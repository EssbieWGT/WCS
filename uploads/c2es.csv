North Dakota Monitor reporter Michael Achterling contributed to this story.","Federal policies on health care and trade are likely to continue to color North Dakota’s biggest government stories in 2026. Congress and the Trump administration are spending money in an attempt to help the rural health care system and farm economy to offset cuts to Medicaid and declining ag commodity prices.

It’s also an election year, featuring ballot measures and a U.S. House race in North Dakota. And the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library plans its grand opening in conjunction with the nation’s milestone 250th anniversary.

Special session

Gov. Kelly Armstrong has set Jan. 21 as the date for a special legislative session to allocate federal rural health funding that was part of what Republicans called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in 2025.

North Dakota was awarded $199 million after applying for its share of the federal funding. One North Dakota policy change prompted by the competition for federal funding was prohibiting the use of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy candy and junk food. The new restrictions are expected to be implemented by September 2026.

North Dakota receives $199 million in federal grant for rural health care

North Dakota’s application for funds from the Rural Health Transformation Program focused on four areas: workforce; preventive care and healthy eating; bringing high-quality health care closer to home; and improving health care technology.

Once lawmakers gather at the Capitol, they could propose bills addressing other issues. But legislative leaders have said they plan to limit the scope of the session, and rules require that a two-thirds majority in each chamber must agree that the topic should be considered.

Election

North Dakota’s only U.S. House seat and a potential statewide vote on making school meals free for students are likely to be the top races in 2026, but there are many more. More than half of the Legislature’s seats are up for election, and there are local races for seats on school boards, judgeships and other positions.

U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, a Republican in her first term, plans to run for reelection and has already received President Donald Trump’s endorsement. Republican Alex Balazs, who came in fourth out of five candidates in the 2024 primary but received the state party endorsement, has announced plans to challenge Fedorchak.

Other statewide offices — all held by Republicans — on the 2026 ballot are secretary of state, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, tax commissioner and two seats on the Public Service Commission.

The statewide nonpartisan offices up for election are the Superintendent of Public Instruction and two seats on the state Supreme Court.

In the Legislature, odd-numbered districts are on the ballot and two even-numbered districts, 26 and 42, have elections for House seats. The primary is June 9.

North Dakotans may be voting on state funding for school breakfasts and lunches, something the 2025 Legislature voted down. Organizers still need to turn in signatures to get the issue on the general election ballot.

Voters will consider during the primary election a ballot measure to require all proposed amendments to the state constitution to comprise a single subject.

The Legislature also approved putting two measures on the 2026 general election ballot. Measure 1 proposes to make changes to term limits voters approved in 2022. The measure would allow lawmakers to serve up to 16 years in one chamber and clarifies that a partial term does not count toward the limit. Measure 2 would require that 60% of voters approve a measure instead of a simple majority.

Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library

The grand opening of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library is set for July 4 in Medora, coinciding with the 250th birthday of the United States.

All living presidents are invited to the grand opening, said Matt Briney, spokesperson for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation. However, they may not attend on the opening weekend and instead arrange a time to see the library before the year ends.

President Trump has not confirmed whether he will attend the library opening, Briney said. July 1 is highlighted on a national calendar of 250th events to celebrate the library’s grand opening.

Members of Theodore Roosevelt’s family are planning to camp in the area during the opening weekend, and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who is also a library foundation board member, plans on attending the library opening, according to Briney. Among public officials expected to attend is Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who championed the library project as North Dakota governor.

The state has high hopes for attracting more tourists to the town of fewer than 200 people with the museum dedicated to Roosevelt, who ranched in the Badlands before becoming revered as one of America’s greatest presidents.

Energy

As the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, North Dakota relies on oil and gas taxes for more than half of its revenue. Production has held relatively steady, though the price of oil is struggling to stay above the level forecast by the state.

North Dakota oil production resilient even as prices have declined

Industry observers will be watching to see if a couple of carbon dioxide gas sequestration projects — Minnkota Power’s Project Tundra and the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline — will move forward.

Sequestration is permanent underground storage of the greenhouse gas. Minnkota would sequester CO2 from a coal-fired power plant while Summit would gather CO2 from ethanol plants in five states, including one in North Dakota. While in the works for years, construction has not started on either project. Summit, which has faced regulatory challenges, has indicated the possibility of changing the pipeline route, but also has said a North Dakota storage area “remains an important long-term asset for the project.”

Meanwhile, hearings on a controversial high-voltage transmission line are coming up in January. There is high interest in a pipeline to bring natural gas from western North Dakota to the east, though construction won’t start until 2028. There could also be headwinds for wind and solar energy as the Trump administration cuts incentives for green energy projects.

Potential efforts to extract critical minerals from coal, lawmakers’ study of nuclear energy’s feasibility in the state and the ongoing discussion surrounding data centers are also likely to be major energy topics in 2026.

Agriculture

The farm economy took a beating in 2025, and 2026 isn’t looking so good, either. A major factor will be export markets. China has been a key importer of North Dakota soybeans in years past but did little buying in 2025.

Depressed prices for soybeans and other crops coaxed the Trump administration into aid payments for farmers, which should arrive in February. Former North Dakota Farmers Union leader Mark Watne questioned whether those payments would be enough to keep farmers afloat.

Construction will continue in 2026 on two giant milking operations for Minnesota-based Riverview in the Red River Valley. There is a lawsuit pending against the state for its permitting of the Herberg Dairy near Hillsboro and other legal challenges to the Abercrombie Dairy north of Wahpeton.

Beef production was the bright spot for North Dakota agriculture in 2025, and despite some ups and downs, could be again in 2026 as consumer demand remains strong despite higher prices.

Climate scientist Tim Lenton explains how positive tipping points are accelerating the transition to a greener future

Imagine sitting on an ordinary chair. Now, lean back gently. Depending on where exactly you are balanced, you could tilt forward to safety, or go crashing backwards. A fraction of a degree is enough to determine your fate. It’s an analogy used by Prof Tim Lenton in his new book Positive Tipping Points: when a threshold is crossed and unstoppable change begins to unfold, a tipping point occurs.

The University of Exeter scientist, who has spent his career researching climate tipping points, offers lots of examples.

The marooning of the Ever Given, the cargo ship that became wedged across the Suez Canal in March 2021, for instance, highlights what Lenton calls “non-linear change”. The actions of the crew, plus other logistical challenges and weather conditions, led to the ship eventually blocking around 30% of the world’s container traffc. “What starts out small – the decision of a ship’s captain or the mutation of a virus – can sometimes cascade into global consequences,” he says.

But what if it were possible to harness the power of positive tipping points?

“Instead of turning away from the complexity and enormity of the climate crisis,” he says, “we need to understand how tipping points can self-propel change. That way we can truly appreciate the risks we are facing and find the agency to accelerate the changes that can get us out of trouble.”

History is full of examples. The suffragettes, for instance who, through protests and acts of civil disobedience, eventually tipped mass public opinion in favour of their cause.

More recently, Greta Thunberg’s School Strike for Climate demonstrates how the acts of a solo schoolgirl sitting outside the Swedish parliament ballooned into a global campaign.

Here are four more positive tipping points that have already reached mass adoption, or have the potential to in time.

1. Norway: streets ahead with EV adoption

Norway is about nine years ahead of the global car market in its tipping to EVs, says Lenton. Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, market share is 90% in the Scandinavian country. This is thanks to policy and financial incentives that were in part triggered by a group of activists – the frontman of pop band A-ha, Morten Harket, among them – who campaigned in the 80s and 90s to get the government to remove barriers to EV adoption.

“Norway’s leadership in being the first country to reach an EV tipping point is important for all of us, because driving cars is currently responsible for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions,” says Lenton.

Norway was the first country to reach an EV tipping point

2. The UK and Denmark have tipped away from coal power

In September 2024, the last coal-burning power station in the UK closed, signalling the final nail in the coffin for dirty energy in the country. Several policy changes contributed to making the tipping point to green power irreversible, including a 2013 carbon tax on emissions generated in the power sector. At the same time renewable energy capacity in the grid was growing exponentially. “Profitable coal plants became loss-making overnight,” explains Lenton.

Today, over half of the UK’s power comes from renewables. It’s a similar story in Denmark, which produces 60% of the country’s power from wind. Meanwhile, solar PV has reached a positive tipping point globally, with panels falling in cost by more than 90% in the last decade.

“As solar and wind power continue to get cheaper, the economics are swinging inexorably in their favour,” says Lenton.

The UK and Denmark are leading the way in tipping away from coal

3. Green hydrogen: the fuel with positive potential

Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis, a process where renewables-powered electricity is used to split water molecules. This fuel, and its derivative green ammonia, can be used in a multitude of industrial sectors, from shipping and steel production to aviation and agriculture.

Although we are a few decades off from reaching a positive tipping point for a green hydrogen economy, “exponential growth is already under way,” says Lenton.

China leads, with about half of the global installed production capacity. Europe, meanwhile, has set a target for green hydrogen to meet at least 42% of existing hydrogen demand by 2030. And in the US, the inflation reduction act offers a substantial tax credit to green hydrogen producers.

While it will require a “heroic effort” to scale up green hydrogen production, the positive tipping point to renewable energy is continually making the fuel more affordable.

4. Plant-based diets hold the key to nature regeneration

There is no ‘one size fits all’ positive tipping point for nature and farming, explains Lenton. What is universal, however, is the key underlying cause of the destruction of nature: diets.

Alt-proteins are at an earlier stage of adoption than other positive tipping points, but peak meat consumption has been reached in some countries

High meat consumption is still the status quo in most countries, but there are encouraging signs of change. “Peak meat consumption has been reached in some rich countries, including New Zealand, Canada and Switzerland,” he says, and investment in alternative proteins has “grown exponentially”. Alt-proteins such as plant-based substitutes and foods made from precision fermentation are still at an earlier stage of mass adoption than green hydrogen. “To displace conventional animal products, alternative proteins need to become more attractive, affordable and accessible to us consumers.”

Positive Tipping Points, by Tim Lenton, is out now, and is published by Oxford University Press.

The Story

Over the last few weeks, silver prices have returned to the spotlight. There’s news about a supply crunch as industrial demand is climbing upward for the metal that usually lives in the shadow of gold.

At first glance, that seems odd. Silver isn’t oil. It isn’t coal. It isn’t even copper. But its resurgence says something important about how the world is trying to fix its energy problem.

Because every major energy transition in history has followed the same pattern. It solves the problem we are worried about at the moment, but creates a new set of problems that only become visible later.

Coal replaced wood and saved forests, but filled cities with smoke. Oil replaced coal and made transport affordable, but it made the world more dependent on fossil fuels. Natural gas cleaned up the air around cities, but didn’t really solve the climate problem. Each transition felt like progress, and each came with trade-offs that only became obvious at scale.

Solar energy sits in the same lineage, promising cleaner air, lower emissions, and energy independence. And in many ways, it delivers. But like every transition before it, there is a hidden downside that only becomes apparent at scale.

For years, solar energy has been sold as the cleanest solution to our climate problem. No smoke, no fuel, no moving parts. Just sunlight turning into electricity.

And to be fair, that story isn’t wrong. Once installed, a solar panel generates power with almost zero emissions. Costs have fallen sharply over the past decade, and installations are scaling rapidly. Governments, too, around the world are embracing solar because it seems to hit two birds with one stone. It helps meet climate targets and reduces dependence on imported fuels.

This is why solar is often framed as a silver bullet. The underlying narrative is simple and comforting. Replace coal plants with solar panels, add some batteries, and the energy problem largely takes care of itself.

These systems, though, don’t operate on narratives, but on physics, materials, and reliability. And that’s where the solar story starts to become more complicated.

Solar energy’s biggest limitation is also its most obvious one. The sun doesn’t follow demand.

Solar power generation peaks around midday, when the sun is at its brightest. But electricity demand usually peaks after sunset, when people return home, switch on lights, cook dinner, and run appliances. That mismatch creates a fundamental problem for power grids. The electricity is generated when it’s least needed and disappears when demand is at its highest.

To deal with this, grids need either extensive transmission infrastructure to move power from solar-surplus regions to solar-deficient ones or they need storage and backup generation. Either of these is expensive, stores power only for short durations, and degrades over time.

As a result, even countries with heavy solar adoption continue to rely on fossil fuels, hydroelectric power, or nuclear energy to maintain stability once the sun goes down or when weather conditions turn unfavourable.

So if we truly need a renewable energy source, it is something that must be predictable, scalable, and have low carbon emissions. Nuclear is arguably the only thing that ticks all three. But that’s a topic for another day.

Then, there’s another issue with solar that receives far less attention and yet looms just as large. And that is manufacturing the panels itself.

Solar power does not burn fuel, but it consumes an enormous amount of physical resources. Silicon is needed for the cells.

Aluminium for frames and mounting structures. Copper for wiring and inverters. Silver for electrical contacts. Glass made from high-purity sand to protect the cells. When you add all this up, solar ends up being far more material-intensive per unit of electricity capacity than coal or natural gas. Here’s an infographic to help you understand:

And mining those materials is neither clean nor low-carbon. From extraction to processing, the entire supply chain is highly energy-intensive. On top of that, components are transported across continents before a panel ever reaches a rooftop or a solar farm. Most of this activity still runs on fossil fuels. As a result, a significant portion of a solar panel’s lifetime emissions are front-loaded during mining and manufacturing. That said, we do agree that panels repay this carbon debt over time, but that repayment is gradual rather than instant.

Apart from this, as solar installations scale globally, demand for both silver and copper is increasing. Photovoltaic cells (the individual solar cell in a solar panel) manufacturing alone accounted for about 14% of global silver consumption in 2023, driven by its use in photovoltaic cells.

Copper demand is even more widespread, as we need it not just for solar panels but also for inverters, transmission lines, electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and the necessary grid upgrades to support a renewable-heavy system.

Naturally, when demand grows faster than supply, prices increase. So part of the recent strength in silver and copper prices isn’t just driven by speculation or short-term cycles; it could also be because of this increased demand.

There is also a geographic imbalance embedded in this transition. The environmental damage caused by mining is local and immediate. Communities near mines deal with land degradation, water pollution, and waste. Meanwhile, the benefits of clean electricity are enjoyed far away, often in cities and industries thousands of kilometres from the point of extraction.

Once you add this to the cost of upgrading grids, recycling challenges for aging panels, and policy uncertainty into the equation, solar starts to look less black-and-white and more complex.

However, none of this makes solar a bad idea. Countries aren’t wrong to invest heavily in it. Solar is cheap, scalable, and far cleaner than the fossil fuels it replaces. It will almost certainly remain one of the pillars of the energy transition.

But it is clean only at the point of generation, not at the point of extraction. It reduces emissions gradually over time. And while it lowers fossil fuel consumption, it does not replace reliable, always-on power capacity one-for-one at an industrial level. Instead, it sits atop grids that still need storage, backup, and careful balancing to function smoothly.

The real risk isn’t overinvestment in solar. It’s underestimating everything else the transition demands. It’s that they might convince themselves that solar alone can do the heavy lifting, without fully grappling with the trade-offs, such as a poor electricity grid and subpar storage capacity, that come with it.

That said, apart from just investing in solar farms, countries should also allocate a portion of their budgets to these additional, but necessary, upgrades. Unless that gap is acknowledged, solar will remain both a solution and a source of new constraints.

But we can let you in on the big storylines our reporters and editors are keeping a close eye on as we head into 2026. Here’s the list, covering everything from companies on the cusp of tech breakthroughs to policy debates that are hitting a boiling point.

The decoupling of vibes from progress

Things are getting messy. President Donald Trump has gutted the only significant decarbonization law the U.S. ever managed to pass. Blue-state governors are backsliding on clean energy goals and easing up on fossil fuels under the cover of affordability. Oil and gas companies have dropped the pretense of caring about climate. ESG is dead. The ​“climate hawk” is dead. The words ​“pragmatism” and ​“realism” have become as inescapable in climate policy discourse as reminders of planetary warming are in the weather reports.

Yes, the climate conversation has changed dramatically over the last year, at least in the Western world. But the techno-economic trends that are driving decarbonization forward have not. Clean energy — mostly solar — is still being built at a blistering pace. EVs are beginning to run gas cars off the road. China’s emissions could be starting to decline. The world is on track for far less warming than it was when the Paris Agreement was signed a decade ago, and we’re still in the early innings of clean energy deployment.

In 2026, I’ll be watching this dissonance between decarbonization vibes and reality. Will politicians, companies, and others grow increasingly quiet on climate, all while the clean energy revolution speaks louder and louder? — Dan McCarthy, senior editor

The rise of virtual power plants

What do you do when you can’t build actual power plants fast enough to keep the lights on and the air conditioners humming? You turn to virtual power plants.

Utilities and regulators have in recent years begun to embrace these networks of rooftop solar panels, backup batteries, plugged-in electric vehicles, smart thermostats, remote-controllable water heaters, and other ​“distributed energy resources” in homes and businesses. By controlling this equipment to lower electricity demand and provide energy to the grid, utilities can replicate much of the value of a traditional, centralized power plant.

Now, the AI boom is forcing decision-makers to take VPPs even more seriously. Gigawatts of planned data centers are pushing up already high and rising utility bills. Equipment shortages are making it nearly impossible to quickly build gas plants, while interconnection bottlenecks are preventing lots of utility-scale renewables from coming online. And the risks of overbuilding to serve what could end up being an AI bubble are rising.

VPPs could help solve all those problems by enlisting energy tech that people are already buying. What I’m eyeing in 2026 is whether utilities, grid operators, and the state and federal regulators overseeing them put their weight behind the VPP build-out. — Jeff St. John, chief reporter and policy specialist

The make-or-break moment for the American nuclear renaissance

2026 is a threshold year for the American nuclear industry as it strives to lay the foundation for an unprecedented scale-up of atomic energy in the U.S. — quadrupling nuclear generating capacity by 2050, as per President Trump’s executive order.

The operators of the Palisades and Three Mile Island plants are pledging 2026 and 2027 restart dates for those mothballed reactors. Additional Trump executive orders are aiming for three advanced nuclear startups to achieve criticality in 2026. (One reactor has already staked that claim.)

Over the coming months, I’ll be tracking whether the industry keeps its bold promise of power-plant restarts and advanced reactor development. We’ll be reporting on the crop of nuclear startups and whether they can deliver on their audacious claims. And we’ll be watching whether the U.S. can start building nuclear reactors at scale.

If those plans are backed by sufficient capital and follow-through, they could restore some of the country’s lost atomic luster. If not, the U.S will have ceded its global nuclear leadership to China and Russia. — Eric Wesoff, executive director

The wind-energy win brewing in New England’s far north

Northernmost Maine has strong winds and lots of open space. But renewable energy developers have not yet managed to capitalize on these conditions to build substantial onshore wind farms, even though the idea has been floating around the state since at least 2008. Last year, Maine energy officials and regional grid operator ISO New England kick-started yet another effort to get turbines spinning up north with requests for proposals for both generation and transmission lines to carry the power south to the rest of the region.

I’ll be watching closely for a few reasons: First, the New England grid needs more power supply as the climate-conscious states it serves make moves to electrify buildings and transportation, and 1,200 megawatts of onshore wind would certainly help. Also, if the plan succeeds, it could offer valuable lessons about the economics of developing renewable energy in the face of federal hostility, which, I think we can all agree, is unlikely to abate anytime soon. — Sarah Shemkus, Northeast reporter

The financial case for electric buildings

As voters worry about the cost-of-living crisis, all-electric new buildings could help keep mortgage payments and energy bills down.

Though exact savings depend on local energy costs, a growing number of analyses have found that all-electric new construction makes financial sense. Building a home with only an electric system is often a simpler feat than building it with both electricity and gas. In some cases, all-electric homes can save people thousands of dollars over the lifetime of super-efficient electric appliances, such as heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters. Even retrofitting an existing structure with these technologies can pay off in the long term, especially in areas with favorable electricity rates.

Yet policymakers who once pushed ambitious electrification standards have been pulling back. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) waived her city’s requirement that new buildings be all-electric after last year’s catastrophic wildfires, then repealed it completely. In June, air-quality regulators in Southern California punted a plan that would have incentivized a gradual phasedown of gas furnaces and water heaters sold in the region. And New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) delayed her state’s first-in-the-nation all-electric building code, which would have taken effect on Dec. 31, 2025.

In 2026, I want to see if politicians and regulators will recognize that electrification can in fact boost affordability, especially in newly built homes. — Alison F. Takemura, staff writer

The geothermal breakthrough on the horizon

Geothermal energy startups have raised huge sums of money in recent months and years to develop next-generation technologies for harnessing Earth’s heat. But so far, the companies have delivered relatively little carbon-free electricity to the grid.

That will change this year, when Fervo Energy flips the switch on its Cape Station facility in Utah. The startup is building an ​“enhanced geothermal system” that uses fracking techniques to create geothermal reservoirs in hard, impermeable rocks. The first 100 megawatts (of an eventual 500 MW) are slated to go online in October, which would make Cape Station the biggest project of its kind to connect to the grid worldwide.

The development will send ​“a powerful signal that next-generation geothermal is moving from promise to commercial reality,” said Jeremy O’Brien of geoscience software company Seequent. ​“We expect this milestone to accelerate both investor interest and government support globally.”

Fervo isn’t alone in its ambitions. The company Eavor will start working this spring to expand its first-of-a-kind geothermal project in Germany, and firms like Sage Geosystems, Quaise, XGS, and Zanskar are accelerating efforts to satisfy demand for clean, around-the-clock power. I’ll be watching closely to see whether 2026 proves to be the pivotal year the industry is hoping for. — Maria Gallucci, senior reporter

The tug-of-war over clean energy in Ohio

Ohio, where I report from, has for years been a hotbed for dark money and a testing ground for national efforts to hinder action on climate change. State lawmakers and regulators continue to throw up obstacles to renewable energy development, while giving preference to new fossil-fueled power plants. One pending bill, for example, calls for energy permitting decisions to make sure facilities ​“employ affordable, reliable, and clean energy sources,” with ​“reliable” meaning energy that’s available at all times and ​“clean” defined to include natural gas. I’ll keep investigating those efforts in 2026 to hold the people in power accountable as the public struggles with rising energy costs and worsening climate change impacts.

But it’s not all bad news in the Buckeye State, as some communities rally in support of clean energy. One story I’m particularly excited to cover is a May referendum that will give voters the chance to overturn a local solar and wind ban covering most of their county — an approach that could take off elsewhere in Ohio and in other states that allow local restrictions on renewable power. — Kathiann M. Kowalski, contributing reporter based in Ohio

The AI boom’s battery awakening

2026 will be the year we start seeing batteries bridge the gap between data centers’ sky-high power demand and what the U.S. grid can actually deliver.

A well-placed battery system can secure electricity for AI computing hubs in the relatively few hours each year when the grid can’t supply them. That can allow data centers to get built far sooner than if they waited for pricey and time-consuming power network upgrades.

Storage developers are reporting a frenzy of interest in such projects, but these typically are shrouded in secrecy. I recently reported on the first publicly confirmed project of this kind, which entered construction in Oregon for Aligned Data Centers and should start operating in 2026. Utility Portland General Electric will own that one and use it to guarantee power a few years earlier than it could have with conventional grid upgrades.

What I found most intriguing is that the data center developer is paying for this smart grid upgrade. This arrangement lays out a rare positive vision for the nation’s energy future: The companies that stand to make boatloads of money on data centers could fund grid upgrades that benefit everyone, as opposed to the general public subsidizing those upgrades to pad the profits of AI ventures. In the year ahead, I’ll be tracking the proliferation of batteries for data centers, and what they mean for consumers’ energy bills. — Julian Spector, senior reporter

The fate of coal in the Midwest

Over the past decade, scores of Midwestern coal plants have closed, as environmental regulations kicked in and coal-fired generation became more expensive than natural gas or renewables.

Utilities are pushing back retirement dates for coal plants as electricity-demand forecasts increase exponentially due to proposed data centers — many of which may never get built. The Trump administration is ordering plants on the brink of closure to stay open and easing up on rules around pollution from coal power. Indiana’s Republican Gov. Mike Braun issued an executive order last spring calling for coal plant ​“life extensions,” and Illinois experts are researching controversial ​“clean coal technologies,” including at a demonstration carbon-capture plant that went online in 2024.

Coal is embedded in the culture in these states, and it’s highly political, as I’ve heard many times from elected officials, grassroots activists, and coal miners. In 2026, I’ll be closely tracking how this campaign to revive coal progresses and what it means on the ground in Midwest communities where it is burned and mined. After all, coal isn’t just an increasingly expensive way to generate electricity; it’s also incredibly polluting. — Kari Lydersen, contributing reporter based in Illinois

Thanks to President Trump’s ire, it’s likely that no new offshore wind farms will be completed in the U.S. until 2035, save for the five projects already being built, BloombergNEF predicted in early December. Even those projects aren’t guaranteed, a fact underscored by the 90-day pause on wind farm construction issued Dec. 22 by the Interior Department.

But Northeast U.S. states aren’t giving up on the renewable energy source. Massachusetts is exploring sourcing offshore wind power from Canada, with Democratic Gov. Maura Healey meeting with Nova Scotia’s premier last month to discuss partnering on energy needs. Maine also seems interested.

In 2026, I’ll be keeping a close eye on whether these deals materialize — and what they mean for North America’s offshore wind workforce and supply chain, which grew under the Biden administration and could otherwise wither away under Trump 2.0. — Clare Fieseler, reporter",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2219197895.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=afe3e6d3747ad8fc1f050000c8b29a2e,N,,2026-01-05 04:12:30.748043

OG&E believes the law requires the use of CWIP, while consumer advocates disagree, calling the law unconstitutional.","Consumer advocacy groups are lining up against an OG&E rate increase request, marking what could become a major test of a new law that changes the way utilities can pay for new construction.

In a fiery statement released in December, the Oklahoma Industrial Energy Consumers (OIEC) and AARP Oklahoma called for Oklahoma Corporation Commissioners to reject a rate hike request for two new power plants planned for completion east of Oklahoma City in 2029.

“If there is a Scrooge this holiday season it is OG&E,” said AARP Oklahoma State Director Sean Voskuhl.

“On the heels of OG&E’s $500 million pre-approval case, where the Oklahoma Corporation Commission rejected OG&E’s attempt to recover an additional $100 million in financing costs, they turned right around and are asking for it again,” Voskuhl said. “OG&E simply cannot take ‘No’ for an answer, but they should.”

The opposing sides are arguing over new regulatory parameters created by Oklahoma Senate Bill 998, which passed during the last legislative session. The law allows utilities to ask for rate increases to help pay for Construction Work In Progress, otherwise known as CWIP.

OG&E believes the law requires the use of CWIP, while consumer advocates disagree, calling the law unconstitutional.

Under CWIP, commissioners can approve rate increases to pay for projects as they are being built. Prior to the law, utilities were required to wait until facilities were completed and operational before they could ask to raise rates.

OG&E says a rate increase through the new law would allow it to raise construction funding while the project is underway, which would help reduce the amount of interest accrued on $506 million in construction loan debt. The company estimates it could save as much as $173 million in interest costs, which is an expense that would be passed on to ratepayers.

The new law provides an avenue for saving ratepayers money, said Christi Woodworth, OG&E vice president of marketing and communications.

“Historically, we’d go borrow the money to build facilities. Then, when they’re operational and turned on, we’d start putting it into rates,” she said. “Meanwhile, we’re making interest payments all along the way, but customers aren’t helping provide the dollars for that until the project is fully operational, which means all of that interest accumulates.”

Adam Singer, attorney for AARP Oklahoma said that’s not the case. “Basically, they’re asking some, or many of their customers to pay for facilities that they may never see the benefit of.”

“You may have people that move away, start paying today and move away after two years, so now they’ve paid for a facility they don’t get the benefit of. Or, you have an elderly person who passes away, and even though they’re near the end of their life, their rates have gone up.

“There’s a reason in my eyes that the company is pushing so hard for these changes, and I think it’s just dollars,” Singer said. “I think Senate Bill 998 is unconstitutional.”

OIEC Executive Director Thomas Schroedter says the new law and OG&E’s rate request will end up costing ratepayers more than the traditional way of financing construction, and he believes the legislature made a mistake in passing the measure.

“It’s not in the best interest of ratepayers if you take the time value of money into account,” said Schroedter, whose organization represents about 30 member companies that consume large amounts of electricity. “The law interferes with the Corporation Commission’s authority to ensure just and reasonable rates for utility customers.”

Every one of OG&E’s stakeholders and PSO stakeholders oppose the law, Shroedter said, “and so in this upcoming session, the legislature needs to repeal this ill-conceived law.”

The law will subsidize a budding data center industry, which is rapidly expanding with new development across the state, he said.

“What’s happening here is OG&E customers are being forced to finance these power plants for these new large-load customers, and it’s not right,” Schroedter said. “If it’s upheld, the new law will require customers to finance capital investments needed to serve large-load artificial intelligence customers that will be coming on to OG&E’s system in the future.

“The data centers won’t be built for eight years from now and they won’t be paying any of the financing costs of these plants, so current ratepayers will be subsidizing these plants,” he said. “That’s unfair.”

The new rate case will mark the second time OG&E has asked for advanced funding for its planned plants at Horseshoe Lake. The Corporation Commission turned the utility’s request down in early December.

Schroedter says commissioners denied the company’s request once and OG&E shouldn’t be allowed to have another bite at the apple.

But the power company contends that its first request was turned down for legal reasons. Its initial request was submitted to the commission in May, which was three months before the new law went into effect.

Now that the law is in effect, OG&E says the Oklahoma Legislature now requires the use of CWIP because it significantly reduces overall interest costs incurred during construction.",https://journalrecord.com/files/2026/01/Utility-rates-web-image.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 05:13:28.400365

Commercial and Industrial Carbon Challenge Awards

The Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Carbon Challenge is a competitive program that provides funding to large energy users such as manufacturers, colleges, universities, health care facilities, and office building owners in New York State to implement clean energy projects that reduce carbon emissions. Projects may utilize a combination of energy or manufacturing process efficiency strategies, carbon capture technology, low-carbon fuel utilization, renewable generation, or energy storage.

NYSERDA awarded over $5 million for two projects located in the Finger Lakes and Capital Region:

Finger Lakes Health will implement seven greenhouse gas emissions reduction projects over the next three years at Geneva General Hospital in Geneva and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hospital in Penn Yan, replacing aging systems, improving HVAC system resilience, and reducing energy use.

The Saratoga County Sewer District will modify existing processes at the County's existing wastewater treatment plant to provide a long-term, cost-saving solution for biosolids management that produces renewable fuels and reduces the environmental impact of operations.

Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, ""Under Governor Hochul's leadership, New York's regional approach to economic development continues to create jobs and leverage private investments. With more than hundreds of projects supported across the state through multiple programs and state agencies, we are promoting opportunities that will generate sustainable economic growth.""

New York Secretary of State Walter T. Mosley said, ""Sustainable building practices are key elements in the state's economic, energy and environmental future. Our partnership with NYSERDA on our Downtown Revitalization Initiative and the State Energy Plan is creating green buildings and projects throughout the State, and our mutual commitment to communities identified as disadvantaged further ensures that our transition to a green economy is both just and equitable. We look forward to expanding that partnership into the future as we implement the Governor's visionary and practical energy goals.""

Today's announcement builds on the success of these two programs. Through the Building Cleaner Communities Competition, 70 projects have leveraged nearly $1.3 billion in public and private investment since 2018 to implement carbon neutral or net zero energy performance solutions. Through the C&I Carbon Challenge since 2018, NYSERDA has made awards that will cumulatively reduce 7.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of removing more than 1 million cars from the road annually.

Funding for this program was included in the 2025 Regional Economic Development Council Initiative. The REDC process continues to support and empower regional stakeholders in developing strategic plans and funding priorities that meet local economic needs. Regional Councils reviewed projects from this program and provided scores that reflect how well a project aligns with a region's goals and strategies.

Blue states gouge residents and businesses with exorbitant rates. But even worse are the bald-faced lies blue-state politicians tell you to defend the gouging.

Instead of admitting that expensive electricity is a choice they’re deliberately making — your budget be damned — they lie, claiming wind and solar power are “affordable” and “reliable.”

The shameless gaslighting was on full display last month, in response to a Trump administration edict pausing offshore wind farm construction along the East Coast near Virginia, New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island.

The administration claims that the huge installations obscure the detection of potential foreign adversaries that could threaten “east coast population centers.” President Donald Trump paused construction until a solution, if any, could be devised.

The minute the administration issued the pause, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont accused the Trump administration of “making things up.” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called it “B.S. ”

Maybe. Admittedly, the Trump announcement was short on facts to back up its security pretext. But the possible deception on Trump’s side is mild compared with the lies spewed by Democrats in response. Hochul claimed wind power will “keep energy costs down” and “strengthen reliability.” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong’s office spuriously insisted wind power will save ratepayers “hundreds of millions of dollars.”

Lamont claimed a “diverse energy supply” that includes wind will “lower utility costs for families.”

Nonsense. In fact, worse than nonsense. Deliberate lying. Each state has the authority to decide the mix of energy sources that go into its electric grid. Blue states have mandated ever-increasing reliance on wind, as well as solar, instead of fossil fuels, explains the Institute for Energy Research.

New Yorkers pay, on average, 58% more for their electricity than the national average because of the green mandates state politicians have imposed and the power sources they exclude, such as natural gas fracking.

Connecticut ratepayers are fleeced even more, paying nearly double the national average rate for electricity.

Climate-driven pols, almost all of them Democrats, should at least admit they’re making decisions based on ideology and, in many cases, pressure from the renewable energy lobby. Instead, they parrot falsehoods about “affordability” and “reliability.”

Offshore wind power is at least twice as expensive per kilowatt as natural gas-generated electricity or almost any other source.

Citing 70 countries around the world, Bjorn Lomborg concludes that “global evidence is clear: Adding more solar and wind to the energy supply pushes up the price of electricity.”

How about “reliability,” the other word blue-state pols repeat ad nauseam to defend renewable energy sources?

Germany learned how unreliable renewables are. Germany installed massive solar and wind equipment to meet 70% of its grid’s needs. But on cloudy or nearly windless days, these renewables deliver a mere 4% — hardly “reliable.” Germany has had to maintain two generating systems at a massive cost. Germans pay 43 cents per kilowatt hour, more than twice what Canadians with similar climate conditions but a reliance on fossil fuels pay.

UK liberal politicians went all out for green energy, but many are now backtracking. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak paused the UK’s transition to net-zero carbon use. Scotland’s government abandoned its goal of a 75% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030.

New England (and the rest of the U.S.) could learn something from old England. Renewables are budget-busters, burdening consumers and slowing economic growth. California’s increasing reliance on renewables — now up to 39% of the grid’s mix — explains why their residents and businesses pay the second-highest rates in the nation, behind Hawaii. That high cost is hobbling growth and causing “energy poverty” among low-income residents who can’t pay their electric bills.

Electric bills were a hot-button issue in the recent New Jersey gubernatorial election. Bills had increased by double digits in the year leading up to the election, partly because outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy retired fossil fuel sources just when power demand was soaring.

Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill promised that investing in offshore wind would “lower energy costs for families,” a blatantly false statement. Republican Jack Ciattarelli pledged to ban offshore wind farms and pursue a more diverse, affordable energy mix. Sherrill’s fib won out.

In blue states everywhere, Americans struggling to pay for electricity need to elect political leaders who will make affordability a priority. But to do that, voters need to hear the truth. So far, they’re getting a pack of lies about wind from windbag politicians like Sherrill, Hochul and Lamont.

And no one is discussing the visual blight — seeing magnificent ocean-scapes destroyed by towering hardware across the horizon. If the Right were demanding lines of towering oil rigs across Long Island Sound or Nantucket Sound, the Left would be screaming bloody murder.

Let’s hope Trump’s pause on offshore wind turbine construction occasions an honest discussion of wind power. On the facts, instead of the lies, wind power is a loser.

At the heart of this transition is the power inverter—a critical component that converts the direct current (DC) generated by solar panels into the alternating current (AC) required for household appliances and the electrical grid. Establishing itself as a China Leading Power Inverter Exporter, MOES has recently garnered significant international attention following its high-profile participation at Intersolar Europe. By bridging the gap between raw solar harvesting and intelligent energy management, the company is redefining how residential and commercial users interact with sustainable power.

The Global Shift Toward Decarbonization and the Role of Inverter Technology

The international energy landscape is currently undergoing a structural shift. With the European Union’s commitment to the European Green Deal and similar initiatives across North America and Asia, the focus has shifted from mere energy generation to “intelligent energy autonomy.” In this context, the power inverter is no longer just a hardware bridge; it has become the “brain” of the modern energy system. Industry trends indicate a move toward hybrid systems that combine photovoltaic (PV) generation with battery storage and smart grid interaction.

Technical reliability in power inverters is the primary barrier to widespread solar adoption. Efficiency ratings, thermal management, and long-term durability are the metrics by which global exporters are judged. High-performance inverters must now manage fluctuating input voltages while maintaining a pure sine wave output to protect sensitive electronic equipment. As decentralized energy systems become more prevalent, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities into these power units is becoming a market standard. Companies that can successfully marry high-load power electronics with cloud-based monitoring are the ones currently leading the export market, providing the stability required for a carbon-neutral future.

Innovation on Display: Intersolar Europe and Market Validation

Intersolar Europe, held annually in Munich, serves as the world’s leading exhibition for the solar industry. For a specialist like MOES, the event provided a strategic platform to demonstrate its latest advancements in power conversion and smart energy ecosystems. The atmosphere at the exhibition reflected a market hungry for “plug-and-play” solutions that do not sacrifice technical depth for user-friendliness.

During the event, the MOES pavilion became a focal point for European distributors and renewable energy engineers. Visitors were particularly drawn to the real-time demonstrations of the hybrid inverter series. One recurring piece of feedback from German engineering consultants centered on the seamless integration between the inverter’s hardware and the mobile management interface. “The ability to monitor conversion efficiency and battery health in real-time through a single app changes the value proposition for the end-user,” noted one attendee. This reception at a premier global forum acts as a powerful endorsement of the company’s technical maturity and its ability to meet the stringent safety and performance standards of the European market.

The presence at Intersolar Europe also facilitated direct dialogues with project developers from the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region and South America. These interactions highlighted a growing preference for Chinese-manufactured inverters that offer high IP (Ingress Protection) ratings, capable of withstanding harsh environmental conditions like high salinity or extreme heat. The success at the fair underscores a broader market trend: global buyers are increasingly looking for exporters who provide comprehensive support and integrated technology rather than just standalone components.

Technical Excellence and Integrated Smart Energy Solutions

Founded in 2008 and headquartered in the industrial hub of Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, MOES has built its reputation on a dual-pillar strategy: high-quality solar products and Tuya-enabled smart home solutions. This unique positioning allows the company to offer a holistic approach to modern living that few traditional inverter manufacturers can match. By leveraging the manufacturing excellence of the Wenzhou region, the company maintains rigorous quality control while remaining agile enough to iterate on new technologies.

The core product lineup is designed to address diverse application scenarios. In residential settings, the power inverters work in tandem with smart energy meters and automated load controllers. For instance, a typical “Smart Green Home” project involves the inverter prioritizing solar consumption for heavy appliances during peak sunlight hours, then automatically switching to battery or grid power as needed—all managed through an intelligent IoT framework. In commercial projects, the focus shifts to scalability and grid stability, where MOES inverters provide robust performance in larger-scale PV arrays.

Key advantages of the MOES ecosystem include:

IoT Integration: Utilizing Tuya technology to provide users with remote control and data analytics for their energy consumption.

Sustainability-Driven Design: Products are engineered for high conversion efficiency, minimizing energy loss during the DC-to-AC process.

Versatile Application: From off-grid cabins requiring reliable stand-alone power to urban smart apartments looking to reduce carbon footprints.

Beyond the hardware, the company’s success as an exporter is rooted in its commitment to environmental responsibility and the “connected lifestyle.” By providing clean energy solutions that are easy to install and manage, the company empowers customers to take an active role in the global energy transition. This mission-driven approach, combined with the technical validation received at international exhibitions, solidifies its status as a reliable partner in the global renewable energy sector.

Summary

As the world moves toward 2030 climate goals, the synergy between green energy and intelligent automation will only become more vital. Companies that continue to innovate at the intersection of power electronics and digital connectivity are set to lead the next generation of global energy infrastructure.

New LNG demand.
Another 10 Bcf/d of new pipelines out of West Texas, plus at least 15 Bcf/d more along the coast.
But the fact is, the past few years in the U.S. natural gas market have really been just a teaser, a preview, an appetizer.
LNG feedgas demand in Louisiana is projected to rise more gradually, from an already hefty 10.6 Bcf/d in 2025 to 11.7 Bcf/d in 2027 and ~16 Bcf/d in 2035.","Sure, natural gas markets have experienced plenty of changes over the past few years. Rising associated gas production in the Permian. New pipeline and storage capacity. New LNG demand. Pricing ups and downs. But we’d argue that all this was merely a prelude. That the main event — a veritable transformation of gas markets, especially along the Gulf Coast — is about to begin. A doubling of LNG demand (to 32 Bcf/d!). Another 10 Bcf/d of new pipelines out of West Texas, plus at least 15 Bcf/d more along the coast. Production revivals in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford. And don’t forget soaring demand for gas-fired power generation. In today’s RBN blog, we discuss the massive, market-transforming changes just ahead — and our upcoming GasCon 2026 conference, which is hyper-focused on this market-shifting inflection point.

With all the announcements in 2022-25 — upstream and midstream consolidation, new pipelines and storage projects, new LNG export terminals, etc. — you’d be tempted to think this has been a period of extraordinary change. And you’d be right. But the fact is, the past few years in the U.S. natural gas market have really been just a teaser, a preview, an appetizer. Now, finally, all the planning and shifting is coalescing. A major, five-year ramp-up in LNG capacity is beginning in earnest. Soaring gas demand along the Gulf Coast will support stronger gas prices and, with that, more drilling and production, not just in the Permian but the Haynesville, the Eagle Ford and, very likely, other basins further afield. And to connect the supply and demand, new multi-Bcf/d pipelines will be coming online and storage projects will be developed.

Let’s begin with the demand angle, because, despite being spurred by natural gas supply pushing out of basins like the Permian, it’s going to be the primary driver behind the upcoming market transformation. RBN’s Arrow Model, which closely monitors the planned addition of new LNG export capacity, projects that feedgas demand from LNG terminals in Texas will soar from “only” 4.5 Bcf/d in 2025 to 8.8 Bcf/d in 2027 and about 16 Bcf/d nine years from now. LNG feedgas demand in Louisiana is projected to rise more gradually, from an already hefty 10.6 Bcf/d in 2025 to 11.7 Bcf/d in 2027 and ~16 Bcf/d in 2035. (Figure 1 below shows the planned additions.) Liquefaction-train commissioning is underway at Plaquemines LNG (already consuming 3.9 Bcf/d on average in December), Golden Pass LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage III, with more to follow at these export terminals and others the next couple of years. Still more are on the way: Over the past 12 months, no fewer than six Gulf Coast LNG projects with a combined capacity of 61 MMtpa (8.1 Bcf/d) reached a final investment decision (FID): trains 4 and 5 at Rio Grande LNG, a two-train expansion at Port Arthur LNG, a small expansion at Corpus Christi Stage III, and two entirely new terminals (Venture Global’s CP2 and Woodside’s Louisiana LNG).",https://rbnenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/single-use/2026-01/Fig1_Gulf%20Coast%20LNG%20export%20capacity.png?itok=hIzsLqOI,N,,2026-01-04 22:12:26.385451

This attracted immigrants — legal and illegal — many of whom came to rural America for economic opportunity.
This was a rare advantage for rural places with low quality of life.
But, despite what many believe, the geography of those cuts is dominated by rural places.
The deepest cuts come to Medicaid and other anti-poverty programs that see their heaviest use in rural places.","Small towns are in for a sobering stretch of economic challenges as elected officials reverse pandemic-era policies that had been reviving them.

COVID-19 was a huge, unexpected opportunity for rural America. The pandemic brought jobs and people to places that had been in decline.

One reason is the pandemic brought a sharp shift in household consumption toward goods and away from services. Rural America, the manufacturing heartland, benefited from job growth in 2022 and 2023. That growth slowed by 2024, but legislation like Sen. Todd Young’s CHIPS Act offered at least a hint that we might be entering a period of more stable factory employment.

Unlike most of the world, the U.S. economy boomed after COVID. The effects were particularly obvious in labor markets, pushing us down to the longest stretch of sub-4% unemployment since the 1960s. This attracted immigrants — legal and illegal — many of whom came to rural America for economic opportunity.

This was a rare advantage for rural places with low quality of life. Economic migrants are driven more by good-paying jobs than luxuries such as walkable neighborhoods or nationally ranked schools. As was the case during the 19th and early-20th centuries, immigrants moved to places native-born Americans were fleeing.

Immigration became a once-in-a-century opportunity for rural places facing the deepest economic decline.

The pandemic also brought opportunities to rural places with high quality of life and small job markets. That’s because COVID accelerated remote work, severing the geographic ties between homes and offices and permitting families to choose rural communities while keeping their jobs.

New businesses also grew during the pandemic, bringing an excess supply of college-educated workers.

Meanwhile, rural America continued to benefit from tax policies, both federal and state. Rural Americans are older, poorer and face higher rates of disability. They pay less taxes and collect more benefits than their urban or suburban counterparts.

Indiana’s poorest rural county receives about $16,000 more per year in per-capita federal transfer payments than it pays. That same county receives $1,500 more per resident in state taxes than it pays.

Along with this, place-based economic policies favored rural counties. For example, child care tax credits, a popular state policy, did more to allow rural families to work than almost any other policy in the past half-century.

Taken together, these policies and economic realities offered rural America a brighter future. Today, everything I’ve just mentioned is at risk, or gone entirely.

The Trump administration has ended remote work for federal workers. Many states, including Indiana, have followed suit for state workers. That directly hurts rural America.

Tariffs and the trade war have reversed manufacturing employment and production. They are also eviscerating agricultural exports. Job growth effectively stopped in April. The deepest job losses are just now settling into rural America, with losses clustered in manufacturing, logistics and agriculture.

Immigration has also stopped, and with it the prospects of population growth for about two-thirds of rural counties. This loss of new families means employers won’t consider these places — they need workers. Schools will shrink, churches will lose congregants and decline will accelerate.

Federal funding will slow under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. That’s unsurprising and inevitable given our large federal debt. But, despite what many believe, the geography of those cuts is dominated by rural places.

The deepest cuts come to Medicaid and other anti-poverty programs that see their heaviest use in rural places. This will lead to the closure of a number of rural hospitals across the country by 2030, as they rely so heavily on this support.

There’s little disagreement on the magnitude of these effects in Washington, D.C., and statehouses across the country. But rural Americans voted so overwhelmingly for the GOP that neither party has much incentive to address these problems.

And so, they will come to pass until the 1 in 5 Americans who live in rural places decide the current policy environment is robbing them of a prosperous future.

Electrek reported that officials powered up Arkansas' first utility-scale wind farm, a 135-megawatt project known as Crossover Wind located in Cross County, which is west of Memphis, Tennessee. Developed by Cordelio Power, the facility is already fully operational.

""We are proud to announce that Crossover Wind is now generating electricity as the first utility-scale wind project in the state of Arkansas,"" said Nick Karambelas, Cordelio Power's chief development officer.

One aspect that has made this clean-energy solution possible is a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, which will receive 100% of the project's power over that time frame. However, the county and its residents are benefiting, too. Cross County will be paid about $950,000 a year, and local landowners participating in the project will receive more than $50 million.

While large-scale clean energy projects such as wind and solar farms can be problematic for landowners, particularly those in the agriculture industry, this project is set up as a win-win for all stakeholders.

Plus, the addition of a major wind power source reduces reliance on polluting energy sources such as coal and gas, lowers electricity costs, and strengthens grid resilience — especially in regions facing growing energy demand from data centers built by companies such as Microsoft and Google. That translates to one more step toward cleaner air for communities and a safer future for all of us.

""Once you've built it, the wind is free. You just get to collect it and make some generation and sell that generation,"" Cordelio Power CEO John Carson told K8 News.

As a Top Rated off Grid Inverter Manufacturer in China, MOES has established itself as a leader in bridging the gap between raw solar generation and usable domestic or commercial power.

Off-grid inverters act as translators between raw energy and modern life. They refine rough, fluctuating direct current into high-quality alternating current that appliances can directly absorb, ensuring that even in remote wilderness areas far from the grid, your expensive appliances can operate as safely and smoothly as in the city center. A critical differentiator in this competitive market is the rigorous adherence to international standards, most notably FCC Compliance. By meeting Federal Communications Commission standards, MOES ensures that its inverters operate without causing electromagnetic interference, a factor that serves as a powerful authoritative endorsement of the brand’s engineering precision and hardware stability. This commitment to regulatory excellence has garnered significant market recognition, particularly in regions where electronic reliability and safety are non-negotiable.

The Shift Toward Energy Sovereignty and Technological Innovation

The global energy sector is currently undergoing a paradigm shift. Driven by the twin goals of carbon neutrality and energy independence, both residential and commercial users are moving away from total reliance on centralized grids. This trend is fueled by the increasing frequency of grid instability and the rising costs of traditional electricity. In this context, the role of high-frequency and low-frequency hybrid inverters has become paramount. These devices allow users to store energy when it is abundant and deploy it when it is needed most, providing a safety net that was previously unavailable to the average consumer.

Technological importance cannot be overstated in this field. An inverter must handle fluctuating inputs from solar arrays while maintaining a steady output for sensitive electronics. MOES addresses this challenge through advanced circuit design and thermal management. By focusing on low-frequency pure sine wave technology, the company provides solutions that are capable of handling high-surge loads—such as air conditioners or heavy machinery—without compromising the lifespan of the equipment. This technical focus is the bedrock of energy security for those living in remote areas or those seeking to optimize their urban energy consumption.

Reliability Through Rigorous Certification and Real-World Application

Reliability in the solar industry is measured by longevity and performance under stress. The FCC certification held by MOES is not merely a label; it represents a comprehensive design philosophy. FCC compliance requires that the inverter’s high-speed switching components do not emit radio frequency noise that could interfere with communication devices or other household electronics. This level of shielding and circuit refinement is a hallmark of premium engineering.

This reliability is consistently demonstrated in diverse project applications. From residential rooftops in North America to remote telecommunications stations that require 24/7 uptime, MOES inverters have been deployed to solve complex energy challenges. These real-world projects highlight the company’s ability to provide high-current charging and stable voltage regulation even in environments with extreme temperature fluctuations. The durability of the hardware, combined with the “set it and forget it” nature of the intelligent control systems, makes these products a preferred choice for long-term investments in renewable energy.

Technical Superiority: Pure Sine Wave and Hybrid Integration

One of the most significant technical hurdles for off-grid systems is the quality of the AC output. Many lower-tier manufacturers produce “modified sine waves,” which can damage sensitive appliances over time. MOES has dedicated its R&D efforts to perfecting the Low-Frequency Pure Sine Wave Hybrid Solar Inverter. This specific technology ensures that the electricity produced is as clean, or cleaner, than the power provided by the public utility grid.

The hybrid nature of these inverters allows for seamless switching between solar power, battery storage, and even backup generators or the utility grid if available. This versatility is essential for commercial applications where downtime translates directly into financial loss. Furthermore, the integration of high-performance chargers within the inverter unit simplifies the overall system architecture, reducing the number of failure points and making the installation process more straightforward for technicians and DIY enthusiasts alike.

Strategic Manufacturing and the Wenzhou Excellence

Founded in 2008 and headquartered in the industrial hub of Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, MOES leverages the region’s long-standing reputation for electrical engineering excellence. Wenzhou is globally recognized for its sophisticated supply chains and manufacturing precision, which allows MOES to maintain rigorous quality control standards that many international competitors struggle to match.

The company’s dual focus—specializing in both solar energy products and smart home solutions—creates a unique synergy. While many manufacturers view the inverter as a standalone component, MOES treats it as part of a broader, connected ecosystem. By integrating Tuya-enabled IoT technology, the company allows users to monitor and manage their energy production and consumption in real-time through intelligent automation. This fusion of green energy and smart technology reflects a deep understanding of the modern “connected lifestyle,” where efficiency is managed through a smartphone screen rather than a manual switchboard.

A Sustainable Vision for a Connected Future

As we look toward the next decade, the integration of clean energy and intelligent automation will define the standard of living. MOES’s mission is to empower global customers with tools that promote environmental responsibility without sacrificing convenience. The company’s trajectory from its 2008 founding to becoming a globally recognized name in solar technology is a testament to its focus on “sustainable innovation.”

By maintaining a presence in major international exhibitions and continuously updating its product portfolio to meet evolving technical standards, MOES remains at the forefront of the industry. The transition to a smarter, greener future requires more than just hardware; it requires a commitment to quality, a deep understanding of user needs, and the technical prowess to deliver on those promises. Whether for a small cabin in the woods or a large-scale commercial facility, the off-grid solutions provided by MOES represent the pinnacle of reliability and intelligent design.

BYD sold 2.26 million EVs in 2025, while Tesla’s deliveries fell 8% year-on-year to 1.64 million units. The shift marks a significant milestone in the global EV market, with the Chinese manufacturer claiming the crown Tesla had held since becoming the world’s most valuable automaker.

Tesla reported fourth-quarter deliveries of 418,227 vehicles, falling short of analyst expectations of 449,000 units according to FactSet consensus. The disappointing quarter capped off a challenging year for the company, which faced headwinds from policy changes and increased competition.

Multiple factors weigh on Tesla

The elimination of a US$7,500 (AUD$13,000) tax credit in the United States at the end of September 2025 contributed to Tesla’s sales decline, with industry observers noting that EV demand requires time to rebalance following such policy changes.

Tesla’s performance was also affected by CEO Musk’s political support of US President Donald Trump and other right wing politicians, which impacted sales in key markets. The company has simultaneously grappled with intensifying competition from BYD and other Chinese manufacturers, as well as European automotive giants.

Wedbush Securities analysts noted that Tesla faces a “more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.” The company continues to face regulatory approval challenges in Europe related to self-driving technology, with sales potentially rebounding once these hurdles are cleared.

BYD’s rapid ascent

Shenzhen-based BYD, known by its English slogan “Build Your Dreams,” was founded in 1995 and originally specialised in battery manufacturing. The company has come to dominate China’s highly competitive market for new energy vehicles, a term encompassing fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.

BYD is now expanding its presence overseas as increasingly price-conscious consumption patterns in China weigh on profitability. While the company faces hefty tariffs in the US market alongside other Chinese EV producers, its success is growing in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

The competition between Tesla and BYD was close in 2024, with Tesla’s 1.79 million EVs narrowly outpacing BYD’s 1.76 million units. However, BYD’s record 2025 performance has established a clear gap between the two manufacturers.

Market outlook

Tesla shares closed 2.6% down in New York following the delivery announcement. Despite the disappointing figures, Wedbush analysts noted that Tesla’s quarterly sales remained better than some had speculated.

The analysts highlighted that “sales around smaller and emerging markets have started to see larger growth metrics than expectations, which look to offset the declines in key regions like China and Europe.”

For Australian consumers, the global shift in EV leadership could signal increased competition and potentially more choice as BYD continues its international expansion, while Tesla works to address regulatory challenges and restore growth momentum.",https://autotalk.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/byd-atto2-rear-688x459-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 19:59:30.344059

One of the leading moves in this space is a cryogenic technology that delivers precisely such long-duration storage – the use of liquid air to deliver stored energy.
On an international stage, the first mover on this opportunity today is a UK company called Highview Power that is now making serious strides.
“Though smaller than what will follow, this one is very important because it is our first full-scale commercial plant,” says Highview Power CEO Richard Butler.
On tech and analytics Butland says Highview’s capabilities lie in power generation through its cryogenic tech but also substantially in its grid analytics capabilities.","As the energy transition builds, and renewable energy grows in the mix, the question of how to store electricity most effectively for grid flexibility has been climbing the agenda. Gas-fired power plants are the most common fast-response option of choice today, increasingly allied to lithium-ion batteries to manage short-duration balancing challenges.

But it is well understood that another piece in the puzzle is needed in the form of low-carbon long-duration energy storage. This means large stores of low- or zero-carbon energy that can be accessed and used from four to up to 20 hours at a time, and sometimes even longer.

One of the leading moves in this space is a cryogenic technology that delivers precisely such long-duration storage – the use of liquid air to deliver stored energy.

On an international stage, the first mover on this opportunity today is a UK company called Highview Power that is now making serious strides. And more than a decade on from proving its technology with a small-scale pilot project near London, a first commercial-scale plant is taking shape, to be followed by four much larger plants by 2030, with two to be built in Scotland and two in England.

Each of the four larger planned UK facilities is a 2.5GWh plant and due to come onstream by 2030, but before that Highview is delivering a smaller project at Carrington near Manchester, in north-west England.

“Though smaller than what will follow, this one is very important because it is our first full-scale commercial plant,” says Highview Power CEO Richard Butler.

“Once connected to the grid, it can deliver 50MW of output and 300MWh of storage using our proprietary tech. That 50MW output equates to delivering up to 100MW of grid stability, which you could say is the functional purpose.”

The plant encompasses compression, liquefaction, and storage of air, ready for regasification and being put through a steam turbine to make electricity.

“It is a very flexible technology because it is modular by design. It makes it easy to adjust the output based on need, and that’s crucial” says Butland.

The Carrington plant should be ready to switch on in the first quarter of 2026 and will serve as an important test-case for Highview.

On tech and analytics

Butland says Highview’s capabilities lie in power generation through its cryogenic tech but also substantially in its grid analytics capabilities.

“You could even say the analytics side is becoming even more important as a differentiator,” he muses. “Four years ago we realised we needed to invest in our analytics function in order to deliver and integrate our technologies, and that’s an investment that has really helped us to turn a corner and maximise our grid insights and control, as well as helping drive wider decisions around grid investments.”

Among its capabilities, Highview is now able to use its analytics to work with governments on identifying grid vulnerabilities and illustrating how, where and why its cryogenic tech would be best deployed, as well as other ways that grids can be reshaped for the future.

“Our modelling is able to show what is needed in a particular location,” says Butland. “With today’s changing and more distributed electricity grids, the requirements to manage grids are more complex than ever and we can deliver a level of insight that is crucial when it comes to planning for tomorrow.”","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/05/Highview-Power-LAES-Storage-Facility51.jpg",N,,2026-01-04 19:59:48.119694

With Tesla announcing vehicle deliveries that were better than expected despite concerns, analysts say the company has demonstrated a solid foundation for future growth.
Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap within the next year, and in a bullish scenario, could achieve a $3 trillion market cap by the end of 2026.” He particularly described Tesla’s robotaxi ‘Cybercab’ as a “golden goose,” predicting it will be a core driver that will substantially boost the company’s AI valuation.
Ives estimated, “Tesla has at least $1 trillion in potential value from its AI and autonomous driving businesses alone.
In a bullish scenario, where federal regulatory hurdles surrounding FSD and autonomous driving are resolved within the next three to six months and the autonomous driving and robotics roadmap enters full-scale mass production, the stock price could rise to $800.”","On January 5, Wedbush Securities stated that Tesla could capture about 70% of the global autonomous driving market over the next decade and that it is possible for the company’s market capitalization to reach $2 trillion within a year. The firm maintained an ‘Outperform’ rating and set a price target of $600.

With Tesla announcing vehicle deliveries that were better than expected despite concerns, analysts say the company has demonstrated a solid foundation for future growth. In the fourth quarter of last year, Tesla delivered 418,200 vehicles (down 16% year-on-year), slightly below the market consensus of 422,900 units, but above the so-called whisper numbers, which were around 410,000 units.

Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, commented, “Given that demand has weakened further following the expiration of electric vehicle (EV) tax credits and that the European market remains a challenge, these are relatively solid results. This indicates that Tesla is gradually building a foundation for growth beyond 2026.” Ives, a renowned technology stock analyst on Wall Street known for his accurate predictions, is a long-time Tesla bull and well-known among retail investors.

Tesla’s FSD (Full Self-Driving) technology is facing difficulties in obtaining regulatory approval in Europe, making an immediate recovery in sales unlikely. Ives explained, “It is highly likely that the approval process will be completed in the first half of 2026. Better-than-expected growth figures in smaller and emerging markets may partially offset the slowdown currently seen in major markets such as China and Europe.”

Tesla’s specific business strategies and mid- to long-term outlook are expected to be further clarified during the fourth-quarter earnings conference call scheduled for the 28th. Ives asserted, “AI valuation will emerge as a key point throughout 2026. Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap within the next year, and in a bullish scenario, could achieve a $3 trillion market cap by the end of 2026.” He particularly described Tesla’s robotaxi ‘Cybercab’ as a “golden goose,” predicting it will be a core driver that will substantially boost the company’s AI valuation.

Ives estimated, “Tesla has at least $1 trillion in potential value from its AI and autonomous driving businesses alone. In a bullish scenario, where federal regulatory hurdles surrounding FSD and autonomous driving are resolved within the next three to six months and the autonomous driving and robotics roadmap enters full-scale mass production, the stock price could rise to $800.”",https://cphoto.asiae.co.kr/listimglink/6/2025091608592734274_1757980767.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 19:59:42.201661

Last week, the Trump administration suspended leases for five large offshore wind projects that are under construction off the U.S. East Coast over what it called national security concerns, sending shares of offshore wind companies plunging.

The suspension was the latest blow for offshore wind developers that have faced repeated disruptions to their multi-billion-dollar projects under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said he finds wind turbines ugly, costly and inefficient.

Denmark’s Orsted said on Friday it was challenging the U.S. government’s suspension of the lease for its Revolution Wind joint venture and would seek a court injunction against the decision to halt its $5 billion offshore wind project.

Equinor said filing for a preliminary injunction is necessary to keep the project on track during this critical execution phase and avoid further commercial and financing impacts if the order remains in effect.

Tesla delivered 1.64 million EVs in 2025, down from 1.79 million in 2024, while BYD achieved record sales of 2.26 million electric vehicles for the year. The shift marks the end of Tesla’s dominance in the global EV market and highlights the growing influence of Chinese manufacturers.

Tesla’s fourth-quarter deliveries of 418,227 units fell short of analyst expectations of 449,000, according to FactSet consensus data. The company’s struggles come despite CEO Elon Musk’s high-profile leadership and Tesla’s established market presence.

Multiple headwinds impact Tesla

Several factors contributed to Tesla’s declining performance throughout 2025. The elimination of a US$7500 tax credit in the United States at the end of September 2025 created a significant headwind for EV demand, with industry observers noting the market needs time to rebalance.

Tesla also faced challenges related to Musk’s political activities, with his support of US President Donald Trump and other far-right politicians affecting demand in key markets. The company has simultaneously grappled with intensifying competition from BYD and other Chinese manufacturers, as well as European automotive giants.

Wedbush Securities analysts noted Tesla’s quarterly sales figure remained better than some had speculated, but flagged the company faces a “more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.”

BYD’s rapid ascent

Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid vehicles, unveiled its record EV sales figures following Tesla’s announcement. The company, known as “Biyadi” in Chinese or by the English slogan “Build Your Dreams,” was founded in 1995 and originally specialised in battery manufacturing.

BYD has dominated China’s highly competitive market for new energy vehicles, a term encompassing fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. China represents the world’s largest market for new energy vehicles.

The company is now expanding its overseas presence as increasingly price-conscious consumption patterns in China impact profitability. While BYD and other Chinese EV producers face substantial tariffs in the US market, the company has found success in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

Market implications

Tesla shares closed 2.6% down in New York following the sales announcement. The narrow margin between the companies in 2024 – when Tesla’s 1.79 million sales barely outpaced BYD’s 1.76 million – indicated the competitive shift was imminent.

Wedbush Securities analysts noted Tesla still faces regulatory approval challenges in Europe relating to self-driving technology, with sales potentially rebounding once these hurdles are cleared. They added that “sales around smaller and emerging markets have started to see larger growth metrics than expectations, which look to offset the declines in key regions like China and Europe.”

Aiming to get back on a growth track, the company has just launched the Roadster X, the first EV motorcycle with a range of over 500 km. However, it may not be the solution to boost volumes and profits.

McD tracks new vehicle registrations across 97+ countries worldwide, reporting data based on the calendar year. When comparing the data reported by us to that declared by manufacturers, it’s important to note that manufacturers typically report their “sales” (vehicles invoiced), which often differ from “registrations” due to variations in their fiscal year reporting.

Global Sales Performance

In 2024, all winds were favorable for Indian startups, and before going public, sales were boosted by strong government incentives for EV models and by the delay of major manufacturers in introducing electric vehicles (EVs).

Additionally, profitability was not yet a major concern, and Ola was able to offer electric scooters at a very competitive price, achieving immediate success by selling over 400K EVs in a single calendar year. The company shared the optimistic vision of being able to sell millions of EVs in the near future.

However, after becoming a public company, profitability became a key factor. The management had to increase prices, just as major OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) began pushing into the EV market and the government decided to reduce incentives for the sector.

As a result, 2025 became a nightmare, with sales dropping by nearly half, to 199,319 units, and the business outlook became completely different from the optimistic narrative prior to the company’s IPO.

2026 Company’s Goals

This year’s goal will be to get back on a positive track, rebuilding credibility after the rapid decline following the public listing (with the company’s shares starting 2026 nearly 50% below their peak) and finding a position amid the growing competition.

A potential milestone on this path could be the Roadster X, the company’s first electric motorcycle, which has just been launched in India. The motorcycle has been presented with outstanding technical features and an impressive world-best range of 500 km.

However, the motorcycle segment in India is currently almost nonexistent, and the potential customer base for this model represents a small niche within the vast local market. We doubt that it can drive a significant shift for the company in terms of sales, especially considering the consistent investment required for its development.

Ola Electric Heritage

Ola Electric Mobility was founded in 2017 in Bangalore, Karnataka (India), with the goal of producing electric two- and three-wheelers powered entirely by electric engines and 100% renewable energy.

The manufacturing facility is located in Krishnagiri, Tamil Nadu (India), on a 500-acre site. It is likely the largest two-wheeler manufacturing facility in the world, known as the Future Factory, and was built with a US$324 million investment.

Production began in December 2021, and by the 2023 calendar year, the company had taken the lead in the Indian electric two-wheeler segment.

The company also manufactures battery cells at its facility in Tamil Nadu, which supply energy storage solutions for its vehicles and other applications. The plant, called the Giga-Factory, is set to become operational at the start of 2025.

But it would also create a state-level repository of data center proposals, making it easier to keep track of proposals.
She expects data center players to argue that onerous regulations could cause data centers to seek sites in nearby states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, rather than Maryland.
“As other states aggressively compete for data center investment, Maryland cannot afford to sit on the sidelines,” reads the August report.
“By welcoming responsible data center development, Maryland can address its immediate fiscal and economic challenges while positioning itself as a leader in the digital economy for decades to come.","The proposals seem to be cropping up left and right.

A vacant Social Security building in Baltimore County. A former power plant in Montgomery. An old mall site in Prince George’s. And that’s on top of a data center campus that has long been under development on a former industrial site in Frederick County.

It’s likely that large scale data centers, which have a large presence in neighboring Virginia, will make their way to Maryland in greater numbers in the years ahead. Yet, there isn’t a cohesive statewide policy regulating the arrival of these facilities, which demand immense amounts of energy. Instead, local jurisdictions wield much of the power to approve or deny projects through zoning rules.

“Local governments can make decisions that affect the entire state,” said Dave Arndt, co-chair of the Maryland Legislative Coalition Climate Justice Wing, who focuses on data centers. “If they approve a very large hyperscale data center that requires new transmission lines, new distribution lines and a new substation — and uses the same amount of electricity as the city of Baltimore — that’s going to increase our rates.”

During the coming General Assembly session, data center regulations are likely to draw some interest, as Maryland’s grid operator continues to issue dire warnings about just how much energy they’re projected to demand — and how that could send energy prices soaring ever further.

Perhaps one needn’t look any further than December’s special session, during which lawmakers overrode Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) veto of a study to evaluate data centers’ potential impact on the state, one of several studies the governor rejected.

Speaking from the Senate floor about the study, Sen. Charles Sydnor (D-Baltimore County) said his office learned over the summer about the data center proposal in Woodlawn — in his district — and has been in “fact-finding mode” ever since.

“The experts are adamant that across the country, and here in Maryland, we are currently rushing to approve data center projects through a poorly planned, chaotic process that lacks a foolproof regulatory framework to protect our communities from harm,” Sydnor said.

Sydnor argued that data center projects seem to offer benefits “only for the wealthy,” while the costs “are socialized for everyone else.”

Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick), speaking for an override of the governor’s veto, said looming data centers have “a very real impact. Frederick County is the first that has really started to develop our data center platforms, and right now we’re looking at a 2,200-acre parcel.”

Last session, the legislature integrated a few data center regulations in a broader package of energy reforms. For example, one provision required electric utilities to create new rate schedules for large-load customers such as data centers — subject to approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC).

“It is the intent of the General Assembly that residential retail electric customers in the State should not bear the financial risks associated with large load customers interconnecting to the electric system serving the State,” read the bill, which Moore signed in May.

But it seems clear more rule changes are coming.

For his part, the governor argues that the state should open its doors to data centers — but not without constraints.

“I do not believe in the false choice that oftentimes is being laid out: That it’s either we let Big Tech do whatever they want, and we turn intoo Northern Virginia, or it’s, don’t allow any type of economic development in the state,” Moore said during a recent news conference. “I don’t think either one of those answers are right.”

In 2024, Moore’s administration proposed a bill exempting data centers’ diesel-powered backup generators from scrutiny by the PSC, which passed.

In his recent remarks, Moore said he envisions a process where state officials work with the impacted community, local officials and environmental groups to determine how data centers considering Maryland can contribute using “best practices,” including by bringing their own power generation along with them.

Data center woes at PJM

Under current policies, all electricity ratepayers share the costs of system expansion and maintenance. But there’s a growing push to require very large users to fund the power boosts that they require.

Leaders at PJM Interconnection, the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid, which includes Maryland, Washington, D.C., and a dozen other states, are currently considering a host of possible policy changes related to data centers. They’re expected to make a decision in January, after which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gets to make the final call.

A proposal from state governors, including Moore, called for PJM to provide incentives for data centers to bring their own power generation. A proposal from state lawmakers, including several Marylanders, would require PJM to curtail power to data centers in emergencies if they do not bring their own generation.

The need for regulatory change appears dire. At its energy capacity auction in December, PJM failed to procure all of the energy that it deemed necessary for the 2027-2028 delivery year — and the projected demand from data centers was largely to blame.

The shortfall doesn’t mean that the grid won’t be able to serve customers during the delivery year. But PJM aims to have a 20% reserve margin for power system emergencies, and it only secured 14.8%.

The shortage happened because PJM projections show there will be an increase of nearly 5,100 megawatts worth of data center demand for those years, though there is worry that the demand is being over-counted as data centers talk to multiple power companies about the same project.

PJM officials are optimistic that their policy changes could reduce the shortfall by lowering the projected toll of data centers.

“There are factors here that lead us to believe that we will actually be closer to the … standard once the delivery year arrives, because of things that we expect to change between now and 2027,” said Stu Bressler, executive vice president of market services and strategy at PJM.

Maryland isn’t ‘negotiating with an empty hand’

At the same time, Maryland is eyeing policy changes of its own.

Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), said she is working on a bill that would require all data centers of a certain size to receive a certificate to operate from the PSC.

She argues that the bill would provide a new layer of state scrutiny focused on energy usage, going beyond the current permitting regime at the Maryland Department of the Environment, which is more focused on emissions and site conditions. But it would also create a state-level repository of data center proposals, making it easier to keep track of proposals.

“It’s basically a transparency bill, so that we’ll have everything in one place at the state,” Hester said.

Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) said she is crafting a bill that would encourage data centers to curtail their power usage during peak periods, such as hot days, when the electrical system is taxed by heavy usage of air conditioners. The electrical system is built around withstanding the peaks, Charkoudian said, even though most of the year, the system is far from maxed out.

“I’m really focused on: When data centers are coming online in Maryland, how can they be part of the solution for the 100 hours a year where their presence is going to lead to driving up costs?” Charkoudian said.

Data centers could reduce their usage by moving particular work to non-peak periods, or pre-cooling their equipment to avoid cooling during the hottest time of the day, when the grid will be most taxed, Charkoudian said.

Charkoudian said her bill will also incentivize data centers to build battery energy storage facilities in their areas, so that they could turn to stored power during peak periods.

Arndt from the Climate Justice Wing called Charkoudian’s bill a “win-win-win situation.”

“They [data centers] stay operational. The grid stays operational. We win because we don’t have to build new peaker plants,” Arndt said, referring to plants that are called on in peak demand periods.

But it’s important that the bill continue to ensure that data centers use clean backup power during peak periods, rather than relying on fossil fuel backup generators, Arndt cautioned.

“We don’t want diesel generators running for four hours in a community just because we’re running low on energy.” Arndt said.

Angie McCarthy, Maryland conservation advocate at Nature Forward, said her group supports Charkoudian’s bill, though she knows it won’t come without controversy. She expects data center players to argue that onerous regulations could cause data centers to seek sites in nearby states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, rather than Maryland.

“From our perspective, Maryland is seen as a prime spot for data center development, because we have such access to the fiber-optic cables and other infrastructure that Virginia has installed in their state,” McCarthy said. “We aren’t negotiating with an empty hand.”

The Maryland Tech Council, a trade association representing technology companies, has focused much of its recent messaging on the economic boost that data centers can bring to the state.

A typical 800,000 square foot data center produces about 5,000 jobs during construction, along with $775 million in economic activity and $18 million in state tax revenue, according to a Tech Council report issued in August. During operation, a typical facility spurs 500 permanent jobs, $31 million in annual compensation and $14 million in annual state tax revenue, according to the study, conducted by the Sage Policy Group, a Baltimore-based firm led by economist Anirban Basu.

In a more recent report, the Tech Council zeroed in on Prince George’s County, arguing that a “mid-sized” data center development would generate over $1 billion in economic activity during construction, and $20 million in annual tax revenue for the county.

“As other states aggressively compete for data center investment, Maryland cannot afford to sit on the sidelines,” reads the August report. “By welcoming responsible data center development, Maryland can address its immediate fiscal and economic challenges while positioning itself as a leader in the digital economy for decades to come. The time to act is now; before this opportunity, like so many others, migrates to neighboring states with more favorable business environments.”",https://www.citybiz.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Data-center.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 19:59:51.515372

Sweden’s state-owned LKAB is relocating the entire Arctic town of Kiruna to access the Per Geijer deposit, Europe’s largest rare earth resource at approximately 2.2 million tonnes, as part of the continent’s push for mineral independence from China.

While the deposit scale is significant, Europe still lacks commercial-scale separation, refining capacity, and magnet manufacturing—meaning a resource discovery alone won’t break China’s 90%+ downstream dominance.

For U.S. stakeholders, Kiruna signals allied mineral realism but underscores the urgent need for coordinated transatlantic investment in processing infrastructure, not just upstream mining.

A recent Oilprice.com feature (opens in a new tab) by Tsvetana Paraskova captures a striking image: Sweden’s mining champion LKAB (opens in a new tab) relocating the Arctic town of Kiruna—including its 113-year-old wooden church—as mine expansion and ground subsidence make the move unavoidable. The visuals are dramatic, but the strategic subtext matters far more. Beneath Kiruna lies the Per Geijer deposit, which LKAB has reported at more than one million tonnes of rare earth oxides—with later disclosures suggesting ~2.2 million tonnes in situ—widely regarded as the largest known rare earth resource in Europe. For a continent anxious about China’s dominance in rare earths, the symbolism is powerful: Europe is literally moving a town to keep critical minerals accessible.

LKAB: A Heavyweight With a Long Horizon

Founded in 1890, LKAB (Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag) is a wholly state-owned Swedish mining group, headquartered in Luleå, with core operations in Kiruna and Gällivare. It is one of the world’s leading suppliers of high-grade magnetite iron ore pellets and fines, serving steelmakers across Europe and Asia. Beyond iron ore, LKAB produces industrial minerals and provides drilling systems and engineering services globally. Strategically, the company positions itself at the forefront of decarbonizing heavy industry, targeting carbon-free steelmaking processes by 2045 through innovations such as green sponge iron and energy-efficient pelletizing. This long-cycle, state-backed mandate shapes how Kiruna’s rare earth potential should be interpreted.

What the Story Gets Right—and Where It Leans

The article is solid on fundamentals. LKAB has publicly confirmed the scale of the Per Geijer resource, and the International Energy Agency consistently underscores the extreme concentration of the rare earth supply chain. China’s dominance—roughly 60% of mining, over 90% of refining, and nearly all permanent magnet manufacturing—is not overstated. Kiruna therefore represents a genuine upstream diversification signal.

Where optimism quietly outruns reality is downstream. A deposit does not equal independence as _Rare Earth Exchanges_™ continuously chronicles. Europe still lacks commercial-scale separation capacity, solvent expertise, and magnet manufacturing depth. Environmental permitting, radioactive by-product handling, and capital intensity remain formidable hurdles. The narrative edges toward inevitability when execution risk is, in fact, substantial.

Why This Still Matters for the U.S.

For American investors and policymakers, Kiruna is asignal, not a solution. It shows allied nations waking up to mineral realism—but without coordinated transatlantic investment in processing and magnets, China’s structural advantage remains intact. Moving a town is bold. Building a supply chain is harder.

In my earlier scenario of maritime shipping decarbonization, I projected that most of the visible progress over the next two decades would come from inland shipping, ports, and short sea routes rather than from transoceanic vessels.
The evidence from ports and inland shipping shows that working outward from what is feasible now delivers faster, more durable progress.
When viewed through that lens, CATL’s Ship-Shore-Cloud strategy looks less like a product announcement and more like an operating system for maritime electrification.
That strategy is reinforced by national Chinese policies that emphasize electrifying inland shipping and ports using technologies that are already commercially viable, rather than deferring action in favor of speculative fuel pathways.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

CATL’s batteries and energy management systems are already operating in roughly 900 ships and vessels, a figure that on its own should reframe how maritime decarbonization is discussed. Shipping is conservative for structural reasons tied to safety, long asset lifetimes, and unforgiving certification regimes, so deployment at this scale signals that electrification is no longer a pilot exercise but operating infrastructure. While much of the public debate remains focused on alternative fuels that are expensive, supply constrained, or operationally complex, electrification has been advancing quietly in the parts of maritime transport where it actually works today.

That reality became clearer when CATL—China’s and the world’s largest battery company—, through its marine subsidiary Contemporary Amperex Electric Vessel (CAEV), unveiled its Ship-Shore-Cloud electric vessel solution at Marintec China 2025 in early December. The announcement was not framed around a single battery product or a demonstration vessel, but around integration across the full operating stack. Onboard, CATL combines batteries, power electronics, propulsion integration, and control systems into certified packages designed for multi-decade service. Onshore, it pairs those systems with charging and battery swapping infrastructure, including a separation of ship and battery model that lowers upfront capital requirements and reallocates risk. At the cloud layer, fleet operators gain continuous monitoring, scheduling, maintenance planning, and optimization across entire fleets. The underlying premise is straightforward. Fragmented supplier models create coordination failures, unclear accountability, and avoidable downtime over a 30 year asset life, while integrated systems reduce operational risk and lifecycle cost.

The significance of that approach becomes clearer when examined against the vessels already operating at scale. CATL’s systems power Changjiangsanxia 1, a roughly 100 meter all electric inland passenger ship carrying more than 1,000 passengers daily on the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges region. Along China’s coast, the Yujian 77 electric passenger vessel operates on short sea routes in places such as Xiamen Bay, meeting China Classification Society requirements for corrosion resistance, redundancy, and marine safety in saltwater conditions that are far harsher than inland rivers. In ports, hybrid tugboats such as Qinggang Tug 1 are handling high transient power demands during ship assist operations, demonstrating that batteries can absorb peak loads and cut diesel use and local air pollution in dense harbor environments.

On the cargo side, the Jining 6006 electric vessel is moving freight along sections of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal using containerized battery swapping, where batteries are exchanged in minutes rather than hours, showing that downtime rather than energy density is often the real constraint for commercial operations. Two sister 700 TEU battery-electric container ships, N997 and N998, built for COSCO Shipping Development and operating on the Yangtze River with swappable containerized batteries, do not use CATL systems but are still indicative of how quickly large-scale inland container shipping is moving toward electrification in China. These deployments are not fringe experiments. They sit squarely in inland waterways, coastal passenger routes, ports, and canals, precisely where electrification is most practical and where emissions have the greatest impact on nearby communities.

The strategic context sharpened further in 2025 when CATL and A.P. Moller Maersk formalized a series of agreements spanning ports, terminals, and logistics. Through Maersk’s terminal arm APM Terminals, CATL batteries are being deployed into electrified container handling equipment and terminal vehicles, a segment where electrification is already economically compelling due to predictable duty cycles, centralized charging, and clear total cost advantages. I’ve spent considerable time talking with Sahar Rashidbeigi about APM Terminal’s electrification efforts under her four years leading the effort, now over as she has taken a new role as VP Decarbonization for the Royal Carribean Group cruise line company.

Beyond terminals, the broader CATL–Maersk strategic partnership positions CATL as a preferred battery and energy technology partner across logistics and supply chains. For Maersk, the value lies in decarbonizing assets without compromising reliability or competitiveness. For CATL, the value lies in embedding its technology into a global operational platform where scale, standards, and learning effects reinforce each other. Clearly Maersk is seeing the strong advantages of electrification of as much of the supply chain it operates as possible.

This trajectory aligns closely with the multi decade port electrification strategy I have laid out in my earlier work. In that analysis, I argued that ports function most effectively as energy hubs rather than fuel depots, because electricity scales incrementally, integrates cleanly with grids, and improves reliability instead of introducing new handling risks. The sequencing matters. Ground equipment electrifies first because the technology is mature and the economics are already favorable. Harbor craft follow because their duty cycles are short, predictable, and power intensive. Shore power then becomes routine for vessels at berth, eliminating auxiliary engine use in precisely the places where air pollution is most visible and politically sensitive. Grid capacity and onshore and offshore renewables expand alongside these changes as demand materializes, rather than being built speculatively in advance. Only after these steps are well underway does it make sense to address the hardest segments of deep sea shipping. This is not an abstract preference. It is an operational strategy that builds infrastructure, workforce capability, regulatory familiarity, and confidence while delivering emissions and cost reductions at each stage.

In my earlier scenario of maritime shipping decarbonization, I projected that most of the visible progress over the next two decades would come from inland shipping, ports, and short sea routes rather than from transoceanic vessels. Inland waterways and coastal services have constrained ranges, centralized charging opportunities, and fixed schedules, all of which favor battery electric propulsion. Ports, meanwhile, are stationary energy consumers that can anchor grid upgrades, renewable integration, and storage, creating spillover benefits for surrounding industries. As these systems scale, batteries become cheaper, operational data accumulates, and standards harden, further lowering barriers to adoption. None of this requires breakthroughs. It requires deployment.

My view on deep sea shipping has always been more conditional. Long haul ocean vessels face genuine energy density constraints that batteries alone cannot solve today, and pretending otherwise does not help the sector. That does not mean decarbonization stalls. It means the pathway is slower and more selective. Operational changes such as speed reductions deliver immediate emissions cuts. Hybridization allows batteries to cover port entry, maneuvering, and auxiliary loads, shrinking fuel demand even when liquid fuels remain necessary. Sustainable biofuels have a role in that context, not as a universal solution but as a limited substitute where electrification cannot yet reach. As I noted after working with TenneT in The Netherlands in the summer of 2025 on their 2050 full country energy decarbonization scenario, core discussions of the economic merit order of aviation versus shipping demand for the feedstocks most suitable for making aviation fuels led to my assumption that biomethanol would be a dominant shipping fuel after all. Subsequent assessment of US corn ethanol futures and an ongoing research effort on pathways to aviation fuels from waste biomass and agricultural feedstocks—expect a series including updates to my aviation scenario soon—lead me to believe that ethanol will also be a likely shipping fuel, especially for ships bunkering in US and Brazilian ports.

Over time, as ports become fully electrified energy hubs and short sea routes normalize electric propulsion, the pressure on deep sea shipping eases because a growing share of maritime activity has already decarbonized and global shipping of fossil fuels—40% of total shipping tonnage today—and raw iron ore—another 15%—will be in structural decline. The mistake is to treat the hardest problem as the first one to solve. The evidence from ports and inland shipping shows that working outward from what is feasible now delivers faster, more durable progress.

When viewed through that lens, CATL’s Ship-Shore-Cloud strategy looks less like a product announcement and more like an operating system for maritime electrification. Integrated onboard systems depend on standardized shore charging, grid upgrades and energy management. Fleet-level monitoring reduces downtime and clarifies accountability across decades of operation, while battery swapping and service models smooth adoption by shifting capital and performance risk. Many battery suppliers sell components into this ecosystem. CATL is positioning itself as a platform provider spanning assets, infrastructure, and operational data.

China’s national policy environment reinforces that positioning. Inland shipping and ports sit squarely within China’s dual carbon objectives of peaking emissions before 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2060, with national and provincial policies emphasizing low carbon ports, electrification of port equipment, expansion of shore power, and modernization of inland waterways. Rivers such as the Yangtze carry immense freight volumes through dense population centers, with predictable routes and centralized nodes that favor electrification earlier than almost anywhere else. Policy support, industrial capacity, and domestic scale combine to create learning curves that compound quickly, allowing standards proven at home to become export standards as deployments accumulate.

CATL is not operating in isolation, even if it is the most visible player at scale. Other Chinese battery manufacturers are already active in or moving decisively toward the maritime space, drawing on the same industrial strengths that reshaped automotive electrification. BYD, through its energy storage and marine subsidiaries, has supplied batteries and complete electric propulsion systems for ferries and workboats, particularly in coastal and inland applications. EVE Energy has obtained marine certifications and is supplying lithium iron phosphate cells and packs into electric and hybrid vessels, often through partnerships with ship system integrators. CALB and Gotion High-Tech are also present, supplying cells and modules used in marine energy storage systems that meet classification society requirements. In parallel, firms such as Lishen, Sunwoda, Great Power, and REPT are positioning their products for maritime use, leveraging scale from automotive and stationary storage markets. What distinguishes this group collectively is not just manufacturing capacity, but proximity to Chinese shipyards and system integrators, which allows batteries, power electronics, and energy management systems to be designed into vessels from the outset. The result is a deep and growing ecosystem of Chinese battery suppliers capable of supporting electrified shipping, even as CATL remains the clear leader in integration, deployment count, and strategic reach.

This stands in sharp contrast to the role the United States has played, where federal policy has actively attacked or undermined progress rather than merely failing to lead. By scuttling decarbonization measures at the International Maritime Organization, the United States has injected uncertainty into a sector that depends on long lived assets and stable standards. That uncertainty has predictable effects. Shipowners will delay retrofits, many ports will hesitate on grid and shore power investments, and capital will wait for clearer signals, even where electric solutions are already viable.

The structural reasons for this posture are not subtle. The United States has a lagging battery manufacturing sector compared with China, no meaningful commercial shipbuilding industry at scale—South Korea, Japan, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Finland each have larger commercial shipbuilding industries than the United States, even though taken together they have a smaller combined population and less than half the GDP of the country—, and a Jones Act regime that sharply limits domestic vessel competition and renewal. Those constraints inhibit electrification of vessels operating in US, Canadian and Mexican waters and make it difficult for American firms to compete with companies like CATL that combine battery manufacturing scale, certified marine systems, and integration across ships, ports, and operations. Instead of addressing those weaknesses, US policy has leaned toward blocking international progress, which slows global decarbonization while doing little to improve domestic competitiveness. The result is a widening gap between countries aligning policy with industrial reality and those attempting to defend legacy structures that no longer match the direction of maritime technology.

Europe occupies a middle ground in maritime electrification, with a shipbuilding industry far smaller than China’s but still robust and globally relevant, and a narrower battery manufacturing base. It has combined port electrification with real-world shipping deployments under a strong policy push, pairing shore power mandates, carbon pricing through the EU emissions trading system, and regulations such as FuelEU Maritime with large-scale demonstrations of battery-electric and hybrid vessels. Electrification of ferries is already routine in Norway, Denmark, Scotland, and the Baltic on fixed routes, while ports across the EU are upgrading grids and berth infrastructure in response to binding decarbonization targets that are steadily reshaping both port operations and short-sea shipping. It will still electrify much more slowly than China, but the Maersk-CATL agreements promise to speed this considerably.

Taken together, these dynamics support a clear conclusion. CATL, as China’s and the world’s leading battery manufacturer, is positioning itself to become the dominant global player in port and shipping electrification, combining manufacturing scale, certified marine technology, integrated service models, and anchor partnerships with operators such as Maersk. That strategy is reinforced by national Chinese policies that emphasize electrifying inland shipping and ports using technologies that are already commercially viable, rather than deferring action in favor of speculative fuel pathways. The result is not a promise about the distant future of shipping, but a concrete reshaping of how large parts of the sector are already operating.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini_Generated_Image_s3es6qs3es6qs3es-800x442.png,N,,2026-01-04 15:57:57.436118

Tesla wasn't the only automaker to experience a sales drop in 2025 as electric-vehicle tax credits in the United States came to an end. Rivian has released its sales data for the full year, and while the result is in line with its expectations, it's not a pretty picture.

Rivian on Friday confirmed 42,247 vehicle deliveries in 2025, an 18% decrease from 2024's record high of 51,579. In particular, Rivian saw a sharp drop in fourth-quarter deliveries—the electric startup moved 9,745 units in the last three months of 2025, compared to 13,201 in the third quarter.

In other words, a lot of buyers rushed out to secure a Rivian R1S or R1T before the tax credit ended in late September, and then didn't show up for the rest of the year.

Unlike Tesla and other automakers, Rivian only sells its EVs in the U.S. and Canada. But the end of America's $7,500 EV tax credit—which also applied to any leased EV—hit most carmakers hard. The credit was a strong driver of both sales and leases, and so many companies, analysts and experts predicted a drop in EV adoption in the latter part of 2025. That includes Rivian, which said that the company's annual deliveries were in line with its estimates.

Tesla, which operates much more globally than Rivian, announced a 9% sales drop in 2025. Chinese automaker BYD is now the worldwide leader in EV sales.

However, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe has said that in the long run, the end of the tax credit could be advantageous if it forces competitors to back off their EV investments. “Narrowly and myopically through the lens of Rvian, it actually creates less competition,"" Scaringe said in November.

The ultimate test of that theory comes later this year with the debut of the 2026 Rivian R2. That EV, a downsized SUV that rides on an all-new platform, will be more affordable and more profitable than its current R1 models. Those SUVs and trucks usually retail for between $80,000 and $100,000 or more. Rivian has claimed the R2 will start around $45,000, although the ""launch edition"" vehicles are likely to be more expensive.

Even so, the R2 is expected to be a crucial, long-term volume-selling EV for Rivian, much as the Model Y was for Tesla. Scaringe told the InsideEVs Plugged-In Podcast as much last year. “If you want to buy an electric vehicle for under $50,000 today, I would say in the United States there are well under five great choices,” Scaringe said. The R2, he said, needs to be a promising enough product that can appeal beyond tax incentives.

Meanwhile, Rivian has a few other promising irons in the fire. The startup was given the keys to the Volkswagen Group's future electrical architecture and software plans in the West, a $6 billion joint-venture deal. And the company is working to boost its autonomous vehicle technology. In December, Rivian announced that a future R2 variant will include lidar for eventual self-driving, and that the company is becoming a kind of Nvidia competitor by making its own computer chips in-house.

Rivian has said that R2 deliveries are expected to begin in the first half of 2026. Until then, the R1S and R1T will have to hold down the fort.

In a seismic shift for the global automotive industry, China’s BYD has officially overtaken Tesla as the world’s leading seller of electric vehicles, marking a pivotal moment in the race for dominance in sustainable transportation. Recent data reveals that BYD delivered 2.26 million battery-electric vehicles in 2025, surpassing Tesla’s 1.64 million units, according to reports from multiple outlets. This achievement comes amid intensifying competition and policy changes that have reshaped market dynamics, particularly in China, the world’s largest auto market.

The numbers underscore BYD’s rapid ascent. While Tesla has long been synonymous with electric innovation, BYD’s strategy of offering affordable, high-volume models has propelled it to the forefront. For instance, BYD’s total vehicle sales, including hybrids, reached 4.6 million units last year, meeting its revised targets despite a challenging economic environment in China. Tesla, on the other hand, faced headwinds from the expiration of federal tax credits in the U.S. and increased rivalry from European manufacturers.

This turnover isn’t just about sales figures; it reflects broader trends in technology, supply chains, and consumer preferences. Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, once famously laughed off BYD’s prospects in a 2011 interview, but the Chinese company’s focus on vertical integration—controlling everything from battery production to vehicle assembly—has given it a cost advantage that’s hard to ignore.

The Roots of BYD’s Rise

BYD’s journey from a battery maker to an automotive powerhouse began in the mid-2000s, but its EV ambitions took off with heavy investments in research and development. Founded in 1995, the company initially specialized in rechargeable batteries before entering the auto sector in 2003. By leveraging China’s vast resources in rare earth minerals and a government-backed push for green energy, BYD has built an ecosystem that minimizes dependencies on foreign suppliers.

Contrast this with Tesla, which revolutionized the industry with its premium models like the Model 3 and Cybertruck, emphasizing software and autonomous driving features. However, Tesla’s growth has slowed, with quarterly deliveries falling short of expectations in late 2025, as noted in a Reuters analysis. The elimination of U.S. federal incentives under the Trump administration exacerbated this, hitting Tesla harder than rivals with diversified markets.

BYD’s success is also tied to its pricing strategy. Models like the Seagull, priced under $10,000 in China, have democratized EV ownership, appealing to budget-conscious buyers in emerging markets. This approach has allowed BYD to capture a 15% share of all car sales in China, far outpacing Tesla’s presence there.

Policy Shifts and Market Pressures

Government policies have played a crucial role in this narrative. In China, subsidies and mandates for electric vehicles have fueled domestic growth, enabling companies like BYD to scale rapidly. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the withdrawal of EV tax credits has dampened demand, as highlighted in coverage from The New York Times. This policy divergence has widened the gap, with Chinese firms benefiting from a supportive regulatory environment.

Globally, BYD’s export strategy is gaining traction. Sales outside China surged 151% in 2025, with the UK emerging as a key market. Posts on X reflect growing sentiment that BYD’s affordable offerings are winning over European consumers, challenging established players. Tesla, focused on high-margin vehicles and ventures like robotaxis, has seen its core auto business questioned amid these developments.

Competition from Europe adds another layer. Brands like Volkswagen and BMW are ramping up EV production, eroding Tesla’s market share. A Euronews report details how BYD’s lower prices are reshaping the competitive field, forcing Western automakers to rethink strategies.

Technological Edge and Supply Chain Mastery

At the heart of BYD’s dominance is its battery technology. The company’s Blade Battery, known for safety and efficiency, has set new standards, reducing costs by up to 30% compared to competitors. This innovation stems from BYD’s origins as a battery producer, allowing it to integrate vertically and avoid supply bottlenecks that plagued Tesla during chip shortages.

Tesla’s strengths lie in its software ecosystem, including over-the-air updates and Full Self-Driving capabilities, but these haven’t translated to volume sales in price-sensitive markets. As per a Bloomberg article, BYD’s 2025 sales milestone was overshadowed by concerns about China’s auto market slowdown, yet it still outpaced Tesla in pure EV deliveries.

Industry insiders point to BYD’s diversification into hybrids as a smart hedge. While Tesla remains all-in on battery electrics, BYD’s plug-in hybrids accounted for a significant portion of its 4.6 million units, bridging the gap for consumers wary of full electrification.

Global Expansion and Challenges Ahead

BYD’s ambitions extend beyond China. The company is building factories in Thailand, Brazil, and Hungary, aiming to localize production and evade tariffs. This move counters protectionist measures, such as potential U.S. barriers under Trump, which could limit Chinese EV imports. Sentiment on X highlights how BYD’s revenue surpassing Tesla’s—reaching $108 billion in 2024—signals a broader economic shift.

Tesla, steering toward robotaxis and humanoid robots, as Musk pivots the company, faces questions about its auto fundamentals. A WIRED piece notes that Tesla’s sales drop in 2025 ceded the crown to BYD, with full-year figures confirming the change.

However, challenges loom for BYD. Overcapacity in China’s auto sector could lead to price wars, squeezing margins. Geopolitical tensions, including trade disputes, might hinder exports. Analysts warn that while BYD leads in volume, Tesla’s higher average selling prices mean its revenue per vehicle remains superior—estimated at twice that of BYD’s.

Strategic Responses and Industry Implications

In response, Tesla is accelerating efforts in autonomous technology, betting on software as a differentiator. Musk’s involvement in U.S. politics, including ties to the Trump administration, could influence future policies favoring domestic production. Yet, as detailed in a Guardian report, Tesla’s sales slump post-subsidy cuts underscores vulnerabilities.

For BYD, sustaining growth involves innovation in smart features and expanding premium lines to compete with Tesla’s luxury appeal. Partnerships, like potential collaborations with tech giants, could enhance its global footprint.

The broader industry feels the ripple effects. Traditional automakers are accelerating EV transitions, with Ford and GM investing billions to catch up. Posts on X capture public fascination, from mockery of Musk’s past dismissals to admiration for BYD’s efficiency.

Future Trajectories in Electric Mobility

Looking ahead, the EV market’s evolution will hinge on battery advancements and charging infrastructure. BYD’s investments in solid-state batteries could further solidify its lead, potentially reducing costs and extending range.

Tesla’s Cybercab and Optimus projects represent a diversification away from pure vehicle sales, positioning it as a tech company. However, as a BBC article states, this is the first time BYD has outpaced Tesla annually, a milestone in the Sino-American rivalry.

Emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America offer growth avenues for BYD, where affordability trumps premium features. Conversely, Tesla’s brand strength in North America and Europe provides a buffer.

Economic and Geopolitical Dimensions

This shift has economic ramifications. China’s dominance in EV supply chains strengthens its position in global trade, potentially influencing commodity prices for lithium and cobalt.

Geopolitically, it heightens U.S.-China tensions, with calls for tariffs to protect domestic industries. A CNBC report recounts Musk’s early skepticism, now ironic given BYD’s triumph.

Investors are recalibrating. Tesla’s stock has faced volatility, while BYD’s shares reflect confidence in its model.

Innovation and Consumer Shifts

Consumer preferences are evolving, with sustainability and cost driving choices. BYD’s focus on practical, efficient vehicles resonates in densely populated regions.

Tesla continues to innovate in AI-driven features, potentially regaining ground through ecosystem lock-in.

Ultimately, this dethroning signals a multipolar EV world, where no single player dominates indefinitely. As per insights from Electrek, BYD’s 2025 performance secures its crown, but the race accelerates.

Sustaining Momentum Amid Uncertainties

BYD must navigate domestic slowdowns, with forecasts predicting moderated growth in 2026. Expanding service networks globally will be key.

For Tesla, refocusing on core autos while advancing tech ventures could restore balance.

Amid what's expected to be a slower year for electric vehicles in America, Toyota will debut two new battery-powered models.

Perhaps the most promising is the 2026 Toyota C-HR, a kind of shrunken-down Toyota bZ—complete with a smaller price tag.

In Europe, at least, the C-HR could use more affordable LFP batteries, too.

With electric-vehicle tax credits gone, fuel economy regulations relaxed and car companies feeling the tariff heat, 2026 is expected to be a slower year for EV adoption. But there are still some bright spots ahead, especially as the EV field moves in a more affordable direction. And one of the more promising entries will come from a company that's historically been more reluctant to lean into EVs than others.

Slated for debut this year is the 2026 Toyota C-HR: a new, smaller and more affordable member of the Toyota EV family that kicked off with the original bZ4X.

That car has been renamed the Toyota bZ for 2026, and it benefits from a wide range of improvements to range, charging, performance and software. But the bigger news is that it's bringing this new friend to play as well.

The C-HR—called the C-HR+ in other markets, to differentiate its all-electric version from other ones—on the same e-TNGA platform as the bZ. But in some ways, it's actually better, in terms of specs. It comes standard with dual-motor all-wheel-drive, eschewing the bZ's front-drive version. That means it packs the same 74.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack in a smaller overall package; it's four inches shorter in wheelbase, two inches shorter and about six inches shorter in total length.

That smaller size means it should deliver an estimated 290 miles of range, Toyota has said. (Official EPA-rated estimates are forthcoming.) That's right around the current table-stakes standard of 300 miles for modern EVs, and in ideal conditions, the C-HR could potentially deliver even more than that. And with 338 horsepower delivering an estimated five-second 0-60 mph time, it should be a decent performer as well.

Like the bZ and the other members of the updated Toyota EV family, the C-HR will also use a Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) port. While Toyota's EVs can already use more than 20,000 Tesla Superchargers with an adapter, the NACS port will make that more seamless than ever.

On the downside, the C-HR will sacrifice interior room to the bZ. It delivers about three cubic feet less storage space behind the second row of seats and dimensions are tighter overall.

While America's C-HR will be fairly well-appointed, the EV comes in more budget-minded trims in other markets. Our colleagues at InsideEVs Germany report that the European C-HR+ will include two front-wheel drive options, and more importantly, what appear to be lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. Those should be a 57.7-kWh LFP battery and a larger 77.0-kWh unit. Toyota has already stated it's working on longer-range LFP batteries for 2026 and beyond, but these seem to be different units.

Regardless, America's C-HR could be a great addition to the field in America for buyers who have been waiting for Toyota to get serious about EVs. Pricing is expected to start well below $40,000—possibly even below $35,000, considering that's now the starting MSRP for the larger bZ.

Toyota has confirmed that the C-HR will arrive later this year at American dealerships, along with the larger bZ Woodland and several Subaru-badged counterparts. We at InsideEVs expect to get behind the wheel for a first-drive test very soon.

Orsted A/S, the Danish renewable energy giant co-developing Revolution Wind, initially offered a veiled response to the second stop work order.
But the hundreds of pages filed in D.C. federal court in the first two days of the year reveal a more forceful fight.
“Rhode Island has built national leadership in offshore wind by doing the hard work and delivering real results,” Gov.
The AGs case was originally filed in Rhode Island federal court, but transferred to D.C. in December, less than two weeks before the second stop work order.","The year is new, but the argument is the same: The Trump administration has no constitutional authority to halt work on a major offshore wind project nearing completion south of Rhode Island’s coastline.

Hundreds of pages of legal filings submitted in federal court on Jan. 1 and 2 by the Revolution Wind developers reprise many of the same arguments already invoked in its August lawsuit against federal regulators.

The 65-turbine project was already 80% complete when the Trump administration unexpectedly ordered work to stop on Aug. 22, citing national security issues. A month of anguish ensued, with local officials, labor leaders and environmental advocates, along with the companies behind the $5 billion project, decrying the unconstitutional overstep by federal regulators. A federal judge in D.C. stepped in, forcing the Trump administration to back off in a Sept. 22 order. Unlike other litigation between states and companies and the federal government, the order was never appealed.

The rocky seas seemed to calm. Laborers resumed work, and the developers said they were still on schedule to begin providing power to Rhode Island and Connecticut by mid-2026. Offshore installation was scheduled to be completed in mid-February, according to an affidavit from Paul Murphy, senior engineering procurement and construction director for the project.

Then, three days before Christmas, a new edict from the Trump administration ordered work to stop again on Revolution Wind and four other offshore wind projects along the Atlantic coast. The second, 90-day pause again rested on national security concerns, despite the rigorous review already dubbed complete by the same federal energy agencies years before.

Orsted A/S, the Danish renewable energy giant co-developing Revolution Wind, initially offered a veiled response to the second stop work order. But the hundreds of pages filed in D.C. federal court in the first two days of the year reveal a more forceful fight.

“The Second Stop Work Order is arbitrary and capricious: It is wholly conclusory, internally inconsistent, and overbroad,” states one of the new legal filings, submitted on Jan. 1. “The Second Stop Work Order ignores that the [Department of] Interior has stated plainly that the Project does not interfere with national security. It also ignores Revolution Wind’s obvious and substantial actions and billions of dollars of investment made in reliance.”

Since work resumed in mid-September, developers have finished installing the foundations that anchor the turbines to the sea floor, along with 58 of the 65 turbines, and “substantial completion” of the underwater cables that will connect the wind-powered electricity to the regional grid, according to court filings. Developers now estimate the project is 87% completed — up from 80% in mid-August.

With every day the pause continues, the losses pile up. The companies estimate they are losing $1.44 million a day on already inked contracts with specialty vessels meant to carry heavy equipment and workers out to sea. If the pause is not lifted by Jan. 12, there is a “very high risk” the vessels will no longer be available and the remaining turbines will not be installed by the mandated Jan. 15, 2027 deadline to supply power to Rhode Island, the court filings state.

The development companies are seeking a second preliminary injunction to stop the Trump administration from suspending work on the project, and have also asked to speed up the deliberations.

Royce C. Lamberth, senior judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, agreed to the second request. His Jan. 2 order gives the Department of Justice attorneys representing the federal administration until Thursday, Jan. 8, to submit a response. An in-person hearing in Lamberth’s D.C. courtroom is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Monday, Jan. 12, according to the court docket.

What’s at stake in R.I.

Beyond the $6 billion loss projected by project developers if the project is canceled or left incomplete are the consequences for Rhode Island and Connecticut. On Friday, state and congressional leaders, labor organizers and environmental advocates organized a press conference and rally in downtown Providence to demonstrate their support for the project.

“Rhode Island has built national leadership in offshore wind by doing the hard work and delivering real results,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement following the event. “These projects are essential to keeping energy affordable, creating long-term jobs, strengthening our economy, and meeting our climate goals. We remain committed to an energy future that works for Rhode Island’s workers, families, and businesses.”

More than 2,000 workers, many of them union laborers, have staked their careers on the burgeoning offshore wind industry, aided by specialty training programs including at the Community College of Rhode Island. Since the second stop work order was issued, 200 workers were put on standby for off- and onshore work, according to an affidavit from Melanie Gearon, head of permitting for the project.

“Just days before the holidays, this administration chose to put thousands of skilled construction workers in limbo – again,” said Michael F. Sabitoni, general secretary-treasurer of the local chapter of the Laborers’ International Union of North America and president of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council. “These are men and women who were counting on this work to support their families and keep food on the table. Offshore wind means union jobs, strong wages, and real economic security. Pulling the plug at the end of the year is reckless and deeply unfair to working families.”

The Ocean State’s ambitious decarbonization mandate, reaching net-zero by 2050, also hinges upon the project’s completion and power for up to 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut. Even states without direct contracts to buy power from the project stand to benefit from a regional electric grid better shielded from the seasonal fluctuations in natural gas prices and availability.

“Stopping these projects ignores both climate science and public support for these projects, and it delays the clean energy transition our communities are counting on,” said Jeff Migneault, executive director of Climate Action Rhode Island.

The press conference and rally also featured remarks from U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo.

The states’ stakes in the project were the focus of a second federal lawsuit filed by Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general in August. The AGs case was originally filed in Rhode Island federal court, but transferred to D.C. in December, less than two weeks before the second stop work order. No new submissions have been filed in the AGs court case since the latest move by the Trump administration to halt the project, though Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said previously that his office was reviewing the suspension order.

A second Orsted project, Sunrise Wind, under construction off the coast of Long Island, New York, was also subject to the December stop work order. Orsted said in a statement on Jan. 1 that it is still evaluating options for this project, including possible legal proceedings.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/607435144_122233792580119380_6578483255360854123_n.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 14:12:48.295881

""If solid state batteries technology comes online with proven, tested results, [this] would be a game changer for EVs!""","A new partnership in battery manufacturing could help push electric vehicles closer to a long-promised breakthrough — and make EVs more practical, affordable, and appealing for everyday drivers.

Electrek reported that U.S.-based Factorial Energy and South Korea's POSCO announced a collaboration at the Future Battery Forum in Berlin aimed at accelerating the development of all-solid-state batteries, a next-generation technology often described as the ""holy grail"" of EV power.

Unlike today's lithium-ion batteries, which rely on liquid electrolytes, solid-state batteries use solid materials that can store more energy, charge faster, and reduce fire risk.

The biggest challenge holding solid-state batteries back has been materials. Researchers have struggled to find solid electrolytes that conduct electricity efficiently without cracking under stress.

Under the new agreement, Factorial and POSCO will combine their expertise to develop and scale those critical materials, including lithium-metal anodes and sulfide-based solid electrolytes.

""Solid-state batteries are entering a new era of commercial readiness,"" Factorial CEO Siyu Huang said, per Electrek, noting that the partnership could also help drive down costs at scale — a key hurdle for widespread adoption.

Solid-state batteries could deliver driving ranges over 600 miles, faster charging times, and longer battery lifespans.

Factorial has already demonstrated the tech outside the lab: Mercedes-Benz tested a solid-state-powered EQS that drove 750 miles from Stuttgart to Malmö and still had range left.

As the publication noted, Mercedes' tech chief Markus Schäfer called the batteries ""a true gamechanger for electric mobility,"" emphasizing that they now perform ""not only in the lab but also on the road.""

For drivers, this technology could mean fewer charging stops, lower long-term maintenance costs, and safer vehicles. On a broader scale, better batteries help speed the shift away from gas-powered cars, cutting tailpipe pollution that harms air quality and human health.

Pairing an EV with home solar can compound those benefits by reducing or even eliminating charging costs. Tools like TCD's Solar Explorer can help homeowners see how installing solar panels might lower energy bills while making clean transportation even more affordable.

Many commenters were excited about the announcement.

""If solid state batteries technology comes online with proven, tested results, [this] would be a game changer for EVs!"" one wrote.

Another added: ""The article just scratches the surface of the battery tech and potential applications; by pushing for greater energy density, the packs could be much smaller/lighter (and more affordable) for a 300-mile range EV, or scaled up for tractor trailer loads.

Yet there were also developments to celebrate, including record deployment of battery storage systems, historic power generation shares from solar farms in dozens of countries, and continued growth in electric vehicle sales in key car markets. Below are some of the key milestones and developments impacting global energy transition progress in 2025, as well as key data points to track heading into 2026 and beyond.

China’s growing clean clout

China remains at the forefront of clean energy generation, and deploys more nuclear, solar, wind and bioenergy power than any other nation. Clean electricity production is on track to record its seventh consecutive year of strong growth. Over the first 11 months of 2025, total clean power output rose 15.4 percent from a year earlier, Ember data shows.

Clean power sources will generate more than 40 percent of China’s utility-supplied electricity for the first time in 2025, while fossil fuels’ share will drop to a record low.

Fossil fuels remain the primary pillar of China’s power system, but since 2019 clean power output has grown more than four times faster than fossil-fuel generation. With Beijing set to keep expanding its solar, wind, nuclear and battery power capacity over the coming decade or so, clean power’s share in China’s generation mix is likely to keep climbing.

China is also making its mark overseas via record clean-technology exports, which climbed to more than $180 billion over the first 10 months of 2025, according to customs data compiled by Ember.

Battery storage systems have emerged as China’s most lucrative clean-tech export, with nearly $66 billion in sales, followed by around $54 billion in EV exports. Exports of grid equipment and heating and cooling units have also hit record highs in 2025, cementing China’s role as the dominant supplier of hardware for the world’s electrification push.

US setback

In contrast to China’s momentum, US clean energy progress hit reverse in 2025 after federal support for renewables was scrapped under the second administration of US President Donald Trump. Steep cuts to tax credits for power developers are expected to slash clean energy investments in coming years and leave the US power system heavily dependent on fossil fuels.

Natural gas remains the main source for US electricity, but in 2025, coal-fired plants delivered the biggest jump in output, driven largely by a spike in gas prices that squeezed utility margins. Coal-fired electricity output from January to November increased 13 percent from a year earlier, its highest in three years, according to Ember.

Because coal plants emit far more carbon dioxide than gas plants - over 900,000 metric tons of CO2 per terawatt hour versus about 550,000 tons for gas - US power-sector emissions also climbed in 2025.

Total emissions from coal and gas plants reached 1.526 billion metric tons of CO2 from January to November, up 3 percent from the same period in 2024 and the highest since 2021, Ember data shows. Given that US natural gas prices look set to finish 2025 at roughly 50 percent above their 2024 average, utilities are likely to lean further on cheaper coal to meet winter demand. That means even higher power-sector pollution heading into 2026 and beyond.

Battery boom and stealthy progress

Even as US utilities burned more coal in 2025, they also rolled out record battery storage capacity to capture surplus solar and wind power for later use. Total US installed battery storage capacity surpassed 39 gigawatts in 2025, a 43 percent increase from 2024, according to energy data portal Cleanview.

That surge is reshaping power flows in key electricity networks. Both California and Texas have added enough battery capacity to materially alter their power grid’s generation mix during peak demand. The California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the state’s main grid and the country’s largest battery adopter, uses batteries to supply around 15 percent to 18 percent of electricity during the evening peak demand, according to Grid Status data, reducing the need for gas and other power sources. In the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a more recent adopter of battery systems, around 3 percent of electricity during peak demand was supplied from battery storage systems - a modest share but up from near zero just a year ago.

Solar power systems have also made their mark again in 2025, generating record shares of utility electricity supplies in several countries.

China and the US typically dominate discussions about solar capacity, but solar’s widespread penetration in recent years now means that developed and emerging economies alike deploy the technology at scale. At times in 2025, countries such as Bulgaria, Pakistan, Hungary and Poland sourced around 20 percent or more of their electricity from solar farms, cutting both costs and emissions.

In 2026, solar’s generation share will likely set new records in even more countries, helping to keep global energy transition momentum alive even if some major economies, such as the US, step back. — Reuters",https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2026/01/04/342745.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 13:12:47.501777

Carolina Journal

As 2025 comes to a close, North Carolina stands in an enviable position. After more than a decade of disciplined tax reform, the Tar Heel State has emerged as one of America’s most economically competitive states. CNBC’s America’s Top States for Business rankings once again place North Carolina among the nation’s leaders, confirming what employers and investors already know: North Carolina is a premier place to invest, expand and create jobs.

That reputation is reinforced by the Tax Foundation’s 2026 State Tax Competitiveness Index, which ranks North Carolina 13th overall — up from 44th as recently as 2013 — ahead of most states that levy all the major taxes and near the top nationally on corporate taxation. This strong showing is no accident. It reflects a flat 4.25 percent individual income tax, the lowest corporate income tax rate among states that still levy one at 2.25 percent, and a sustained commitment to broad tax bases and low rates rather than politically favored credits.

Yet even the Tax Foundation is clear: North Carolina’s biggest remaining obstacle to greater competitiveness is its franchise tax.

What makes the franchise tax different — and harmful

Unlike income-based taxes, the franchise tax is levied on a business’s net worth — its accumulated capital — regardless of whether the business is profitable. Companies pay it year after year simply for owning assets, even in downturns or startup phases. In effect, the tax penalizes investment itself, taxing firms not on what they earn but on what they have built.

The Tax Foundation’s North Carolina profile does not mince words. It calls the franchise tax “unusually aggressive,” noting that it taxes businesses “on their worth rather than their profits,” harming investment and violating basic principles of tax fairness and ability to pay. In a state otherwise defined by pro-growth tax policy, the franchise tax stands out as an anachronism.

Real costs for real businesses

This problem is not theoretical. A 2024 John Locke Foundation report shows that the franchise tax creates especially high compliance costs due to its complexity and traps small businesses and independent contractors in mandatory minimum payments. The burden falls especially hard on mom-and-pop businesses, such as a local plumbing company with fewer than 20 employees that owns a small fleet of work vans. Even in a slow year, that firm owes the franchise tax simply for having invested in the vehicles and equipment it needs to operate — penalizing small businesses not for profits, but for preparedness. The same analysis shows that the tax exposes companies to punitive audits over technical errors rather than real tax avoidance, and that businesses can owe the tax even if they lose money — or even if they have no physical presence in North Carolina, so long as they sell goods here.

And for all that damage, the franchise tax contributes little to state finances. In recent years, it has accounted for just over 2 percent of General Fund revenue, a share that is shrinking further due to recently enacted caps. That is a steep economic price to pay for such a modest and declining return.

That reality leads to the most common objection to repeal — and the least persuasive.

The revenue objection — and why it falls short

Critics will argue that repeal is impractical because the franchise tax still generates revenue. But that objection misunderstands both scale and trade-offs. The amount involved is small enough to absorb through normal economic growth, ongoing budget surpluses or modest base broadening elsewhere. More importantly, repealing the franchise tax would remove a direct penalty on capital investment, encouraging business expansion that broadens the income and sales tax bases over time. In other words, repeal is not a gamble on growth — it is an exchange of a narrow, distortionary tax for a broader, more sustainable revenue stream.

Other states have recognized this reality. Oklahoma repealed its capital stock tax. Mississippi is phasing its out. Connecticut is completing its repeal. Louisiana has already enacted repeal as part of a broader competitiveness package — and the Tax Foundation expects that move alone to produce meaningful improvements in Louisiana’s rankings and investment climate. Meanwhile, North Carolina risks being left behind, clinging to a tax most states have already abandoned.

What makes this moment especially important is that North Carolina has already done the hard work. The state has resisted the temptation to rely on narrow tax credits and instead built a system based on low rates and neutrality. That approach is precisely why North Carolina ranks so highly among states that levy all major taxes. Eliminating the franchise tax would not be a radical departure — it would be the logical completion of a long-running reform agenda.

A clear next step for 2026

If lawmakers want a single, concrete goal for strengthening North Carolina’s economy in 2026, this is it. Repeal the franchise tax. Remove the last major tax penalty on capital formation. Signal to entrepreneurs, manufacturers and employers that North Carolina will not tax them for growing, investing or weathering hard times.

North Carolina has become a national model by refusing to settle for “good enough.” Ending the franchise tax would ensure it remains one.",https://www.salisburypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Salisbury-Post.png,N,,2026-01-04 15:58:24.127486

With so much misinformation circulating about the economics of energy, one climate expert is cutting through the noise with the facts.

Former U.S. climate negotiator Lia Newman (@liaandtheworld) recently posted a TikTok debunking the claim that increasing fossil fuel usage boosts a region's GDP, in turn providing economic stability and lower poverty rates.

This claim was recently amplified in a video from The Free Press and former climate activist Lucy Biggers, which featured graphs suggesting a link between dirty energy use and increased income.

Debunking these graphs, Newman explained that they were created by fossil fuel advocate Alex Epstein, showing a clear agenda behind their framing. Addressing these claims, Newman cited a well-known scientific adage: ""Correlation is not causation.""

""This 'fossil [fuels] equals development' myth is outdated and misleading,"" Newman wrote in a caption to her video.

Newman clarified that fossil fuels themselves aren't pulling people out of poverty, despite what the graphs imply. Instead, it's what dirty energy usage represents — industrial, manufacturing, and job growth.

But that relationship is changing. Clean energy is reshaping manufacturing and industrial sectors, proving that countries can build booming economies without relying on high-pollution pathways.

Newman pointed to the rapid expansion of the clean energy sector in China and India as evidence that renewables can drive economic growth just as effectively as dirty energy sources. ​​She added that while total emissions are still rising in many countries, emissions intensity — the amount of pollution produced per unit of GDP — has been steadily falling, meaning economies are generating more value with less pollution than before.

""This shows a decoupling that, although GDP can rise, emissions or emission intensity can drop,"" Newman said.

That trend is already happening in several countries. As Newman outlined, GDP is continuing to rise while dirty energy emissions drop in the U.S., the European Union, Japan, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. There is also already divergence in GDP and dirty energy emissions in China, India, Africa, and Latin America. Newman said this divergence shows that economic growth no longer has to be tied to rising pollution.

""This video presents a false choice — development or tackling emissions — which is just not true,"" Newman said, referencing the video by The Free Press. ""Don't be fooled by these points promoted by the fossil fuel industry.""

In an era when misinformation spreads quickly, many of Newman's viewers said they appreciated seeing the claims fact-checked in real time.

By Gordon Anderson | gordon@rantnc.com

If you’re new to Lee County, fracking might not be a term you’ve heard a whole lot of in the context of local politics. But there was a time not long ago when fracking — shorthand for hydraulic fracturing, a method used to release natural gas and other resources by injecting high-pressure fluid into underground rock formations — was a hot topic both across the state and in the general area.

Lee and Chatham counties sit atop shale gas deposits identified by state geologists, and for much of the early 2010s, there was a contingent both locally and in the state capitol working to allow those with mineral rights in the area to get to it. Proponents said it would create new wealth, new economic activity and a clean burning energy source right here at home.

Detractors, however, pointed to reports of environmental harm in places like Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, where fracking has been undertaken on a large scale. There were widely circulated reports at the time of contaminated water — including claims of flammable tap water. Even earthquakes have been tentatively linked to fracking. Also, mineral rights are often severed from land rights, meaning one can theoretically have the right to access natural gas that’s beneath land that isn’t theirs.

There’s not enough space to rehash that debate in its entirety, but it had gone mostly quiet by the turn of the 2020s. Lee County was under a locally-passed fracking moratorium through the last half of the 2010s, but even after it expired, there’s been no commercial hydraulic fracturing here or elsewhere in North Carolina outside of test and exploratory wells.

But the debate about fracking, it seems, wasn’t over. Just dormant.

Deep River Data and the Butler Well

Things came spilling back into the public on Nov. 1, when Inside Climate News published a report indicating Alamance County-based company Deep River Data wanted to access natural gas from Butler Well No. 3, which is situated in the woods between U.S. 421 and Cumnock Road near the Lee-Chatham County line and use it to power a data center for artificial intelligence here.

The story identified Deep River Data as having “connections with the cryptocurrency industry” and detailed connections its officers have both in business and government.

“Company adviser Dan Spuller, who is both a crypto entrepreneur and a natural gas landman, contacted the state Oil & Gas Commission in September about applying for a drilling unit, a parcel of land where drilling would occur,” the story read. “He said the natural gas would be for a data center to power ‘AI workloads,’ not crypto mining. Both applications are energy-intensive, running server farms around the clock to power streams of computer computations.”

The ICN piece reports Spuller writing “we want to submit a packet that is complete on first impression — avoiding delays and making the Commission’s review as straightforward as possible.”

The news spread quickly – the article and others like it were shared on social media, often with calls to action attached. In December, that action spilled off of the internet and into real life. At meetings of the Sanford City Council (Dec. 2) and the Lee County Board of Commissioners (Dec. 15) nearly 20 people addressed the two boards, urging both to put a stop to the idea as quickly as possible.

Although Spuller is quoted in the Inside Climate News piece as saying Deep River Data plans to use “conventional drilling, rather than fracking,” those who appeared before local governing boards in December unanimously asked for moratoriums to be enacted on both data centers and fracking.

Community concerns

“Sanford has a large population of residents that would be harmed by fracking,” area resident Keely Puricz told the city council on Dec. 2, holding up a map of the area surrounding Butler Well No. 3. “I’m speaking before it’s too late. The risk of using an antiquated well in itself is frightening. This well has not had regular inspections … and at recent meetings of the Oil & Gas Commission, the (Department of Environmental Quality) admitted they only had one employee to review the rules versus the four or five they had 10 years ago.”

Sam Kauffman told the council he’s originally from Oklahoma, and “grew up during the oil and gas boom.”

“I’ve seen the wells, I’ve seen the fracking — it’s not worth it,” he said. “You’ll end up in an Erin Brokovich situation where pollution is inevitable.

“It’s not if, it’s when.”

The county Board of Commissioners heard more of the same less than two weeks later.

“I know this will be a great monetary gain for the man that’s interested in having this in our county,” Christine Morgan told the commissioners on Dec. 15. “But we all deserve to have clean air and clean water. I feel like that’s our right. God made the planet one way, and we have done enough in our destructive selves.”

Jennifer Garner told the commissioners she was born and raised in Sanford, and had “moved away a couple times.”

“Every time I came back I’d see the growth and the revitalization that’s been done in my favorite city and my favorite downtown,” she said. “It seems like a gross, counterproductive measure to put all that into our community just to destroy it, just to open the literal floodgates of contamination that would be brought by frackinig.”

The message was clear: There’s at least a part of the Lee County community that’s not only adamantly opposed to fracking, but also data centers in general, and they’re not afraid to show up and talk about it.

Permits, utilities and regulatory reality

There’s a wrinkle to the concern over drilling for AI in Lee County. Not a single permit has been requested for any of the things outlined in the Nov. 1 story — not at the state level or the local level.

Not to cast doubt on the ICN piece, which is sourced from emails received under a request for public information. There’s no reason to doubt those are real or that Deep River Data has at least explored the idea it described. But potential moratoriums aside, there’s nothing for local government to do right now with regards to the rumored project, because nobody’s asked for anything. At least not on paper, according to Kirk Smith, Republican chairman for the Lee County Board of Commissioners.

“There are no permit requests before the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality to access the natural gas in Lee County nor the Butler #3 gas well,” Smith told The Rant via email in December. “There are no permit requests for a drill pad nor for an access road with the NC DOT. There are no permit requests for extraction and the ultimate closing of the well. The Lee County Technical Review Committee has not received any plans for a proposed data center nor has the Sanford Area Growth Alliance received any Requests for Information with the intent of establishing a data center. The Lee County Joint Planning Commission gave instructions for the staff to research possible modifications to the Unified Development Ordinance addressing data centers.”

Further, utilities are increasingly wary of data centers — they use an inordinate amount of power after all, and companies like Duke Energy are more regularly asking for sizable, up front monetary commitments from those who want to operate one. It’s possible the rumored project would be powered by a private, onsite power plant of its own, but that would still require approval from Duke for interconnection and backup service. So, nowhere near impossible, but not as simple as it sounds either.

Smith’s statement could be seen as cold water thrown on the idea of drilling for natural gas at Butler No. 3 and using it to power a data center. But Smith also threw cold water on the idea of any kind of moratorium on fracking and/or data centers.

“The demand to establish a moratorium thus blocking land owners from generating wealth from their property, is on its face dictatorial and rooted in an authoritarian regime most associated with Marxists,” he wrote. “While on the subject, recent hearings in the U.S. Congress reveal the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is funding environmental groups opposing ‘data centers.’

“The CCP is home to cheap and plentiful electricity generated by coal fired electrical plants (do you recall the air pollution leading up to the Beijing Olympics?). What better way for China to lead and dominate the Artificial Intelligence industry. Our Constitutional purpose as a governing body is to ‘Protect Life, Liberty, and Property Rights.’ Any moratorium violates that fundamental purpose of our Constitutional Republic protecting property rights.”

However, local fracking moratoriums in North Carolina aren’t explicitly bans on the practices — they’re temporary pauses that allow governments to review potential impacts. The state retains ultimate regulatory authority.

Data centers: A separate but linked debate

Jimmy Randolph, CEO of the Sanford Area Growth Alliance — a public-private partnership that houses the area chamber of commerce as well as the county’s economic development operation — similarly said he hasn’t heard much, if any, credible talk about the project. He was careful to distinguish the issues opponents are raising from one another.

“There’s a conversation to be had about data centers and the benefits and utility they may be able to provide to communities like ours. The right data center project could absolutely be a positive for Sanford and Lee County. Fracking is an entirely separate conversation with concerns and questions that are unique to that issue,” he said. “That being said, SAGA has not received or been asked to provide any information about the specific project referenced in recent media reports and in front of the city council and the county commissioners, so it would be inappropriate to speculate.”

The debate over data centers includes controversies of its own — controversies which are separate from the debate over fracking. They’ve been shown to bring increased tax revenue and some number of jobs, although nowhere near the number a more traditional industry might offer. But there have also been concerns about water usage and other environmental concerns (for his part, Smith disputed entirely the idea that data centers “consume enormous amounts of water,” calling the idea “fear mongering”).

So it’s not surprising that news reports are common lately which describe local governments proposing and enacting standards surrounding data centers.

A recent piece in the Midland Daily News in Texas described efforts by the government of Bay City, Texas (population of around 18,000) to look at concerns like “maximum facility size and acreage of the site; power demand threshold and utility capacity review, water usage limits and cooling method requirements; noise, lighting, buffering and setback standards; site location criteria and zoning compatibility; phased development and expansion limitations; emergency response, resiliency and decommissioning plans; and community benefit and infrastructure impact considerations.”

North Carolina law does allow local governments to regulate land use through zoning and other methods, making standards similar to those being explored in Bay City theory possible.

What comes next?

It’s too early for alarm or worry about Lee County’s potential role in the country’s AI boom. There’s too much that nobody knows at this point. Data centers and fracking are separate issues, but both have sparked local debate about environmental impacts, utility use and community standards. Those addressing local governments over the matter have the right idea — they’re making their stance known now while the issue gathers on horizon, instead of waiting for it unpack its bags.

Puricz, who spoke before both the city on Dec. 2, told the Board of Commissioners on Dec. 15 about recent fracking activity in Pennsylvania and cited a data center moratorium in Wisconsin that allowed “local government to develop suitable ordinances regulating an industry’s activities.”

“Since Dec. 4, one (Pennsylvania fracking) company had 360,000 gallons of drilling fluid lost into the local coal pockets,” she said.

Another speaker before the county commissioners on Dec. 15 was Debbie Hall, who acknowledged that no applications have been filed. “You know and we all know that the wheels are turning,” she said. “Drilling, fracking and data centers are linked to many hazards. You are the people that can help us, and we’re asking you to do that.”

This issue isn’t likely to go away anytime soon, regardless of what happens with the rumored project that kicked off what appears to be a revival in local anti fracking activity. More is coming in the weeks, months and years ahead. The Lee County Board of Commissioners as of this writing is scheduled to meet on Jan. 5, which is The Rant Monthly’s publication date. Clean Water for NC, a state based water advocacy group, published a blog on Dec. 17 urging interested parties to attend and ask for a moratorium on fracking and data centers.",https://i0.wp.com/rantnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/datafarm3.jpg?fit=1200%2C879&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-04 15:58:33.998575

The Green Fee increases the Transient Accommodations Tax by 0.75 percent to an 11 percent rate statewide. This fee will be applied to costs for tourism-related activities including hotels and short-term rentals. But on New Year’s Eve, a federal judge blocked one portion of the law from taking effect: specifically, the portion that would have introduced an 11 percent tax on cruise ship passenger bills.

That provision had faced pushback from the cruise industry earlier this year.

Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) sued the state in August, arguing the fee unfairly targets cruise passengers and will add hundreds of dollars to the price of Hawaii cruises. And in November, the U.S. Department of Justice also filed a motion in the Hawaii District Court asking a federal judge to let the federal government intervene in the cruise industry’s lawsuit against the Green Fee. The DOJ has argued that Hawaii doesn’t have the power the charge cruise ships this kind of fee, saying only Congress can approve taxes and charges on vessels when they enter a port.

A district judge denied CLIA’s request for an injunction in December, court documents show. But on Dec. 31, the Ninth Appellate Court granted an injunction after an appeal.

The CLIA applauded the decision in a statement shared with Nexstar.

“This case involves important questions about how federal and state laws interact in regulating maritime commerce — principles rooted in long-standing constitutional safeguards that protect free and open ports nationwide,” reads a statement from a CLIA spokesperson. “On behalf of its member cruise lines, CLIA will continue to pursue this matter constructively through the courts while working with Hawai‘i to support local communities and sustainable tourism.”

Hawaii Gov. Josh Green (D) and other lawmakers in support of the Green Fee had argued that the taxes were needed to mitigate environmental effects caused by tourism.

The revenue generated from the new Green Fee was projected to raise an estimated $100 million a year to address what the state says is about half a billion dollars in critical funding needed to protect Hawaii’s environment. The areas of priority are protecting land and aquatic resources, climate and hazard resiliency and sustainable tourism.

“We must protect and preserve Hawaiʻi’s natural resources and safeguard the health of our residents,” Green previously said. “Visitors who benefit from our island’s resources have a shared responsibility to help preserve them. The Green Fee ensures that the resources needed to protect Hawaiʻi are available for future generations.”

Toni Schwartz, a spokesperson for the Hawaii attorney general’s office, believes it’s only a matter of time before the entire Green Fee is enforced.

“We are aware of the Ninth Circuit’s order granting an injunction that temporarily enjoins (halts) enforcement of Act 96 with respect to cruise ships while the appeals process moves forward,” Schwartz said in a statement shared with Nexstar’s KHON. “We remain confident that Act 96 is lawful and will be vindicated when the expedited appeal is heard on the merits.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/GettyImages-637168124-e1718985154555.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-04 12:12:28.472989

The energy industry will be abuzz with activity in South Carolina as two major developments unfold this year.

The most immediate is a proposal by Santee Cooper and Dominion Energy to construct a large natural-gas fired power plant in Colleton County that's roughly doubled in price since a 2023 cost estimate.

The utilities submitted their paperwork last month with the S.C. Public Service Commission, kicking off a six-month review process.

The first formal hearing for the $5 billion project is set for March 12 in Columbia — and opposition from environmental groups is expected.

Regulators must issue a decision by June 12.

Around the same time, Santee Cooper will have a clearer picture about whether its plan to sell the two unfinished reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant will advance.

The $2.7 billion deal was announced in October. Last month, the state-owned power provider signed a ""memorandum of understanding"" with global investment giant Brookfield Asset Management to continue negotiations and refine the terms of the sale that would likely close in 2027.

The agreement expires June 26, but it could be extended beyond that date. It also could be squelched if Brookfield decides to take a pass on the Midland reactors.

Check-in time

A long-awaited luxury hotel offering panoramic views of Charleston Harbor and the peninsula will soon make its debut in 2026 after years of delays.

The Cooper is scheduled to open on March 1.

The 191-room property next to Waterfront Park will offer a spa, four dining concepts, luxury retail shops, a private marina and other amenities.

The high-end Concord Street project has been on the drawing board since 2017. Los Angeles-based developer Lowe broke ground about six years ago at the site of the former State Ports Authority headquarters.

BHC, once known as Beemok Hospitality Collection and owned by Charleston business mogul Ben Navarro and his family, became the majority owner in 2021 and took about two years to put its stamp on the design plans.

Dockside dealings

The fate of a structurally unsound 1970s-era condominium tower along Charleston Harbor could be determined this year after the property’s governing board took a decisive move to line up a buyer.

Dockside Association Inc. closed out 2025 by seeking bankruptcy protection on Dec. 29. The filing keeps creditors at bay while putting all litigation on hold.

The end goal is to solicit as many would-be buyers as possible to bid on the 3.3-acre property at a court-supervised auction. It could be one of the most memorable local real estate transactions in recent memory.

""The board’s priority remains to secure the best possible outcome for all of Dockside’s 100+ owners, many of whom are already facing significant financial hardship, and we believe seeking this relief is the most expedient and effective path forward,” the association said in a written statement last month.

Residents were forced to evacuate the 18-story high-rise and adjacent ground-level townhomes in February. The owners later voted down a repair plan that would have cost them about $150 million.

Step it up

Two of the region's largest blue-chip manufacturers will be making moves to accelerate their assembly lines this year.

Boeing South Carolina is aiming to crank out 10 787 Dreamliners each month at its North Charleston factory by late 2026 to meet what it called ""exceptional demand"" for the widebody.

The company recently raised the monthly output rate at the local factory to eight jets, a new high for the plant.

Boeing watchers have speculated that the aerospace giant could one day be rolling out anywhere from 12 to 16 new 787s every four weeks after a second assembly line is completed in 2028.

Meanwhile, Volvo Cars will start building its top-selling XC60 at its underutilized Ridgeville plant to jumpstart U.S. sales and reduce exposure to new tariffs on overseas-made cars.

Production of two versions of the electric-gas hybrid now made in Sweden is expected to begin in Berkeley County by late 2026. They'll be built alongside the sluggish-selling all-electric EX90 and another EV that made for Sweden’s Polestar brand.

Volvo said it also plans to add a fourth model to its local lineup but no details beyond it being a yet-to-be named hybrid have been released.

Data center opposition dominates local politics Winning over local officials, however, hasn't translated to winning over residents.","SPRING CITY, Pa., Jan. 4, 2026 (AP) — Tech companies and developers looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly losing fights in communities where people don’t want to live next to them, or even near them.

Communities across the United States are reading about — and learning from — each other's battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources.

In many cases, municipal boards are trying to figure out whether energy- and water-hungry data centers fit into their zoning framework. Some have entertained waivers or tried to write new ordinances. Some don’t have zoning.

But as more people hear about a data center coming to their community, once-sleepy municipal board meetings in farming towns and growing suburbs now feature crowded rooms of angry residents pressuring local officials to reject the requests.

“Would you want this built in your backyard?” Larry Shank asked supervisors last month in Pennsylvania's East Vincent Township. “Because that’s where it’s literally going, is in my backyard.”

Opposition spreads as data centers fan out

A growing number of proposals are going down in defeat, sounding alarms across the data center constellation of Big Tech firms, real estate developers, electric utilities, labor unions and more.

Andy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL, counted seven or eight deals he’d worked on in recent months that saw opponents going door-to-door, handing out shirts or putting signs in people’s yards.

“It’s becoming a huge problem,” Cvengros said.

Data Center Watch, a project of 10a Labs, an AI security consultancy, said it is seeing a sharp escalation in community, political and regulatory disruptions to data center development.

Between April and June alone, its latest reporting period, it counted 20 proposals valued at $98 billion in 11 states that were blocked or delayed amid local opposition and state-level pushback. That amounts to two-thirds of the projects it was tracking.

Some environmental and consumer advocacy groups say they’re fielding calls every day, and are working to educate communities on how to protect themselves.

“I’ve been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I’d guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I’ve ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson of the Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition.

In Indiana alone, Gustafson counted more than a dozen projects that lost rezoning petitions.

Similar concerns across different communities

For some people angry over steep increases in electric bills, their patience is thin for data centers that could bring still-higher increases.

Losing open space, farmland, forest or rural character is a big concern. So is the damage to quality of life, property values or health by on-site diesel generators kicking on or the constant hum of servers. Others worry that wells and aquifers could run dry.

Lawsuits are flying — both ways — over whether local governments violated their own rules.

Big Tech firms Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook — which are collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers across the globe — didn’t answer Associated Press questions about the effect of community pushback.

Microsoft, however, has acknowledged the difficulties. In an October securities filing, it listed its operational risks as including “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development.”

Even with high-level support from state and federal governments, the pushback is having an impact.

Maxx Kossof, vice president of investment at Chicago-based developer The Missner Group, said developers worried about losing a zoning fight are considering selling properties once they secure a power source — a highly sought-after commodity that makes a proposal far more viable and valuable.

“You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. “The thing is you could have power to a site and it’s futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.”

Some in the industry are frustrated, saying opponents are spreading falsehoods about data centers — such as polluting water and air — and are difficult to overcome.

Still, data center allies say they are urging developers to engage with the public earlier in the process, emphasize economic benefits, sow good will by supporting community initiatives and talk up efforts to conserve water and power and protect ratepayers.

“It's definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, ‘Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?’” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition, a trade association that includes Big Tech firms and developers.

Data center opposition dominates local politics

Winning over local officials, however, hasn't translated to winning over residents.

Developers pulled a project off an October agenda in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina, after Mayor John Higdon said he informed them it faced unanimous defeat.

The project would have funded half the city’s budget and developers promised environmentally friendly features. But town meetings overflowed, and emails, texts and phone calls were overwhelmingly opposed, “999 to one against,” Higdon said.

Had council approved it, “every person that voted for it would no longer be in office,” the mayor said. “That's for sure.”

In Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, a proposed data center campus several times larger than the Mall of America is on hold amid challenges over whether the city’s environmental review was adequate.

Residents found each other through social media and, from there, learned to organize, protest, door-knock and get their message out.

They say they felt betrayed and lied to when they discovered that state, county, city and utility officials knew about the proposal for an entire year before the city — responding to a public records request filed by the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy — released internal emails that confirmed it.

“It’s the secrecy. The secrecy just drives people crazy,” said Jonathan Thornton, a realtor who lives across a road from the site.

Documents revealing the extent of the project emerged days before a city rezoning vote in October. Mortenson, which is developing it for a Fortune 50 company that it hasn't named, says it is considering changes based on public feedback and that “more engagement with the community is appropriate.""

Rebecca Gramdorf found out about it from a Duluth newspaper article, and immediately worried that it would spell the end of her six-acre vegetable farm.

She found other opponents online, ordered 100 yard signs and prepared for a struggle.

“I don’t think this fight is over at all,” Gramdorf said.

The program targets fleet-focused customers such as security operations, municipalities, campuses, grounds maintenance teams and commercial facilities.

The fleet and commercial vehicle program focuses on organizations that need reliable electric utility vehicles for high-utilization, year-round operation. The initial product emphasis centers on Massimo’s newly introduced MVR HVAC electric vehicle series, the company said.

Fleet-Focused Product Differentiation

The MVR HVAC series features fully enclosed cabs with heating and air conditioning. This design improves operator comfort, productivity and reliability across varied climates and duty cycles.

Massimo positions the MVR platform as a differentiated solution for fleet customers that require consistent performance regardless of weather conditions. That capability is becoming increasingly important for public-sector and enterprise users.

The company expects the MVR HVAC lineup to play a central role in the fleet and commercial vehicle program. The vehicles support extended operating hours, reduced downtime and applications where operator comfort and safety are critical.

Go-To-Market Strategy

As part of the rollout, Massimo plans to engage directly with fleet and commercial customers. The strategy includes participation in national and regional trade shows, targeted outreach and dedicated fleet-focused sales efforts.

These initiatives aim to accelerate customer engagement and support pilot deployments. Massimo also plans to use the program to establish long-term relationships with procurement decision-makers.

The fleet and commercial vehicle program is designed as a scalable platform. It supports repeat purchasing, multi-unit deployments and longer vehicle lifecycles compared with traditional consumer retail sales.

Expansion of Massimo’s Growth Platform

“As we continue to evolve our business, fleet and commercial customers represent an important opportunity to expand Massimo’s addressable market and strengthen revenue diversification,” said David Shan, chief executive officer of Massimo Group. “The launch of our Fleet & Commercial Vehicle Program, supported by the MVR HVAC series, reflects our focus on practical innovation, disciplined execution, and building products that meet the real-world demands of professional users.”

Powerful total return potential Utilities expect to grow their earnings briskly in the coming years as they invest heavily to support surging power demand by AI data centers.","AI has the potential to be a powerful technology. However, access to power will be crucial to the technology's adoption in the future. AI data centers require significantly more electricity compared to those handling traditional workloads due to the specialized chips and cooling systems needed to keep these facilities running at full capacity 24 hours a day, every single day.

As a result, utilities could be big winners in the AI age. They should have considerable opportunities to invest capital into expanding their power generation capacity and the related infrastructure to support their expanded operations. That should empower them to grow their earnings and dividends at faster rates in the future, enabling them to produce powerful total returns for their investors.

Here are some of the utilities in the best positions to cash in on the AI boom.

NextEra Energy

NextEra Energy (NEE +0.81%) operates the country's largest electric utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL). It distributes electricity to 12 million people across the state of Florida. Additionally, the company owns one of the country's largest energy infrastructure development companies (NextEra Energy Resources).

The state of Florida is in a strong position to capitalize on the AI data center boom. It has a state sales tax exemption for data centers over 100 megawatts. Meanwhile, FPL has the first and only approved large load tariff in the state. These catalysts should enable the utility to capitalize on growing power demand by data centers in Florida.

Meanwhile, NextEra Energy Resources should be an even bigger beneficiary of the AI power boom. The entity develops and operates a range of clean energy infrastructure, including natural gas pipelines, electricity transmission lines, and various forms of clean power generation capacity, such as natural gas, nuclear, and renewable energy. The company has a strategic relationship with Google to develop nuclear energy and data center campuses. These catalysts support NextEra Energy's view that it can grow its adjusted earnings per share at more than 8% annually over the next decade, while also continuing to increase its 2.8%-yielding dividend.

Dominion Energy

Dominion Energy (D +1.11%) provides regulated electricity services to 3.6 million homes and businesses in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The company's electric utility in Virginia will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom because the state is one of the world's largest data center markets. The utility has requests to supply 47.1 gigawatts (GW) of power to data centers in the state, a 17% increase over the past year.

The company is investing heavily to build out the necessary power generation capacity and related infrastructure to support the coming surge in power demand. Its current capital investment plan is $50 billion in the 2025 through 2029 time frame, with Dominion Energy Virginia seeing the bulk of that investment. Included in that capital is 50% of the costs to build the $11.2 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project that Dominion expects to complete in 2026.

Dominion Energy expects its current investment rate to support 5% to 7% annual earnings-per-share growth over the long term, based on 2025's level. The company plans to maintain its current dividend rate (4.5% yield) to allow its growing earnings to lower its dividend payout ratio. However, its dividend should rise with its earnings growth rate once it achieves its more conservative payout target.

Entergy

Entergy (ETR +1.55%) produces, transmits, and distributes electricity to 3 million customers across Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. It expects power demand in its operating areas to surge in the coming years, driven by a 13% to 14% compound annual growth rate from industrial customers, such as data centers.

For example, Meta Platforms is building a $10 billion AI data center in Northeast Louisiana, with power supplied by Entergy. The utility is constructing two new gas-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 1.5 GW to power the data center. Entergy secured gas supplies from pipeline giant Energy Transfer to provide fuel for these facilities and others.

Entergy plans to invest $41 billion between 2026 and 2029 on new power generation capacity and related infrastructure. Additionally, the company has signed power purchase agreements with third-party power producers to provide it with additional electricity. For example, NextEra Energy is developing up to 6.2 GW of renewable energy and storage capacity for Entergy over the next few years. These investments support Entergy's expectations that it can deliver more than 8% compound annual earnings-per-share growth through 2029. That should enable the utility to continue increasing its 2.8%-yielding dividend.

Powerful total return potential

Utilities expect to grow their earnings briskly in the coming years as they invest heavily to support surging power demand by AI data centers. When added to their dividend income, these stocks could generate strong total returns for investors in the future. That could make them the next big winners of the AI boom.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F846736%2Fa-person-wearing-a-hardhat-and-holding-a-laptop-near-a-power-line.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-04 12:58:05.982997

Stromnetz Berlin said there had been a similar attack on two power pylons in the city's southeast in September that was politically motivated.","Electricity has been restored to thousands of households in the southwest of the German capital, Berlin, after a power outage hit some 45,000 homes and 2,220 businesses on Saturday, the grid operator said on Sunday.

""By 3:23 a.m. (0223 UTC/GMT) on 4 January, we had been able to restore power to around 7,000 households and 150 businesses in several stages, particularly in the Lichterfelde area,"" Stromnetz Berlin announced on its website overnight.

Suspected malicious act

The partial restoration of power means that some 38,000 homes and more than 2,000 businesses remain without electricity in the district of Steglitz-Zehlendorf, with Stromnetz Berlin saying it could take until Thursday afternoon to remedy the problem completely.

The outage, which leaves many of those homes without heating, comes as the city is experiencing a bout of very cold winter weather.

The affected district contains several care homes and medical facilities. Emergency services have transferred residents from at least two homes for the elderly.

The loss of power was caused by a fire at a cable link over the Teltow Canal that police are investigating as a possible arson attack after a letter sent to authorities claimed responsibility.

A spokeswoman for Berlin's Senator for Economic Affairs Franziska Giffey said authorities believed that a malicious act was behind the fire.

The authenticity of the letter is being examined, but no group has been identified as a certain perpetrator so far.

However, Berlin's state leader, Mayor Kai Wegner of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), said the culprits were ""obviously left-wing extremists,"" whom he accused of endangering people's lives with their actions.

A Berlin police spokesman also said that it was ""credible"" that the letter was written by a left-wing extremist group calling itself the ""Vulkangruppe"" (Volcano Group), as the letter claimed.

He said, however, that the investigation was still ongoing.

Police call for better surveillance

The head of the Berlin branch of the GdP police union, Stephan Weh, called the attack ""senseless"" and without any legitimation, ""even if the suspected arsonists again throw together all sorts of hypocritical reasons in a pamphlet on the end of the world.""

He called for an ""unideological"" debate on video surveillance in view of the fact that so many thousands of people were affected.

""Cameras mounted on electricity poles could help investigations but also have a preventive effect. We do without protective technology in the public space just because some people cry out loudly and cite Orwell's '1984,'"" he said.

His words were echoed by Alexander Schirp, the director of the regional business associations in Berlin and Brandenburg (UVB).

""We are expecting damage costing millions to plants and machines and owing to high losses in revenue,"" he said, calling for better protection of infrastructure against attacks and accidents.

""This is a serious problem and stokes a feeling of insecurity in the business world,"" he said.

Stromnetz Berlin said there had been a similar attack on two power pylons in the city's southeast in September that was politically motivated.

We recently published 10 Stocks Already Shocking 2026 With Massive Gains. Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSEAmerican:UUUU) was one of the top performers last week.

Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSEAmerican:UUUU) saw its share prices jump by 13.9 percent week-on-week, as investors raised their exposure to energy firms believed to largely benefit from the cold months and the US nuclear renaissance this year.

The stock rallied alongside its counterparts as traders placed bets on the sector’s “seasonal strength,” with households and businesses expected to ramp up consumption to power their heating appliances during the winter season.

The White Mesa Mill—a mine site owned and operated by Energy Fuels Inc. Photo from Energy Fuels website

Higher energy demand is expected to indirectly benefit the uranium sector, including Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSEAmerican:UUUU), as nuclear companies would need to expand their uranium fuel consumption to run their plants.

In an updated report last month, the US Energy Information Administration said that it projects retail energy price forecasts to pick up amid a colder-than-usual winter season.

In the broader front, the uranium and nuclear sectors are poised for an expansion this year, thanks to the US government’s commitment to a nuclear renaissance, where more projects are expected to be developed in support of the growing demand from the artificial intelligence and manufacturing sectors.

The policy direction followed President Donald Trump’s executive order early last year aimed at accelerating nuclear development to support national security.

While we acknowledge the potential of UUUU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Read Long Reads Autocar Professional Person of the Year 2025: Sudarshan Venu The global two-wheeler industry is undergoing a rare shake-up.","The final week of 2025 and the opening days of 2026 offered a natural pause for the Indian automotive industry to take stock of a year that was anything but ordinary. What began on a cautious note ended with record sales months, structural shifts in market leadership, and a growing sense that India’s auto ecosystem is entering a more mature, execution-driven phase.

Calendar year 2025 closed with India’s passenger vehicle industry crossing critical milestones. Monthly wholesales breached the 400,000-unit mark for the first time in December, electric vehicle sales hit record highs across cars and two-wheelers, and exports remained a pillar of growth even as global uncertainty persisted. The numbers confirmed that GST rationalisation, easing interest rates and a steady recovery in rural demand helped the market regain momentum after a volatile start to the year. At the same time, the sales data also revealed deeper structural trends–SUV dominance, the resilience of value-led models like the Dzire, and the widening gap between leaders and laggards.

Beyond the spreadsheets, the week was also defined by narrative shifts. The idea of EV leadership itself came under scrutiny, with Tesla’s once-unquestioned dominance giving way to a broader debate about scale, manufacturing depth and long-term execution. In India, automakers and suppliers alike sharpened their focus on systems, localisation and profitability rather than disruption alone. That theme resonated strongly with Autocar Professional’s Person of the Year 2025, Sudarshan Venu, whose steady, execution-led leadership has propelled TVS Motor into the global top tier while redefining India’s electric two-wheeler landscape.

Policy and institution-building developments added further layers. The PLI Auto scheme crossed a major investment milestone, underlining the government’s role in anchoring India’s manufacturing ambitions. New standards for electric agricultural tractors pointed to the widening footprint of electrification beyond urban mobility. Leadership changes at Hyundai Motor India, fresh IPO filings, cybersecurity incidents and renewed investment activity all signalled an industry that is expanding in breadth.

Here’s the detailed round-up of all major developments from this week:

India's PLI Auto Scheme Crosses ₹35,657 Crore Investment

India's Production Linked Incentive scheme for the automotive sector has achieved significant milestones, with cumulative investments reaching ₹35,657 crore and incentive disbursements totaling ₹2,321.94 crore as of December 31, 2025. The scheme has catalyzed the production of over 13.6 lakh electric vehicles while generating nearly 49,000 jobs, according to an official announcement by the Ministry of Heavy Industries.

JSW MG Bets on Extended Buyback to Address EV Resale Concerns

Concerns over the resale value of electric vehicles remain one of the key hurdles to faster adoption of EVs in India. While OEMs have introduced assured buyback programs, JSW MG Motor is now offering an extended buyback program that guarantees a fixed resale value for EVs for up to five years.

The automaker says this extended buyback program is an “industry-first initiative” for mass market EVs to boost consumer confidence, as most of the other OEMs offer a buyback program for only up to three years. The program, which guarantees 40-60% resale value, builds on the company's existing buyback program, which is for up to three years.

However, what began as a strategy to mitigate the peaks and troughs of the Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicle (M&HCV) segment has evolved into a formidable, standalone business vertical.

Anti-Dumping Duties on Chinese Cranes May Lift the Game for ACE

For years, the Indian market for high-capacity truck and crawler cranes has been dominated by Chinese manufacturers, helped by cheaper domestic steel, state support, and soft financing that left them 30–40% cheaper than Indian rivals. The Central Government now proposes anti-dumping duties of roughly 35–40% on Chinese cranes, covering truck cranes up to 160 tonnes and crawler cranes up to 260 tonnes, in a move that would significantly narrow this price gap. ACE sees the measure as more than a simple tariff adjustment.

The industry’s domestic dispatches rose 26% YoY in December to 404,229 units, marking one of the strongest monthly performances in recent years and reinforcing the view that the sector has entered a structurally stronger phase after several quarters of volatility.

Insights & Interpretations

Tesla Uncrowned

The electric vehicle story is often told as a race for sales, market share, or technological firsts. But that framing misses the deeper shift now underway. What we are witnessing is not the arrival of electric mobility, but a change in what leadership in this industry truly means. Tesla once turned electric cars into belief, aspiration, and cultural inevitability. Today, the centre of gravity is moving from narrative power to industrial depth, from charisma to systems, from disruption to execution. This piece is about that transition and about what happens when a story-led revolution collides with the hard mathematics of scale, manufacturing, and long-term dominance.

Accelerating Battery Manufacturing Ecosystem in India

India's energy future is increasingly reliant on advanced battery technologies, which are indispensable for powering electric vehicles (EVs) and facilitating the storage of renewable energy from burgeoning solar and wind sources. This national drive is fuelled by rapidly rising energy demand and a decisive governmental shift towards clean technologies.

India has set ambitious targets, including achieving 30% EV sales penetration and reducing projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030; and committing to net-zero emissions by 2070. These objectives underscore a profound strategic commitment to sustainable mobility and energy independence.

The article covers current challenges associated with indigenous development of raw materials, battery cell manufacturing, equipment/ machinery development so to meet the growing demand for energy storage systems both for the electric mobility and stationary storage applications.

India Reclaims Growth Momentum as Policy Support and New Models Lift Auto Market

After a sluggish start to the year, India’s passenger vehicle market regained momentum in the last quarter of 2025, driven by GST 2.0, falling interest rates, and new model launches at attractive prices, reviving demand.

While growth remained moderate rather than spectacular in the first 9 months due to a high base and a slowing economy, the industry clawed back lost ground and closed the year with volumes estimated at around 4.58 million units, making India the second-fastest-growing large car market globally after China.

The recovery came amid slowing global demand and persistent geopolitical uncertainty. Yet, unlike several mature markets that saw stagnation or contraction, India managed to sustain forward momentum, aided by a combination of price correction beyond the GST cut, portfolio expansion, and improving consumer sentiment around the festive season.

Canada’s closest neighbour and biggest trading partner is driving massive political and economic restructuring. This has created great political and economic unease among Canadians at a collective and personal level.

These new threats have also forced public attention away from clean energy, climate change, plastic pollution, urban sprawl and chemical pollution. Unfortunately, many polluting industries have seized upon this moment to maximize their profits — lobbying decision-makers to roll back progress and carry out attacks on long-standing environmental protection rules and legislation.

These industries argue that it’s for the greater good — but is it? Evidence from history shows that societies succeed in the long term when they integrate protection of the environment into the economic and social development strategies. Those that do not tend to fail. In fact, for the first time in human history, scientifically conclusive evidence is telling us that moving forward economic progress must be grounded in what is best for the environment.

As we move into 2026, Canada has the opportunity to get some key things right to chart a course towards a better future. Here are our predictions for the biggest environmental wins coming our way next year.

Nation-Building Projects:

This year, the federal government has been hyper-focused on nation-building projects. Next year, we will advocate for these projects to align with moving Canada towards clean energy, climate action and protection of nature. Some ones to watch are:

High Speed Rail: The proposed route would run from Toronto through to Ottawa and Quebec City. This train would dramatically cut travel times and highway traffic and increase business and personal productivity. It would also replace fossil fuel powered planes with electric powered trains. Building it should also involve restoring forests and wetlands and delivering benefits to communities. We hope to see another route announced for Edmonton to Calgary.

Wind West: This renewable energy project would see the creation of massive offshore wind farms in Nova Scotia that could then be sent west to provide up to 25% of Canada’s electricity needs. We expect to see federal support help to move this project ahead and help remove the need for costly and polluting gas plants that are being pushed forward in Ontario and Alberta.

Clean Steel: It is key to Canada’s future competitiveness that we increase our steel exports to places outside of the U.S. (who has slapped big tariffs on it). A great way to do this and also reduce pollution is to switch from fossil fueled furnaces to electric ones. This will make our steel cheaper to manufacture and also more attractive to purchasers who want green steel. Algoma Steel has this process underway and great progress stands to come in Hamilton and in Quebec.

Public Transportation: The best way to have less gridlock is to have less cars on the road and that happens when commuters are given viable and affordable choices. Watch for action to roll out a focus on building more public transit infrastructure, giving existing transit greater priority on streets and increasing the frequency of how often a bus or a train comes.

Forever Chemicals:

The jig is up on the long-hidden truth about the risks of Polyfluoralkyl chemicals (PFAS), also known as “forever chemicals”, to people and the environment. These include developmental effects, cancers and disruption of hormone regulation. These chemicals are found in a plethora of everyday products including non-stick coatings, menstrual products, and furniture. Fortunately, after long delays, 2026 is a year when we expect to see action by the federal government to ban at least some of the most egregious PFAS. We will be pushing for action on all of them.

Ontario Deposit Return:

If you live in Ontario, you’re probably sick of seeing littered plastic drink bottles.2026 is the year when we expect to finally see the Ontario government move to adopt a new deposit-return program that will put a price on non-alcoholic drink containers and, as a result, greatly increase recovery and recycling rates. It is not hard to do and 8 of the other 10 Canadian provinces already have successful programs in place.

Clean Energy:

The fossil fuel industry has worked hard to block renewable energy projects. Fortunately for all of us, the price of solar, wind and battery storage systems has dropped so dramatically that it will become increasingly difficult to convince citizens to stick with expensive and polluting gas and oil. Watch for an ongoing shift from gas furnaces to heat pumps and from gas plants to renewable energy production projects.

Electric Vehicles:

EVs will be back in style as both consumers and our governments recognize that they are better value and less polluting. There is no future for Canadian automakers and the jobs they provide if Canada tries to join the US in sitting out the move to EVs. We think we’ll be seeing more affordable EVs and a major government push on charging infrastructure.

Sustainable Housing:

Big changes to the rules that guide building in our cities will come this year. In the place of regulations that have prevented mid-rise buildings (think four stories with six apartments), we anticipate cities and towns will recognize that the housing crisis will be partly solved by encouraging more of this type of building. This will allow us to densify our existing neighbourhoods rather than relying on environmentally destructive urban sprawl.

No new pipelines:

Finally, the cynical Alberta-Federal MOU that undercuts Canadian climate action will run up on the rocks of its own making. Oil demand is expected to peak by the end of this decade, meaning the massive increases in oil sands production and risky bitumen pipeline to the British Columbia north coast make no economic sense. These projects will never move forward. We’ll be reading the MOU’s epitaph well before year-end.

Our vision for 2026 is clear: a Canada where clean water, a safe climate, and healthy communities ground all our efforts to create economic and social prosperity.

He said export realisations were currently around $446–448 per tonne FOB, compared with London white sugar prices of about $426 per tonne.
He said around 1.5–2 lakh tonnes of sugar have been contracted so far, with 50,000–60,000 tonnes already exported.
On the domestic front, he said India began the season with opening stocks of about 50 lakh tonnes, and sugar production is progressing well.
Total output for the season is estimated at around 345 lakh tonnes, while domestic consumption is projected at 284–285 lakh tonnes.","The Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) has urged the government to rationalise GST on flex-fuel vehicles and higher ethanol blends in the upcoming Union Budget, saying the move would support clean mobility while helping stabilise the ethanol ecosystem.

The Director General of ISMA, said GST on flex-fuel and strong hybrid vehicles should be reduced to 5 per cent, in line with electric vehicles, from the current rate of around 18 per cent.

“For a clean technology like EVs, the GST is 5 per cent. There is no reason why the same rate cannot be extended to flex-fuel and strong hybrid vehicles, which are also clean technologies,” he told ANI in an interview.

He also called for a reduction in the GST on higher-ethanol-blended fuels such as E85 and E100. He said bringing GST down to 5 per cent from 18 per cent would make these fuels cheaper than conventional petrol and boost consumer adoption.

Sugar prices in India

On sugar exports, he said India was permitted to export 15 lakh tonnes of sugar in November, though shipments have been slow due to weak international prices. He said export realisations were currently around $446–448 per tonne FOB, compared with London white sugar prices of about $426 per tonne.

“There is no parity in sugar prices as Indian prices are higher than global prices at present,” he said, adding that exports are expected to pick up from January as Brazilian sugar supplies ease.

He said around 1.5–2 lakh tonnes of sugar have been contracted so far, with 50,000–60,000 tonnes already exported.

On the domestic front, he said India began the season with opening stocks of about 50 lakh tonnes, and sugar production is progressing well. Total output for the season is estimated at around 345 lakh tonnes, while domestic consumption is projected at 284–285 lakh tonnes.

Even after accounting for ethanol diversion and exports, he said closing stocks are expected to remain high at around 59–60 lakh tonnes, putting pressure on domestic prices.

He also flagged challenges for the ethanol sector after achieving the E20 blending target, citing limited consumption beyond 20 per cent and low allocation to distilleries, which have impacted viability in several states.

Tesla said Friday that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world’s richest man. The sales drop came despite President Donald Trump’s marketing effort early last year when he called a news conference to praise Musk as a “patriot” in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock fell 2.6% to $438.07 on Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

Cheaper models haven’t reversed downward trend

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Musk said earlier last year that a “major rebound” in sales was underway, but investors were unruffled when that didn’t pan out, choosing instead to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business. He has has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory — and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin in June, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

“Regulatory is going to be a big issue,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. “We’re dealing with people’s lives.”

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla’s autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Personal wealth pushing new frontiers

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to the public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering.

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to $67 million.
Corn production in North Dakota alone has quadrupled to 16.5 million acres since the turn of the century, crowding out the diverse vegetation bees depend on.
For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places like North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere.
“Folks are concerned about how sustainable aviation fuel production could change the landscape,” she said, “unless we get the rules right.”","The Millers are a family of beekeepers in Gackle, North Dakota, a tiny farming town about 70 miles east of Bismarck. It was five decades ago when they began their labors here amid the endless swaths of sweet clover, alfalfa and the variety of other plant life that bees love.

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to $67 million. All of it courtesy of these undulating fields of wild grasses, and the buzzing insects who return to them each year.

“It was bee paradise,” said Jason Miller.

But not anymore. That paradise is slowly being transformed into a heaving ocean of corn and soybeans. Corn production in North Dakota alone has quadrupled to 16.5 million acres since the turn of the century, crowding out the diverse vegetation bees depend on.

Part of the reason has been the growing use of corn and soybean ethanol in biofuel, which mixes agricultural and waste feedstocks with fossil fuels for use in combustion engines. But more recently, it is the promise of a newer biofuel that agricultural lobbyists and some environmentalists hope may someday supplant an intractable source of greenhouse gas emissions: jet fuel.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created a U.S. renewable fuel standard in part to decrease dependence on foreign oil. In 2021, President Joe Biden’s “Sustainable Airline Fuel Grand Challenge” turbocharged interest in jet biofuel, offering tax breaks to encourage production of 3 billion gallons of it by decade’s end. The aim was to help shrink the carbon footprint of air travel while locking in demand for U.S. corn and soybeans, especially as the rise of electric vehicles shrinks traditional ethanol use in cars.

Biofuels also can be made from animal fats, algae, waste cooking oils or agricultural waste such as wood chips and straw. While the Environmental Protection Agency is to evaluate all of the pathways for corn or soybeans to produce SAF, the agricultural industry and its lobbyists continue to prepare for what they hope is a fait accompli.

In the last year, U.S. production capacity of SAF jumped from 5,000 to 30,000 barrels per day, according to government estimates, with much of the increase tied to new facilities coming online. And despite conflicting signals from the White House, the Trump administration just unfroze a $1.67 billion Biden-era loan for biofuel processing plants.

The downside of making jet biofuel from corn or soybean production is that it will likely fuel significant land transformation, according to several expert analyses, including one by Braden Limb, a research scientist at Colorado State University. According to his study, about 50% more cropland is needed for corn and soybeans to meet the 2050 SAF production goals.

“The maximum amount of land that we’ve converted to cropland in a single year (roughly 1.8 million acres), would have to be quadrupled every year for the next 30 years,” said Limb. And while collateral damage from efforts to slow global warming is not a new phenomenon, the expanded use of undeveloped land for biofuel-friendly monocultures and its destructive effect on bee populations could be especially significant for food production, the broader environment-and people like Jason Miller.

“We used to make 140 pounds of honey per beehive,” he said. But these days, Miller’s bee colonies appear to be weakening. This year, he averaged only 33 pounds.

The bees that once thrived in North Dakota and places like it are the backbone of a $400 million paid U.S. pollination industry. Miller’s bees follow a pollination circuit in the spring, from almonds to apple and stone fruit orchards throughout the West. By late summer, they return to North Dakota to produce honey.

Honeybee populations already face a number of stressors – disease, pesticides and poor nutrition. Stressed bees are vulnerable to colony collapses: Only a year ago U.S. beekeepers lost more than half of their hives, per an industry study. Katrina Klett, a doctoral student at the University of Minnesota who studies land use change and honeybee health, has seen up close the negative effects of grasslands giving way to corn.

“What I fear is that we’re not going to attach the environmental ethics to sustainable aviation fuel,” Klett said. “If we properly attach environmental metrics and outcomes to tax credit payments, we could move the needle to support farmers to adopt practices that increase diversity on the landscape.”

But as demand for air travel soars, so does aviation’s climate impact. According to the International Air Travel Association, air traffic rose more than 10% between 2023 and 2024, making it one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Aviation contributes roughly 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions but is responsible for at least 3.5% of human-caused climate change.

Airlines have been exploring the few options available to lower emissions, including SAF. The industry has committed to biofuel use and the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted an ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which would require significant biofuel inputs. Researchers such as Limb point to crops other than corn or soybeans, like sorghum and miscanthus, that can be used for biofuel but are not as damaging to ecosystems.

“All of our optimization work,” Limb said, “says corn and soybeans are not the answer.”

There are forces at work that may yet forestall the mass repurposing of grasslands for biofuel. In 2022, the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, created by Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, crafted more incentives for domestic production and sale of low-carbon transportation fuels. But the Republican tax and spending bill passed this summer, while extending the credit, decreased the $1.75 per gallon credit for SAF to $1. Without that added subsidy, it may be difficult for SAF to be cost-competitive with regular jet fuel. (The bill did, however, change how biofuel sustainability is calculated in a way that makes it easier for producers to qualify while still clearcutting forests or eliminating grasslands).

There are other reasons SAF may still be too expensive to justify the investment. Jet fuel purity standards require complex processing and specialized equipment, and current feedstocks for SAF – including virgin vegetable oils – are typically more expensive than other biofuels.

“Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers,” said Andrew Swanson, an agricultural economist at Montana State University.

Still, agricultural lobbies continue to express eagerness when it comes to jet biofuel given the effect EV use is having on corn and soybean ethanol markets. While pushing for a higher percentage of ethanol in gasoline blends used in land transportation, organizations such as the National Corn Growers Association and state-based trade groups are seeking more government incentives to use corn and soybeans for SAF.

Another driver of aviation biofuel is the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), an initiative that aims to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions from international flights. CORSIA is a three-phase international agreement. The first two phases were voluntary, but beginning in 2027, CORSIA becomes mandatory for most of international aviation, with some exceptions. Under the agreement, airlines must measure, report, verify and offset emissions that exceed the 2019 baseline.

For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places like North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere. A new study by researchers at the University of California, Davis, found biofuel demand drove the conversion of 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm production in Indonesia and Malaysia between 2002 and 2018.

Turning wild grasslands into homogenous fields of corn and soybeans remains a “very real problem for biofuels,” said Jeremy Martin, director of fuels policy at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, in a Nov. 5 blog post. But there are other troubling consequences of the U.S. biofuels push. Proposals for its production far exceed current domestic availability, meaning current mandates can only be met with imports and diverting vegetable oil from food to fuel, which will raise the cost of both while accelerating deforestation.

Swanson said the wild card in the SAF debate is trade, noting that the U.S. exported almost 2 billion gallons of corn ethanol last year. “If U.S. exports decline,” he said, “then we will need to find ways to increase domestic consumption-increasing land use change pressure.”

SAF advocates such as Veronica Bradley, director of environmental science for the industry lobby Clean Fuels Alliance America, counter that existing biofuel sources – used vegetable oil, beef tallow and forestry wastes – could satisfy near-term demand, as could shifting uses for corn ethanol amid the EV boom. For now, it appears the uncertainty over regulatory policies and incentives has put both the threat and promise of SAF, and in some respects the expanded use of biofuels in general, on hold.

“There is no real indication that we will move towards a clear widely applicable standard for assessing land-use change and biodiversity impacts,” said Swanson. “This puts the SAF industry in a difficult position. Contradictory policy standards will mean that by catering to one market you are cutting off the opportunity to produce for a different market.”

If climate change increases incidents of pathologies that bring chronic pain, it will increasingly stress the healthcare services disabled people rely on, she said.

Advocates worried that without this office, chronic pain research coordination across the NIH and HHS would suffer.","Dawn Gibson can literally feel storms coming in her bones.

“I’ll start feeling like this gnawing and throbbing in my bones and joints,” the 48-year-old suburban Detroiter said. “I get this feeling like my body is getting very heavy, and it’s almost like those old diving suits with the big window in front.”

Imani Barbarin, in Philadelphia, sometimes feels like her pain is better at predicting the weather than the app on her phone.

“It kind of builds; usually I feel it most in the morning the day of [the storm],” the 35-year-old said. “It’ll be like, something’s off, and it’ll be sunny outside, like I don’t get it. Then all of a sudden it’ll just be all cloudy, pouring out rain.”

Gibson and Barbarin are among the more than 50 million Americans who have some form of ongoing, regular pain—the fastest growing chronic condition in America. Gibson suffers from ankylosing spondylitis and fibromyalgia, which both lead to widespread pain throughout the body and overall fatigue, while Barbarin has cerebral palsy.

And for as long as people have reported recurring pain that doesn’t respond adequately to treatment, they’ve complained about the weather making it worse. Atmospheric changes intensifying pain “is a common complaint among people with persistent pain” said Dr. Corey Simon, associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Duke University, who sees patients coping with it in his practice.

There is a library of studies trying to understand the connection between chronic pain and weather, but no single theory has prevailed in the medical establishment. Nonetheless, patients, clinicians and epidemiologists all agree that weather is a factor in some pain. Now, as climate change slowly remakes weather patterns and atmospheric trends, a new question is emerging: Is global warming increasing the torment of those suffering from chronic pain?

The Agony of a Rapidly-Increasing Chronic Condition

Everyone feels pain, from the immediately sharp, but then dull throb of a stubbed toe, to the searing sting of a cut hand sliced while peeling vegetables or the deep soreness of heavy bruises from a fall down the stairs. While this kind of discomfort can fade quickly, chronic conditions can bring prolonged, often life-long agony that disables many people. Chronic pain both vividly colors and darkens the everyday experience of those who suffer it, according to Barbarin, a disability advocate.

“A dull ache is kind of like my normal,” she said. “I feel it on my feet all the time. I feel it on my hips, in my back.”

This rise in chronic pain is happening alongside a big increase in autoimmune disorders since 2017, said Dr. Tamiko Katsumoto, clinical associate professor of immunology and rheumatology at Stanford University. The outcome is now that chronic pain is “our most prevalent chronic health condition, number one cause of disability globally, [and] most expensive,” Nicholson said. Half a trillion dollars are spent annually on chronic pain treatments, many of which don’t work.

Weathering Pain That’s Hard to Study

Elderly osteoarthritis patients often complain that cold, wet conditions make their pain worse, Simon, at Duke University, said. Dr. Sara Wallace, an orthopaedic surgeon and assistant professor at the University of Chicago Medical Center, has seen similar pain triggers in her patients.

“I can say anecdotally that most patients who come to the door, if not all patients with arthritis, will tell you that when the weather changes, when it’s going to rain outside, when it’s going to snow, patients do say that their pain is worse,” she said.

Rain, or stormy weather, is often associated with lower barometric pressure. “If the barometric pressure, for example, outside goes down, then that may allow the joints to swell in the body,” potentially increasing pain, Wallace explained.

“There’s a lot more variability in day-to-day pressure during winter than summer” in the United States, said Steve Vavrus, Wisconsin State climatologist and assistant director of the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This could explain the “wet and cold” connection that Simon and Wallace have been observing.

For Barabarin, even weather conditions this mundane can be devastating.

“There are some days where I just become so jumbled up,” she said. “Sometimes I just can’t get my body to cooperate, and that’s not necessarily pain, but it’s also environmentally implied too.”

In a scenario in which the pain occurs in a variety of winter conditions that occur simultaneously—wet, cold, low barometric pressure—it can be hard to identify the meteorological source of pain. Such atmospheric complexities can make research at the intersection of chronic pain and weather even more inconclusive.

As osteoarthritis is a fairly common cause of chronic pain experienced by many older people globally, it’s drawn a lot of research and made people in their sixties a somewhat uniform population to study. But even with consistency among the patients studied, the results vary widely.

U.S.-based researchers in 2007 found that older American patients felt more arthritis pain with high barometric pressure. In 2015, researchers in Northern Europe found that osteoarthritis patients throughout Europe experience worse pain in colder, more humid conditions and barometric pressure had little impact. A study published in 2014 that immersed older adults in cold water found that their pain tolerance decreased when exposed to frigid conditions. But then two Australian studies published in 2016 found that weather had limited impact on chronic musculoskeletal pain in people over 40.

Timothy McAlindon, a rheumatologist and professor at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School and a co-author on the study focused on Americans, thinks that investigating only the physiological connection between weather and pain is why these studies are not conclusive. He pointed out that people “have their own prior hypotheses” that inform their perceptions of pain.

Psychology, particularly mood and memory, really influences perception of pain related to weather, McAlindon, Wallace and Simon agree.

“If your mood has been very positive, very high, then you may, generally speaking, experience less pain in your body,” Wallace explained. “Whereas, if your mood is kind of low and maybe you have some seasonal associated depression, maybe you notice that joint pain more.”

Volatile, climate-driven weather shifts can drive mood swings, as well as “climate grief” and “eco-anxiety.”

Additionally, if the weather has you trapped inside, you lose your ability to exercise, which can help alleviate pain from osteoarthritis, Wallace and Simon both explained.

Exercise is also key to maintaining good mental health. But for many folks with varying degrees of pain and disability, walking outside might be the only form of exercise available to them, Gibson added, and that might become more difficult if climate change brings more heat or precipitation to their community.

The myriad weather impacts on mental health and mood can lead people to fixate on their pain more when the weather is poor, Simon said. Humans have a tendency “to invest in patterns” which can lead to “confirmation bias,” he noted.

“Such biases can lead us to remember pain on poor weather days [rather] than pain on good weather days.”

A prolonged poor mood can turn into chronic stress, which can make pain worse by triggering the body to release cortisol, which increases inflammation, Katsumoto said.

Collaboration Challenges Hinder Research

Though deeply unsettled, research on chronic pain and weather exists. But studies of chronic pain explicitly related to climate change do not, and atmospheric scientists and epidemiologists seldom collaborate on research into the topic.

“The data are in different formats,” Vavrus said. “There’s just a different language spoken between the different fields.”

Few of the many weather and pain studies include atmospheric scientists. The research often treats weather as though it’s fixed throughout the day, with few looking at how temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and precipitation fluctuations over a 24-hour time period might affect pain.

It’s hard to make conclusions “if you only have one data point,” Vavrus said. If these studies did incorporate meteorology as it changes, research might be more robust, but the complex challenges of comprehensively determining what climate change is doing to weather will make figuring out its impacts on pain even more difficult.

Global warming is bringing more heatwaves and an atmosphere that sucks up more moisture to feed storms. Those thermodynamic effects of climate change often have more clear ties to pain. For example, gout sufferers living in Arizona—which will continue to get hotter and dryer as global temperatures increase—will likely experience worse pain due to more frequent and severe instances of dehydration driven by the increasing temperatures and aridity. That’s on top of the exacerbation of the pain by the heat itself.

Anna Samson, a 26-year old writer and disability advocate from Toronto, has axial spondyloarthritis (a form of arthritis) and fibromyalgia. When temperatures start getting into the upper 70s, it feels like “the slightest movement takes all the effort in the world,” she said via email. And high humidity can send her literally reeling.

“[Humidity], in particular, instantly makes me dizzy,” she added. “It feels like running into an invisible wall, and I have to sit or lie down until my head stops spinning.”

“My joints will feel slow and sticky, like they have hot, burning glue inside them,” she said. “It makes everything difficult to do.”

One irony of the warming climate is the possibility that it could bring more polar vortexes of unusually frigid temperatures to otherwise temperate parts of North America. The strength of the polar jet stream that circulates around the Arctic is driven by the North Pole being much colder than the equator. But with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet, that differential between warm and cold temperatures has decreased. And some scientists have proposed that the polar jet stream is slowing down and starting to wobble like a top that’s about to stop spinning, with its teetering dropping cold, polar air to more temperate, lower-latitude regions like Michigan.

“There’s good theoretical reasons why we would expect that climate change should generally slow down the strength of the westerly polar jet stream,” Vavrus said.

“My joints will feel slow and sticky, like they have hot, burning glue inside them. It makes everything difficult to do.”

For folks susceptible to cold this is ominous news, and a way climate change impacts on atmospheric dynamics could worsen chronic pain.

Three years ago, Gibson was diagnosed with Raynaud’s syndrome, which causes decreased blood flow to the extremities. In cold weather, such as when frigid Arctic temperatures descend to lower latitudes, this can cause pain and even lead to frostbite—health challenges that Gibson is facing more often than she expected in a warming climate.

“When we have a polar vortex, I try not to go outside, because there is a very real chance of something bad happening,” she said.

Torment During and After Tempests

The increasing incidence and severity of climate-driven extreme weather events complicates the lives of those experiencing chronic pain during extreme weather events and also in their aftermath.

Those pains and the stress of the extreme weather that brought them on pile up into an emotional toll that can also manifest itself physically.

“Our streets were flooded. People lost so many items. It’s emotionally oppressive,” Gibson recalled. “When these big storms come now, or there’s a potential for these big storms, I do feel this terrible dread.”

The looming threats of displacement, loss of valuables or harms to loved ones can spike levels of cortisol, the hormone associated with stress reactions, which increases many forms of chronic pain, Katsumoto said.

Climate change is also altering when, where and how humans are sickened by infectious disease. Vector-borne illnesses like Lyme disease, dengue fever, chikunguna and malaria have all become more prevalent and widespread as global temperatures warm, a trend that researchers expect to continue. And autoimmune diseases—many of which cause repetitive pain—are “oftentimes triggered by infections,” Katsumoto said.

“Not to mention that autoimmune disease patients are immunosuppressed,” she added, “so they’re going to be more susceptible to infections.”

Some medications prescribed to treat pain have side effects that can be more dangerous as the climate warms. Gibson takes duloxetine, an antidepressant that also treats chronic pain, but like other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used to treat depression, the drug substantially reduces the heat tolerance of the people who take it. The increasing frequency, severity and duration of heatwaves make this and similar pain management medications more dangerous to prescribe.

“If you’re on [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors], you can’t live where it’s too hot any longer.” Barbarin warned. “You will die.”

Federal Urgency Wanes as Diagnoses Increase

Autoimmune diagnoses have been rising, in general, even without the potential increases climate change could bring.

“Our wait times have gone up tremendously,” Katsumoto said about healthcare providers who treat rheumatic diseases like arthritis, gout and Lupus. If climate change increases incidents of pathologies that bring chronic pain, it will increasingly stress the healthcare services disabled people rely on, she said.

All of this comes as the Trump administration is narrowing the research scope of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, key agencies for monitoring chronic illness, Barbarin and Katsumoto said.

Before the start of the second Trump Administration, funding for pain research at the NIH was about two percent of the agency’s annual research budget. Pain advocates had lobbied Congress for nearly a decade to double that amount, said Christin Veasley, co-founder and director of The Chronic Pain Research Alliance, at a conference in August.

But this past April, the Trump Administration proposed a 40 percent funding cut to the NIH, including terminating the Office of Pain Policy and Planning. That office coordinated chronic pain research activities across the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services, and facilitated both public-facing and Congressional communication on chronic pain research. Advocates worried that without this office, chronic pain research coordination across the NIH and HHS would suffer.

There was, however, hope this summer that those cuts wouldn’t be permanent.

“Some perceived the president’s budget as merely a proposal and others looked at it more of like a policy framework by which they would start negotiating,” Veasley said in August.

While some of the 2025 NIH cuts have been reversed, almost $38 million in pain-related research funding was terminated and around $74 million remains frozen, according to Grant Witness, which is tracking Trump administration cuts to scientific research agencies. These terminated and frozen grants comprise roughly 27 percent of pain-related funding from the NIH. When Inside Climate News asked specifically about the future of the Office of Pain Policy and Planning, the NIH Press Team wrote that “as the [office] was not responsible for conducting or funding research activities, its closure does not impact the scope or continuity of federally supported scientific research.”

But Linda Porter, former director of the Office of Pain Policy and Planning, worries that the office’s closure could upend “decades of progress in enhancing federally funded pain research.”

“The value of NIH research arises not simply from ‘conducting or funding research activities,’ but also from careful evaluation of the current research endeavor, how it benefits the lives of people who it is meant to serve, and how best to move research into the future,” she wrote in response to the Press Team’s statement. “The Office also developed and oversaw training programs for the next generation of researchers, provided networking channels for communication across research disciplines and with people who live with pain.”

Veasley told Inside Climate News via email that the Chronic Pain Research Alliance and other pain advocates “have not gotten any indication that the Office will reopen.”

Cuts to pain research also coincide with steep reductions in federal climate research funding.

This year, the number of geoscience grants awarded by the National Science Foundation, which often fund meteorology and climate science, have dropped by 35 percent relative to the yearly average over the last decade. And with the Trump administration targeting federal climate science with budget cuts, staff reductions and the removal of data from federal websites, getting funding from Washington for research at the intersection of global warming and pain is virtually impossible.

As questions about their continued suffering go unanswered by government-supported research, Barbarin said many disabled people are leaning on one another, and using each other’s anecdotes to better understand their conditions. Online forums, like Reddit, provide critical community spaces. The r/ChronicPain subreddit has been around since 2009, and has 87,000 weekly visitors with 4,600 weekly global contributors who often discuss their struggles with their conditions. The number of posts about weather-triggered pain have ticked steadily upwards over the past three years.

“It’s weirdly comforting to realize I’m not alone in this, but also frustrating how much control the weather seems to have over my body,” one contributor wrote. “It’s like a predicting super power,” another user responded about their chronic pain.

For now, sharing their experiences with one another might be the most reliable way forward.

“When you have something that is a lot unknown, that means you have to live and make your life work while you’re waiting for the science to catch up,” Gibson said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2247506229-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 06:15:28.237161

Former President Joe Biden's policies set the changes in motion, and successor Donald Trump may take the credit. But the real winners are Korea's LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI and SK On, who will be better able to take on China.

US demand for lithium-ion batteries, used to power cars and store energy, has been accelerating, but domestic supply failed to keep pace: consequently, for storage alone, the country has imported more than $100 billion in batteries and components since 2021, according to S&P Global, roughly half of which came from China. Increasing reliance on the People's Republic – total lithium-ion battery shipments grew 15-fold in the decade to 2024, per International Trade Centre data – worried policymakers.

Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act flipped the script. The scheme awarded generous credits for local investment and production, slashing battery-making costs by 30 percent, the Center on Global Energy Policy estimates. Setting up factories was especially enticing for Korean giants, since Chinese rivals, including the world's largest battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology, were effectively excluded. Now, the country could see an oversupply of lithium-ion batteries as soon as 2026, per Benchmark Minerals forecasts.

South Korean producers have invested some $20 billion to build out capacity, per S&P, and will account for more than two-fifths of the growth in production between 2025 and 2029, Benchmark Minerals estimated in 2024. The US was LGES's largest market by sales in the first half of 2025, and SK On expects to have more than doubled its capacity there in that year, compared with 2024.

That's feeding through to earnings. LGES and Samsung will turn a 2025 loss to a 2026 net profit of $700 million and nearly $400 million, respectively, according to Visible Alpha. SK Innovation's battery subsidiary SK On needs longer to reach profitability, but revenue will increase around 50 percent in the year ahead, Jefferies estimates. While Trump terminated electric-car subsidies in September, the energy storage market is growing quickly due to demand from AI data centres, and manufacturers are retooling production to cater to the latter.

There are other perks. Higher overall sales drive economies of scale in sourcing and also research. That, coupled with the lack of Chinese competition, has helped the Koreans play catch-up in commercialising lithium ferrous phosphate chemistry, a cheap and long-lasting kind of battery in which China's players until recently boasted a global monopoly. LGES is now producing LFP products in the US while Samsung begins production in 2026, and SK On is in discussions with automakers. The US is also a good testing ground for alternatives like lithium manganese-rich cells. That will help the three in other major markets like Europe.

There are risks too. If the AI boom slows or Americans steer clear of electric cars, then excess supply could pressure prices, eroding the US industry's profitability. And American or even Chinese policymakers may yet deliver nasty surprises: Beijing still controls supply chains for the raw materials like graphite that go into battery cells and so could hamper production if trade tensions rise again.

TSMC’s N3 Fab Commissioning: completion of its second Arizona fab in 2028.","Deep within Arizona’s arid landscape, two of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers—Intel and TSMC—are transforming vast stretches of sun-drenched topography into the epicenter of America’s chipmaking revival. Both companies have drawn global attention for their massive investments and technological ambition, but there is a crucial difference between their operations.

Intel’s newly constructed Fab 52 stands as the most advanced semiconductor factory on U.S. soil, while TSMC’s Arizona fabs represent a significant relocation of Taiwanese semiconductor mastery to U.S. soil. These vast industrial footprints obscure a complex environmental challenge regarding how these facilities will balance technological leadership with resource sustainability in one of the most water-stressed regions of the world.

The promise of Arizona as a burgeoning ‘Silicon Desert’ semiconductor hub reflects more than competition. It represents a national effort to secure advanced manufacturing and reduce dependency on Asia while fueling the growing demand for artificial intelligence hardware. Yet, as massive capital investments reshape the desert infrastructure, critical questions remain:

How can precision manufacturing sustain itself while relying on millions of gallons of water daily?

Can “greener” engineering truly offset the enormous energy and environmental costs of making chips for the AI era?

These inquiries highlight the friction between industrial growth and environmental limits.

Key Semiconductor Statistics: Intel and TSMC Arizona Quick Facts

Intel Fab 52: Located in Chandler, Arizona, part of Intel’s Ocotillo campus. Built for Intel 18A process technology featuring RibbonFET and PowerVia. The designed capacity targets roughly 40,000 wafer starts per month, positioning the facility within a competitive comparison of Intel’s Fab 52 and TSMC’s Arizona fabs, where production volumes are expected to exceed regional rivals by 2027.

TSMC Arizona Fab 21: Located near Phoenix. Began high-volume production in late 2024. This expansion roadmap includes advanced N4 and N3 process nodes that will facilitate future N2 technology integration near Phoenix.

CHIPS Act Funding: Intel has secured $7.86 billion in direct CHIPS Act funding to accelerate U.S. manufacturing efforts, while the federal government has finalized a $6.6 billion U.S. CHIPS incentives package for the Phoenix fabrication campus.

Sustainability Metrics: Intel reports net-positive water use in Arizona and 100% renewable electricity since 2012. TSMC targets 90% water recycling by 2028 through an Industrial Water Reclamation Plant.

Comparing Chip Capacity: Intel Fab 52 vs. TSMC Arizona Infrastructure

Initial comparisons suggest Intel’s Fab 52 appears to exceed the technical specifications of TSMC’s Phoenix operations in nearly every measurable way. It is physically larger and designed for a more advanced process node. Furthermore, it is equipped with a higher number of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines—the most expensive and critical tools in modern chip production. Reporting from Tom’s Hardware indicates that Intel’s Arizona campus may eventually host as many as fifteen EUV scanners once all facilities reach full capacity.

Physical scale, however, does not translate directly to immediate market impact. While Intel’s new fab represents unmatched potential throughput, its Intel 18A node is still in the early phase of yield optimization. Tom’s Hardware notes that world-class yields are not expected until early 2027, meaning much of the plant’s output capacity will remain underutilized for the next several years. TSMC, by contrast, began producing chips on its proven N4 node in 2024, ensuring that its Arizona fabs contribute to commercial supply chains sooner, even if the process technology is slightly older.

This shift underscores a recurring industry cycle in semiconductor manufacturing: ramp-up is everything. While Intel may ultimately achieve a larger footprint and finer transistor geometries, TSMC’s experience with high-yield production gives it a near-term advantage in stability and output. The real competition is not over who builds the biggest factory, but who achieves consistent yields first—the moment when every wafer reliably produces profitable chips.

The Intel 18A Advantage: Revolutionizing Performance with RibbonFET and PowerVia

Intel’s Fab 52 is not just another facility; it is the cornerstone of the company’s strategy to establish a new benchmark in transistor density and performance. Built on Intel 18A technology, this fab will be the first to fully deploy RibbonFET transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, two innovations designed to deliver faster performance and lower power consumption. These technologies are critical for next-generation AI accelerators, cloud processors, and high-performance computing chips.

The Intel 18A node will underpin the company’s reemergence as a foundry for external clients. This shift supports a dedicated foundry business for external chip customers while the company scales up contract manufacturing. The Intel 18A foundry partnership with Microsoft for next-generation AI silicon illustrates how Fab 52 anchors a broader domestic ecosystem of AI-focused chip designs built on U.S. soil. Together, those commitments position Intel as a potential domestic alternative to Asian foundries for leading-edge manufacturing once yields mature.

Engineering Precision in the Cleanroom Environment

From an engineering standpoint, each wafer processed at Fab 52 moves through hundreds of ultra-precise steps inside cleanrooms that filter particles measured at the sub-microscopic level. Advanced semiconductor fabrication requires a continuous, high-volume water supply, yet Intel has emphasized sustainability from the start. The company claims 100% renewable electricity use across its Arizona operations and reports restoring billions of gallons of water annually through conservation and watershed projects.

TSMC Arizona Fab 21: Diversifying the Global Semiconductor Supply Chain

The TSMC Arizona manufacturing complex presents a different but complementary narrative. Its Fab 21 began high-volume manufacturing in late 2024 using the N4 process, an advanced but mature node that already powers many of today’s smartphones and graphics processors. High-volume manufacturing began in late 2024, signaling the commencement of TSMC Arizona chip production following federal grant approvals and laying the groundwork for future nodes.

Beyond the technology race, TSMC’s U.S. presence strengthens semiconductor resilience, reducing the concentration of fabrication capacity in East Asia. Its Arizona complex will eventually represent an investment exceeding $65 billion and employ thousands of local workers. TSMC’s commitment to sustainability is reflected in several key project milestones:

Solar Integration: The site will integrate 14.5 megawatts of solar generation.

Renewable Offsets: The facility will utilize renewable energy credits to offset 100% of its power use.

Water Reclamation: A new Industrial Water Reclamation Plant, scheduled for 2028, targets 90% water recycling.

These targets ensure that TSMC’s presence contributes to the region’s environmental goals.

Comparing Corporate Strategies: Predictable Output vs. Leading-Edge Ambition

TSMC’s steady approach contrasts with Intel’s high-stakes bid for leadership. By starting with proven process nodes, the company ensures immediate output and revenue flow, even as it builds the infrastructure for more advanced technologies. Together, Intel and TSMC’s projects represent a powerful signal: America’s chipmaking resurgence depends as much on long-term sustainability and diversification as on raw production capacity.

Sustainable Chip Manufacturing: Innovative Water Restoration and Recycling Strategies

Advanced semiconductor fabrication requires a continuous, high-volume water supply. To produce a single silicon wafer, thousands of gallons of ultrapure water (UPW) are needed to meticulously clean and rinse microscopic surfaces. In a desert environment, this requirement becomes a sustainability challenge as much as an engineering one. Intel and TSMC are addressing it through different but complementary approaches aimed at making water a circular resource rather than a consumable.

Intel has achieved net-positive water use in Arizona by restoring more water to local watersheds than it withdraws. Through 21 water restoration projects and advanced on-site recycling systems, the company recycles and reuses billions of gallons annually.

The Ocotillo campus also operates a large water reclamation facility. This site processes wastewater for reuse within the fab network, significantly reducing overall demand on municipal supplies.

TSMC’s Industrial Water Reclamation Plant and Solar Integration

TSMC, meanwhile, is constructing an Industrial Water Reclamation Plant (IWRP) that will come online by 2028, capable of recycling up to 90% of process water. The facility will also use renewable electricity, integrating with 14.5 megawatts of solar generation at the Arizona site. Current projections for TSMC’s water use and industrial recycling suggest daily demand could reach tens of millions of gallons, but the strategy aligns with data center cooling innovations designed for dry regions that prioritize extreme water efficiency.

The challenge extends beyond water. Both companies are committing to renewable power agreements to ensure energy-intensive chip fabrication aligns with state and federal sustainability goals. These strategies are not just environmental goodwill—they are practical responses to the growing scrutiny of manufacturing footprints in the age of climate accountability.

Overcoming Yield Challenges: The Reality of High-Volume Production Ramps

Although these campuses anchor the resurgence of U.S. chip production, their operational realities remain tethered to a single, unforgiving metric: yield. Capacity projections are irrelevant until every wafer that enters the fab exits as a functional chip. The Intel 18A node currently navigates the complex phases of process maturity, meaning its massive infrastructure advantage cannot yet translate to matching output volumes.

TSMC’s Arizona operation, leveraging its well-established N4 node, offers a contrast in predictability. The company can deliver reliable wafers more quickly, reinforcing its reputation for consistent yield performance. However, as it transitions toward N3 and N2 production in the next few years, it too will face the challenge of scaling complexity in an unfamiliar environment with a U.S. workforce still ramping up to full experience levels.

For both manufacturers, success depends on synchronization between tool readiness, workforce expertise, and supply chain logistics. The supply chain now includes everything from advanced packaging to the ultrapure quartz industry. The industry recently faced storm-driven disruptions in North Carolina’s quartz supply for AI chip manufacturing, revealing how environmental events can halt the global supply chain. Until all of those pieces align, output will lag behind design capacity, tempering the enthusiasm behind billion-dollar investments and reminding policymakers and industry watchers that ramp efficiency defines true competitiveness more than building size ever could.

Silicon for the AI Era: Impact on Climate Technology and Grid Optimization

Semiconductor fabs are not only about hardware; they sit at the heart of the energy transition and the digital future. AI accelerators, data center processors, and renewable energy management systems all rely on cutting-edge chips to process petabyte-scale datasets with high efficiency. Software and hardware are increasingly optimized through carbon-aware computing for hyperscale data centers to maximize work per kilowatt.

The fabrication techniques being refined in Arizona today will ripple into climate modeling, grid optimization, and medical research tomorrow. Research into photonic chips for data center networking and monolithic 3D AI chips that deliver fourfold energy gains at a U.S. foundry illustrates how each new generation of silicon is trying to push past the energy wall that now constrains AI growth. Emerging breakthroughs in photonic chips for networking and monolithic 3D AI architectures demonstrate how silicon can push past current energy limits.

Addressing the Advanced Packaging and Supply Chain Bottleneck

At the same time, a critical bottleneck persists in advanced CoWoS-style compute packaging, which remains a primary hurdle for high-end accelerator supply. This constraint reminds policymakers that wafer capacity alone will not solve AI supply shortages. In the broader context, these fabs embody the convergence of clean technology and national security. The CHIPS Act funding model demonstrates how public investment can accelerate innovation while enforcing accountability through measurable sustainability outcomes. As the AI economy grows, the carbon cost of computation will increasingly depend on the efficiency of the chips and the integrity of the manufacturing processes that produce them.

What to Watch Next (2026–2028)

The success of Arizona’s semiconductor corridor depends on meeting several critical milestones between now and 2028:

Intel’s 18A Ramp: achieving high-yield production by early 2027.

TSMC’s N3 Fab Commissioning: completion of its second Arizona fab in 2028.

Water Recycling Benchmarks: Intel maintaining net-positive performance; TSMC activating its IWRP to reach 90% recycling.

CHIPS Act Accountability: progress reports tied to funding disbursements and job creation metrics.

These targets provide a measurable roadmap for assessing the impact of multi-billion dollar industrial investments.

The Future of Arizona’s Sustainable Silicon Fab Hub

The industrial transformation occurring in Arizona is a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of technical excellence. Intel’s Fab 52 and TSMC’s expansion are more than just factories; they are test cases for a new era of responsible manufacturing where yield and sustainability are no longer mutually exclusive. As these giants ramp up production of 18A and N3 nodes, their legacy depends on the ability to deliver the silicon required for the AI economy without compromising the environmental integrity of the desert that hosts them.

Looking ahead, the Arizona corridor stands as a blueprint for the global semiconductor industry. By proving that net-positive water use and high-volume recycling are achievable at scale, these facilities are redefining what it means to be an industrial leader in the 21st century. The legacy of the Silicon Desert will not be found in the millions of chips shipped, but in the enduring lesson that technological progress must ultimately harmonize with the preservation of our most vital natural resources.

Essential Insights into Arizona’s Semiconductor Hub

What makes Intel 18A technology unique for AI?

Intel 18A introduces RibbonFET and PowerVia, allowing for significantly higher transistor density and more efficient power delivery, which are essential for the massive computational demands of modern AI models.

How does TSMC manage water recycling in a desert?

TSMC is launching a state-of-the-art Industrial Water Reclamation Plant (IWRP) by 2028, designed to recycle up to 90% of the ultrapure water used during the manufacturing process.

Why is the Silicon Desert critical for the U.S. economy?

The concentration of Intel and TSMC facilities in Arizona secures a domestic supply of leading-edge chips, reducing reliance on overseas foundries and creating thousands of high-tech jobs.

What role does the CHIPS Act play in these Arizona projects?

The CHIPS Act provides billions in direct funding and incentives to accelerate the construction of these fabs, ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in global semiconductor innovation.

Can these massive factories truly achieve net-positive water use?

Yes, Intel already achieves this in Arizona by funding watershed restoration projects that return more water to the environment than the Ocotillo campus consumes annually.",https://www.intelligentliving.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Intels-Fab-52-vs-TSMC-Arizona-Fabs-The-Silicon-Desert-Capacity-Boom-Meets-a-Water-Reality.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 07:57:33.621152

DS and BR: A once a day action is a first step toward broader actions, so it is difficult to track the actual impact of the Campaign on meat consumption.
These data indicate that Meatless Monday is making an impact on how many people think about and consume meat.","Meatless Monday has been active for over 20 years. Would you recount the original idea and how the campaign started?

DS: Meatless Monday recently celebrated its 20th Anniversary in 2023. The campaign was founded in 2003 by Sid Lerner- a leader, philanthropist, and marketing savant who used the art and science of advertising to promote healthy behaviors worldwide – in partnership with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Meatless Monday was inspired by the meat reduction campaigns and “meatless days” during World War I and World War II. The simple concept of “cutting out meat one day per week” was clear, memorable, and easy to understand and encouraged participants to take small steps towards lifestyle changes. Meatless Monday materials, resources, and programming were made free to the public and could be easily customized for any organization, community or individual. Today, organizations and communities worldwide have adopted Meatless Monday to promote healthy, sustainable eating habits and better food choices among their employees, students, staff, and constituents. The beloved movement, which can be found in over 40 countries and translated into 20 languages, continues to grow year after year.

How did John Hopkins collaborate in forging the general concept? And how is it backing the Meatless Monday campaign?

BR: The Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future (CLF) has been the science advisor to Meatless Monday since the beginning. As the story goes, in 2003, recalling the meatless days of the World Wars, ad man Sid Lerner and Dr. Bob Lawrence, the founding director of the Johns Hopkins CLF created “a public health campaign with a creative grassroots marketing strategy” to encourage people to reduce their meat consumption by skipping meat once a week. This reduction was in accordance with a 2000 report by the Surgeon General and the American Heart Association, recommending that Americans reduce their meat and saturated fat consumption by 15 percent. (According to the Environmental Protection Agency, in 2010 agriculture and forestry produced 24% of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Animal agriculture alone accounts for 14.5% of all global greenhouse gas emissions. As the body of evidence has grown, the goal of the campaign has expanded to harness the actions of individuals, communities and institutions to address the health of the planet by reducing the environmental burden associated with meat production.)

CLF works closely with Meatless Monday to ensure their materials, messages and social media resources align with the best science and evidence base. Furthermore, CLF’s research, education and communication undergirds and informs Meatless Monday’s strategy and approach as a gateway toward a healthy, just and sustainable food system. Most recently, CLF worked with Meatless Monday to launch the Meatless Monday Resource Center, which is housed and managed at Johns Hopkins. This will ensure the Campaign is embedded at JHU and will continue to provide evidence based materials and resources for individuals and organizations interested in implementing Meatless Monday.

You define yourself as a movement and encourage people to cut meat consumption. Is Monday the best day to change a behaviour?

DS: Meatless Monday is simply an idea, a marketing concept that other people, communities and organizations can leverage to encourage healthier eating habits. Since 2003, it’s grown into a grassroots, organic global movement, active in more than 40 countries, having a positive impact on our health, our environment, and our communities.

Research does show that the start of the week – Monday -is the day people are most open to trying healthy behaviors. Monday offers a weekly opportunity to “reset” and get back on track. Studies show that people who start a healthy habit at the beginning of the week are better able to maintain progress over time.

Meatless Monday’s message to “skip meat once a week” works because it provides a regular cue to take action on Monday, which research shows is the day people are most open to making positive changes. Starting each week by participating in Meatless Monday can lead people to eat more fruits, vegetables, and plant-based meals the rest of the week.

Which is the most effective way of educating consumers?

DS: Meatless Monday is an easy and delicious first step toward making healthier habits. When educating consumers we try to meet them where they are. We encourage starting small by eating plant-based just one day a week and to use this as an opportunity to not only understand the benefits of meat reduction for our health and the health of the plant, but to explore culinary creativity. Many favorite meals can be made plant-based. We offer a ton of cooking tips, swaps, recipes and resources to help people get started.

We suggest trying the Meatless Monday Challenge – a free 12 week email campaign delivered to your inbox each Friday. You can also find more inspiration on our Resource Center, Instagram and by signing up for the Meatless Monday newsletter.

BR: Another effective strategy for encouraging consumers to reduce meat consumption is through modifications in the food environment. When the desired food is visible, tasty, common (meaning often chosen by others) and easy to access, consumers are more likely to make the healthy, sustainable choice. This research shows that education and choice architecture strategies complement each other. By providing recipes, ideas, knowledge and community, Meatless Monday is an effective and fun step toward healthy, sustainable change.

Which are the beneficial effects of increasing beans consumption for human health and the environment? Are there recent studies providing new data?

BR: Beans are multi-talented when it comes to health and the environment. Beans are high in protein, resistant carbohydrates and fiber. They contain good amounts of important nutrients – some of which are also in animal products, such as iron and zinc, and others that are unique to plants, such as folate, fiber and polyphenols. Frequent bean consumption is linked to lower rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, healthier microbiomes, and lower BMIs. A recent dietary analysis demonstrated that bean consumers had higher quality diets overall and consumed more of several shortfall nutrients including choline, alpha-linolenic acid (a poly-unsaturated fat) folate,iron, magnesium and vitamin E.

Beans produce markedly lower amounts of greenhouse gas emissions than animal foods. Producing a serving of lentils produces 173 times less CO2 equivalents than a serving of beef. Beef and other ruminants require more than 20 times more land than pulses per unit of protein consumed, and producing 1 kg. of beef requires 15,000 liters of water, while 1 kg. of beans takes only 360 liters. Finally, beans are especially good for promoting biodiversity and soil health, thus increasing the nitrogen use efficiency, improving yield and reducing disease.

Beans have been cultivated for food over 10,000 years, and nearly every culture has a bean dish. They are versatile and can be adapted to almost any cuisine and menu. Despite the importance of beans, global consumption has not changed much over the past four decades. There are huge opportunities to promote beans for individual and planetary health.

We often overconsume proteins, especially when it comes to dietary patterns for athletes or people who aim to lose weight. What do you think about this trend?

BR: Protein needs vary from person to person depending on their health, activity and body composition; however, most Americans and Europeans (consumers in high income countries) meet or exceed protein requirements. There is also a wide range of acceptable, healthy protein intake. A person who eats 2000 calories per day could consume from 50 to 175 grams and stay within the U.S. Institute of Medicine recommendations.

While protein is an important macronutrient for growth, preservation of lean body mass and immunity, protein is plentiful in many foods we eat across all food groups. Protein from grains, vegetables and starches contribute to total protein intake along with protein from meat, seafood, dairy, beans, nuts and seeds. Diets that are diverse and well-balanced are nearly always plentiful in protein.

The current trend for prioritizing protein intake over other macronutrients and consuming well beyond requirements is based on protein’s reputation as clean, satiating and beneficial for weight loss, but it comes at a risk, particularly depending on the type of protein food people consume. For example, we know that diets high in red and processed meats are associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The proliferation of protein supplements that are under-regulated and may contain toxins and untested ingredients also carry risks. Overconsumption of protein foods can also lead to underconsumption of other healthy, nutrient rich foods, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Long term studies show that diets balanced in complex carbohydrates, proteins and healthy fats are associated with the best outcomes.

As mentioned before, beans and legumes are excellent sources of protein and do not carry the same risks as high consumption of red and processed meats. Meeting protein needs with beans, legumes, nuts and seeds is healthy for people and the planet.

Nearly 40% of Americans have heard of Meatless Monday and 1 in 5 Americans reported to have participated in Meatless Monday. Are there indicators about a decline of meat consumption in the US?

DS and BR: A once a day action is a first step toward broader actions, so it is difficult to track the actual impact of the Campaign on meat consumption. We do have research findings that confirm that people who practice Meatless Monday also reduce meat in other ways throughout the week, such as eating smaller portions, choosing meatless meals when dining out or preparing meatless meals on other days of the week. These data indicate that Meatless Monday is making an impact on how many people think about and consume meat.

In the US, meat consumption has continued to slowly increase over the last two decades. Although poultry has grown at a faster rate, pork and beef still make up the bulk of meat consumption. Interestingly, new research shows that more households are actually avoiding or decreasing meat purchases, but the increase in meat purchases across other households (by an average of 15% by weight) mask these reductions. Further analysis suggests that the share of households not buying meat was driven by a combination of price changes and cultural shifts related to age and other factors.2

BYD Overtakes Tesla in 2025 Sales

Tesla said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, a nine percent drop from the previous year. That figure placed the company behind BYD, which sold 2.26 million battery electric vehicles during the same period.

The shift marked the first time BYD has taken the global sales lead in fully electric vehicles. Tesla had held the top position for several years, supported by strong demand in the United States and Europe.

The gap between the two companies was wide. BYD sold more than 620,000 vehicles compared to Tesla during the year, reflecting its rapid expansion in both domestic and overseas markets.

Second Year of Falling Deliveries

Tesla’s 2025 results followed a weak performance in 2024, when deliveries also declined. The two-year slide marked the sharpest downturn in the company’s history since it became a mass-market manufacturer.

For the final quarter of 2025, Tesla delivered 418,227 vehicles. That total was down more than 15 per cent from the same period a year earlier and fell short of analyst expectations.

Market analysts had forecast around 440,000 deliveries for the quarter. The lower-than-expected result added to concerns about slowing consumer demand in key markets.

Tax Credits and Political Backlash

The fall in sales was partly linked to the end of a US$7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle buyers. The incentive expired at the end of September under the Trump administration, raising the effective purchase price for many customers.

Sales had surged in the third quarter as buyers rushed to secure the credit before it ended. That rush left a weaker fourth quarter, as demand cooled after the subsidy disappeared.

Tesla also faced consumer resistance tied to chief executive Elon Musk’s political positions. Public criticism of his right-wing views has led some buyers to avoid the brand, especially in Europe.

Growing Pressure From Chinese Rivals

BYD’s rise has been driven by aggressive product launches and expanding global reach. The company introduced a wide range of new models over the past five years, targeting multiple price segments.

Its overseas sales exceeded one million vehicles in 2025, with strong growth in Europe and parts of Asia. BYD has also announced new factories in Europe to reduce costs and avoid regional trade barriers.

Tesla, by contrast, has relied on existing platforms. The Model 3 and Model Y remain the company’s main products, despite being based on older designs compared with newer competitors.

Price Cuts Fail to Halt Slide

In October, Tesla introduced lower-priced versions of the Model Y and Model 3 in an effort to revive demand. The Model Y was priced just under US$40,000, while the Model 3 was listed below US$37,000.

The models were designed to compete more directly with cheaper Chinese vehicles in Europe and Asia. Even so, the move failed to prevent an overall decline in annual deliveries.

The pricing strategy has also affected profit margins, adding pressure as Tesla faces more intense competition in the global EV market.

Stock Rises Despite Weak Sales

Despite falling vehicle sales, Tesla shares ended 2025 with an overall gain of about 11 per cent. Investors continued to back the company based on expectations tied to future technology projects.

Tesla stock was down nearly three per cent in trading after the latest delivery figures were released. However, shares had reached record highs late last year.

Market analysts said investors are now more focused on Tesla’s ambitions in robotaxi services and artificial intelligence rather than its current vehicle sales.

Robotaxi and Regulatory Challenges

Tesla has begun rolling out a robotaxi service in Austin, first with safety monitors inside vehicles and later without them. The company plans to expand the service to more cities this year.

Musk has said software updates could allow hundreds of thousands of Teslas to operate without human intervention by the end of the year. The company is also planning to begin production of its driverless Cybercab in 2026.

Regulators have raised concerns about safety. Tesla is facing several federal investigations and could temporarily lose its licence to sell cars in California over claims it misled customers about vehicle safety.

Leadership and Investor Support

In November, Tesla shareholders approved a new pay package for Musk aimed at keeping him focused on the company. The package could make him the world’s first trillionaire if he sells shares in SpaceX.

Investors appear willing to accept weak car sales in exchange for long-term bets on automation and robotics. That shift has changed how markets value Tesla compared with traditional carmakers.

For now, BYD’s rapid growth has placed it firmly at the top of the global electric vehicle market, while Tesla faces mounting pressure to stabilise its core business.

FAQs

Why did Tesla lose its title as the world’s top electric vehicle maker?

Tesla was overtaken by BYD after its global electric vehicle deliveries fell in 2025 while BYD’s sales continued to rise. The change made BYD the world’s biggest EV seller for the year.

How many electric vehicles did BYD sell compared with Tesla in 2025?

BYD sold about 2.26 million electric vehicles in 2025. Tesla delivered about 1.64 million vehicles during the same period, leaving BYD well ahead in global sales.

What caused Tesla’s sales to decline?

Tesla’s sales were affected by stronger competition from Chinese and other global manufacturers, as well as the end of key electric vehicle tax credits in the United States, which made EVs more expensive for buyers.

Does BYD’s lead reflect worldwide sales?

Yes. BYD’s position as the top electric vehicle maker is based on its global sales, including strong growth in China, Europe, and other international markets.

Is this the first time Tesla has lost the global EV sales lead?

Yes. Tesla had held the top position for several years before being overtaken by BYD in 2025 on a full-year sales basis.

Does Tesla still lead in any markets?

Tesla remains a leading electric vehicle brand in several countries, including the United States. However, BYD surpassed Tesla in total worldwide electric vehicle sales during 2025.

Bull Case EV and hybrid win momentum: Net new business awards exceeding $229 million YTD on EV and hybrid platforms support the case for above-market growth.
Investment Conclusion Cooper-Standard has delivered exceptional returns over the past year, powered by margin improvement, cost-savings execution, and wins on EV programs.","ted to grow at a CAGR of about 3.7% from 2025 to 2035, helped along by electrification and tighter emissions standards. In the US, OEM production is expected to reach roughly $754.5 billion by 2033, growing at a 1.72% CAGR from 2025 to 2033.

Cooper-Standard goes up against big-name suppliers like Denso, Continental, Magna, and Faurecia. Its angle is lean manufacturing plus materials-science know-how, which it’s using to win OEM awards – particularly on hybrid and battery-electric vehicle programs.

Recent Performance

CPS has been on a tear: over the past year, it delivered a 186.6% total return, miles ahead of the S&P 500’s 16.0% gain.

The market move wasn’t just vibes – the business improved sharply too. Operating profitability stepped up as cost-savings programs and Kaizen initiatives helped margins:

Adjusted EBITDA rose by $29.4 million year-over-year to $58.7 million in Q1 2025 (that’s 8.8% of sales).

Operating income surged 539%.

In July 2025, management raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $220 million–$250 million, pointing to improving volumes and efficiency gains. And Cooper-Standard booked $132 million of net new business awards in H1 2025, a sign it’s getting more exposure to EV and hybrid platforms.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Cooper-Standard’s trailing-12-month revenue was $2.73 billion in 2024, down 3.0% from 2023, as light-vehicle production cooled in some regions.

The more recent picture looked better: in Q3 2025, sales increased 1.5% year-over-year to $695.5 million, helped by favorable volume/mix and FX tailwinds. It also reported $229 million of new business awards year-to-date, mainly tied to electrified platforms.

With industry growth expected to be modest (around 3.7% CAGR globally), Cooper-Standard’s push into hybrid and EV programs points to mid-single-digit revenue growth potential in 2026.

Quality & Moat

The headline number on quality is capital efficiency. Cooper-Standard’s ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) sits at 46.6%, far above both its five-year average of 6.2% and the market average of 11.4%.

Margins have also improved, even if they’re not “best in class” yet:

Operating margin is now positive at 4.28%.

That’s a big step up from its five-year average of –1.98%.

But it’s still below the global auto components peer average of 18.3%.

Cash generation is the other standout. Cooper-Standard’s free cash flow (FCF) yield is 60.6%, way above the market average of 2.0%, which gives it plenty of fuel for debt reduction and reinvestment.

On execution, management has delivered over $29 million in cost savings through lean initiatives and Kaizen programs, including a Champions of Excellence Award in the Czech Republic. It’s also continuing to win design-in awards with top OEMs.

Valuation

On traditional valuation metrics, CPS looks cheaper than the wider market:

Forward P/E: 19.9x, versus the market’s 26.3x, and also below peers in auto components.

EV/Sales: 0.61x, versus the market average of 4.46x and its five-year average of 0.48x.

That discount reflects real issues: cyclical exposure, elevated leverage, and a history of earnings volatility. But it may also underplay the company’s high ROIC and exceptional FCF yield.

Market Sentiment

Wall Street’s broadly constructive on CPS. Analysts mostly rate it a “Buy”, with a consensus price target near $39 – about 20% upside from current levels.

Institutional ownership is still high among automotive-focused funds, and short interest is modest. The company has also made some attention-grabbing leadership hires, including a new CIO and AI officer, pointing to a bigger push into digital manufacturing.

Sentiment has been helped by margin expansion and EV design wins, though supply-chain headwinds and inflation worries still pop up and cool things down at times.

Key Risks

Cyclical end-market exposure: Light-vehicle production cycles are sensitive to macroeconomic downturns, trade tensions, and tariffs. That can materially reduce OEM order volumes and margins.

Elevated leverage: Net debt/EBITDA of 4.75x is well above the auto-components average of 1.14x, raising interest costs and refinancing risk if rates stay high or move higher.

Profit volatility: Operating margins are still below peer averages, and profitability can swing with raw-material costs, FX movements, and customer production cuts.

High stock volatility: With a beta of 2.13 and realized volatility of 33.7% versus the market’s 22.7%, the share price can swing hard when markets get stressed.

Supply-chain and inflation risk: Inflation and logistics bottlenecks could squeeze margins if Cooper-Standard can’t fully offset them through cost-savings initiatives.

Bull Case

EV and hybrid win momentum: Net new business awards exceeding $229 million YTD on EV and hybrid platforms support the case for above-market growth.

Cost-savings and lean execution: Kaizen and digital manufacturing programs have delivered over $29 million in annual savings, supporting ongoing margin expansion.

Undemanding valuation: At a forward P/E of 19.9x and EV/Sales of 0.61x, CPS looks inexpensive versus peers when you factor in its high ROIC and free cash flow yield.

Strong free cash flow: An FCF yield of 60.6% gives the company room to pay down debt and make targeted capital investments, improving financial flexibility.

Guidance upgrades: Management raised full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $220–$250 million, which signals confidence in volumes and operating leverage.

Bear Case

Auto production downturn: If light-vehicle manufacturing slows more broadly, CPS could face order cancellations or tougher pricing.

Debt and interest burden: High leverage magnifies the downside if free cash flow unexpectedly drops, or if refinancing gets more expensive.

Competitive intensity: Bigger Tier-1 suppliers with deeper pockets could undercut pricing or win the best design slots, hurting Cooper-Standard’s share.

Margin still below peers: Operating margins of 4.3% remain far below the global auto-component average of around 18%, leaving less cushion if conditions worsen.

FX and raw-material volatility: A broad geographic footprint means more exposure to currency swings and commodity cost spikes, both of which can pressure profitability.

On Our Radar

Q4 2025 earnings release: Set for February 12, 2026. Investors will be watching the Q4 2025 results and full-year guidance update for margin and volume commentary.

2026 guidance timing: Updated FY 2026 sales and EBITDA targets are expected on the Q4 earnings call, which should clarify management’s assumptions on volume recovery.

Detroit Auto Show highlights: January 2026 auto shows may surface new OEM platform designs and awards for sealing and fluid systems, shaping future contract opportunities.

Supply-chain outlook reports: Updates from OEM customers on production planning in H1 2026 could hint at order timing and volume shifts.

Potential M&A in supply chain: Industry consolidation could open the door to bolt-on acquisitions or partnership announcements in late 2026.

Investment Conclusion

Cooper-Standard has delivered exceptional returns over the past year, powered by margin improvement, cost-savings execution, and wins on EV programs. But it’s still an auto supplier, so the business comes with the usual cyclical exposure to vehicle production. It also carries elevated leverage.

For long-term investors who want exposure to the electrification of mobility, today’s setup could still look attractive: CPS trades at a discount on valuation, while showing high ROIC and strong free cash flow generation.

EVXL’s Take I’ve spent the last year documenting Tesla’s sales crisis across every major market.","I’ve been tracking this collision for months, and now it’s official: the company that defined the EV revolution just lost its crown while Wall Street threw a party. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries dropped 8.6% to 1.64 million vehicles, handing BYD the title of world’s largest electric vehicle maker by a margin of more than 620,000 units. Yet Tesla stock touched $489.88 last month, an all-time high.

That disconnect tells you everything you need to know about where Tesla is headed, and what it means for anyone considering a Tesla purchase or investment.

What: BYD sold 2.26 million BEVs in 2025, surpassing Tesla’s 1.64 million deliveries for the first time on an annual basis

Who: Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose focus has shifted to robotaxis and humanoid robots, versus BYD, the Chinese automaker Musk laughed at in a 2011 interview

When: Tesla reported Q4 2025 deliveries on January 2, 2026, confirming 418,227 deliveries (down 15.6% YoY)

Why it matters: Tesla’s stock price is decoupling from its automotive business, investors are betting on robotaxi and Optimus robot revenue that doesn’t exist yet

The numbers come from Reuters reporting and company disclosures released this week.

The Numbers Nobody Wants to Talk About

Global EV sales grew 28% in 2025. BYD’s battery-electric sales grew 27.9%. Tesla’s deliveries dropped 8.6%. That’s not a company facing headwinds. That’s a company going backward while the market surges forward.

The fourth quarter was particularly brutal. Tesla delivered 418,227 vehicles, down 15.6% from 495,570 a year earlier and missing even the lowered analyst estimate of 434,487. For perspective, Tesla published those pessimistic analyst estimates on its own investor relations website, a first for the company, and still came in below them.

Tesla’s full-year 2025 deliveries of 1.64 million compare to 1.79 million in 2024, which was already a 1% decline from 2023. Two consecutive years of falling sales, the biggest annual drop in company history, and the stock is near record highs.

Why Wall Street Doesn’t Care About Car Sales Anymore

Here’s the quote that captures everything: “Investors are so focused on the future with Tesla that they are ignoring delivery numbers. It’s about Optimus, Robotaxi and physical AI,” said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading, which owns Tesla shares.

Tesla shares fell about 2% on the delivery news, then recovered. The stock finished 2025 with an 11% gain despite posting its worst sales performance ever. That’s not normal market behavior for an automaker. It’s how investors treat a technology company with automotive revenue they’re willing to ignore.

This is the logical endpoint of what we documented when shareholders approved Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package while European sales cratered. Investors aren’t buying Tesla the car company. They’re buying Tesla the robotics company, the AI company, the energy storage company. The automotive business is just overhead to them.

The Tax Credit Hangover We Predicted

We’ve been warning about this since July. The September 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit was always going to create a Q3 pull-forward followed by a Q4 collapse. Tesla’s record third-quarter deliveries of 497,099 vehicles were artificial, buyers rushing to lock in $7,500 before it vanished.

Now the hangover is here. The Reuters report notes Tesla’s Q4 figures “come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in $7,500 in federal tax credits after President Donald Trump’s administration decided to pull the plug on the incentive in September.”

U.S. EVs accounted for just 6.2% of retail vehicle sales in Q4, down 3.6 percentage points from a year earlier. Average transaction prices rose nearly $6,000 to $53,300, according to J.D. Power. Without subsidies, EVs got more expensive and sold worse. This is exactly what we predicted when we covered Trump’s replacement tax break that offers maybe $660 in actual savings to middle-income buyers.

BYD: The Company Musk Laughed At

In October 2011, Bloomberg TV asked Elon Musk about BYD as a competitor. He laughed and said, “I don’t think they have a great product.”

Fourteen years later, BYD outsold Tesla by more than 620,000 battery-electric vehicles in a single year. BYD’s BEV sales hit 2.26 million units, up 27.9% year-over-year. Their overseas sales surpassed 1 million units for the first time, up 150% from the previous year. They’re building factories in Hungary, Turkey, and potentially Spain to neutralize EU tariffs.

As we documented in October, BYD launches cars twice as fast as Tesla. They introduced at least 17 SUV models from 2020 through 2025, roughly double the number of redesigned Ford SUVs in that period. Tesla, meanwhile, killed its $25,000 Model 2 project and is still selling the same Model 3 and Model Y platforms designed between 2017 and 2020.

The contrast couldn’t be starker. BYD is flooding every segment with fresh products. Tesla is relying on cost-cut versions of aging models while its CEO talks about robots.

What This Means for Tesla Buyers and Owners

If you’re considering a Tesla, understand what you’re buying into. The company’s leadership and investors are explicitly focused on robotaxis, humanoid robots, and AI, not on improving the Model Y you’re about to purchase. The stripped-down versions Tesla introduced in October, priced under $40,000 for Model Y and under $37,000 for Model 3, are cost-cut variants of existing platforms, not new vehicles.

For current Tesla owners, this matters for resale values. Tesla’s declining market share, particularly the 48.5% European sales collapse we documented in November, puts downward pressure on used Tesla prices. When the market leader is going backward while competitors surge forward, your three-year-old Model 3 faces stiffer competition from both new Teslas and new rivals.

Europe is particularly brutal. Tesla’s new vehicle registrations for the first 11 months of 2025 totaled just 203,382 units, a 28% decrease from 282,335 units in the same period of 2024. BYD’s European registrations in that same period hit 159,869 units, up 276%.

EVXL’s Take

I’ve spent the last year documenting Tesla’s sales crisis across every major market. Europe down 48.5%. China at three-year lows. The U.S. market collapsing after the tax credit expired. The numbers tell a consistent story: Tesla is losing the automotive race while betting everything on products that don’t exist yet.

Here’s what I expect: Tesla’s Q1 2026 will be ugly. Without tax credits pulling demand forward, without fresh products to excite buyers, and with Musk’s focus visibly elsewhere, deliveries will struggle. Analysts are already projecting a 3% drop in Q4 sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share. If Q1 confirms that trajectory, even the robotaxi believers will start asking questions.

The irony is thick. Tesla created the modern EV market. They proved electric cars could be desirable, not just dutiful. And now they’re abandoning that market to chase robots and AI while BYD, the company Musk laughed at, takes the crown Tesla worked a decade to build.

For prospective buyers, the calculus has changed. You’re not buying from the market leader anymore. You’re buying from a company whose investors have explicitly told you they don’t care about cars. Whether that matters to you depends on whether you’re buying a Tesla for the product or for the brand. The product hasn’t fundamentally changed since 2020. The brand is now something else entirely.

He Says He'll Do It in Venezuela.,"Anton Troianovski, www.nytimes.com, anton-troianovski",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/us/politics/trump-venezuela-oil.html,"While he was out of office, President Trump mused about what would have happened if the United States had taken control of Venezuela.
“It would have been right next door.” On Saturday, Mr. Trump made it clear that he now intends to follow through.
Before Venezuela nationalized its oil industry in 1976, American companies like Exxon, Mobil and Gulf Oil were major players.
U.S. oil giants like Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips claimed they were owed billions of dollars in compensation because their operations were seized.
Chevron has in recent years been the only U.S. oil company operating in Venezuela, thanks to permission from the governments of both countries to produce and export oil there.","While he was out of office, President Trump mused about what would have happened if the United States had taken control of Venezuela.

“We would have gotten all that oil,” he said in a speech at the North Carolina Republican Convention in 2023. “It would have been right next door.”

On Saturday, Mr. Trump made it clear that he now intends to follow through.

In the last year, as the Trump administration built up pressure against Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leader, the president and his top aides said that the aggressive U.S. actions were necessary to curb drugs and migration from that country. But on Saturday, as Mr. Trump discussed the predawn attack on Venezuela that led to the capture of its leader, it was evident that the president’s longtime fixation on oil was a driving factor in his decision to greenlight the mission.

“We’re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he celebrated the seizure of Mr. Maduro, promising that American companies would be able to tap more of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.

The money made, he said, would go not only to the people of Venezuela, but also to American oil companies and “to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement for the damages caused us by that country.”

There was little immediate clarity as to how the White House envisions the United States profiting from Venezuela’s oil. Analysts warn that large increases to the country’s oil production could take years and tens of billions of dollars in spending. But Mr. Trump indicated that the country’s oil wealth was a key factor not only in his decision to attack, but also in pledging that the United States would “run” Venezuela for the foreseeable future.

“It won’t cost us anything because the money coming out of the ground is very substantial,” Mr. Trump said, adding that “we’re going to get reimbursed for everything that we spend.”

Venezuela has about 17 percent of the world’s known oil reserves, or more than 300 billion barrels, more than any other country. But its production is only about 1 percent of the world total.

Before Venezuela nationalized its oil industry in 1976, American companies like Exxon, Mobil and Gulf Oil were major players. The country reopened its oil industry to foreign drillers in the 1990s, but Hugo Chávez, Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, began another phase of nationalization in 2007. U.S. oil giants like Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips claimed they were owed billions of dollars in compensation because their operations were seized.

That history feeds the Trump administration’s contention that Venezuela stole oil from the United States — an argument that the White House increasingly made in the weeks leading up to Saturday’s attack. Stephen Miller, the senior Trump adviser central to the president’s immigration crackdown, posted on social media last month that “American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela.”

“If you remember, they took all of our energy rights; they took all of our oil from not that long ago,” Mr. Trump said last month. “And we want it back.”

Laying claim to other countries’ oil has long been a fixture in Mr. Trump’s rhetoric.

“I’ve been saying it for years. Take the oil,” he told The New York Times in 2016, when asked how his strategy to fight the Islamic State in the Middle East would differ from President Barack Obama’s approach.

As the Trump administration increased its pressure on Mr. Maduro during the last year, oil was not initially central to its public rationale. Instead, the White House focused on claims that Mr. Maduro had directed drug trafficking and gang members who migrated to the United States — some of which have been disputed by Mr. Trump’s own intelligence agencies. When Mr. Trump said in March that he would impose tariffs on countries that buy Venezuelan oil, he said he was doing it because, he claimed, Venezuela had “purposefully and deceitfully” sent “murderers and people of a very violent nature” to the United States.

But behind the scenes, as The Times reported last month, the future of Venezuela’s oil was central to Mr. Trump’s deliberations as early as last spring. The White House saw the pressure campaign against Venezuela as a way to combine three separate policy goals: crippling Mr. Maduro, using military force against drug cartels and securing access to Venezuela’s oil reserves for U.S. companies.

Chevron has in recent years been the only U.S. oil company operating in Venezuela, thanks to permission from the governments of both countries to produce and export oil there. Chevron’s activities played into the White House deliberations, as the company lobbied the White House for an extension of the Biden-era license that allowed it to expand its operations in Venezuela, as The Times previously reported.

However, on Saturday, Chevron was circumspect, even after Mr. Trump said that U.S. companies would soon spend “billions of dollars” on Venezuela’s oil infrastructure.

The company initially sent reporters a statement saying it was “prepared to work constructively with the U.S. government during this period, leveraging our experience and presence to strengthen U.S. energy security.” It later said the statement was incorrect and issued a new one that removed mention of the U.S. government.

“Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,” the company said. “We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.”

This is why permitting reform — the process of streamlining and speeding up government approval for clean energy projects and infrastructure — is essential to address our emerging electricity demand crisis in Virginia.

The energy sector is a permit-rich environment. From siting a new electricity generation facility, to long-distance transmission lines and local distribution networks, permits play a key role at every stage. It can take a decade or more for energy projects to move from start of construction to full operation and the permit process is a large part of that. The need to alleviate these bottlenecks is why I and others with Citizens’ Climate Lobby are asking Congress to pass bipartisan permitting reform.

Such reform measures must balance environmental protection with economic growth by setting a reasonable statute of limitations for judicial review under the National Environmental Policy Act. Reform should streamline interstate transmission permits while giving states the initial authority with the federal government intervening if the states need assistance in the permitting process. Accelerating the process for rejected as well as accepted projects means that time and resources are not wasted on projects that are ultimately rejected.

All this can be facilitated by early community input and full transparency. This is especially true for communities that do not directly benefit from infrastructure such as transmission lines but that would be affected by their construction and operation. Permits for simple updates or low-impact projects should be considered under categorical exclusions that allow for a simpler, streamlined process.

Permitting reform is deeply connected to our effort to solve the climate change threat. Virginians who live in the western mountains and the Tidewater region have experienced the effects of a changing climate through flash floods in the west and sea level rise in the east. Extreme weather events result in higher food prices and insurance rates for automobiles and homes. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, from 1970 to 2025 Virginia’s cooling degree days — when extra energy is needed for air conditioning — increased by 47%, slightly less than 1% per year. While climate change helps drive summer cooling demand, most of the projects slowed by permitting obstacles involve cheaper clean energy. Getting these sources of energy on the grid faster will reduce our need for heat-trapping fossil fuels and contribute to price stability.

Electricity prices in Virginia have risen substantially. Historical data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicates that between 2000 and 2024 Virginia residential electricity prices almost doubled (92%) or more than 2.5% per year. In 2023, according to EIA, Virginia was the top importer of electricity from other states. Also, between 2019 and 2023, Virginia’s commercial sector had the largest growth in electricity demand of any state, largely due to data centers. All this makes Virginia particularly vulnerable to the permitting process in place and is a real threat to sustained economic growth.

There is positive bipartisan support for permitting reform. The Congressional Problem Solvers Caucus has proposed a framework for moving forward and the National Governors Association has written a letter supporting action. Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and the incoming General Assembly will work on the data center issues, but Congress has authority on permitting that they lack.

Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner have a history of bipartisanship. Although these are partisan times, it is my hope that Virginia’s members of Congress will negotiate in good faith to control rising costs and bring new clean energy sources and technologies to consumers.

Tesla's sales fell in 2025, ceding its position as the world's biggest electric vehicle maker for the year to Chinese auto giant BYD.

The American company led by Elon Musk said on Friday it logged 418,227 deliveries in the final three months of the year, taking its full-year sales figure to around 1.64 million EVs.

This marked a drop in sales of more than 8 percent compared with 2024.

A day prior, BYD said it sold 2.26 million EVs last year.

Analysts had expected Tesla's sales in the final quarter to slow less, to 449,000, according to a FactSet consensus.

The pullback comes amid the elimination of a US$7,500 US tax credit at the end of September, with industry watchers noting it will take time for EV demand to rebalance.

But even before then, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over political support by Musk, the company's chief executive, of US President Donald Trump and other far-right politicians.

Tesla has also been grappling with rising competition from BYD, other Chinese companies and from European giants.

Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid cars, unveiled record EV sales in the past year on Thursday.

Known as ""Biyadi"" in Chinese – or by the English slogan ""Build Your Dreams"" – BYD was founded in 1995 and originally specialised in battery manufacturing.

The automotive juggernaut has come to dominate China's highly competitive market for new energy vehicles, a term used to describe various vehicles from fully electric ones to plug-in hybrids. China is the world's largest market for new energy vehicles.

BYD is now looking to expand its presence overseas, as increasingly price-wary consumption patterns in China weigh on profitability.

While BYD and other Chinese EV producers come up against hefty tariffs in the United States, the company's success is picking up in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and in Europe.

Tesla only narrowly beat BYD in annual EV sales in 2024, with the US company's 1.79 million outpacing the latter's 1.76 million.

Tesla shares closed 2.6 percent down in New York on Friday.

Analysts at Wedbush Securities noted that Tesla's quarterly sales figure remained better than some had speculated.

They flagged that the company faces a ""more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries"".

The company still sees challenges obtaining certain regulatory approval in Europe – relating to self-driving technology – with sales potentially rebounding once the regulatory hurdles are cleared.

""Sales around smaller and emerging markets have started to see larger growth metrics than expectations which look to offset the declines in key regions like China and Europe,"" Wedbush analysts said.

2026 Outlook Wall Street has grown increasingly skeptical about Tesla’s 2026 sales prospects.","Tesla Inc. ceded the title of world’s top seller of electric cars to China’s BYD Co., squandering a lead the Elon Musk-led company built as it popularized plug-in vehicles over the past decade.

The US automaker reported a 16% decline in fourth quarter deliveries, trailing analyst estimates. For the year, Tesla sales slid almost 9%, its second consecutive annual drop.

BYD, by contrast, increased battery-electric vehicle sales both for the quarter and the full year, delivering almost 2.26 million EVs in 2025 to Tesla’s 1.64 million.

Investors have paid little mind of late to Tesla’s decline in the global EV pecking order, with Musk prioritizing artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. The chief executive officer has drawn attention away from Tesla’s core business by touting progress in his longstanding effort to start a robotaxi service.

Standing up those operations will be crucial in 2026 given the outlook for EV demand in the US, Tesla’s largest market. President Donald Trump’s administration has ceased federal incentives supporting plug-in vehicle purchases and hollowed out fuel economy and emissions regulations that had generated billions of dollars in revenue for the company.

“Deliveries barely matter anymore,” Alexander Potter, an analyst with the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, said in a note Friday. Instead, the performance of Tesla’s shares in 2026 “should be driven by progress in AI and robotics.”

AI Emphasis

Wall Street had been bracing for a “hangover” for Tesla after tax credits for EV purchases ended in the US, William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a note. He similarly posited that the company “is valued almost entirely on the transformation to real-world AI.”

Tesla shares fell 2.8% as of 1:35 p.m. Friday in New York. The stock advanced 11% last year, paring gains after hitting an all-time high in mid-December.

BYD pulled away from Tesla last year after coming up just shy of the world leader in 2024. While the Chinese manufacturer delivered more fully electric cars in the fourth quarter of that year, Tesla maintained a slim lead on an annual basis.

In addition to selling far more EVs in China — where some of its cars are far cheaper than Tesla’s most affordable vehicle, the Model 3 — BYD has been surging in Europe.

Through the first 11 months of last year, BYD registered more cars than Tesla in both Germany and the UK, the region’s two biggest EV markets. Tesla’s sales across Europe fell 28% during that span, and the company posted steep December declines in France, Spain and Sweden.

2026 Outlook

Wall Street has grown increasingly skeptical about Tesla’s 2026 sales prospects. This time two years ago, analysts were predicting Tesla would deliver more than 3 million vehicles. The average estimate has plunged to around 1.8 million.

Tesla’s energy storage battery business, on the other hand, has never been stronger.

The company deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of energy storage products last quarter, up from the 11 gigawatt hours a year earlier. Total deployments for the year jumped almost 50% to 46.7 gigawatt hours.

“The sustained growth of energy storage reflects structural tailwinds from AI-driven electricity demand, which is driving incremental storage requirements to support data center buildouts and power grid stabilization,” Tom Narayan, an RBC Capital Markets analyst with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla’s stock, said in a note.

Tesla ended last year by building anticipation for Cybercab, a two-seat compact car with butterfly doors. While prototypes have lacked a steering wheel or pedals, Tesla’s board chair Robyn Denholm told Bloomberg News in October that the company will sell the car with those components if required by regulators.

While Tesla began driverless testing with Model Ys in Austin late last month, consumers thus far are only able to summon rides from small numbers of cars in the Texas capital and the San Francisco Bay area with safety supervisors in the front seats.

For his part, Musk is optimistic about the year ahead.

“Great work by @Tesla team in 2025,” he wrote this week on X. “2026 will be epic!”

Chevron, the only US oil company still operating in Venezuela, committed only to following “relevant laws and regulations” after the US president suggested American energy multinationals would be central to his plans for the country.

Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – reputedly the world’s largest – will be modernized and exploited, Trump claimed in interviews and a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate. US oil firms will invest heavily to reconstruct “rotted” infrastructure, ramp up production and sell “large amounts … to other countries”, he told reporters, adding: “We’re in the oil business.”

“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies – the biggest anywhere in the world – go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure and start making money for the country,” the president said. The firms would be “reimbursed”, he added, without providing more detail.

ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil company, and ConocoPhillips, another major player, did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokesperson for Chevron said: “Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.”

Venezuela​ moved to nationalize its oil industry some 50 years ago, and​ later ​seized control of operations still run under private arrangements​ in 2007. While Chevron agreed to remain, others including ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips​ refused to accept new terms.

ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips engaged in a years-long legal battle with Venezuela after exiting, and were ultimately awarded billions of dollars by the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes. But Venezuela, with an economy battered by sanctions, mismanagement and corruption, has yet to pay all the money.

For now, a US embargo on all Venezuelan oil remains in full effect, according to Trump, whose administration has repeatedly accused the country of stealing American wealth and property by seizing control of the reserves. As the US moves to take them back, its next steps will be closely scrutinized amid questions over the legality of Trump’s vision.

Trump’s suggestion that US oil majors would play a key role in Venezuela prompted analysts to conclude their executives had likely been consulted ahead of time.

“My hunch is that, if President Trump said this publicly, probably there was already an agreement with the US companies,” Jorge León, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, an industry consultancy, said. Tina Fordham, a geopolitical strategist and consultant, said: “One assumes that they have been part of the conversation.”

The White House did not comment on whether it consulted US oil giants before the strike.

Administration officials have in recent weeks told US oil executives that, if they want compensation for rigs, pipelines and other seized property in Venezuela, they must return and invest heavily, according to Politico, which cited two unnamed sources familiar with the conversations.

Venezuela holds some 17% of global oil reserves, according to the Energy Institute. But its output, as high as 3.5m barrels per day in the 1970s, fell dramatically due to decades of mismanagement, corruption and underinvestment. Production from Venezuela was around 1.m barrels per day, around 1% of the world’s output, last year.

Taking production in the country back to anywhere near its previous levels is widely expected to require huge investment. Returning to 2m barrels per day by the early 2030s would require an estimated $110bn, according to Rystad.

“I don’t think companies will rush back into the country,” said León, who suggested it would be “very, very tricky” for Venezuela to attract the private investment required to dramatically increase oil production.

He added: “Companies, before rushing back into the country, will want to see the country is stable enough. The fact this industry was nationalized by [Hugo] Chávez a few years ago, that remains in the back of their minds. They will really want to see things improving.”

The global oil market is “entering into a period of oversupply”, said León. “Prices will come down and will continue to come down … That means that oil companies will be very, very selective of where they invest, in a period of lower prices. Given the choice, they will probably want to go investing in places they already know.”

But other industry observers expect oil majors to jostle for a chance to operate in Venezuela. The country now amounts to “a huge opportunity” for big firms, said Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight. “There will be immense competition between them for the best opportunities.”

On Saturday morning, Trump hailed “one of the most stunning, effective and powerful displays of American military, might and competence” in history.

But in corporate boardrooms and beyond, memories of other toppled dictators – including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya – where the aftermath proved complicated, loom large.

“The history of post-authoritarian transitions, whether they are organic or externally brought about, is long and non-linear,” said Fordham. “Trump appears to have complete faith that, under him, things will be different.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15118474f58139106fad851dc9471f1b12314098/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=948ee7fe7753fec755aabada8c46649d",N,,2026-01-03 18:12:45.392814

A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.
The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.","SEATTLE (AP) — Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are suing the Trump administration for what they say is the unlawful withholding of over $2 billion in funding for two electric vehicle charging programs.

A federal lawsuit filed Dec. 16 in Seattle is the latest legal battle that Democratic-led states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”

“The Trump administration’s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. “This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several Biden-era policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks in favor of policies that align with Trump’s oil and gas industry agenda.

Transportation Department officials did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states — Georgia, Illinois, Maryland and Wisconsin — have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

The new lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

After returning to office last January, Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden’s “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the United States to be electric by 2030, his policies did not force American consumers to buy EVs or automakers to sell them.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV adoption, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix.

Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase, a program that congressional Republicans ended last fall.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent — to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the United States as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs sold for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Last month, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

Last spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/bllxir-6bknX0i65DjubO_6P44I=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/LDW3TZY54NEUTEAZ5TX7CKT36Q.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 17:58:38.518411

The Green Fee increases the Transient Accommodations Tax by .75% to an 11% rate statewide. This fee will be applied to costs for tourism-related activities including hotels and short-term rentals. But on New Year’s Eve, a federal judge blocked one portion of the law from taking effect: specifically, the portion that would have introduced an 11% tax on cruise ship passenger bills.

That provision had faced pushback from the cruise industry earlier this year.

Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) sued the state in August, arguing the fee unfairly targets cruise passengers and will add hundreds of dollars to the price of Hawaii cruises. And in November, the U.S. Department of Justice also filed a motion in the Hawaii District Court asking a federal judge to let the federal government intervene in the cruise industry’s lawsuit against the Green Fee. The DOJ has argued that Hawaii doesn’t have the power the charge cruise ships this kind of fee, saying only Congress can approve taxes and charges on vessels when they enter a port.

A district judge denied CLIA’s request for an injunction in December, court documents show. But on Dec. 31, the Ninth Appellate Court granted an injunction after an appeal.

The CLIA applauded the decision in a statement shared with Nexstar.

“This case involves important questions about how federal and state laws interact in regulating maritime commerce — principles rooted in long-standing constitutional safeguards that protect free and open ports nationwide,” reads a statement from a CLIA spokesperson. “On behalf of its member cruise lines, CLIA will continue to pursue this matter constructively through the courts while working with Hawai‘i to support local communities and sustainable tourism.”

Hawaii Governor Josh Green and other lawmakers in support of the Green Fee had argued that the taxes were needed to mitigate environmental effects caused by tourism.

The revenue generated from the new Green Fee was projected to raise an estimated $100 million a year to address what the state says is about half a billion dollars in critical funding needed to protect Hawaii’s environment. The areas of priority are protecting land and aquatic resources, climate and hazard resiliency and sustainable tourism.

“We must protect and preserve Hawaiʻi’s natural resources and safeguard the health of our residents,” Green previously said. “Visitors who benefit from our island’s resources have a shared responsibility to help preserve them. The Green Fee ensures that the resources needed to protect Hawaiʻi are available for future generations.”

Toni Schwartz, a spokesperson for the Hawaii attorney general’s office, believes it’s only a matter of time before the entire Green Fee is enforced.

“We are aware of the Ninth Circuit’s order granting an injunction that temporarily enjoins (halts) enforcement of Act 96 with respect to cruise ships while the appeals process moves forward,” Schwartz said in a statement shared with Nexstar’s KHON. “We remain confident that Act 96 is lawful and will be vindicated when the expedited appeal is heard on the merits.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2026/01/CruiseShipHawaiiGettyImages-1721432968-e1767205449834.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-03 22:12:37.268790

Many communities are resisting both data centers and their dirty emissions — from Memphis, Tennessee, to Bessemer, Alabama, to Santa Teresa, Arizona.","“The demand for power and for AI is like nothing I’ve ever seen.”

These words were uttered during an October earnings call, not by a wide-eyed tech executive, but by Jeff Miller, the CEO of Halliburton, one of the world’s biggest oilfield services corporations.

Like droves of other companies tied to the fracked gas industry, Halliburton is pivoting toward servicing the data center boom with new loads of methane-emitting, gas-fired power generation to feed the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble being stoked by Silicon Valley billionaires and allied corporate elites.

Halliburton is merely one of many fossil fuel companies that are striking deals to power the insatiable electricity needs of data centers. More specifically, the natural gas industry — frackers, gasfield services, pipeline companies, power suppliers — are positioning themselves as bold saviors ready to step in and meet AI’s bottomless energy demands.

In doing this, fracked gas companies are fully backed by the Trump administration, with its ideological dedication to fossil fuels and its cozy relationship with billionaire oil and gas donors. For its part, Big Tech is going along, largely sidelining its purported commitments to renewable energy.

As the global climate emergency intensifies, none of this bodes well. Despite being sold as a “clean” fossil fuel, fracked gas emits loads of methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and local communities — often rural, low-income, and predominantly Black — bear the brunt of the combined nexus of data center behemoths and fossil fuel power generation being constructed in their backyards.

“The natural gas industry is directly aligning with the data center industry,” Tyson Slocum, the director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, told Truthout. “From a climate perspective, and from a local environmental perspective, data centers represent a significant impediment to action on climate change.”

“Icing on the Cake”

Natural gas currently provides over 40 percent of the electricity for data centers, making gas-fired power stations their largest power source, according to the International Energy Agency.

The massive demand for electricity from data centers is driving a surge in the construction of power generation infrastructure fueled by natural gas.

One McKinsey analyst recently noted that over 100 gigawatts (GW) of new gas-fired projects are being planned. “To put that number in perspective,” he said, “over the last five years, the U.S. added only about 35 GW of gas,” meaning this is “almost triple what it was.”

Utilities announced a slew of new gas-fired power projects in 2025 — a factor that helps explain private equity’s rush to acquire utilities. Utility powering of data centers is expected to skyrocket by 22 percent this year.

Industry leaders are swooning. “It’s been 40 or 50 years, or so, since we’ve seen demand grow the way it’s growing and is expected to grow,” said one executive of energy giant NRG.

“AI is obviously a big part,” he added.

The core driver of the fracked gas industry over the past decade has been the booming production of liquified natural gas (LNG) for export, which has vastly accelerated since the Obama administration. Today, the U.S. leads the world in natural gas production and exports.

While LNG exports are unrivaled as “the demand driver and the profit center for the domestic natural gas industry,” says Slocum, data centers “provide a significant additional profit cushion.”

“Data centers are far and away the largest variable that is increasing electricity demand,” he said. “They’re sort of the icing on the cake.”

“Help Nourish That Appetite”

With 3 million miles of gas pipelines tightly networked across the country, Slocum says the fracked gas industry has positioned itself as the prime supplier for powering data centers.

This is seen through a flurry of data center deals struck by corporations across the fracked gas supply chain — independent drillers, oil and gas majors, pipeline companies, and oilfield services companies.

EQT, a top U.S. natural producer based in Western Pennsylvania, the heart of the vast Marcellus Shale formation, struck a deal to supply two huge data center hubs in Appalachia — the Shippingport and Homer City projects — with a combined 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of gas supplies.

“Just to put this in perspective, that’s enough natural gas to power two of New York City,” gloated EQT CEO Toby Rice, who also added that Homer City and Shippingport are “just the first steps of multiple steps in multiple projects.”

EQT is hardly alone. Fracking giants like EOG and Antero Resources are striking deals to position themselves to supply data centers. Comstock Resources, owned by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, is partnering with utility giant NextEra to “keep the lights on at a plethora of data centers” in Texas, says Natural Gas Intelligence.

Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil and gas company, is getting in the game. “AI data centers require massive amounts of energy to function,” the company gushed in a February press release.

But have no fear, they promised. “Chevron is tapping into natural gas to help nourish that appetite,” the oil giant declared, announcing a new deal to build gas-fired power plants for data centers.

“Unleashing American Energy”

While the massive energy demands of artificial intelligence are pulling the fracking industry toward data centers, the Trump administration’s policies are also playing a critical role.

“National policy under Trump is prioritizing fossil fuels for data center development” and “particularly natural gas,” Slocum told Truthout.

“It’s explicit in Trump’s July executive order on artificial intelligence, where he defines the criteria that data centers need to meet to qualify for expedited approval, and it lists every energy source except wind and solar,” Slocum added.

That July 2025 executive order, titled “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure,” clearly emphasizes the role of fossil fuels in powering data centers. It defines “Covered Components” — the “materials, products, and infrastructure that are required to build Data Center Projects” — using language that foregrounds “energy infrastructure” like “natural gas pipelines or laterals” and “natural gas turbines” and “coal power equipment” with no mention of words like “wind” or “solar.”

As Slocum has written, “a data center proposed to be powered by wind and solar will not qualify for expedited treatment, whereas a fossil fuel powered facility would,” adding that fossil fuel-powered data centers could also qualify for direct federal subsidies.

This codification of national policy around fossil fuels as the core supplier of data centers aligns with Donald Trump’s campaign promise to “Drill Baby Drill” and his adamantly pro-fossil fuel January 2025 executive order on “Unleashing American Energy.”

Since taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has gone to war against renewable energy, freezing permits around solar and wind projects and denigrating windmills.

Trump and the Fossil Fuel CEOs

Trump’s ideological commitment to feeding data centers with fossil fuel-powered electricity is wedded to his cozy relationship with the fracking billionaires who helped bankroll his 2024 reelection.

Trump saw oil and gas barons as a key constituency during his 2024 reelection campaign, and industry billionaires like Harold Hamm and Kelcy Warren showered Trump with millions in donations.

As Truthout has previously noted, Trump filled out his cabinet with fossil fuel executives and boosters, including Chris Wright, the fracking-liquid-guzzling former CEO of Liberty Energy, who Trump made energy secretary.

Since then, the fossil fuel industry has benefited handsomely from Trump’s policies of environmental deregulation and tax subsidies — and a bonanza of new business tied to data centers.

Warren is the co-founder and executive chairman of pipeline giant Energy Transfer and a longtime Trump ally. Energy Transfer is awash in new business supplying data centers from Texas to Arizona and is partnering with AI giants like Oracle.

Hamm is the founder and former CEO of fracking giant Continental Resources, and is a major Trump donor who is also backing Trump’s White House ballroom. He may be Trump’s biggest fossil fuel industry ally.

“Together,” writes The New York Times, Trump and Hamm “have remade federal policy to benefit oil and gas companies, including Mr. Hamm’s Continental, and put off the transition to greener alternatives like solar power and batteries.”

The Hamm Institute for American Energy, a research and policy hub funded by Hamm, who also serves on its board, has supported natural gas for powering AI and hosted an April event on “powering AI” that featured key Trump cabinet members leading the administration’s energy policies.

Liberty Energy — again, formerly led by Trump Energy Secretary Chris Wright — is also striking deals to power data centers in Pennsylvania.

“The only thing that’ll prevent us from leading in AI is the failure to build this electric generating capacity that needs to happen,” Wright recently raved to the Council on Foreign Relations, adding that he was “using emergency powers to stop [the] closure of coal plants” and “expediting the permitting of building of new plants.”

Big Tech’s Conformity

For its part, Big Tech has quickly backtracked on its net zero commitments as it embraces gas-fired power generation for data centers.

For example, Entergy, a power generation behemoth that relies mostly on fossil fuels, is currently constructing three massive gas-fired plants to power a $10 billion Meta data center in Louisiana.

Less than a decade ago, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg waxed about addressing the climate crisis. Fast forward to today, and headlines like “Meta goes all in on gas to power a mega data center” are being published, while Zuckerberg and Meta are being lambasted by lawmakers, energy analysts, and community groups.

This fits a larger pattern, which Truthout has reported on, of Silicon Valley CEOs backtracking on purported climate aims and criticism of Trump to remain the president’s good graces and profit off his policies.

“Trump demands conformity, and Big Tech is providing that conformity by turning its back on its traditional commitments to increase and rely upon renewable energy,” said Slocum.

Of course, all this will exacerbate the climate crisis. The production, transport, and burning of natural gas releases huge amounts of methane, which is 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere.

Under Trump, data centers are also giving new life to dying and dirty coal plants, and many data centers are backed up by super-polluting diesel generators that some fear could come to be used more frequently.

As journalist Adam Mahoney has reported, in states like South Carolina and Texas, Black households disproportionately bear the brunt of the data center boom and AI’s growing fossil fuel emissions trail, especially with on-site power generation.

Many communities are resisting both data centers and their dirty emissions — from Memphis, Tennessee, to Bessemer, Alabama, to Santa Teresa, Arizona.

To be sure, Big Tech firms are also partnering on some projects with renewable energy sources to service data centers. While U.S. data centers are overwhelmingly powered by fossil fuel sources, the International Energy Agency notes that the proportion of solar, wind, and other renewables involved will increase going into the 2030s and beyond.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2245882134.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 16:57:52.693095

NEW YORK: Tesla lost its crown as the world’s best-selling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier. Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker. It’s a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world’s richest man.

The sales drop came despite President Donald Trump’s marketing effort early last year when he called a press conference to praise Musk as a “patriot” in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September. Tesla stock fell 2.6% to $438.07 on Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along. Musk said earlier last year that a “major rebound” in sales was underway, but investors were unruffled when that didn’t pan out, choosing instead to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business. He has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory and much less with car sales.",https://sundayguardianlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image_6.png,N,,2026-01-03 19:57:39.697589

WATERTOWN, S.D. – In South Dakota, where the state’s proportion of clean energy production is the highest in the country, students are taking advantage of growing energy workforce needs.

Lake Area Technical College, which has two degree-providing programs in the energy sector, has seen students with renewed interest in the industry thanks to both its growth and opportunity in the state.

Brooks Jacobsen, energy department supervisor at Lake Area Tech, told News Watch that the school’s energy operations and energy technology programs have 100% job placement rates. According to Lake Area Tech’s website, the energy technology program has an average salary of $71,000 after six months of employment.

Jacobsen said that the exposure students get to various energy sectors, including hydroelectricity, coal, wind and solar energy, allow them to be more flexible when searching for the right career.

“They’ll go do an interview or a job shadow on (a specific energy sector) and they’ll just love it, and they never thought they would. We try to keep an open mind, try to pre-teach these students that there are these capabilities all over the state,” Jacobsen said.

News Watch spoke to three students about their decision to enter the energy sector and the opportunities that the state provides for their futures. Here are their stories.

Lakshan Sethuhewa: “Energy is everywhere”

Lakshan Sethuhewa, a 29-year-old student from Sri Lanka, came to Lake Area Tech after a tour that showed him the “sophisticated program.” Now in his second year, Sethuhewa said he already has a job as a refrigeration expert lined up at the soon-to-open CJ Schwan’s Foods production facility in Sioux Falls.

He said that all of his classmates have job prospects, and that choosing energy was in part due to the vast employment opportunities the field offers.

Sethuhewa is a student in the energy operations program, which trains students to manage energy facilities and operate plants. He described the program as “hands-on and minds-on,” and appreciated how his education could translate globally.

“You can practice energy everywhere in the world. Whether you want to go to Europe, South Asia, energy is everywhere,” Sethuhewa said.

Quincy Thu: “The only thing that I could envision myself doing in the future”

For Quincy Thu, energy runs in the family: his father began teaching energy technology at Lake Area Tech in 2022, which got Thu thinking about the opportunities of the sector.

Thu said that the proximity of the school to his home in Castlewood, as well as affordability, was his deciding factor. As he comes into his final year in the program, he said that he’s particularly interested in the wind energy sector, which has strong roots in the eastern side of the state.

“I’m trying to talk to people, interview people, find out where I want to go, find the best company that fits me,” Thu said.

But he plans on staying in the state for any future career ventures.

“I’m from South Dakota, I love it here,” Thu said.

Tate Sheehan: “The industry is growing at immense rates”

Tate Sheehan, a second-year student who is originally from Bird Island, Minnesota, said that his decision to enter the energy sector comes from the idea that the industry’s growth is not slowing down any time soon.

He said that a combination of in-class work and hands-on projects has allowed him to feel exceptionally prepared for his entry into the energy world.

Though he’s a few hundred miles from home, Sheehan said he plans to stay in South Dakota and find a company he can “settle down” with while continuing to climb the career ladder – a goal he credits to seeing firsthand how quickly the industry is growing.

“There’s a lot of great opportunities through the energy technology program and the energy operations program to prepare us for the real world and get us ready to go out there and make a difference working for them,” Sheehan said.

Heike Deggim, Director of IMO’s Maritime Safety Division, elaborated on the organization’s focus in the Arctic and its engagement with the Council.

The pressing issues that attract IMO’s attention include ensuring the safety, security, and sustainability of shipping in the Arctic. IMO aims to mitigate risks related to search and rescue operations, pollution response, maritime safety, and environmental protection in this fragile region. The organization’s Polar Code establishes mandatory requirements for vessels operating in polar environments, enhancing safety standards beyond existing regulations. However, there is recognition that additional measures are needed, particularly for boats not covered by the Polar Code, such as fishing vessels and pleasure yachts. IMO has invited its Member States to voluntarily implement Polar Code safety measures across these vessels.

Broader maritime concerns also occupy IMO’s focus, including the enhancement of navigational charts, establishment of search and rescue facilities, improvements in satellite and radio communications, and the creation of port reception facilities for operational waste. A significant aspect of IMO’s mission is contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, aiming for at least a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050. This initiative is aligned with the Paris Agreement and supported by various practical projects aimed at fostering technology development and operational best practices, particularly in developing countries.

In the Arctic, Member States are intensifying efforts to address black carbon emissions from ships and are advocating for extending the current ban on heavy fuel oil from the Antarctic to Arctic waters. Furthermore, addressing marine litter and microplastics is a key initiative; IMO is collaborating with the United Nations Environment Program to combat sea-based sources of marine litter.

Following its accreditation, IMO has engaged with the Arctic Council through formal channels, building upon past informal collaborations on projects such as the “Guide on Oil Spill Response in Ice and Snow Conditions.” Current collaborations involve the Arctic Shipping Best Practice Information Forum, enhancing the effectiveness of the Polar Code. Upcoming meetings will continue to strengthen the communication between IMO Member States and the Arctic Council.

Furthermore, IMO is actively developing specifications for ships’ equipment in polar waters, focusing on guidelines for navigation and life-saving appliances for vessels not covered by the Polar Code. Recent sessions have led to the creation of guidelines targeting pleasure yachts and fishing vessels operating in these regions.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-03 23:57:31.399961

You might not get the community support.” Some in the industry are frustrated, saying opponents are spreading falsehoods about data centers — such as polluting water and air — and are difficult to overcome.
Data center opposition dominates local politics Winning over local officials, however, hasn’t translated to winning over residents.","SPRING CITY, Pa. (AP) — Tech companies and developers looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly losing fights in communities where people don’t want to live next to them, or even near them.

Communities across the United States are reading about — and learning from — each other’s battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources.

In many cases, municipal boards are trying to figure out whether energy- and water-hungry data centers fit into their zoning framework. Some have entertained waivers or tried to write new ordinances. Some don’t have zoning.

But as more people hear about a data center coming to their community, once-sleepy municipal board meetings in farming towns and growing suburbs now feature crowded rooms of angry residents pressuring local officials to reject the requests.

“Would you want this built in your backyard?” Larry Shank asked supervisors last month in Pennsylvania’s East Vincent Township. “Because that’s where it’s literally going, is in my backyard.”

Opposition spreads as data centers fan out

A growing number of proposals are going down in defeat, sounding alarms across the data center constellation of Big Tech firms, real estate developers, electric utilities, labor unions and more.

Andy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL, counted seven or eight deals he’d worked on in recent months that saw opponents going door-to-door, handing out shirts or putting signs in people’s yards.

“It’s becoming a huge problem,” Cvengros said.

Data Center Watch, a project of 10a Labs, an AI security consultancy, said it is seeing a sharp escalation in community, political and regulatory disruptions to data center development.

Between April and June alone, its latest reporting period, it counted 20 proposals valued at $98 billion in 11 states that were blocked or delayed amid local opposition and state-level pushback. That amounts to two-thirds of the projects it was tracking.

Some environmental and consumer advocacy groups say they’re fielding calls every day, and are working to educate communities on how to protect themselves.

“I’ve been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I’d guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I’ve ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson of the Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition.

In Indiana alone, Gustafson counted more than a dozen projects that lost rezoning petitions.

Similar concerns across different communities

For some people angry over steep increases in electric bills, their patience is thin for data centers that could bring still-higher increases.

Losing open space, farmland, forest or rural character is a big concern. So is the damage to quality of life, property values or health by on-site diesel generators kicking on or the constant hum of servers. Others worry that wells and aquifers could run dry.

Lawsuits are flying — both ways — over whether local governments violated their own rules.

Big Tech firms Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook — which are collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers across the globe — didn’t answer Associated Press questions about the effect of community pushback.

Microsoft, however, has acknowledged the difficulties. In an October securities filing, it listed its operational risks as including “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development.”

Even with high-level support from state and federal governments, the pushback is having an impact.

Maxx Kossof, vice president of investment at Chicago-based developer The Missner Group, said developers worried about losing a zoning fight are considering selling properties once they secure a power source — a highly sought-after commodity that makes a proposal far more viable and valuable.

“You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. “The thing is you could have power to a site and it’s futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.”

Some in the industry are frustrated, saying opponents are spreading falsehoods about data centers — such as polluting water and air — and are difficult to overcome.

Still, data center allies say they are urging developers to engage with the public earlier in the process, emphasize economic benefits, sow good will by supporting community initiatives and talk up efforts to conserve water and power and protect ratepayers.

“It’s definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, ‘Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?’” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition, a trade association that includes Big Tech firms and developers.

Data center opposition dominates local politics

Winning over local officials, however, hasn’t translated to winning over residents.

Developers pulled a project off an October agenda in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina, after Mayor John Higdon said he informed them it faced unanimous defeat.

The project would have funded half the city’s budget and developers promised environmentally friendly features. But town meetings overflowed, and emails, texts and phone calls were overwhelmingly opposed, “999 to one against,” Higdon said.

Had council approved it, “every person that voted for it would no longer be in office,” the mayor said. “That’s for sure.”

In Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, a proposed data center campus several times larger than the Mall of America is on hold amid challenges over whether the city’s environmental review was adequate.

Residents found each other through social media and, from there, learned to organize, protest, door-knock and get their message out.

They say they felt betrayed and lied to when they discovered that state, county, city and utility officials knew about the proposal for an entire year before the city — responding to a public records request filed by the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy — released internal emails that confirmed it.

“It’s the secrecy. The secrecy just drives people crazy,” said Jonathan Thornton, a realtor who lives across a road from the site.

Documents revealing the extent of the project emerged days before a city rezoning vote in October. Mortenson, which is developing it for a Fortune 50 company that it hasn’t named, says it is considering changes based on public feedback and that “more engagement with the community is appropriate.”

Rebecca Gramdorf found out about it from a Duluth newspaper article, and immediately worried that it would spell the end of her six-acre vegetable farm.

She found other opponents online, ordered 100 yard signs and prepared for a struggle.

“I don’t think this fight is over at all,” Gramdorf said.

""2026 is shaping up to be a bountiful year for Tesla, with the anticipated scale-up of CyberCab and Optimus (Gen 3) production, alongside a possible acceleration in Semi output and continued expansion in energy storage driven by the launch of Megapack 3.","Investing.com -- Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas said 2026 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for Tesla, driven by a wave of new products and a reset in the U.S. electric vehicle market that he believes ultimately favours the company.

Gianarikas said Tesla is set to benefit from the expected scale-up of its CyberCab and Optimus Gen 3 programs, alongside a potential acceleration in Semitruck production.

He also flagged continued growth in energy storage, supported by the launch of Megapack 3, describing 2026 as a year with multiple new product catalysts.

In the United States the expiry of federal EV subsidies has weighed on near-term demand but is forcing the market into a healthier and more durable phase. The recent weakness reflects a pause typical of major technology transitions rather than a structural reversal in EV adoption.

Gianarikas said EV demand, previously boosted by generous tax credits, is resetting into a smaller but more fundamentals-driven market.

Pricing and incentives are normalising, weaker models are being phased out, and competition is increasingly favouring manufacturers with dedicated EV platforms, software and cost discipline.

Gianarikas said Tesla stands apart in the U.S. as the only automaker with a fully scaled and integrated EV franchise, with Rivian emerging as the only credible long-term mass-market challenger.

He added that the current shakeout is clarifying which automakers treated EVs as core businesses rather than compliance efforts, a shift he sees as positive for Tesla’s market share.

Gianarikas pointed to rising EV adoption in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil. While these regions are not yet meaningful contributors to Tesla’s results, he said they represent early-stage opportunities for longer-term growth, even as competition from Chinese automakers intensifies.

Canaccord applies a 46x multiple to its 2028 non-GAAP earnings estimate of $11.98 a share to arrive at a price target of $551.

Gianarikas said the premium valuation reflects Tesla’s long-duration growth opportunities in robotics, autonomy and energy storage. Though the implied execution leaves little room for error.

""2026 is shaping up to be a bountiful year for Tesla, with the anticipated scale-up of CyberCab and Optimus (Gen 3) production, alongside a possible acceleration in Semi output and continued expansion in energy storage driven by the launch of Megapack 3.

Clean air and clean water are crucial for maintaining the quality of life we have come to expect.
Do not fall for the political ploy that the economy will be boosted and jobs created if environmental regulations are weakened or eliminated.
Resolve to pay attention to what would happen to your air, water and ecosystems if certain regulations are eliminated.","Once again, my New Year’s resolutions pertain directly to our personal health and well-being. I don’t mean more trips to the gym and fewer to the refrigerator. Instead, I propose keeping our elected officials apprised that protection of natural habitats and native wildlife needs to be on the front burner. Also, those we have placed in charge have a responsibility to ensure that our shared natural resources of air and water stay clean. I have heard of proposals here and there at local, state and federal levels of government that would benefit a few at a cost to the many. If carried out, from county to national levels, the effect on the natural environment would be regrettable and would in turn adversely affect us all.

As a prime example at the federal level, substantive changes that might be forthcoming in the Environmental Protection Agency are uncertain. But any rumblings that we need to weaken the oversight and rulings by this critical government program should be cause for alarm. And the idea proposed by some of abolishing the EPA entirely is beyond alarming; it is absurd and would be inherently irresponsible for any member of Congress to support. A worthwhile New Year’s resolution would be to oppose any legislation that even hints at getting rid of a government agency that limits assaults on the environment from unchecked commercial greed. The outcomes from a weakened EPA would be detrimental to the majority of U.S. citizens.

As I have noted before, specters of what would happen by gutting the authority of the EPA are disquieting. Do we really want to curb EPA regulations that prevent mining wastes from being dumped into clear-flowing mountain streams? Do we want streams that trout and other aquatic wildlife can no longer live in? I don’t think so. President Richard Nixon had it right when he formed the EPA in 1970 and signed the Clean Water Act in 1972.

Another suggestion has been to reduce EPA air quality regulations. Such regulations limit emissions that result in undesirable outcomes such as acid rain, smog and lung cancer. Think about it. In the 1960s in Gary, Indiana, and Birmingham, Alabama, you could not see buildings half a mile away because of the smoke and soot filling the air. President Nixon did the right thing when he signed the Clean Air Act in 1970. Weakening regulatory features of the EPA would definitely not be an improvement. Clean air and clean water are crucial for maintaining the quality of life we have come to expect.

I suggest everyone resolve to keep our country’s natural heritage and a healthy environment as priorities for the coming year. Keep an eye on proposed changes in any program that can affect the environment in your community, your region, your nation. Resolve to challenge your congressional representatives when you hear of a proposal that would diminish the effectiveness of maintaining standards for potable water and unpolluted air.

Make a resolution to get the facts when politicians start making promises they claim will help everybody. Do not fall for the political ploy that the economy will be boosted and jobs created if environmental regulations are weakened or eliminated. Look, instead, at who would benefit from the loosening of any given environmental regulation. Someone will be making money. But you can be sure it won’t be you and me. We will be stuck with murky skies, undrinkable water and habitats in which our native wildlife cannot survive.

I have used the EPA as an example, but bad things could be happening environmentally in your community, your county or your state. Resolve to pay attention to what would happen to your air, water and ecosystems if certain regulations are eliminated. Will a proposed change be in the best public interest or does it financially benefit only a few special interest groups? Make environmental resolutions for yourself and future generations — and have a happy new year.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/56/556ceeed-dc8c-49af-846b-ca36fbb07ca9/695498990c1d4.image.jpg?crop=1498%2C787%2C0%2C483&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-03 14:58:18.464790

Nawyn, Michigan State University

From beginning to end, 2025 was a year of devastation for scientists in the United States.

January saw the abrupt suspension of key operations across the National Institutes of Health, not only disrupting clinical trials and other in-progress studies but stalling grant reviews and other activities necessary to conduct research. Around the same time, the Trump administration issued executive orders declaring there are only two sexes and ending DEI programs. The Trump administration also removed public data and analysis tools related to health disparties, climate change and environmental justice, among other databases.

February and March saw a steep undercutting of federal support for the infrastructure crucial to conducting research as well as the withholding of federal funding from several universities.

And over the course of the following months, billions of dollars of grants supporting research projects across disciplines, institutions and states were terminated. These include funding already spent on in-progress studies that have been forced to end before completion. Federal agencies, including NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Agency for International Development have been downsized or dismantled altogether.

The Conversation asked researchers from a range of fields to share how the Trump administration’s science funding cuts have affected them. All describe the significant losses they and their communities have experienced. But many also voice their determination to continue doing work they believe is crucial to a healthier, safer and more fair society.

Pipeline of new scientists cut off

Carrie McDonough, Associate Professor of Chemistry, Carnegie Mellon University

People are exposed to thousands of synthetic chemicals every day, but the health risks those chemicals pose are poorly understood. I was a co-investigator on a US$1.5 million grant from the EPA to develop machine-learning techniques for rapid chemical safety assessment. My lab was two months into our project when it was terminated in May because it no longer aligned with agency priorities, despite the administration’s Make America Healthy Again report specifically highlighting using AI to rapidly assess childhood chemical exposures as a focus area.

Labs like mine are usually pipelines for early-career scientists to enter federal research labs, but the uncertain future of federal research agencies has disrupted this process. I’m seeing recent graduates lose federal jobs, and countless opportunities disappear. Students who would have been the next generation of scientists helping to shape environmental regulations to protect Americans have had their careers altered forever.

I’ve been splitting my time between research, teaching and advocating for academic freedom and the economic importance of science funding because I care deeply about the scientific and academic excellence of this country and its effects on the world. I owe it to my students and the next generation to make sure people know what’s at stake.

Cara Poland, Associate Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University

I run a program that has trained 20,000 health care practitioners across the U.S. on how to effectively and compassionately treat addiction in their communities. Most doctors aren’t trained to treat addiction, leaving patients without lifesaving care and leading to preventable deaths.

This work is personal: My brother died from substance use disorder. Behind every statistic is a family like mine, hoping for care that could save their loved one’s life.

With our federal funding cut by 60%, my team and I are unable to continue developing our addiction medicine curriculum and enrolling medical schools and clinicians into our program.

Meanwhile, addiction-related deaths continue to rise as the U.S. health system loses its capacity to deliver effective treatment. These setbacks ripple through hospitals and communities, perpetuating treatment gaps and deepening the addiction crisis.

Communities left to brave extreme weather alone

Brian G. Henning, Professor of Philosophy and Environmental Studies and Sciences, Gonzaga University

In 2021, a heat dome settled over the Northwest, shattering temperature records and claiming lives. Since that devastating summer, my team and I have been working with the City of Spokane to prepare for the climate challenges ahead.

We and the city were awarded a $19.9 million grant from the EPA to support projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build capacity to address environmental and climate justice challenges.

As our work was about to begin, the Trump administration rescinded our funding in May. As a result, the five public facilities that were set to serve as hubs for community members to gather during extreme weather will be less equipped to handle power failures. Around 300 low-income households will miss out on efficient HVAC system updates. And our local economy will lose the jobs and investments these projects would have generated.

Despite this setback, the work will continue. My team and I care about our neighbors, and we remain focused on helping our community become more resilient to extreme heat and wildfires. This includes pursuing new funding to support this work. It will be smaller, slower and with fewer resources than planned, but we are not deterred.

LGBTQ+ people made invisible

Nathaniel M. Tran, Assistant Professor of Health Policy and Administration, University of Illinois Chicago

This year nearly broke me as a scientist.

Shortly after coming into office, the Trump administration began targeting research projects focusing on LGBTQ+ health for early termination. I felt demoralized after receiving termination letters from the NIH for my own project examining access to preventive services and home-based care among LGBTQ+ older adults. The disruption of publicly funded research projects wastes millions of dollars from existing contracts.

Then, news broke that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer process or make publicly available the LGBTQ+ demographic data that public health researchers like me rely on.

But instead of becoming demoralized, I grew emboldened: I will not be erased, and I will not let the LGBTQ+ community be erased. These setbacks renewed my commitment to advancing the public’s health, guided by rigorous science, collaboration and equity.

Pediatric brain cancer research squelched

Rachael Sirianni, Professor of Neurological Surgery, UMass Chan Medical School

My lab designs new cancer treatments. We are one of only a few groups in the nation focused on treating pediatric cancer that has spread across the brain and spinal cord. This research is being crushed by the broad, destabilizing impacts of federal cuts to the NIH.

Compared to last year, I am working with around 25% of our funding and less than 50% of our staff. We cannot finish our studies, publish results or pursue new ideas. We have lost technology in development. Students and colleagues are leaving as training opportunities and hope for the future of science dries up.

I’m faced with impossible questions about what to do next. Do I use my dwindling research funds to maintain personnel who took years to train? Keep equipment running? Bet it all on one final, risky study? There are simply no good choices remaining.

Inequality in science festers

Stephanie Nawyn, Associate Professor of Sociology, Michigan State University

Many people have asked me how the termination of my National Science Foundation grant to improve work cultures in university departments has affected me, but I believe that is the wrong question. Certainly it has meant the loss of publications, summer funding for faculty and graduate students, and opportunities to make working conditions at my and my colleagues’ institutions more equitable and inclusive.

But the greatest effects will come from the widespread terminations across science as a whole, including the elimination of NSF programs dedicated to improving gender equity in science and technology. These terminations are part of a broader dismantling of science and higher education that will have cascading negative effects lasting decades.

Infrastructure for knowledge production that took years to build cannot be rebuilt overnight.

____ This story has been corrected to show that BYD sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, not 2.26.","NEW YORK (AP) — Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world’s richest man. The sales drop came despite President Donald Trump’s marketing effort early last year when he called a press conference to praise Musk as a “patriot” in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock fell 2.6% to $438.07 on Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Musk said earlier last year that a “major rebound” in sales was underway, but investors were unruffled when that didn’t pan out, choosing instead to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business. He has has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory — and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin in June, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

“Regulatory is going to be a big issue,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. “We’re dealing with people’s lives.”

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla’s autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to the public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering. ____

These power grabs have had a profound effect on both democracy in the state and on the everyday lives of North Carolina residents, Democrats argue.

The changes are “weakening environmental protections, raising energy costs, and politicizing election administration,” Josh Stein, North Carolina’s governor, said in a text message responding to questions from ProPublica.

Republican leaders in the General Assembly did not respond to requests for comment or emailed questions about the power shifts. In the past, they have defended these actions as reflecting the will of voters, with the senate president describing one key bill as balancing “appointment power between the legislative and executive branches.”

Former state Sen. Bob Rucho, a Republican picked to sit on the state elections board after lawmakers shifted control from Stein to the Republican state auditor, said the changes would fix problems created by Democrats.

“Republicans are very proud of what’s been accomplished,” Rucho said. Shifting authority over the elections board, he argued, would “reestablish a level of confidence in the electoral process” that Democrats had lost.

ProPublica recently chronicled the nearly 10-year push to take over the board, which sets rules and settles disputes in elections in the closely divided swing state. Decisions made by the board’s new leadership — particularly on the locations and numbers of early voting sites — could affect outcomes in the 2026 midterms.

Below, we examine how other power transfers driven by North Carolina’s Republican legislature are reshaping everything from the regulations that protect residents’ drinking water to the rates they pay for electricity to the culture of their state university system.

Environmental Management Commission

What it is: The Environmental Management Commission adopts rules that protect the state’s air and water, such as those that regulate industries discharging potentially carcinogenic chemicals in rivers.

Power transfer: In October 2023, Republican legislators passed a law shifting the power to appoint the majority of the commission’s members from the governor to themselves and the state’s commissioner of agriculture, who is a Republican.

What’s happened since: The new Republican-led commission has stymied several efforts by the state’s Department of Environmental Quality to regulate a potentially harmful chemical, 1,4-dioxane, in drinking water.

Advocates for businesses, including the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce, had criticized some regulations and urged the commission to intervene. “Clean water is worth the cost, but regulators should not arbitrarily establish a level that is low for the sake of being low,” the chamber said in a press release.

The Southern Environmental Law Center, which has pressed the state to regulate the chemical, has said the commission’s rulings are “crippling the state’s ability to protect its waterways, drinking water sources, and communities from harmful pollution.”

Utilities Commission

What it is: The North Carolina Utilities Commission regulates the rates and services of the state’s public utilities, which include providers of electricity, natural gas, water and telephone service. The commission also oversees movers, brokers, ferryboats and wastewater.

Power transfer: In June 2025, a trial court sided with the General Assembly in allowing a law passed in 2024 to take effect, removing the governor’s power to appoint a majority of the commission’s members and transferring that power to legislative leaders and the state treasurer, who is a Republican.

What’s happened since: The state’s primary utility, Duke Energy, has backed off from some plans to rely more on clean energy and retire coal-fired power plants. In November, the company said it would seek the commission’s approval to raise rates by 15%.

In response to a new resource plan the company filed in October, the executive director of NC WARN, a climate and environmental justice nonprofit, said in a statement that Duke’s actions would cause “power bills to double or triple over time” and increase carbon emissions. The state’s governor and attorney general, both Democrats, have said they oppose the rate hike.

Garrett Poorman, a spokesperson for Duke Energy, said that the company is “focused on keeping costs as low as possible while meeting growing energy needs across our footprint” and that the company had recently lowered its forecasted costs.

The commission will decide whether to approve the proposed rate hikes in 2026.

University of North Carolina System

What it is: The University of North Carolina System encompasses 17 institutions and more than 250,000 students, including at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, considered one of best in the nation.

Power transfer: Though the legislature has traditionally appointed the majority of the trustees for individual schools, the governor also made a share of these appointments.

In 2016, the legislature passed a law that eliminated the governor’s ability to make university trustee appointments.

In 2023, changes inserted into the state budget bill gave the legislature power to appoint all of the members of the state board that oversees community colleges and most of those colleges’ trustees. The governor had previously chosen some board members and trustees.

What’s happened since: The system has created a center for conservative thought, repealed racial equity initiatives, suspended a left-leaning professor, gutted a civil rights center led by a professor long critical of Republican lawmakers and appointed politically connected Republicans to the boards.

Republicans say the moves are reversing the system’s long-term leftward drift.

“Ultimately, the board stays in for a while, and you change administrators, and then start to moderate the culture of the UNC schools,” said David Lewis, a former Republican House member who helped drive the changes to the university system.

Democrats, including former Gov. Roy Cooper, have criticized the board changes as partisan meddling.

“These actions will ultimately hurt our state’s economy and reputation,” Cooper said in a 2023 press release.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-148932699.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 13:13:39.173887

This is not the first time we’ve observed it, but Tesla really isn’t a “car company” at this point. Elon Musk’s perpetual money machine has diversified into increasingly pointless and stupid directions over the years in its search of some kind of rationale for exactly why it should be valued in the trillions of dollars, most recently going all in on fake robots like Optimus, which Musk continues to tout for private home use despite the fact that in public appearances, the “robots” are still being remotely controlled by human beings so they can do such complex tasks as “walk around” and “pour drinks for people.” Falling by the wayside in all of this, meanwhile, is Tesla’s formerly world-leading edge in electric vehicles, and we can now formally say “formerly,” because Tesla has officially lost the title of the world’s biggest EV company. They’ve been significantly lapped by China’s BYD, which surged to 2.26 million EVs sold in 2025, while Tesla sold 1.64 million. That was a big decrease of 9% overall for Tesla from 2024, demonstrating the weakness of the brand both in the United States and abroad.

Much of Tesla’s slump can unsurprisingly be blamed directly on the spastic actions of Musk through the last few calendar years, as he completed his transformation from mere Twitter-buying troll to chief Donald Trump bootlicker, temporary shadow president and DOGE-lord. His effort to “cut government spending and waste” via the Department of Government Efficiency unsurprisingly ended up being a resounding failure, with most theoretical savings being impossible to quantify, eventually walked back, or simply replaced with new Republican spending, for a deficit that only continues growing. All the while, the Trump admin stabbed him in the back by ending the EV tax credits that incentivized consumers to buy electric vehicles. Musk himself has admitted that his time at DOGE was only “a little bit successful” (lol) at most, and that he wouldn’t even attempt to do it again if given the chance. Perhaps more important to Musk was the effect that his government cosplaying ended up having on public perception of Tesla and consumer interest in buying his cars, like the woeful failure of the Cybertruck. Oh, and he may have visited the Epstein Pedophile Island as well.

Tesla’s board has of course long been aware that Musk is somehow both their golden goose and the albatross around their neck, and in May of 2025 they reportedly grew tired enough of his bullshit that they were attempting to replace him as CEO with someone who might actually show a bit of interest in the duties of the job. Instead, however, the company reversed face by the end of the year and decided to reward Musk with a compensation package that could ultimately be worth $1 trillion in stock value … provided that the company continues growing its market cap to an absurd degree over the next decade. And as our own Jacob Weindling pointed out, that is hardly a given. To quote his amusingly acerbic take:

This is yet another big bet on AI, as the whole industry is pitching an Underpants Gnomes-style business plan where they build a bunch of data centers far outpacing the present-day demand for AI, have no fucking idea what to do next, then claim we will enter an age of unprecedented prosperity. AI is definitely here to stay to some degree, and OpenAI advertising themselves this week as too big to fail is one example of how we’re stuck with it, but the lesson from the dot com bust is that Amazon and Apple were big winners in large part because there were so many other losers.

And Tesla is a loser. It’s a carbon credits company that sells a couple of cars and launched a truck so shambolic and dangerous it makes the notoriously combustible Ford Pinto look like a Boeing Dreamliner by comparison. I have lived the lesson of never short a cult, and Tesla is the ultimate proof that the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, but Tesla is the exact kind of Pets.com-ass bubble that got popped in the 2000s. It’s a pinky promise, not a company, and it’s a lot harder to survive through a bear market solely on pinky promises.

To wit, the stock price of Tesla has remained difficult to put a dent in, although the last week has been rough, sending it plunging almost 10% in total. Still, even so, that represents the company being up by roughly 15% in the last calendar year, and more than 86% in the last five years. But much of those gains were built on the back of a company that at least dominated one emerging industry in EVs. Now Tesla doesn’t even have that feather in its cap anymore, and few but the Musk acolytes seem to care about its stated intention to dominate the “fake household robots” industry. The only people who really want those things are the streamers and influencers who are very much looking forward to abusing a humanoid robot on camera for clicks.

It’s perfectly fitting, by the way, that China’s BYD would blow by Tesla as an EV maker, offering comparable quality vehicles at prices that Musk’s company has struggled to match, even after stripping features out of the Model Y and Model 3 in an effort to bring their sticker prices down … again necessary after Trump and co. ended tax credits for EV vehicles, even after Musk threw his weight and cash behind getting Trump elected. Years ago, Musk had mocked BYD in an interview when asked if he saw the company as a competitor, saying that their cars were of poor quality: “Have you seen their car? I don’t think it’s particularly attractive, the technology is not very strong, and BYD as a company has pretty severe problems in their home turf in China.”

Now, years later, Musk finds himself purposefully making his flagship EVs worse and less feature rich, in order to compete with those very same Chinese EV manufacturers he was once mocking. Who’s producing junk now? It’s enough to make you want to ask Optimus to poorly mix up a batch of drinks.

This year, TCD's resident auto experts are asking for some big changes that would make EVs cheaper, easier, and more fun to drive in the new year.

Here are eight clean machine-related resolutions we'd like to see coming to fruition in 2026:

Reinstate the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs

With American giants such as Ford taking billions of dollars in losses and opting to kill beloved EVs like the F-150 Lightning, reinstating these nixed tax incentives would be a way for the government to support the economy.

Get rid of the idea that EV drivers should be charged more

There's a whole lot of cost and confusion looming, as individual states decide how to tax EV drivers as a way of making up for lost gas tax revenue.

Let's make these laws common sense — and not a clear cash-grab or subversive plot to put people off buying EVs.

Allow Chinese EVs to be sold in the US

Doing so would mean radical changes to policy and tariffs, but it would also likely bring the average cost of an EV down considerably without sacrificing quality.

The added competition would put further pressure on U.S. and European manufacturers, and is that really such a bad thing?

Hurry up and bring sub-$25,000 EVs to market

Slate promises its new plug–and-play EV, due in 2026, will be around this price, but if the Chinese can make great electric vehicles far more cheaply, why can't we?

Right now, we're seeing some sub-$30,000 offerings on the horizon, but surely America's home-grown engineering and business savvy can crack the code on lower sticker prices.

Make all charging stations available to all EV owners — for a standard cost

This would be opposed to the wildly fluctuating costs across charging suppliers and states. The state of Indiana is currently trying something in this vein, with a pilot program that charges drivers the same amount regardless of where — or when — they charge.

Fix all those broken EV chargers

It's still too common to come across an outdated or broken charger (as witnessed on a recent drive up the northeastern coast). They give EVs a bad rap, and the property owners should be fined for hosting old or non-functioning equipment.

Explore new charging alternatives, like battery-swapping

The companies that are beta-testing this solution find it as quick as a gas station stop, and batteries can be optimized for longevity by keeping them charged to the most efficient maximum levels.

Allow EVs to make fun noises

If a Nissan Leaf could sound like a powerful V12 engine, wouldn't that be fun? Or, if you're an EV purist, why not let these cars make calming nature sounds. Best yet, let the owner choose their car's sonics, like Tesla does.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LtzLeESjhwH.Ze8gEokbxw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/94c1448035a899bb5cad74becf944d5f,N,,2026-01-03 18:59:26.120751

​The project described is real. It is the CPV Backbone Solar farm in Garrett County, Maryland. It is indeed a ~160 MW (megawatt) facility built on a former coal mine (specifically a reclaimed strip mine near Backbone Mountain) and consists of over 300,000 panels.

​Here is the breakdown of the facts, particularly regarding the job numbers you requested:

​1. Is the project real?

​Yes.

​Name: CPV Backbone Solar (developed by Competitive Power Ventures).

​Location: Garrett County, Maryland, on a former coal strip mine (Arch Coal/Vindex/Mettiki vicinity).

​Scale: ~160 MW capacity with ~300,000+ panels.

​Status: Commercial operations began recently (late 2025).

​2. How many jobs are created with ongoing operations?

​This is where the comparison to coal mining is stark. While the image mentions ""hundreds of jobs"" for the local community, it specifies these were during the construction phase.

​Construction Jobs (Temporary): ~200 jobs.

​Building the solar farm created a significant spike in employment, but these jobs lasted only for the duration of construction (approx. 12–18 months).

​Ongoing Operations Jobs (Permanent): Likely fewer than 10.

​Solar farms are highly automated. Once built, a 160 MW facility typically requires only a very small team of technicians for security, vegetation management (mowing), and panel maintenance.

​Unlike a coal mine, it does not require a daily workforce to ""extract"" the energy.

​3. Comparison to the former coal mine?

​The ""former coal mine"" (likely referring to operations like the Mettiki Coal complex or similar surface mines in that region) would have had a vastly different employment profile.

Fortunately, hydrogen has been discovered in America, and it’s enough to produce 104 MW and to power 25,000 homes. Discover how repurposing a molybdenum mine could end up generating clean energy to power the U.S., and perhaps even the world.

Hydrogen was found in America

The best way to reach the global zero-emission goal by 2050 is to ensure that fossil fuels become a thing of the past. In its place, renewable energies should be the primary source to produce clean energy. However, the efficiency of renewable power production varies depending on location and the associated weather patterns. For example, Oakridge, Tennessee, would not be ideal for a wind farm.

That is why Questa, New Mexico, is ideal for solar energy production, as it enjoys a high amount of sunshine each year. Mayor John Ortega also seems to think so, which is why he and the Village of Questa have teamed up with Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC). The challenge with solar production is the intermittency of the source and the storage of excess solar energy.

One of the most ingenious ways to store excess renewable energy is by utilising green hydrogen. Now, Questa will be getting a green hydrogen plant with the help of KCEC, and a $231 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Repurposing a molybdenum mine to generate clean energy

Green hydrogen plants have been popping up all over the world, including Germany’s 320 MW green hydrogen plant in Emden. In Questa, New Mexico, one of the most obvious places to build the new plant was the old Chevron Molybdenum mine. Mayor Ortega’s father worked in the mine for nearly 30 years until it was shut down in 2014.

The mine is presently in the middle of a substantial environmental rehabilitation process, which reportedly will continue until the 2040s. The USDA released an intermediate feasibility study in 2023, which explained that the plant will utilise reclaimed water from the old mine for hydrogen separation through electrolysis. This will be used for long-term energy storage in newly developed technology.

Enough to produce 104 MW and power 25,000 homes

The Chevron Molybdenum mine’s closure resulted in the loss of 50% of the jobs it had provided to the area. By repurposing the mine for the plant’s development, over 350 jobs will be established in the region. Additional advantages of the plant include:

70 local jobs for the hub and associated energy production

Increased tax revenue

Funding for

extra public safety officers

a full-time, professional EMS/fire-fighting team in an area prone to wildfire

The region will economically benefit from $298 million in the first five years

Enough clean power production to power 25,000 homes annually

Conversion of a brownfield into a greenfield development opportunity

Promotes the region’s sustainable way of life

When asked about Chevron’s millions of gallons of treated water in addition to the municipal wastewater, Mayor Ortega said:

“Might as well use it for something. It’s perfect use for it, it’s not going to waste. And we’re not using water from our well or the aquifer.”

While additional purification may be required for the water’s electrolysis process, the entire project will be primarily beneficial for the entire Taos County, especially the Village of Questa. The USDA has only granted $500,000 for a safety study, which is presently being conducted by KCEC, and will hopefully bring the community some peace of mind. So far, operational dates have not been confirmed.

By Amy Kuras

To see the beautiful house on McClellan Ave., impeccably kept with colorful flowerbeds in front and a charming gazebo in the back, you’d never imagine it was once just another abandoned Detroit house awaiting a wrecking ball.

Thanks to a dedicated nonprofit, Detroit Catholic Pastoral Alliance, and a hardworking couple, Lynne and Johnnie Williams, the house that could have been fated to be a cloud of dust and an empty lot is a thriving asset in a stable neighborhood – and its owners, once in the grip of substance abuse, are assets to their community as well.

Detroit Catholic Pastoral Alliance has been buying and renovating single-family homes and apartments in Detroit’s Gratiot Woods neighborhood for nearly 20 years. Founded in the wake of the 1967 uprising, the alliance has worked to engage community members in the social, moral, and political issues of the day and to actively work against racism.

Housing connects to that in many ways – a lack of access to homeownership, for example, means Black families have exponentially less generational wealth available to them than white families.

For DCPA, creating safe, affordable, well-maintained housing means stabilizing a neighborhood that serves as an important gateway to the city. DCPA renovated its first home, donated by a parish member in 2006, and has since built or renovated five multi-family projects in the neighborhood and several more single-family homes.

Redeeming homes, redeeming people

One of those homes went to the Williams family, owners of the caringly maintained home on McClellan. Their own story parallels that of their home.

“We’ve always said this was the house God had for us all along because, just like us, it was on the demolition list, and, just like us, it was completely restored,” says Lynne Williams. She and her husband Johnnie were both struggling with drug addiction, but were able to get clean and sober 15 years ago.

Once they were out of treatment and trying to create a new and positive life for themselves, they wanted to leave the neighborhood they had been in and move away from bad influences. One day, Williams was driving down Gratiot and saw one of the apartment projects DCPA had renovated. She called, and they landed the last apartment available in the building.

A few years later, they decided they wanted to move into homeownership. Because their experience renting from DCPA was so positive, they reached out to the organization to see what else was available. The house on McClellan was under renovation, and Williams admits she was very skeptical at first. “I didn’t know how they were going to renovate it!” she said.

After extensive work on the house, they moved in during 2017 and have been making it their own ever since. They now have three rescue dogs and two cats, have put extensive efforts into beautifying the home, and they even hosted a wedding for Lynne Williams’ best friend in early September. Williams is also a community representative on the board at DCPA.

Due to the Williams’ history, they would not have qualified for a traditional mortgage. DCPA worked with them on a land contract to allow them to buy their home. DCPA also frequently uses what is called a “soft second mortgage,” where the organization is in second position in financing the house and will reap some of its investment when it sells.

Stabilizing a neighborhood

Because the nonprofit’s goal is neighborhood stabilization, it also requires that homeowners not sell the home for a designated period of time. This avoids issues with someone flipping the home quickly instead of investing in the neighborhood, as intended.

“The way that we’re looking at it now is mostly as a way to be able to complete these projects without a subsidy and to bring up property values in the neighborhood and also to encourage home ownership,” says Cleophus Bradley, executive director of the Detroit Catholic Pastoral Alliance. “We don’t want them leaving and cashing out any type of equity they may have in the home. You want them to have a stake in the community for at least five years.”

DCPA accomplishes its mission through a variety of financing methods, including taking advantage of available subsidies through the City of Detroit and the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. A bequest from a priest at the Church of the Nativity in the neighborhood means they can currently complete most projects without a subsidy. This is advantageous, as subsidies create more red tape and can slow down development.

Previous building projects also help fund the work, either through profits from homes sold or from rental income at one of the apartment projects DCPA has renovated.

”We’ve survived throughout the years because we haven’t relied on one particular source of income the whole time. And even as it relates to income from our real estate portfolio, we have a good mix of commercial and residential,“ says Christopher Bray, DCPA director of housing and finance.

“We’ve got something special going on in the neighborhood, in terms of the different types of housing available and the kind of investment that we put in, both in terms of actual bricks and mortar, repaving alleys and neighborhood beautification, and then also community organizing and things of that nature,” Bray says.

Meeting the need for affordable homes

DCPA is one of several organizations in the city attempting to address the affordable housing crisis in a city that’s rapidly changing and with an uncertain federal funding environment. Lisa Johanon, executive director and housing director of Central Detroit Christian Community Development Corporation, says it’s unclear what the future might hold for affordable housing.

“We don’t know what the final outcome of the federal government’s funding is, as it relates to CDBG [Community Development Block Grant Program] and HOME [HOME Investment Partnerships Program] funds,” she says, noting that at one point this year those funds were entirely gone from the federal government and then were restored.

“That’s going to have severe implications on affordable housing going forward,” she says, “I’m not being optimistic, that’s for sure.”

Another issue is the rapidly rising home prices in the North End, where Central Detroit CDC is located. Johanon says it’s not as simple as pointing fingers at gentrifiers coming in and making neighborhoods unaffordable.

A $200,000 house that would have sold for half that a few years ago may be out of the price range of a traditional resident of the neighborhood, but it also means the longtime resident whose home may have been worth considerably less several years ago is now able to see a return on the financial and emotional investment they have made in the neighborhood over decades.

Central Detroit Christian CDC is focused on children, and housing is an outgrowth of that mission to educate and care for children. That’s because once a family finds stable housing, all sorts of other potential issues are headed off.

A stable home means children are not moving schools constantly, the family’s stress is lessened, and the parents can plan a future because they know what their housing costs will be and that their investment will most likely appreciate in value, allowing them to build wealth.

To that end, Central Detroit Christian CDC offers training and counseling for potential homebuyers, ensuring they understand the costs of homeownership, how financing works, and how to avoid foreclosure or eviction. The organization also provides other services, such as child care and after-school programs for children, that ease families’ overall financial burden.

“If we put you in a house and you’re paying 50% of your income, which so many Detroiters are, something catches up so that you can’t pay this bill or that bill. And eventually it becomes your rent,” she says. “We want to have enough services for you, if that’s what you need. We’d rather work with folks that way.”",https://michiganchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Story-7_Resilient-Neighborhoods1.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 10:58:15.668367

Article content

While offering several worthy recommendations, the report is also plagued by backsliding, lowering of targets, false solutions, and an overall lack of emergency-level ambition.

Article content

Article content

To start with the positives: Expanding programs that enable access to clean home heating and cooling options, like heat pumps, is critical. Heat pumps are significantly more energy efficient than gas furnaces, helping lower energy bills while cutting climate pollution. The recommendation to reduce hydro rates for lower-income households is also welcome.

Article content

Article content

The reviewers also recommend increasing funding for active transportation and public transit, noting that the current provincial budget falls far short of what is required. Investing in active transportation creates significant public health and affordability benefits.

Article content

Additionally, the report’s support of a Youth Climate Corps (YCC) is welcome. Included in the 2025 federal budget, a YCC will become reality in April 2026 as a federal public jobs program for young Canadians. If the B.C. government cost-matches this program, even more young people can start building green careers.

Article content

Risks of LNG

Article content

The report takes a nuanced stance on liquefied natural gas (LNG) expansion. It outlines many risks, including the “staggering” demand for clean electricity required for electrifying LNG facilities, the volatility of gas prices, economic risks of entering into the global LNG market, the uncertainty around future demand for B.C.’s LNG, and the likelihood of a looming supply glut.

Article content

Article content

It also notes that LNG expansion will escalate conflicts with First Nations Rights and Title Holders (conflicts already instigating legal battles), harm the health of communities where the gas is fracked, and require billions in taxpayer dollars, with inadequate payoff in terms of jobs and benefits for British Columbians.

Article content

Despite all this, the review falls short of calling for what is needed: an immediate end to LNG expansion.

Article content

Weakening ambitious targets

Article content

The review falls flat in a number of other ways. It claims that emission reduction targets deemed “unrealistic” can “backfire … (leading) to either rollback or inaction.” It thus recommends lowering the 2030 target for EV adoption to 50 to 60 per cent (rather than 90 per cent) and completely removing the ban on sales of new gas-powered vehicles set for 2035.",https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/vancouversun/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0801-eby-lng-2_297957516.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 18:59:17.643154

Meanwhile, BYD announced that its battery-powered vehicle sales grew by almost 28% in 2025, reaching more than 2.25 million units sold.

Tesla cited a challenging year, including a mixed reception to new product offerings, political scrutiny surrounding CEO Elon Musk, and increasing pressure from Chinese competitors.

BYD’s surge in global EV sales comes as Tesla faces slowing deliveries, intensifying Chinese competition, and mounting pressure from pricing, the expiry of U.S. tax credits, and growing brand backlash.

In the final quarter of 2025, Tesla’s deliveries declined by 16%. The drop was partially attributed to the expiration of a U.S. government subsidy that had provided up to $7,500 off the price of certain electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell vehicles.

Wall Street analysts have recently lowered their sales projections for Tesla in 2026, signaling a more cautious outlook for the company.

Chinese manufacturers such as Geely, MG, and BYD have gained market share by pricing their EVs lower than established Western brands while, according to some reviewers, delivering vehicles of competitive quality.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world’s richest man. The sales drop came despite President Donald Trump’s marketing effort early last year when he called a press conference to praise Musk as a “patriot” in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock fell 2.6% to $438.07 on Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Musk said earlier last year that a “major rebound” in sales was underway, but investors were unruffled when that didn’t pan out, choosing instead to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business. He has has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory — and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin in June, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

“Regulatory is going to be a big issue,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. “We’re dealing with people’s lives.”

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla’s autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to the public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering. ____

Last year, BYD saw a 28% in sales by selling 2.26 million vehicles. Notably, BYD did not make any sales to American consumers.

Meanwhile, Tesla, which was riddled with controversy due to CEO Elon Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration, sold 1.64 million vehicles last year, marking a 9% drop in sales from the year prior. 2025 marked the second year in a row that Musk’s company experienced a slump in yearly sales.

With Musk taking on the role of leading the Department of Government Efficiency at the beginning of Trump’s second term, he was met with widespread criticism by government employees and liberals alike for his cavalier approach in administrating widespread firings and audits of the federal government.

Protests at Tesla showrooms and dealerships erupted across the country to pushback against Musk. Many of these “Tesla Takedown” campaigns turned violent with showrooms vandalized and vehicles set on fire.

By the end of Tesla’s first quarter, Tesla saw a 71% drop in earnings. Shortly after, Musk announced he would be ending his role with the Trump administration. However, his announcement also corresponded with the end of his 130 day legal limit as a special government employee.

Tesla has also had to navigate the Trump administration’s decision to not extend a $7,500 federal EV tax credit in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The EV tax credit expired in September.

Just how pricey remains to be seen. New financing models could help keep some solar and battery costs in check, according to Emily Walker, director of insights at online solar marketplace EnergySage.

The tax credit repeal’s impact on prices

Article content

Article content

The expiration of the 30% federal tax credit for solar and battery installations at the end of 2025 doesn’t necessarily make the equipment more costly to buy but for homeowners with a tax liability, it does end the ability to reduce or erase their tax bill. A typical solar and battery system generated tax credits worth about $10,000.

Article content

You can still save by leasing

Article content

Tax credits remain for leased solar systems through the end of 2027, though the installer receives the incentive and passes on the savings to homeowners through lower monthly payments or other cost reductions.

Article content

A new model of solar ownership is emerging

Article content

Walker said installers who sold systems are now switching to a new model that lets residents ultimately own their solar and battery arrays while securing the savings from leasing. Called lease-to-own or a prepaid lease, a homeowner pays for the cost of the system upfront and the installer passes on the tax credit benefits as a discount. The solar company must retain ownership for a certain number of years under the tax code but then transfers title to the homeowner.

Article content

Article content

Southern California installer SolarShoppers sells its systems but company president Shawn Heckerman said he estimates that prepaid leases will account for nearly all of his business in 2026. Like other solar installers, he anticipates that demand will initially soften but recover later in the year. “I expect us to have a better year in 2026 than the last one, even with the tax credit expiring,” he said.

Article content

That’s due to soaring electricity rates and temperatures that force residents to run their air conditioners. “When we get into the summer, customer calls spike when they get their first high utility bill,” said Heckerman.

Article content

Walker also expects homeowners to continue adding panels as they install electric vehicle chargers and replace fossil fuel appliances with induction stoves and heat pumps. That can make going solar still financially attractive in the long run, even if the absence of federal incentives means adding a couple of years to the time it takes for the energy savings to equal the cost of the system, she said.",,N,,2026-01-03 16:57:48.046086

Interestingly, sales of “Other Models” – including the Model S, X, and Cybertruck – plummeted from 23,640 to 11,642. That’s a decline of 50.8 percent and it shows the company’s wedge-shaped pickup continues to be a flop.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1,636,129 vehicles. That’s down from 1,789,226 in 2024, marking an 8.6 percent decrease overall.

Tesla Q4 2025 Sales

Tesla didn’t have much to say about the disappointing numbers, but the company will reveal their full financial results on January 28. However, the Q4 numbers were worse than the original estimate of 422,850 vehicles. This also meant the full year sales total fell below projections.

While the numbers weren’t too far off, projections for Other Models was laughably wrong as they indicated the company would sell 34,848 units in the fourth quarter. However, they only managed to move 11,642, which means those estimates were off by nearly 300 percent.

Tesla 2025 Sales

On the bright side, the automaker did reveal one positive development and that was a record deployment of 14.2 GWh worth of energy storage products in the fourth quarter. That brought their full year number to 46.7 GWh, which is a substantial increase from the 31.4 GWh deployed in 2024.

While Tesla didn’t delve into specifics, the company’s problems are well-known. Outspoken CEO Elon Musk alienated a number of his customers by joining the Trump Administration and slashing the federal workforce in a sometimes haphazard fashion. The company also had to deal with increased competition and the elimination of federal tax credits, which caused sales to slump at Rivian.

In the U.S., investments in renewable, non-polluting energy were rolled back, and policy moves like the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” and the Environmental Protection Agency's reconsidering a key part of the federal government’s legal authority to regulate emissions.

However, other nations have continued to make policy progress on prioritizing renewable energy and protecting the environment, and so have some scientists and groups on this side of the Atlantic.

Here are a few of the highs and lows of humanity’s effect on our planet this year.

The bad news first

Goal of keeping warming to 2.7 degrees no longer realistic

Humans have failed to keep global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, long considered the goal following the original Paris climate agreement, according to UN Secretary General António Guterres. “Overshooting is now inevitable,” he said.

Scientists widely consider the 2.7 degree goal the point at which climate change will begin hitting its most severe, irreversible damage.

“We don’t want to see the Amazon as a savannah. But that is a real risk if we don’t change course and if we don’t make a dramatic decrease of emissions as soon as possible,” Guterres said ahead of the 2025 UN climate summit COP30, urging humanity to change course immediately.

COP30 fails to make substantive progress

Unfortunately, the outcomes from that UN summit did not live up to the secretary general’s hopes. This summit is an annual meeting where member countries measure their progress on addressing climate change and agree to legally binding goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

However, this final decision coming out of this year’s summit only included new voluntary initiatives to accelerate national climate action. According to commentary from the World Resources Institute, more than 80 countries advocated for a “global roadmap” to guide the transition away from fossil fuels, but negotiators didn’t include it in the final decision after they faced opposition from countries whose economies are built largely on oil and gas extraction and exports.

World passes first climate ‘tipping point’

This year, the world passed its first climate ""tipping point,"" meaning a threshold of irreversible change. Warming oceans have caused mass death in coral reefs, which are some of the world’s most diverse ecosystems. These reefs support a quarter of marine life and a billion people.

Other tipping points, such as the devastation of the Amazon rainforest and melting ice sheets, are also approaching, scientists warn.

Record-setting days of heat in major cities

The world’s major cities now experience a quarter more very hot days every year on average than they did three decades ago, according to a September analysis by the International Institute for Environment and Development.

“This isn’t a problem we can simply air-condition our way out of,” said Anna Walnycki, a principal researcher, in a press release. “Fixing it requires comprehensive changes to how neighbourhoods and individual buildings are designed, as well as bringing nature back into our cities in the form of trees and other plants.

“Climate change is the new reality. Governments can’t keep their heads buried in the sand anymore.”

Where positive action made a difference

Global renewable energy generation surpasses coal for first time

The SunZia Wind and Transmission project will be a renewable energy corridor that will link New Mexico to Arizona, meeting the growing power demand in the West. With the demand for electricity on the rise, the SunZia 3, which is a 3,650 MW wind farm, is permitting the integration of renewable energy generation on a large scale. SunZia will be the largest renewable energy project, which is set to provide power to over 1.2 million households.

A Western clean energy project to keep track of

This 3.5 MW wind farm will be located in central New Mexico and will consist of 916 turbines, 10 collection substations, 115 mi of overhead collection lines, and 130 mi of 345 kV AC generation. This surely is one of the largest wind installations throughout the United States.

The system is a rather huge engineering feat, with a transmission line set to carry power westward from Corona, New Mexico, and then to a converter station near Casa Grande, Arizona. SunZia can deliver more energy, which is far more stable power with fewer energy losses. There were over 80 organizations that contributed throughout the development timeline of this wind farm. With six years of construction and 17 years of permitting issues, the energy project posed a series of regulatory challenges that have been reflected throughout modern expansions.

The engineering challenge behind such a project

While the building of SunZia will resolve many technical problems along the way, there surely are engineering challenges to be dealt with. The transmission structures themselves are more than 2,000 structures, made from steel. A hybrid system was considered, where underground segments are used along with overhead construction lines. Overhead conductors can provide power to underground cables, resulting in savings of almost $45 million.

For this project, 2,000 workers and many helicopter fleets were called upon to handle the engineering challenge of such a project. These workers had to access difficult terrain as well; however, the jobs that were created included jobs for:

Electrical engineers

Studies and system planners

Civil engineers

Structural engineers

Material manufacturing and testing engineers

Geotechnical engineers

Environmental engineers

The success of this project would signify that large-scale infrastructure can be designed and built in the U.S., and that too within a rather reasonable time period. As it stands, it will take five years for the completion of the wind farm and six years for the full completion of the HDVC line, along with two years of field construction.

SunZia is setting an entirely new benchmark for U.S. clean energy

The expected economic benefits gained from this project amount to more than $20.5 billion, including direct and indirect economic benefits. SunZia is setting the benchmark for clean energy infrastructure. This is surely a step in the right direction in terms of large-scale renewable generation and long-distance transmission that can be delivered within a manageable timeline. Many states, on their own, are looking to power all of America, and with this initiative, climate change issues and global warming will be somewhat reduced.

The year of extended range EVs This year, a new trend will likely change the vehicle market in the US.","The year that ended brought a great deal of unpredictability to the automotive industry, especially regarding electric vehicles and battery technologies. It's difficult to make predictions in such an unstable environment, when decisions are made based on vibes and whims, only to be reversed days or weeks later.

This was, at least, the case with tariffs, which threatened to grind the automotive industry to a halt. Raw materials and many individual parts and components cross the US borders several times as they are processed, manufactured, and installed in new vehicles. In this case, the final products can add tariffs at various stages of the supply chain, making everything more expensive for everyone.

Thankfully, just as suddenly as they were announced, tariffs were also scrapped or lowered to bearable amounts. They did make the business environment more difficult for companies, while raising prices for consumers. However, since everyone had to pay them, they had little effect on the market dynamics.

2025 has been a mixed bag

When it comes to electric vehicles, the current administration has proved more consistent in rejecting them. The cancellation of the EV tax credit has been, undoubtedly, the most consequential event of 2025. The policy change caused a spike in EV sales in the months that preceded the end of the subsidy. The market is still adjusting to this change, and we're yet to see how bad the EV sales have been in the fourth quarter.

Tesla offered for the first time what financial analysts call ""company-compiled consensus"" regarding the fourth quarter sales. To be fair, the carmaker provided such analysis to select investors by mail, but this is the first time the estimates were published on the company's investor relations webpage.

Why has Tesla taken such a drastic change, you might ask? Your guess is just as good as mine, but many speculated that Tesla's delivery numbers were so bad that investors needed to be prepared in advance. This was confirmed on January 2, when Tesla reported even worse delivery numbers than Wall Street estimates.

Whatever the case, the 2025 delivery numbers mark two consecutive years of shrinking sales for Tesla. This is a direct consequence of abandoning the fight in manufacturing, something that became obvious in 2024. If you think that Tesla is doing a lousy job at selling EVs, just take a step back and have a look at the EV market as a whole.

Legacy carmakers are abandoning the EV race one by one

Liberated from the constraints of strict emissions regulations, legacy carmakers seized the opportunity to return to business as usual. In their case, it was and always will be building combustion engines. While this provides a brief relief as they return to their comfort zone, it's not going to help them in the long term.

As Ford CEO Jim Farley admitted, the Blue Oval is a global company now, and most of its sales are done abroad. Even if tariffs and lax regulations might help it in the US, Chinese carmakers will wipe the floor with it in Europe and Asia. Yet, somehow, Ford is happy abandoning the fight and expanding its combustion engine programs in North America against previous EV plans.

Indeed, Ford recently announced it is cancelling their large-EV program, including the F-150 Lightning full-size truck. Its only pure-electric plans are now tied to the work of its much-hyped ""Skunkworks team"" and the midsize EVs that it works on. Ford has taken a page out of Tesla's book here, unveiling both a cutting-edge EV platform and a new manufacturing process that is more efficient than anything used at present.

This sounds a lot like the Unboxed Vehicle manufacturing process that Tesla unveiled alongside the next-gen EVs. However, Tesla basically abandoned this project to focus on the Cybercab, the autonomous vehicle based on the new platform. The Cybercab is still promised to use the new manufacturing process, although we won't know for sure until it launches later this year.

It's not just Ford that is walking back previous bold claims about EV projects. GM is also scaling back its EV ambitions, despite announcing more affordable models. The upcoming Chevy Bolt is a prime example, although the Bow Tie company already warned that it would only be built in limited numbers. There aren't new EV models expected soon from GM, which might indicate that it would likely follow Ford's path.

In retrospect, Stellantis looks inspired to have delayed launching new electric vehicles, as they are no longer needed in the US market. The only two EVs Stellantis launched in North America are the Dodge Charger Daytona and the Jeep Wagoneer S, and they are selling so badly that they make Tesla Cybertruck look like a resounding success. The recently-launched Jeep Recon EV will likely have a similar fate. Fret not, though, I'm sure Stellantis is already working on adding a gas engine as a range extender to make it more compelling.

Young companies are approaching the make-or-break moment

Not everyone is taking the recent policy changes as a cue that electric vehicles are dead. EV startups, which don't stand a chance competing with legacy carmakers on their ICE turf, are forced to press ahead. Besides that, this is the sensible thing to do, considering that the car market is poised to be dominated by electric vehicles, no matter how some people feel about them. As Agent Smith said in Matrix Revolutions: ""Not impossible. Inevitable.""

Very few people who experienced electric mobility are indeed willing to go back to driving a combustion vehicle. Electric cars require a drastic routine change compared to ICE vehicles, taking into account charging stops and whatnot. However, once people become familiar with the new routine, going to a gas station no longer seems natural and straightforward. When charging at home, you wake up every day to a full tank.

There are other marked advantages of driving an EV, starting with the ultimate comfort of not having to deal with noise and smells. Add to this the instant acceleration that a combustion engine can't easily replicate, unless we're talking about supercars. Finally, maintenance is minimal on an electric car, which has very few moving parts compared to a gas-fueled vehicle.

These factors will compound to reward the companies that make it to the other side when the EV adoption tipping point is crossed. So far, it doesn't look like there will be many legacy carmakers among them. Almost all have abandoned the fight in the EV arena for the comfort and short-term gains of continuing to sell gas-powered vehicles.

However, being an all-EV carmaker doesn't guarantee success in itself. Not even Tesla, with its seemingly infinite cash coffers, is 100% safe in this fast-moving environment. Tesla has essentially abandoned the EV manufacturing race, scrapping almost all new vehicle programs. Its pivot to autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence will not guarantee a seat at the automotive industry's table.

Rivian and Lucid continue to struggle towards profitability, although the two have chosen very different paths. Lucid is focusing on being an EV manufacturer and has just announced expanding its manufacturing facilities in the Middle East. Lucid currently assembles vehicles there, but will move to local part sourcing and production in 2026. However, unless it changes something in its strategy, this is a narrow road to nowhere.

The AI-Defined Vehicle (ADV) era has begun

The world has moved toward software-defined vehicles or, as Rivian announced during the Q4 2025 earnings call, AI-Defined Vehicles. Rivian might be seen as a small company now, but its ambitions are huge, and the vision is enlightening. Rivian is no longer content with expanding its vehicle lineup and market share. It also wants to dominate in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, much like Tesla.

Before dismissing its efforts, pointing out Tesla's own struggles on this road, we should consider the vastly different conditions each company operates in. Tesla was a trendsetter and tried several strategies before deciding on its Vision-only, end-to-end AI approach. Rivian doesn't need to waste time and resources in this direction, because it has already seen at Tesla that it doesn't lead anywhere.

Rivian is, thus, able to burn through development stages much quicker, and early experience shows that it might get to Tesla's level faster than anyone thought possible. However, there's still a significant disadvantage for the EV startup: it doesn't have many vehicles in its fleet, so the data collection might lack variation, especially the edge cases that help refine its autonomous driving models.

Rivian tries to replace this with simulations running in the Amazon cloud. This means that it might not need expensive data centers that Tesla already has up and running, at least for now. However, this approach might not provide the same high-quality data processing capabilities that its more established rival has in place. It's exciting watching how this clash between Tesla and Rivian will unfold in 2026, especially as this will change everything we know about cars.

Legacy carmakers are doomed to fail

The question that is on everyone's mind right now is, where do the traditional carmakers sit in this landscape? Well, a mass extinction event might not happen in 2026, but I am not very optimistic about their fate. Some will fare better than others, but the end of 2026 will bring a significantly different car market than what we see today. What we know is that Volkswagen positioned itself preemptively alongside Rivian in the AI-Defined Vehicle era. We've already seen the first fruits of this collaboration in the form of the Rivian Assistant. This very clever AI assistant has been developed by the Rivian-Volkswagen software joint venture, which means that both brands will benefit.

Korean carmakers (Hyundai and Kia) have also made efforts on the software-defined vehicle front, although they are behind the market leaders in this endeavor. Other legacy carmakers, like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, have stepped up their EV game, but they're still far from catching up in software with Rivian and Tesla. Meanwhile, the Detroit Three, and especially Stellantis, look doomed to fail sooner rather than later.

Exciting new EV models expected in 2026

While most car companies have been retreating from the EV market, with fewer models planned to launch, others have still maintained their ambitions unaltered. The most exciting launch of the year is undoubtedly the Rivian R2, which should start sales in the coming months. This will provide an insight into Rivian's AI-Defined Vehicle program, although not from the start.

Rivian opted for a controversial approach, with the most advanced features missing on the first R2 vehicles built in 2026. These include Rivian's next-generation autonomous driving computer, built around the company's first in-house SoC, called RAP001. The first R2 vehicles will also lack LiDAR, which seems like a missed opportunity considering how badly Rivian needs to collect this data for its autonomous driving software.

Early adopters are essentially left out of the most exciting features promised on the R2. This will almost certainly make many postpone the purchase until after Rivian starts equipping the R2 with all the promised features, both hardware- and software-wise. However, things are on the last final now, and we should see everything aligning by the end of the year. Or, on the contrary, crumbling, if this omission botches the R2 launch.

By the end of 2026, Slate Auto is also planning to start production of its affordable Slate EVs. These should prove either a huge hit or a monumental flop, depending on the market conditions at the time and the customer preferences. If a basic EV will be what people want, Slate Auto might have a win. However, if Ford succeeds in offering its midsize truck at the reasonable price it promised in 2027, Slate Auto's career might be incredibly short.

Sadly, there's no exciting new car brewing in Tesla's gigafactories. That is, if we don't count the Cybercab, which should launch sometime this year. We're yet to see what Tesla would make out of it, whether it would have a steering wheel, or if it will hit the promised features, specifications, and price. Tesla has also been promising the second-generation Roadster for some years already, but it's hard to believe it is actually working on it. I don't expect it to surface in 2026, if ever.

On the legacy carmakers' front, there are some highly desirable models preparing to start their US career. Among them are the BMW iX3 (Neue Klasse) and the crossovers built on Mercedes-Benz's MMA platform, the GLA and GLB. As much as the CLA EV is concerned, despite its impressive capabilities, the market is no longer favorable for new sedans, which means it will not make a significant impact, especially as it will launch without 400-volt capabilities.

The year of extended range EVs

This year, a new trend will likely change the vehicle market in the US. For the first time, there are several extended-range EVs planned to launch this year. Among them is the Ram 1500 REV, which was once supposed to be an all-electric pickup truck. Other carmakers are also preparing EREVs, with notable examples being Scout Traveler and Terra, as well as the successor to the Ford F-150 Lightning. However, they will not arrive earlier than 2027, with some planned for 2028.

This puts Stellantis in an awkward trendsetter position. It also means that its rivals will have time to assess whether an EREV is viable. Stellantis plans not one, but two EREV models this year, with the Jeep Wagoneer S also scheduled for an ICE transplant later this year. However, it's the Ram 1500 REV that people are looking more anxiously at.

Electric pickups have been unsuccessful so far, with many citing the limited range and lackluster towing capabilities. If a range extender is the cure to electric pickup truck problems, the Ram 1500 REV should provide the decisive answer. Many expect miracles from an extended-range pickup truck, but it remains to be seen if people are willing to pay significantly more than for either a gas or EV pickup just to have ""the best of both worlds.""",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/what-s-next-in-2026-electric-passenger-cars-trucks-and-suvs-263518_1.jpeg,N,,2026-01-03 07:12:36.121534

Bourbon Street terror

The news cycle opened on New Year's Eve with tragedy in New Orleans as a man drove a truck into crowds celebrating on Bourbon Street and then exchanged gunfire with police. The attack killed 14 people and injured at least 57 before the suspect was shot and killed. Nearly a year later, state officials still viewed it as a defining event for how the city plans security around major gatherings.

Attorney General Liz Murrill ordered state investigators to review the security planning and execution around New Year’s Eve and the Sugar Bowl game that coincides with the holiday.

On Monday, Murrill said a federal report has been completed and was being discussed with the city and its law enforcement partners. Security measures for this year's events included closing streets, searching bags and deploying around 800 local, state and federal law enforcement officers in the downtown area.

Federal interventions

In the closing weeks of the year, federal Border Patrol agents targeted the New Orleans area for the Trump administration's expanded immigration crackdown. Hundreds of arrests were made as the administration said it was looking for immigrants with criminal histories. Protesters, criticizing the agents' aggressive tactics and arrests of some citizens without criminal pasts, attended a City Council meeting that was eventually halted.

At the same time, the Louisiana National Guard grew more visible. About 350 Guard members were authorized to patrol New Orleans during New Year’s Eve festivities and remain through February during Carnival season.

Data center boom

Louisiana secured a massive $10 billion data center from Facebook parent Meta that drew heavy scrutiny. Filings and reporting around the project put at least $470 million of related infrastructure costs on Entergy ratepayers, as Meta and Entergy detailed broader transmission and generation plans to meet the site’s enormous electricity demand.

With more large-load projects circling Louisiana, regulators agreed to fast-track new power resources as part of the state’s “lightning speed” pitch to big employers that raised the stakes of long-term decisions for customers and the grid.

Another billion-dollar data center was announced the week before Christmas in West Feliciana Parish, and Shreveport approved a permit for a large data center in the western portion of the city.

Redistricting

As states across the country ramped up efforts to redraw their congressional maps, Louisiana joined them in a particularly significant case. Led by Attorney General Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry, both Republicans, the state challenged a major portion of the Voting Rights Act before the U.S. Supreme Court.

If successful, state lawmakers will be able to redraw a map that would not require a second Black-majority district. This would almost certainly lead other states to redraw their maps, potentially limiting the ability of Black voters and other minority groups to use the law to force additional majority-minority districts.

Carbon capture

At the state Capitol, carbon capture and sequestration remained one of the year’s biggest policy divides. Lawmakers advanced a narrow bill after hours of testimony and widespread public pushback against proposals viewed as either too permissive or too restrictive. Several bills never made it out of committee.

One that broke through, Senate Bill 73, aimed to elevate local-government input in certain sequestration decisions. Gov. Landry later ordered a pause on new applications in the carbon storage permitting pipeline while the state focused on a backlog of pending reviews.

Rural Louisianas who oppose the projects organized a Facebook group with over 10,000 members, shared their concerns at local government meetings and received support from various state legislators.

Budget crisis

New Orleans' finances worsened in 2025, and by September major cuts were needed to offset hundreds of millions of dollars. City leaders froze hiring, announced furloughs and proposed changing the city charter to put hard limits on future spending.

New Orleans secured a $125 million state loan to cover its expenses after Gov. Landry suggested a financial takeover. The loan instead includes strict oversight from the state.

The financial issues will pass to the city's next mayor, Helena Moreno, a Democrat and city council vice president who was elected in October to succeed term-limited LaToya Cantrell.

Cantrell made news in August when she was indicted on federal charges that accused her of defrauding the city to hide a relationship with a police officer assigned to protect her.

Over the past three years, trillions of dollars have poured into sustainable investments—from renewable energy infrastructure to eco-conscious real estate. The numbers tell a compelling story of transformation that is reshaping industries, creating millions of jobs, and fundamentally altering how we invest.

The Investment Surge

For the first time in history, global energy investment exceeded $3 trillion in 2024. The International Energy Agency reports that $2 trillion of this went directly to sustainable investments in clean energy technologies and infrastructure—nearly double the $1.1 trillion invested in fossil fuels. This 2:1 ratio has widened from an approximate 1:1 ratio just a decade ago.

Solar photovoltaic investment alone is projected to exceed $500 billion in 2024, surpassing all other generation technologies combined. Meanwhile, global ESG fund assets—a key indicator of sustainable investments—reached $40.7 trillion in 2024, an 11% year-over-year increase. Green, social, and sustainability bond issuance hit a record $1.05 trillion, with green bonds accounting for 64% of the total.

As for the 2026 real estate market, this fits into the top trend for housing. You’ll find my recent essay on this of interest.

To put this growth in perspective: in 2015, the ratio of clean power to unabated fossil fuel power investments was roughly 2:1. By 2024, that ratio has soared to 10:1. Africa’s clean energy investments alone doubled between 2020 and 2024, reaching over $40 billion—a signal of massive infrastructure growth in emerging markets.

A Jobs Revolution

The surge in sustainable investments has translated directly into employment. According to IRENA, global renewable energy jobs reached 16.2 million in 2023, up from 13.7 million in 2022—an increase of nearly 2.5 million positions in a single year. The global energy sector added approximately 2.5 million jobs in 2023, with 1.5 million of those in clean energy sectors.

In the United States, clean energy jobs grew 3.9% in 2024—three times faster than the overall economy. Clean energy now accounts for 82% of all new energy jobs added in the country. From 2021 to 2024, U.S. clean energy employment increased by 12%, reaching 3.6 million workers, significantly outpacing the overall job market growth of 8%.

Solar PV remains the fastest-growing employer with 4.9 million jobs globally, while battery electric vehicle manufacturing jobs surged by 40% during this period. Clean energy employment has now surpassed fossil fuel employment globally—a historic crossover that occurred in 2021 and has only accelerated since.

Sustainable Homes: The New Premium

Sustainability, resilience, and efficiency have indeed become top real estate trends—and the data backs it up. Sustainable investments in the global green building market were valued at $565 billion in 2024 and are projected to reach $1.37 trillion by 2034, growing at a compound annual rate of 9.42%.

“84% of residents say living in a green home is important to them, and 64% would pay a premium to live in a green community.”— NAR 2024 Sustainability Report

The wellness real estate segment alone reached $584 billion in 2024, growing an extraordinary 20% annually over the past five years—nearly four times faster than overall global construction growth. The Global Wellness Institute projects this market will double to $1.1 trillion by 2029.

In 2024, over 355,000 homes were HERS (Home Energy Rating System) rated, a 13% increase from 2023. Nearly one-third of all new U.S. homes are now rated for energy efficiency—a direct result of sustainable investments in the housing sector. These homes save homeowners an average of $1,100 per year on energy costs compared to code-minimum construction.

New green buildings see an average 9% increase in asset value and a 10.5% reduction in first-year operating costs. Homes built to LEED standards show an 8% boost in resale value. With 72% of real estate professionals reporting that utility bills and operating costs are a top priority for clients, the market is responding decisively.

When I think of sustainable investments, I think of how we live in our home. It’s putting your money where your mouth is. You can find all sorts of sustainable investments you can make at home, right here.

The Path Forward

The data is unequivocal: capital is voting with its feet, and it’s walking firmly toward sustainability. With sustainable investments in clean energy now doubling fossil fuel spending, millions of new green jobs being created annually, and sustainable real estate commanding premium valuations, we are witnessing not a trend but a fundamental economic transformation.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/eap03.easyagentpro.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/877/2025/11/15141154/solar-power-7151958_1280.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 11:58:30.222379

As adoption grows, the industry has to take responsibility for how these systems perform years after installation. Longevity, safety, and proper maintenance are no longer optional—they’re essential”

— Nick Ogilvie

CELINA, TX, UNITED STATES, January 2, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — As artificial turf continues its rapid expansion across residential, commercial, athletic, and municipal applications, industry leaders are increasingly focused on long-term performance, safety, and sustainability. One of the earliest and most influential figures shaping this shift is Nick Ogilvie, an artificial turf pioneer based in Celina, Texas, whose work spans more than two decades and nearly every major climate region in the United States.

Ogilvie is widely recognized within the industry for advancing artificial turf beyond surface-level installation and toward fully engineered systems designed for longevity, sanitation, and real-world performance. His career includes industry-first installations, nationally recognized certifications, proprietary product development, and extensive consulting work supporting artificial turf companies and facilities across the country.

National Experience Across Diverse Climates

Over the course of his career, Ogilvie has installed and consulted on artificial turf projects from Los Angeles, California, to Burlington, Vermont, and as far south as Sunset Key, Florida. His work spans arid desert conditions, coastal hurricane zones, cold-weather regions, and high-traffic commercial environments.

Industry professionals note that this geographic diversity has contributed to Ogilvie’s reputation as a system-level expert, with firsthand experience in how synthetic turf behaves under varying environmental, structural, and usage demands. In addition to his consulting work, Ogilvie has led installations through his company, Luxe Blades, assisting property owners, developers, and organizations with both new construction and remediation of underperforming turf systems.

Industry-First Installations and Certifications

Among Ogilvie’s most notable achievements is being the first to design and install an artificial turf Par 3 golf hole on the rim of Palo Duro Canyon, one of the most challenging natural landscapes in the United States. The project required advanced engineering solutions addressing wind exposure, drainage, and sub-base stability in a high-risk environment.

Ogilvie is also the only artificial turf installer to hold a certified wind uplift approval for rooftop turf installations under Miami-Dade Code, validated through independent testing and documentation by Haag Global. This certification is considered a benchmark for rooftop turf safety, particularly in hurricane-prone regions, and has helped establish artificial turf as a code-compliant architectural surface.

Product Innovation Driven by Field Experience

In addition to installation and consulting, Ogilvie has played a central role in developing products designed specifically for artificial turf systems—addressing gaps long recognized by industry professionals.

He developed Luxe Bond Pro, a proprietary turf adhesive engineered to withstand extreme heat, moisture, and shear forces commonly encountered in rooftop and high-stress turf installations. The adhesive was created in response to repeated failures observed with generic construction products not designed for synthetic turf applications.

Ogilvie also helped pioneer the first battery-powered artificial turf power broom, developed to restore turf fibers, rebalance infill, and improve surface drainage without damaging turf backing or seams. The innovation marked a shift away from improvised maintenance tools toward equipment engineered exclusively for artificial turf.

Advancing Eco-Conscious Turf Maintenance

Recognizing growing concerns around sanitation, pet safety, and environmental impact, Ogilvie contributed to the development of a fully natural cleaner and deodorizer designed specifically for artificial turf.

The product is:

Eco-friendly and pet-safe

Designed to eliminate odor-causing organic material at the source

Whole Foods EcoCompliant, making it the only artificial turf cleaner in the industry to meet that standard

The formulation also includes a natural, proprietary static-release technology, addressing static buildup commonly associated with synthetic turf surfaces—an issue long noted by facility managers and turf professionals.

Addressing the Industry’s Maintenance Gap

As artificial turf adoption accelerates nationwide, Ogilvie has consistently highlighted what many in the industry now acknowledge as a critical issue: turf systems are often installed correctly but lack proper long-term maintenance protocols.

Organic buildup, infill compaction, bacterial growth, and fiber fatigue can compromise turf performance, safety, and lifespan. Ogilvie’s work has focused on developing maintenance solutions that protect the integrity of turf systems while extending their usable life.

Industry observers note that his approach has helped shift the conversation from “maintenance-free” marketing claims toward realistic, performance-based stewardship of synthetic turf assets.

A Recognized Voice in a Maturing Industry

With artificial turf increasingly used in public spaces, sports facilities, rooftops, and pet environments, scrutiny around safety, compliance, and lifecycle cost continues to rise. Ogilvie’s experience—spanning installation, certification, product development, and maintenance—positions him as a recognized voice in the industry’s ongoing maturation.

Rather than focusing on short-term trends, his work emphasizes accountability, system integrity, and long-term value.

“Artificial turf has matured into permanent infrastructure, not a novelty surface,” said Nick Ogilvie. “As adoption grows, the industry has to take responsibility for how these systems perform years after installation. Longevity, safety, and proper maintenance are no longer optional—they’re essential.”

“We clean the water,” said the superintendent of the Skowhegan Water Pollution Control Plant.

But as one of the oldest wastewater treatment plants in the state, Skowhegan’s facility, along with its sewer system, are constantly in need of improvement. So with the select board’s approval in August, a facility master plan study is now underway.

The planned plant improvements follow more than two decades and millions of dollars’ worth of investments in improving the town’s sewer system. The understanding of wastewater treatment and the biological processes that underpin it, meanwhile, continue to advance, Zaluski said.

And, Zaluski said, improving the plant goes hand-in-hand with ongoing efforts to revitalize the region’s economy and embrace Skowhegan’s connection to the Kennebec River.

“It’s a really good opportunity to optimize the plant and set it up for the next 20 years,” Zaluski said during a recent tour of the town’s plant, off Joyce Street.

Zaluski, 40, of Turner, was hired this spring as the water pollution control superintendent after longtime superintendent Brent Dickey retired. Before Skowhegan, Zaluski worked for the Portland Water District and did offshore work in Alaska.

Zaluski, though, is no stranger to the region: he grew up in the area and went to high school in Madison (and his mother is a recently retired employee of the Maine Trust for Local News and its predecessors).

“I’m excited to be here,” Zaluski said. “I want to acknowledge Brent for doing such a good job for 37 years. We have a precedent of really good environmentalism in this town. We can take that and keep that momentum going. We can do some really cool things for the community with an upgrade — things that bring budgets down.”

The plant at 53 Joyce St. takes sewage and stormwater from approximately 36 miles of collection system, treats it and discharges the cleaned water into the Kennebec River.

The facility, operated by four workers and staffed 365 days a year to meet state and federal permitting and data reporting requirements, is rated to take up to 1.65 million gallons a day.

The treatment process used in Skowhegan is fairly standard, Zaluski said. It largely uses aeration to feed bacteria, which naturally break down nutrients. The final step before water is put into the river is disinfection, done with sodium hypochlorite, commonly known as bleach.

Most of the municipal sewer system is downtown and in the surrounding neighborhoods, although parts of it extend outward, including underneath portions of Madison Avenue, North Avenue, Malbons Mills Road, Norridgewock Avenue, Waterville Road and Middle Road.

A 2019 study reported 5,000 people using the sewer system across 1,500 connections. The system is funded by town property taxes, rather than ratepayers like in a quasi-municipal district.

Skowhegan’s treatment plant dates back more than five decades. Newspaper archives show town voters approved funding in 1971. The plant was built mostly in 1972 and opened the next year.

Zaluski points out the Clean Water Act — the federal law regulating what can be discharged into bodies of water — was enacted in 1972, indicating Skowhegan’s leaders at the time were thinking ahead. The law prompted many communities across the country to build their wastewater treatment plants.

The last major upgrade of the treatment plant was in 2004, with smaller improvements done about 10 years later, according to records Zaluski compiled.

The town’s investment in the last 25 years has focused less on the plant, but more on reducing the impact of its combined sewer overflow.

Like in many older communities, especially those in the Northeast, Skowhegan’s system was designed to carry stormwater and wastewater in the same pipes.

Under normal conditions, all of it goes to the pollution control plant. But during heavy rainfall or snowmelt, the volume of water exceeds the system’s capacity, and and the system discharges untreated water.

Approximately 700 communities in the U.S. have combined sewer systems, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Efforts have been underway in those communities to separate the systems so that stormwater doesn’t flow into the plants, burden the systems, and cause untreated discharges.

As of 2024, Maine had 32 combined sewer overflow permittees in 29 communities, according to the most recent annual report from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Fifteen systems in Maine have fully completed their abatement plans, which the DEP began requiring in the early 1990s in response to federal requirements.

Mitigation work in Skowhegan has been done in phases funded by three bonds. The ultimate solution, Zaluski said, is separating stormwater and wastewater into different pipes throughout much of the system. But that essentially requires digging up every street.

The town has spent more than $20 million on the improvements. The work has resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in untreated discharges since the early 2000s, Zaluski said, although DEP data shows discharges vary widely by year.

For example, the system reported untreated discharges of approximately 253,000 gallons in 2021, 1.7 million gallons in 2022, 7.9 million gallons in 2023 and 2.4 million gallons in 2024, according to the DEP’s 2024 annual report. The number of discharge events has decreased steadily, with six reported in 2024.

With abatement work ongoing — the town has to file an updated master plan with the DEP every five years — Zaluski is now focusing on the plant itself.

The select board approved spending $42,500 for a facilities plan study; the town hired Olver Associates of Winterport to conduct it.

The six-month study is expected to continue into 2026. The goal is to go through every single asset and determine what to keep, what to get rid of, and what to improve. When complete, there will be proposals at a town meeting, when voters can decide if they want to proceed and what projects they want to fund.

Zaluski said improvements would likely include repairs to tanks and opportunities to use new biological technology, such as anoxic and anaerobic treatment zones in addition to the current aerobic treatment. Preventative maintenance is cheaper than major emergency repairs, he said.

He is also looking at ways to keep costs down. Aside from personnel, the department’s top cost in its roughly $1 million annual operating budget is disposal of sludge. The state has required sludge, which had been spread on farmland, to be taken to landfills because of the potentially harmful impacts of so-called forever chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.

Zaluski said odor control measures could be considered as part of the ongoing facility study. In some cases, he said, the solution could be as simple and inexpensive as adding covers to tanks that are currently exposed. More advanced technology is available, too.

Some have pointed out that the plant’s location is less than ideal, just downstream of multimillion-dollar plans to build the long-discussed whitewater River Park, associated trail projects and riverfront improvements. Dealing with sewage comes with an odor.

“Odor control is tough because it’s sort of an elective,” Zaluski said. “It’s a public perception thing. It doesn’t improve the quality of your effluent, but it improves your public image.”

The planned improvements would also set the plant up to accommodate economic growth, Zaluski said.

He is working to develop an ordinance around an industrial pretreatment program, to put a formal framework in place for large, commercial users such as Gifford’s Ice Cream, as well as others that want to move to town.

“I’m looking at resilience in the capacity that we have,” Zaluski said. “It’s an economic driver. If a new business comes in here, we need to be able to handle it.”",https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/43324223_20251215__ms.skowheganwastewater.12xx-_0y071.jpg?w=780,N,,2026-01-03 09:57:56.327269

But as the calendar flipped to 2026, a new champion emerged from the East: China’s BYD. The milestone, reported by outlets including BBC News, The Guardian, CNN, and The New York Times on January 2, 2026, marks the first time Tesla has been dethroned on a calendar-year basis. BYD’s rapid ascent is more than a symbolic victory—it signals a seismic shift in the global automotive industry, with implications that stretch from Wall Street to Main Street, and from Beijing to Detroit.

According to BBC News, BYD’s battery-powered car sales soared by almost 28% in 2025, reaching more than 2.25 million units. Tesla, meanwhile, saw its worldwide deliveries fall nearly 9% to 1.64 million vehicles, marking its second consecutive year of declining sales. The numbers are stark: BYD not only outsold Tesla, but did so by a margin of more than 600,000 vehicles. The Guardian put BYD’s battery electric car total at 2.26 million, while Tesla’s figure stood at 1.63 million.

How did this happen? The story is one of aggressive Chinese expansion, shifting government policies, and a touch of political drama. BYD, founded in 1995 by Wang Chuanfu as a battery company, has been quietly building its empire, first in China and then across the globe. In 2025, BYD’s sales growth was particularly strong in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Europe, despite trade barriers and tariffs imposed on Chinese EVs. The company’s UK sales, for example, surged by a staggering 880% in the year ending September 2025, driven by demand for its plug-in hybrid Seal U SUV, as reported by BBC News.

It’s a remarkable turnaround for a company that, just over a decade ago, was dismissed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In a 2011 Bloomberg TV interview, Musk openly laughed at the mention of BYD, saying, “I don’t think they have a great product.” Fast forward to 2025, and BYD has not only survived but thrived, outselling Tesla despite its EVs not being available for retail purchase in the United States, as noted by USA Today.

But BYD’s rise isn’t just about China’s manufacturing prowess. It’s also a tale of changing tides in government support. Tesla’s struggles in 2025 were exacerbated by the elimination of federal tax credits in the U.S. President Donald Trump and Congress scrapped up to $7,500 in subsidies for EV buyers, a move that hit Tesla particularly hard. As The New York Times reported, Tesla accounted for 45% of the U.S. EV market and had been the biggest beneficiary of federal incentives. The removal of these credits, along with efforts to roll back clean air regulations, sent a chill through the American EV market. Tesla’s car sales fell 16% in the last quarter of 2025 alone.

The political twists didn’t stop there. Musk himself became embroiled in controversy, having briefly served as head of the Department of Government Efficiency under Trump before stepping back. His increasingly visible political views, described by The Guardian as a “backlash from some consumers after Musk’s embrace of far-right politics,” may have also contributed to Tesla’s declining sales. Meanwhile, BYD kept its focus on product and expansion, even as it faced fierce competition at home, with Chinese rivals like Geely, MG, SAIC, and Chery all vying for market share.

Despite its sales slump, Tesla remains the world’s most valuable carmaker, with a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion—more than the next 30 automakers combined, according to The Guardian. Investors seem to be betting on Musk’s vision for the future, which now hinges less on selling cars and more on pioneering robotics and artificial intelligence. Tesla has invested heavily in its “Optimus” humanoid robot and self-driving “Robotaxis.” The company started limited robotaxi operations in Austin, Texas, in 2025, and its self-driving technology rollout in 2026 is seen as crucial to its future. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities told BBC News that Tesla could “own about 70% of the self-driving market over the next decade as no other company in the world can match the scale and scope” of Tesla.

Yet, competition in autonomous driving is heating up. Several Chinese carmakers, including BYD, have introduced advanced driver-assistance systems, such as BYD’s “God’s Eye” technology, now standard even on its cheapest models. While Tesla’s stock price tumbled in early 2025 amid competition and controversy, it rebounded by year’s end, closing at a record $489.88 in December, as reported by CNBC. BYD’s shares also surged, jumping 5% after the latest sales figures were published, while Tesla’s dipped slightly.

Globally, EV sales rose about 28% in 2025, with Chinese automakers leveraging aggressive pricing to undercut Western rivals. BYD’s prices often come in below those of established brands, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers. The company’s overall vehicle sales, including plug-in hybrids and commercial vehicles, reached 4.55 million in 2025. Its sales of plug-in hybrids fell 8% to 2.29 million, but commercial vehicle sales more than doubled to 57,000 units, according to The Guardian.

For Tesla, the loss of the global sales crown is a blow, but not necessarily a knockout. The company remains dominant in the U.S. and is betting big on technologies that could redefine transportation. But the landscape has changed. With governments in Europe and elsewhere rolling back aggressive EV targets, and consumers facing rising prices and fewer incentives, the path forward is less certain than it seemed just a few years ago.

As for BYD, the company’s ascent is a testament to the power of persistence, innovation, and strategic expansion. From its humble beginnings as a battery manufacturer in Shenzhen, BYD now stands atop the EV world—a position few would have predicted a decade ago. The question now is whether it can maintain its lead as the race for the future of mobility enters a new and unpredictable phase.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/jTOQ6HZFGe-rCOpj6NhbaiMJZTM=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F5d0e0773-8954-4c92-a660-0f8932903179.jpeg,N,,2026-01-03 17:58:46.352288

Lake Area Technical College, which has two degree-providing programs in the energy sector, has seen students with renewed interest in the industry thanks to both its growth and opportunity in the state.

Brooks Jacobsen, energy department supervisor at Lake Area Tech, told News Watch that the school's energy operations and energy technology programs have 100% job placement rates. According to Lake Area Tech's website, the energy technology program has an average salary of $71,000 after six months of employment.

Jacobsen said that the exposure students get to various energy sectors, including hydroelectricity, coal, wind and solar energy, allow them to be more flexible when searching for the right career.

""They'll go do an interview or a job shadow on (a specific energy sector) and they'll just love it, and they never thought they would. We try to keep an open mind, try to pre-teach these students that there are these capabilities all over the state,"" Jacobsen said.

News Watch spoke to three students about their decision to enter the energy sector and the opportunities that the state provides for their futures. Here are their stories.

Lakshan Sethuhewa, a 29-year-old student from Sri Lanka, came to Lake Area Tech after a tour that showed him the ""sophisticated program."" Now in his second year, Sethuhewa said he already has a job as a refrigeration expert lined up at the soon-to-open CJ Schwan’s Foods production facility in Sioux Falls.

He said that all of his classmates have job prospects, and that choosing energy was in part due to the vast employment opportunities the field offers.

Sethuhewa is a student in the energy operations program, which trains students to manage energy facilities and operate plants. He described the program as ""hands-on and minds-on,"" and appreciated how his education could translate globally.

""You can practice energy everywhere in the world. Whether you want to go to Europe, South Asia, energy is everywhere,"" Sethuhewa said.

For Quincy Thu, energy runs in the family: his father began teaching energy technology at Lake Area Tech in 2022, which got Thu thinking about the opportunities of the sector.

Thu said that the proximity of the school to his home in Castlewood, as well as affordability, was his deciding factor. As he comes into his final year in the program, he said that he's particularly interested in the wind energy sector, which has strong roots in the eastern side of the state.

""I'm trying to talk to people, interview people, find out where I want to go, find the best company that fits me,"" Thu said.

But he plans on staying in the state for any future career ventures.

""I'm from South Dakota, I love it here,"" Thu said.

Tate Sheehan, a second-year student who is originally from Bird Island, Minnesota, said that his decision to enter the energy sector comes from the idea that the industry's growth is not slowing down any time soon.

He said that a combination of in-class work and hands-on projects has allowed him to feel exceptionally prepared for his entry into the energy world.

Though he's a few hundred miles from home, Sheehan said he plans to stay in South Dakota and find a company he can ""settle down"" with while continuing to climb the career ladder – a goal he credits to seeing firsthand how quickly the industry is growing.

Renewable energy - considered crucial to limiting climate change - produced a record amount of electricity in Great Britain in 2025, BBC analysis shows.

Wind was the biggest single renewable source of electricity, according to the provisional figures from the National Energy System Operator (Neso).

But solar-powered electricity rose by nearly a third on 2024 levels, helped by the UK's sunniest year on record and the expansion of solar panels around the country.

While behind renewables, electricity from fossil gas also rose slightly, highlighting the challenge of reaching the government's ""clean power"" target by 2030.

""It has been quite a strong year in terms of deployment of renewables,"" said Pranav Menon, research senior associate at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.

""[But] what we're not seeing is kind of the exponential scale-up that you'd need to get to clean power 2030, because those targets are very, very ambitious,"" he added.

Under its ""clean power"" target, the government aims to use hardly any polluting gas to produce electricity by 2030. It is also under pressure to meet its pledge to bring energy bills down by up to £300 by then and has argued that clean power can achieve this.

Neso data - and the clean power target - only cover Great Britain and not Northern Ireland, which has its own electricity transmission system operator.

The recent growth of renewables has been one of the strongest areas of progress in the world's attempts to tackle climate change.

The trend has been notable in Great Britain over the past decade too. The government wants to ramp up renewables even more quickly to help meet its own clean power goal and reduce its planet-warming carbon emissions.

In 2025, wind, solar, hydro and biomass generated more than 127 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in Great Britain, according to BBC analysis of provisional Neso data.

That beats the previous high of 119TWh in 2024.

Wind generated more than 85TWh - nearly 30% - of Great Britain's electricity last year, up slightly on 2024, according to analysis of Neso data.

But the most notable change was solar power.

Over the course of the year, solar panels generated more than 18TWh - over 6% of British electricity.

While that is still a relatively small share, it marks a growth of more than 4TWh versus 2024.

At its peak, solar was producing more than 40% of electricity for a small number of half-hour periods in July.

Back in 2013, no such period had more than roughly 5% of electricity generation from solar.

Part of the reason is the expansion of solar panels across the UK. More large solar farms came online this year, including the biggest at Cleve Hill near Faversham, in Kent.

And it was a record year for solar panels on rooftops, with about 250,000 new small-scale installations reported to the Microgeneration Certification Scheme.

With 2025 the UK's sunniest year on record, conditions were ideal for British solar panels to capitalise on long, sunny days through the spring and summer.

""Solar's probably a bigger part of the system than we'd expected, given the cost has come down so much,"" said Michael Grubb, professor of energy and climate change at University College London.

Renewables can generate significant amounts of electricity when conditions are right. On roughly a third of days in 2025, at least half of Britain's electricity came from renewables, according to BBC analysis of Neso data.

But the British electricity grid often still leans heavily on fossil fuel gas.

Analysis of Neso's figures shows gas generated more than 77TWh - roughly 27% - of electricity, up from 72TWh in 2024.

That increase could be down to several factors, including Britain importing slightly less electricity from Europe, lower nuclear generation, the closure of the last coal power station in 2024 and higher electricity demand.

Driven by the rise in gas, Britain's electricity was slightly more polluting in 2025 than 2024, according to Neso's data.

In 2025, each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated 126g of planet-warming carbon dioxide on average - up from 124g/kWh in 2024 but down from 505g/kWh in 2012.

With the exception of wind and solar, Neso's figures only cover generation connected to the main transmission network.

They do not include smaller-scale gas, biomass and hydro operators feeding in electricity at a local level, but these contribute a relatively small fraction of Britain's total generation.

Separate analysis of UK government data by the climate website Carbon Brief - which includes these smaller sources and Northern Ireland - shows very similar trends to the Neso data for Great Britain. That includes a new renewables record and a slight rise in gas generation.

Off track for clean power?

The government has defined its ""clean power"" target as 95% of all electricity generated in Britain coming from renewables and nuclear energy by 2030.

In 2024 clean sources produced almost three-quarters of total electricity generation for the year, according to government figures.

These numbers differ from Neso data, which includes imports as well as some gas generation not covered by the government's clean power definition.

Government figures for 2025 will not be released until later this year - but the amount of gas still in the electricity mix shows there is much to be done.

""There's still a significant number of periods in the year where the sun's not shining, the wind's not blowing, demand is high […] and that's where the system is sort of forced to rely on gas-fired power to turn up and meet demand,"" said Mr Menon.

He added that there were solutions to this challenge. They include technologies like batteries - to store renewable electricity to use when it is less sunny and windy - as well as other low-carbon sources like nuclear, which can provide dependable output.

One of the other struggles in meeting the clean power target is the need to upgrade the electricity grid, partly to connect new renewables and move their electricity around the country.

Sometimes the grid cannot cope with all of the renewable electricity that could be generated, leading to wind farms being paid to reduce their output.

Grid upgrades should help to reduce the problem but upgrades add to costs in the short term.

That could offset some of the savings from some of the cheapest renewables which are starting to displace gas power, according to Prof Grubb.

But he said he still expected bills to start to come down in the coming years - partly due to those renewables, but also assuming gas prices fall from their recent high levels.

In response to the renewables data, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: ""After years of delay and underinvestment, this government is keeping its promise to take back control of Britain's energy with clean homegrown power.""

This would ""protect households against volatile fossil fuel markets"", he added.

But shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho called on the government to ditch its clean power target, arguing it was raising energy bills.

""Britain is generating more renewable power than ever before, but people should know about the extra costs that come along with it,"" she said.

CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) — Sixteen-year-old Arthur Brodard went to the Le Constellation bar with friends to celebrate the New Year. Nearly 48 hours after a devastating fire, his mother still held out hope he might be one of the six injured people who remained unidentified after one of Switzerland’s worst tragedies.

Those half-dozen people gave a glimmer of hope for families whose loved ones were missing in the aftermath of the fire at the Alpine ski resort of Crans-Montana that killed 40 people and injured 119 others, 113 of whom have been formally identified.

“I’m looking everywhere. The body of my son is somewhere,” Laetitia Brodard, from Lausanne, Switzerland, told reporters. “I want to know, where is my child, and be by his side. Wherever that may be, be it in the intensive care unit or the morgue.”

The severity of the burns has made it difficult to identify both the injured and deceased, requiring families to supply authorities with DNA samples. In some cases, wallets and any identification documents inside turned to ash in the flames. An Instagram account has filled up with photos of people who were unaccounted for, and friends and relatives begged for tips about their whereabouts.

Officials in the Valais regional government acknowledged the prolonged heartache.

How one Swiss hospital coped with the injured from the Alpine bar fire

SION, Switzerland (AP) — The hospital that initially took in the majority of injured victims from a fire at a Swiss bar is no stranger to emergencies: In the heart of the Alps, it is used to treating winter sports enthusiasts who have accidents on the slopes.

But the flood of young and severely burned survivors from the blaze that tore through Le Constellation in Crans-Montana during New Year's Eve revelry was something else.

Eric Bonvin, general director of the regional hospital in Sion that took in several dozen injured people, said those with severe burns face months of treatment but expressed hope that their youth will speed their recovery.

The injured were teenagers and young adults, roughly 20 years old on average, he told The Associated Press inside the hospital, which is about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the resort by air. Survivors have described seeing their fellow revelers struggling to escape the inferno, some with severe burns.

Bonvin recounted how hospital staff scrambled to determine the extent of people’s injuries — aided by colleagues who had not been scheduled to work but rushed in to lend a hand.

Zelenskyy names Ukraine's head of military intelligence as his new chief of staff

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday appointed the head of Ukraine's military intelligence as his new chief of staff, a move that comes as the U.S. leads a diplomatic push to end Russia's nearly 4-year-old invasion.

Announcing the appointment of Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, Zelenskyy said Ukraine needs to focus on security issues, developing its defense and security forces, and peace talks — areas that are overseen by the office of the president.

Zelenskyy had dismissed his previous chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, after anti-corruption officials began investigating alleged graft in the energy sector.

The president framed Budanov's appointment as part of a broader effort to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy.

“Kyrylo has specialized experience in these areas and sufficient strength to achieve results,” Zelenskyy said.

Trump and top Iranian officials exchange threats over protests roiling Iran

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump and top Iranian officials exchanged dueling threats Friday as widening protests swept across parts of the Islamic Republic, further escalating tensions between the countries after America bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June.

At least eight people have been killed so far in violence surrounding the demonstrations, which were sparked in part by the collapse of Iran’s rial currency but have increasingly seen crowds chanting anti-government slogans.

The protests, now in their sixth day, have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. However, the protests have yet to be as widespread and intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.

Trump initially wrote on his Truth Social platform, warning Iran that if it “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the United States “will come to their rescue.”

“We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” Trump wrote, without elaborating.

Yemen’s separatists announce a constitution for an independent south

ADEN, Yemen (AP) — Yemen 's separatist movement on Friday announced a constitution for an independent nation in the south and demanded other factions in the war-torn country accept the move in an escalation of a confrontation that has pitted Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against each other.

The UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council depicted the announcement as a declaration of independence for the south. But it was not immediately clear if the move could be implemented or was largely symbolic. Last month, STC-linked fighters seized control of two southern provinces from Saudi-backed forces and took over the Presidential Palace in the south's main city, Aden. Members of the internationally recognized government — which had been based in Aden — fled to the Saudi-capital Riyadh.

On Friday, Saudi warplanes bombed camps and military positions held by the STC in Hadramout province as Saudi-backed fighters tried to seize the facilities, a separatist official said. It was the latest direct intervention by Saudi Arabia, which in recent weeks has bombed STC forces and struck what is said was a shipment of Emirati weapons destined for the separatists.

Meanwhile, the UAE announced early Saturday it had completely withdrawn all its troops from Yemen, something it pledged to do after the confrontation.

Ostensibly, Saudi Arabia and the UAE and their allies on the ground in Yemen have all been part of a Saudi-led coalition fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who control the north in the country's decade-long civil war. The coalition's professed goal has long been to restore the internationally recognized government, which was driven out of the north by the Houthis. But tensions between the factions and the two Gulf nations appear to be unraveling the coalition, threatening to throw them into outright conflict and further tear apart the Arab world's poorest country.

Trump wants to overhaul the 'president's golf course.' He hasn't played there yet

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump has spent much of his two-week vacation in Florida golfing. But when he gets back to the White House, there's a military golf course that he's never played that he's eyeing for a major construction project.

Long a favored getaway for presidents seeking a few hours’ solace from the stress of running the free world, the Courses at Andrews — inside the secure confines of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the White House — are known as the “president's golf course."" Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Joe Biden have spent time there, and Barack Obama played it more frequently than any president, roughly 110 times in eight years.

Trump has always preferred the golf courses his family owns — spending about one of every four days of his second term at one of them. But he's now enlisted golf champion Jack Nicklaus as the architect to overhaul the Courses at Andrews.

“It’s amazing that an individual has time to take a couple hours away from the world crises. And they’re people like everybody else,” said Michael Thomas, the former general manager of the course, who has golfed with many of the presidents visiting Andrews over the years.

Andrews, better known as the home of Air Force One, has two 18-hole courses and a 9-hole one. Its facilities have undergone renovations in the past, including in 2018, when Congress approved funding to replace aging presidential aircraft and to build a new hangar and support facilities. That project was close enough to the courses that they had to be altered then, too.

FBI says it disrupted a New Year's Eve attack plan inspired by Islamic State group

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The FBI said Friday it disrupted a New Year’s Eve attack plot targeting a grocery store and fast-food restaurant in North Carolina, arresting an 18-year-old man who authorities say pledged loyalty to the Islamic State group.

Christian Sturdivant was charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Investigators said he told an undercover FBI employee posing as a supportive confidant about his plans to attack people. Their online messages, along with a recent search of his home, indicated attacks would occur with knives and hammers, according to prosecutors and records.

Worried Sturdivant might attempt violence before New Year’s Eve, the FBI placed him under constant surveillance for days, including on Christmas, U.S. Attorney for Western North Carolina Russ Ferguson said.

Agents were prepared to arrest him earlier if he left his home with weapons, Ferguson said at a news conference in Charlotte. “At no point was the public in harm’s way.”

Sturdivant was arrested Wednesday and remained in custody after a federal court appearance Friday. An attorney representing him did not immediately respond to an email or phone message seeking comment. Another hearing was scheduled for Jan. 7.

Grandmother and grandson burn to death in Gaza tent while cooking; Jolie visits Rafah crossing

DEIR AL BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson burned to death in Gaza when their tent caught fire while cooking, as thousands of Palestinians endure colder weather in makeshift housing.

The nylon tent in Yarmouk caught fire Thursday night while a meal was being prepared, a neighbor said. A hospital official said that two Palestinian men were killed by Israeli gunfire on Friday in Gaza.

The shaky 12-week-old ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas militant group has largely ended large-scale Israeli bombardment of Gaza. But Palestinians are still being killed by Israeli forces, especially along the so-called Yellow Line that delineates areas under Israeli control.

On Friday, American actor and film producer Angelina Jolie visited the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.

Over the past few weeks, cold winter rains have repeatedly lashed the sprawling tent cities, causing flooding, turning Gaza’s dirt roads into mud and causing damaged buildings to collapse.

Tesla loses title as world's biggest electric vehicle maker as sales fall for second year in a row

NEW YORK (AP) — Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It's a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world's richest man. The sales drop came despite President Donald Trump's marketing effort early last year when he called a press conference to praise Musk as a “patriot” in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Earthquake with 6.5 magnitude rattles southern and central Mexico killing 2

MEXICO CITY (AP) — A strong earthquake rattled southern and central Mexico on Friday, interrupting President Claudia Sheinbaum ’s first press briefing of the new year as seismic alarms sounded and leaving at least two people dead.

The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.5 and its epicenter was near the town of San Marcos in the southern state of Guerrero near the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco, according to Mexico ’s national seismological agency. There were more than 500 aftershocks.

The state’s civil defense agency reported various landslides around Acapulco and on other highways in the state.

Guerrero Gov. Evelyn Salgado said that a 50-year-old woman living in a small community near the epicenter died when her home collapsed. Authorities also said that a hospital in Chilpancingo, Guerrero's capital, suffered major structural damage and various patients were evacuated.

Residents and tourists in Mexico City and Acapulco rushed into the streets when the shaking began.

The $285 million cash transaction marks a consolidation of assets as Pine Gate proceeds through a court-supervised restructuring in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.

The portfolio consists of nine solar projects across North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Alabama. According to court filings, the deal carries an implied enterprise value of approximately $575 million, which includes the assumption of $260 million in project-level debt and an additional $30 million in committed investments.

The portfolio includes 650 MW of operational capacity and 100 MW in advanced construction. The remaining 225 MW is in early-stage construction and expected to reach commercial operation by 2027.

The acquisition comes just eight weeks after Pine Gate Renewables filed for Chapter 11 protection on November 6, 2025. At the time of the filing, the developer cited mounting legislative and regulatory challenges, citing the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which curtailed federal tax credits and increased project costs. Before the filing, the company’s EPC subsidiary Blue Ridge Power laid off over 500 employees.

Nofar USA’s purchase is subject to a final bankruptcy court approval hearing scheduled for January 5, 2026.

The acquisition represents a major expansion of Nofar USA’s North American footprint, bringing its total U.S. pipeline to nearly 2 GW of solar and 1.2 GWh of storage. Nofar USA’s parent ocompany Nofar is headquartered in Kfar Saba, Israel.

The transaction is expected to close following standard regulatory approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

In 2026, the pressure will be even higher as AI data centers driven by Microsoft and Amazon come online. And it seems everyone, including Gov. Josh Shapiro, has big ideas for the future.

The governor’s Lightning Plan and a competing push for both fossil fuel and renewable projects drove debate over a host of issues, all circling the same question of whether new generation can be added to the grid fast enough.

Billed as an “all of the above” energy strategy designed to lower consumer costs, create energy jobs, and streamline approval of new power projects in the commonwealth, it has met opposition on several fronts.

The plan – House Bill 501 – requires 35% of generation to come from renewable sources within 10 years. It advanced from the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee in June by a 14-12 party-line vote, with no Republicans in support. In October, it was removed from the table, with no further action to date.

It also seeks to create the Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition (RESET) board, intended to expedite the approval of major energy projects. However, some opponents claimed that it would undermine municipal zoning and local control. In April, it was referred to the House Energy Committee, where it awaits further action.

Industry experts say clean energy projects can be built quickly and affordably, though getting the proposals through the legislative process may take time.

Lawmakers wanting to make solar a part of the state’s broader energy strategy say last year’s budget impasse stalled momentum and now hope the bills will rise on the priority list.

The Solar for Schools Grant Program is one exception: the legislation creating it passed last session with bipartisan support and backing from environmental and labor groups. In the pilot round, demand outpaced funding. The Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development received 88 applications from schools across 25 counties requesting $88 million – more than three times the available $25 million. The administration added another $25 million to the budget in 2025-2026 to expand the program.

A bill to conduct a study on the viability of renewable energy projects on Lake Erie has been lying dormant since May.

During a House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee meeting on the subject, supporters emphasized that the study explores the opportunity to diversify Pennsylvania’s energy portfolio while prioritizing the use of clean, renewable energy without increasing utility prices. Opponents expressed concerns over the impact on wildlife, outdoor recreation, shipping, and tourism.

House Bill 1155, a Democratic-backed community solar proposal, would let people who can’t install panels at home, such as renters, subscribe to a shared solar project to lower their electricity bills while strengthening the grid. It’s also designed so non-subscribers aren’t responsible for costs associated with the program.

Legislation in both chambers takes advantage of the proliferation of warehouses that have popped up in the commonwealth by making use of their rooftops to deploy solar.

House Bill 1260 proposed requiring new warehouses to be built “solar-ready” while offering tax incentives to retrofit existing structures. In parallel, Senate Bill 983 would create a commercial and industrial rooftop solar program designed to streamline front-of-meter projects – installations that can send power back into the grid.

Supporters argued that rooftop solar avoids new land use fights and can scale quickly compared with large greenfield developments. Skeptics warned mandates risk government overreach and suggested incentives-only approaches would be more politically viable.

Federal money is also on the table to help low-to-moderate income households install solar through the Solar for All program, but Pennsylvania law requires legislative approval before it can be accessed.

House Bill 362 was introduced to clear the way for the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority to tap into the $156 million the EPA awarded in 2024 through the Inflation Reduction Act. The program promises at least 20% savings on electricity bills while also supporting workforce training and upgrades needed to make solar possible.

The tax credits for wind and solar being phased out by the congressional budget resolution passed in July was widely viewed as a blow to the renewable energy industry but clean energy advocates remain optimistic.

Even as electricity costs are projected to rise over the next decade, they say, some wind and solar developments can still qualify for credits if construction begins within a year of the law’s passage. And federal incentives remain available for other technologies such as geothermal and battery energy storage – an especially important opening for Pennsylvania as power demand climbs alongside major tech-sector investment.

Still, others warned that repealing bipartisan federal tax credits for energy manufacturing could jeopardize $1.34 billion in potential investment. Reduced investment and rising energy costs, they say, would lead to 26,000 fewer jobs by 2030 and nearly 29,000 fewer by 2035 compared to projections under current tax policy.

They pointed to a report projecting that the elimination of energy-related tax credits would reduce new clean power additions to the grid by 57% to 72%, even as the state’s energy demand is expected to rise by 4.5 to 6.5 TWh by 2026. Additionally, without technology-neutral federal incentives, electricity prices could jump 8% over the same period.

Technology companies responsible for power-hungry data centers have hitched their hopes on a resurgence of nuclear power. Amazon and Microsoft have both enlisted existing plants to fuel their AI infrastructure, while the industry looks toward the development of small modular reactors for future output.

The reaction to the reopening of Three Mile Island through a purchase agreement with Microsoft remains split. Supporters emphasize jobs and carbon-free baseload power while opponents focus on waste, risk, and site concerns.

As renewables and nuclear advanced in committees, advocates made the argument for the reliability of natural gas and touted pipeline expansion as a key to U.S. energy dominance.

At Shale Insight 2025, hosted by the Marcellus Shale Coalition in Erie, the message from industry leaders and policymakers was consistent: natural gas remains the backbone of America’s energy system. Expanding pipeline capacity, modernizing regulations, and protecting affordability were framed as essential to meeting rising demand in a rapidly changing landscape.

At the conference, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum warned against policies that shut down base loads like gas and nuclear plants while prioritizing highly subsidized, intermittent, and unreliable renewable sources of electricity – arguing such policies have led to higher costs and less reliability.

Participants widely agreed natural gas is the cornerstone of U.S. energy, while highlighting overlapping concerns over grid reliability, affordability, and infrastructure bottlenecks.

Marcellus Shale was also mentioned in a study by the National Energy Technology Laboratory suggesting wastewater from the region could supply 40% of U.S. lithium needs – an exciting prospect as lithium demand surges for phones, EVs, and grid-scale storage. This, however, presents a dilemma for clean energy advocates, as it comes from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking – an industry they oppose.

Throughout the year, affordability and reliability framed every discussion. As 2026 begins, the question isn’t whether Pennsylvania needs more power – it’s about who will decide what gets built – and how fast.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/67/967975d9-9364-4f19-b18d-5a4c28696b0c/68d80fae15cf8.image.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 05:57:18.823798

It's a stunning reversal for Musk who once dismissed BYD as a threat as Tesla's rise seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make him the world's richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk's pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don't matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company's energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla's directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Over time, silt filled the river bottom from increased runoff, and large ships could no longer navigate through the waters.
The Anacostia River watershed, the area that drains into the main branch of the river, covers 176 square miles of highly urbanized geography.
The budget crisis has resulted in the termination of funding that supported the free educational Anacostia Riverkeeper boat tours.
For organizations that rely on government grants, like Anacostia Riverkeeper, this can be a devastating blow to operations.","“It’s such a different sight than what people expect of the Anacostia River,” says Trey Sherard.

The riverkeeper slowly pulls his boat up to the underpass of the Anacostia Railroad Bridge, collapses the boat canopy, and wryly asks if anyone has read The Chronicles of Narnia. Sherard is met with a few yeses and some nos, then says we are about to enter the Anacostia River version of the wardrobe that transports to a magical land.

Before us are sunbathing turtles, an osprey nest, and two miles of undeveloped waterfront. The Anacostia River—known to many in Washington, D.C., as a littered and polluted urban waterway —seemingly has a natural beauty to rival rivers anywhere in the United States. Lush green woodlands slope into muddy riverbanks. Wetland grasses sway in the breeze, and the sun glistens off the current.

“This section of river here,” says Sherard, “is what we call the epicenter of environmental racism on this river, which is saying a lot because the whole river has often been defined in terms of environmental injustice.”

Along the river’s east bank are five historically Black Washington communities: Mayfair, River Terrace, Kenilworth, Parkside, and Eastland Gardens, all boxed in between the river, Kenilworth Park, and the Anacostia Freeway. For decades, these communities have dealt with disinvestment, industrial pollution, and the waste and litter carried by the neglected river. Swimming in the Anacostia was deemed unsafe and made illegal in 1971. The communities surrounding the river have been vocal about these problems since the area was first developed.

“It’s not for lack of advocacy by the community, [that the river was neglected],” says Sherard, “but for lack of their message being received by someone held accountable.”

At this point in the tour, the boat is located squarely inside D.C., but from the bow, it looks like you’re out in the country. The juxtaposition of the rich greenery from the U.S. National Arboretum and Kenilworth Park with the history of environmental racism of the area is staggering. Sherard, who leads this boat tour as part of his work with the organization Anacostia Riverkeeper, says that the contrast is useful for helping people understand what’s happened here and getting them engaged.

“[The river is] this incredible asset and opportunity, even despite all of the abuse that we’ve given to it,” he says.

The eight-and-a-half mile Anacostia River is short, but has a long history of supporting human life. The largest of three D.C.-area Native American villages, Nacotchtank, was located along the river, which was called anaquash, meaning “village trading center.” Historians believe Native Americans lived on the river for 10,000 years before being pushed out by European colonialization. Settlers arriving in the early seventeenth century found a river teeming with shad, herring, and perch, and in places it was forty feet deep, leaving plenty of room for large vessels to navigate the waterway.

The District’s population boomed during and after the Civil War as newly freed enslaved people moved north and Union soldiers garrisoned there. Over time, silt filled the river bottom from increased runoff, and large ships could no longer navigate through the waters. Its usefulness as a waterway for shipping ended, and many industries treated the river as a waste disposal site.

Sewage has proven to be a perennial problem for the Anacostia River. A significant portion of the capital’s sewer system was built before 1900 and is a combined sewer system, which means stormwater and sewage are mixed. This doesn’t cause problems when conditions are stable, but during heavy rainfalls, the system can overflow into nearby waterways, including the Anacostia. These events can cause bacteria levels to spike to unhealthy amounts, giving rise to waterborne illness. As humans continue to drive climate change by rapidly burning fossil fuels, D.C. is seeing more intense rainstorms. The Anacostia River watershed, the area that drains into the main branch of the river, covers 176 square miles of highly urbanized geography. Stormwater, sewage, sediment, and trash all flow into the river, creating a concentrated mix of harmful debris.

“You can associate the conditions and health of the river to conditions and health of the areas that border it, and that includes the people who inhabit those areas,” says Dennis Chestnut, a lifelong Washingtonian and resident of Ward 7. “When discussing environmental justice on the Anacostia River, you have to include and focus as much on the communities that border the river.”

Chestnut is a master carpenter and vocational educator by profession, and is also a national river hero and environmental activist with a palpable enthusiasm. “The river really got me very interested in science and made me appreciate the outdoors,” he says. His relationship to the river is lifelong, and he has made it a personal goal to help others build one as well.

“As a child, it was like an ocean to me,” Chestnut says. In the 1950s and 1960s—before it was outlawed—he learned to swim in the Anacostia and in a tributary near his childhood home. Today that tributary, a stream called Watts Branch, is mostly captured in concrete channels and culverts. For Chestnut and his family, it was like a personal beach, and since it was an inlet, it was safer to swim.

“The times that we were in, the reason we were swimming in the stream and in the river was because Washington, D.C., was legally segregated,” says Chestnut. “The closest swimming pool was in a white community and it was segregated. We couldn’t go to that pool. But we had the river.”

Chestnut emphasizes that the environmental burdens on the Anacostia River and the communities to its east have not been accidental. He points out that railroad tracks crisscross Ward 7, highway 295 cuts through the middle of the community, and the riverside Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) plant burned coal and dumped waste in the river for decades, alongside many other polluting industries.

Watts Branch flows through Kenilworth Park, which was Kenilworth Dump and Landfill for nearly three decades. The site received municipal waste from the capital, burned trash openly, and received ashes from nearby incinerators, which leached into the river. The dump exposed the nearby community and river to smoke and toxic chemicals. It was one of the few open areas in the communities east of the river, and Chestnut remembers playing at the dump with his friends. In 1968, seven-year-old Kelvin Tyrone Mock burned to death while playing on the trash when winds shifted and engulfed the child in flames. The following day, the mayor ordered open-burning at the dump to stop, but municipal trash continued to fill the site until 1970.

“All of those things that we would consider negative impact kinds of things—like the railroad tracks, the freeway, the power plant, the landfill—were located on this side of the city primarily because this was the side where the people of color and poor people lived,” says Chestnut. “This community has been resilient for a long time, having to put up with all of those things.”

Earth Conservation Corps (ECC) a youth-driven environmental action organization that works to restore the Anacostia River, has also made enormous strides in helping communities reclaim the river through cleanups and youth programs, but there is much more to be done.

“The perception of the Anacostia [to most in Generation Z] right now is still, ‘Nah, it’s dirty, don’t touch it,’ ” says Sonora Phillips, director of programs and partnerships at ECC.

Yet, she adds, “Young people are powerful. Getting young people involved in the environment and allowing them to see they can make a difference . . . that’s huge.”

Phillips helps students care for raptors; maintain Turtle Beach, one of the last few remaining wetlands along the Anacostia River; and learn about the power of storytelling and environmental education through ECC’s Youth Media Arts program.

The ECC program works with youth from many different backgrounds, including students coming from the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services.

“These are youth who are often counted out, and [now] they’re doing conservation work,” Phillips says. “It’s amazing; I never thought the environment would be the thing that would take young people out of their current [difficult] environment, and it is.”

Washington, D.C., has been in a budget crisis for the better part of 2025. The problems started in March when the House of Representatives passed a federal government funding bill that would force the D.C. Council to revert to its 2024 budget parameters. This move left a $1.1 billion gap in a previously balanced budget midway through the financial year. Months later, a fix for the budget has stalled out at the hands of ultraconservatives, with their insistence on more limits on voting rights and abortion. While city officials have added some money back to the budget, many cuts have been made to plug the enormous hole.

The budget crisis has resulted in the termination of funding that supported the free educational Anacostia Riverkeeper boat tours. There are also now no funds for the organization to monitor water quality, or to maintain trash traps that capture floating debris in the water.

“We’re coming to an inflection point now,” says Sherard. “We need to keep moving forward and not risk losing ground as we lose investment.”

Under the Trump Administration, the nonprofit landscape has entered uncharted waters with organizations facing the possibility of losing government funding or their tax-exempt status if they are at odds with the White House. For organizations that rely on government grants, like Anacostia Riverkeeper, this can be a devastating blow to operations. Sherard says the administration is relentlessly attacking environmental initiatives and organizations.

“Philanthropy largely backed out of this watershed a little while back after it got it from ‘worst’ to ‘OK,’ ” says Sherard. Anacostia Riverkeeper has seen a small uptick in philanthropic donations, but not enough to cover foundational needs. “We hope that big philanthropy will step in while clearly the government is unable to do so, but we don’t know, and that uncertainty is a big stressor.”

“The river is this beautiful green and blue way through the middle of Northeast and Southeast D.C.,” he adds. “Someone who hasn’t seen it firsthand can’t really truly understand that.”

While political shifts have disrupted Anacostia Riverkeeper, momentum continues forward through new and old partnerships, with a swim event still set as a long-term goal. Since the swimming ban in 1971, the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment amended the rules in 2018 to permit single-day swim events if certain healthy conditions are met. There is no date on the calendar for a 2025 swim event, as the permitting process can take months, but Anacostia Riverkeeper is hoping to host an event in 2026.

Chestnut is excited by the prospect.

“I still have the same attachment to the river as I had as a child, and I hope to be able to swim in it again,” he says with a big smile. “This community, full of natural resources, has done a lot for me and I just feel so very fortunate to have had the opportunity to be here and still be here.”

Despite the recent financial setbacks and a grim political landscape, Chestnut is heartened by the efforts of his community in Ward 7 to restore the river.

“I feel good about where I see things,” Chestnut says. “If we keep going in this direction, and get future generations involved, it’s going to be the kind of river we should have in the nation’s capital.”

Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles, marking the company's second consecutive annual decline.

With global EV sales rising 28% last year, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time on an annual basis, helped by rapid growth in Europe, where the Chinese automaker has been widening its lead over the U.S. rival.

The annual deliveries figure raises questions about whether Tesla can stabilize its core auto business following two consecutive years of sales declines, even as it pivots to futuristic projects such as robotics and self-driving cars to justify its steep valuation.

Tesla shares were marginally up in early trading.

""I think the market remains focused on the robotaxi business, where Tesla is testing its Cybercab in Austin,"" said Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar.

""If deliveries can continue to not be down too much in the coming quarters, I expect market sentiment around the robotaxi will continue to drive the stock,"" Goldstein added.

Tesla's fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in U.S. EV tax credits before they expired at the end of September, followed by a sharper slowdown as incentives rolled off.

EV demand has softened in the U.S. since the end of September, when President Donald Trump's administration ended $7,500 federal tax credits.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October-December quarter, down 15.6% from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles or a 12.3% drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles, marking the company's second consecutive annual decline.

Analysts have said Tesla came under immense pressure in 2025 in North America and Europe, where competition intensified and the company faced brand backlash due to CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric.

Growing competition from Chinese firms and European automakers such as Volkswagen and BMW has weighed on Tesla's sales momentum.

BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150% from 2024. The company has said it aimed to sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down ""Standard"" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about $5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend sales volumes after the tax credit loss and appeal to customers in Europe looking for cheaper options.

The move disappointed some investors, who had expected a larger price cut or a meaningfully new mass-market product.

Even as vehicle deliveries have weakened, Tesla shares rose about 11.4% in 2025, boosting Musk's wealth.",https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-productionv3-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F0%2F9%2F8%2F9%2F11969890-2-eng-GB%2F93612e3798cd-2025-07-15T091040Z_1027668819_RC2TMFA378H4_RTRMADP_3_TESLA-INDIA.JPG?width=1260&fit=cover&gravity=faces&dpr=2&quality=medium&source=nar-cms&format=auto&height=630,N,,2026-01-02 23:57:27.260253

Coal has long powered the homes and industries of Indiana, but the future of the state’s energy landscape is at a crossroads. As the push for renewable energy grows stronger, the state faces tough questions about how to transition away from its reliance on coal – an energy source deeply embedded in both the economy and culture. What will it take to make that shift, and why has it taken so long? WFHB Environmental Correspondent Amelia Bucher explores the challenges, the stakes, and the politics of Indiana’s energy future in her feature on the path to cleaner, more sustainable power.

Up next, on June 9th, 2025, the city of Bloomington posted a news release that explained an insect, named the Spotted Lanternfly, had been confirmed in Bartholomew County, about 50 miles from Bloomington. The insect, a non-native and invasive species, can feed on more than 70 plants, harming growth and health of plants. Correspondent Katrine Bruner spoke with the city’s Urban Forester, Haskell Smith, to learn more about the insect and what Bloomington has been doing to mitigate risk.

That cumulative pressure helps explain the persistent deficits Wood Mackenzie models for 2025: an estimated 30% shortfall for power transformers and 10% for distribution units across the national fleet.
Since 2019, unit prices have increased 77% for power transformers and 45% for GSUs, with some classes of distribution transformers rising as much as 95%.
Over the past year, policy signals around transformer manufacturing have been notably mixed but potentially disruptive.
The Transformer Shortage Is Systemic, Not Isolated While transformers draw the most attention, the transformer shortage is really a transmission and distribution (T&D) equipment shortage.","Analysts still see multi-year deficits in U.S. transformer supply, even as equipment manufacturers invest billions in new factories and advanced manufacturing processes. But some brokers suggest there is no real shortage and that, if there is a crisis, it stems from procurement blinders.

The electrical transformer “shortage” seems to have become the defining supply chain story of the 2020s, and it has factored into utility capital plans, renewable deployment timelines, and even how grid resilience is discussed at the policy level. As POWER reported in 2024, over the past few years, what started as a squeeze has gradually morphed into a crisis, furnished by years of underinvestment in domestic manufacturing, a sudden surge in post-pandemic construction and electrification, and volatility in grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES) and copper markets, which steadily pushed lead times for large power and generator step-up (GSU) transformers beyond historical norms.

At POWER’s Experience POWER conference in October 2025, concerns remained centered on procurement of the critical components, which are used to step voltage up for transmission, step it back down for safe distribution, and protect every major interface between generation, the bulk grid, and end-use systems.

Utilities, prominently, have begun treating early transformer and switchgear procurement as a competitive lever in an era of accelerated build timelines to accommodate large new loads such as data centers, while engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firms report being forced to redesign schedules, reorder work sequences, and lock in equipment earlier than ever as access to scarce grid components increasingly determines which projects can advance and which are pushed into multi-year limbo. In 2025, several consulting firm assessments continued to warn of persistent transformer shortages and an overstretched supply chain. However, some market participants go further, arguing that there is no real shortage and that procurement practices—not manufacturing capacity—are the bottleneck.

The Shortage by the Numbers

In an August 2025 analysis, consulting firm Wood Mackenzie warned that the U.S. transformer market remains structurally out of balance, and that demand continues to outpace any realistic near-term increase in manufacturing capacity. The firm noted that power-transformer demand has risen 119% since 2019, and distribution-transformer demand is up 34%, driven by faster-than-expected load growth, an expanding clean-energy pipeline, and a wave of end-of-life replacements. One of the summary findings put it bluntly: “Supply shortage persists as demand growth remains robust.”

Aging infrastructure is a major contributor, the report notes. According to the analysis, more than half of U.S. distribution transformers—roughly 40 million units—are already beyond their expected service life, adding a steady replacement burden on top of rising new-build requirements. That cumulative pressure helps explain the persistent deficits Wood Mackenzie models for 2025: an estimated 30% shortfall for power transformers and 10% for distribution units across the national fleet.

However, the tightening is most severe in higher-voltage classes. Since 2019, demand for generator step-up units has grown 274%, and substation power transformers are up 116%, reflecting both grid modernization needs and the acceleration of large-scale generation and data center development. Lead times mirror that imbalance. While distribution transformer availability has improved, large units remain locked above two years, with power transformers averaging 128 weeks and GSUs 144 weeks in WoodMac’s second quarter 2025 survey. Meanwhile, costs have also climbed. Since 2019, unit prices have increased 77% for power transformers and 45% for GSUs, with some classes of distribution transformers rising as much as 95%.

For now, even with nearly $1.8 billion in announced North American manufacturing expansions (Figure 1), Wood Mackenzie expects that while some deficits may ease, the “pad-mount three-phase transformer shortage is likely to worsen due to surging industrial demand from data centers, manufacturing facilities, and EV [electric vehicle] charging infrastructure.” The report concludes that without intervention, “extended lead times and elevated costs will become the new normal, potentially derailing grid modernization efforts.”

A Solid Effort to Expand Manufacturing

Still, the severity and duration of the transformer crunch appear to have finally forced a reckoning across the supply chain, prompting the most significant manufacturing buildout the sector has seen in decades. As a historically low-margin, capital-intensive industry, transformer manufacturing is responding to sustained demand growth and a policy environment, despite its vacillation, that prioritizes grid modernization and domestic manufacturing. Over the past year, policy signals around transformer manufacturing have been notably mixed but potentially disruptive.

On one hand, Washington has doubled down on trade measures: copper now faces tariffs of up to 50%, Section 232 steel and aluminum duties have been expanded to hundreds of additional tariff lines, and new “Liberation Day”–style actions have ratcheted up rates on imports from key suppliers such as Brazil, India, and China.

Those moves raise costs for both imported transformers and domestic manufacturers that rely on foreign electrical steel, transformer cores, and copper wire. At the same time, a budget package widely dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” has begun phasing down investment and production tax credits for renewables while tightening foreign‑entity‑of‑concern (FEOC) rules, effectively curbing the use of Chinese‑linked transformer content in projects that depend on federal incentives. But, countering those headwinds, federal and state economic development agencies have leaned into reshoring with tax breaks, loan guarantees, and site selection support for new plants in Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and elsewhere, signaling that long‑term policy risk now favors North American manufacturing—if companies can navigate the near‑term tariff and demand volatility.

Since 2023, manufacturers have committed nearly $2 billion to new or expanded transformer capacity, spanning everything from pole-mount units to 765-kV transmission-class equipment. Hitachi Energy (Figure 2) leads the surge with more than $1 billion in continental investments, including a $457 million facility in South Boston, Virginia—which is set to become the nation’s largest large power transformer plant by 2028—and a $106 million expansion in Alamo, Tennessee, focused on critical components. Siemens Energy is building its first U.S. large power transformer plant in Charlotte, North Carolina, a $150 million project expected to begin production in early 2027. Eaton has committed $340 million to a three-phase transformer facility in South Carolina, also targeting a 2027 start.

Mid-sized and specialized manufacturers are scaling aggressively as well. Prolec GE is investing more than $300 million across new and expanded sites, including a medium-power facility in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and additional pad-mount capacity in Louisiana and Mexico. Virginia Transformer Corp. is undertaking a $40 million expansion in Georgia to boost output by 70%, while WEG is adding transformer capacity in Missouri. Distribution-class expansions include ERMCO’s $70 million-plus investments in Tennessee and Wisconsin, Central Moloney’s new $50 million Florida plant, and MGM Transformer Co.’s 430,000-square-foot facility in Waco, Texas. Even HD Hyundai Electric is enlarging its Alabama footprint, aiming to increase U.S. production by 30% by 2026.

The Transformer Shortage Is Systemic, Not Isolated

While transformers draw the most attention, the transformer shortage is really a transmission and distribution (T&D) equipment shortage. Demand across nearly every major category of electrical infrastructure has surged since 2019—by 35% to 274% depending on the equipment type, according to Making the Connection: Meeting the Electric T&D Supply Chain Challenge, a September 2025 report co-authored by Wood Mackenzie and American Clean Power.

Generation step-up transformers appear to be the most stressed, but high-voltage (HV) switchgear and medium-voltage (MV) circuit breakers are running short, too. Lead times reflect the pressure: switchgear averaged 44 weeks in Q2 2025, while pad-mount transformers, reclosers, and wire and cable all recorded quarterly increases. Prices for these components are also climbing: circuit breakers have jumped 47% since 2021, with medium-voltage switchgear up 50%, as multiple markets compete for scarce manufacturing slots.

The underlying demand drivers remain relentless. Data center expansion, manufacturing construction spending increases of 96% over three years, and a pipeline of renewables projects all push competing demands on the same equipment base. Aging infrastructure adds to the burden: roughly 55% of in-service distribution transformers are more than 33 years old and approaching end-of-life, triggering replacement demand on top of new construction.

For now, tariffs appear to be making matters worse. Evolving trade policy is expected to put “additional upward pressure on both imported and domestically produced equipment,” according to the report, even as expanded Section 232 steel and aluminum duties inflate costs for U.S.-made components. One result may be that utilities and developers cannot solve the constraint by sourcing around one bottleneck. A project team securing transformers on a 12-month timeline may still find switchgear, breakers, or wire in equally tight supply, the report suggests.

Is There Really a Shortage?

Against the prevailing narrative of deficits, long lead times, and constrained factory capacity, some market participants argue that the shortage is overstated. One of the most forceful voices is Patrick Tarver, owner of Bolt Electrical LLC, who describes his firm as “a middleman for different transformer companies throughout the U.S and the world and Mexico.” He characterizes the company as “small, personnel-wise; midsize, money-wise,” and says he serves customers “anywhere in the world that you need to transform.”

Tarver’s central claim challenges the core assumption of the transformer crisis. “There is not a shortage,” he said when asked about the widely cited 30% supply deficit. He asserted that for a standard substation power transformer, once “the initial engineering drawings were approved,” he could have a unit “delivered within 12 to 14 months.” He added that this applies to “all voltage classes” and emphasized, “I’m not the only person that can do this.”

On pricing, Tarver said he typically adds 12% to 15% to factory cost for his services, including staying involved through warranty support. Even with that margin, he argued, “our prices are a lot cheaper than the big four manufacturers, the large manufacturers.” When discussing materials constraints, he rejected much of the industry’s framing: “It’s all exaggerated to drive pricing. I’m telling you that we can get the supplies they need, but they don’t ask.”

For Tarver, the real constraint is access to decision-makers. He contends that the bottleneck lies beyond factory output and more in the structure of utility and EPC procurement, including layers of qualification rules, vendor lists, and internal hierarchies that prevent alternative suppliers from ever reaching the people who could authorize a different approach. In his view, utilities default to familiar equipment manufacturers because their internal processes are designed in ways that reinforce existing relationships rather than evaluate whether faster or more cost-effective options might be available.

If that dynamic is as widespread as he suggests, it implies a supply environment more varied than headline lead times indicate. But it remains difficult to validate without broader engagement from manufacturers and buyers: large power transformers are highly customized, heavily regulated assets, and many utilities face legitimate constraints tied to standards, testing protocols, cybersecurity requirements, and domestic-content rules.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fig2-hitachi-varennes-investment-c.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 09:57:51.830061

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has transformed the Environmental Protection Agency in its first year, cutting federal limits on air and water pollution and promoting fossil fuels, a metamorphosis that clashes with the agency’s historic mission to protect human health and the environment.

The administration says its actions will “unleash” the American economy, but environmentalists say the agency’s abrupt change in focus threatens to unravel years of progress on climate-friendly initiatives that could be hard or impossible to reverse.

“It just constantly wants to pat the fossil fuel business on the back and turn back the clock to a pre-Richard Nixon era” when the agency didn’t exist, said historian Douglas Brinkley.

A lot has happened this year at “Trump’s EPA,” as Zeldin frequently calls the agency. Zeldin proposed overturning the landmark finding that climate change is a threat to human health. He pledged to roll back dozens of environmental regulations in “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen.” He froze billions of dollars for clean energy and upended agency research.

Zeldin has argued the EPA can protect the environment and grow the economy at the same time. He announced “five pillars” to guide EPA’s work; four were economic goals, including energy dominance — Trump’s shorthand for more fossil fuels — and boosting the auto industry.

Zeldin, a former New York congressman who had a record as a moderate Republican on some environmental issues, said his views on climate change have evolved. Many federal and state climate goals are unattainable in the near future — and come at huge cost, he said.

“We should not be causing … extreme economic pain for an individual or a family” because of policies aimed at “saving the planet,” he told reporters at EPA headquarters in early December.

But scientists and experts say the EPA’s new direction comes at a cost to public health, and would lead to far more pollutants in the environment, including mercury, lead and especially tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs. They also note higher emissions of greenhouse gases will worsen atmospheric warming that is driving more frequent, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who led the EPA for several years under President George W. Bush, said watching Zeldin attack laws protecting air and water has been “just depressing.”

“It’s tragic for our country. I worry about my grandchildren, of which I have seven. I worry about what their future is going to be if they don’t have clean air, if they don’t have clean water to drink,” she said.

The history behind EPA

The EPA was launched under Nixon in 1970 with pollution disrupting American life, some cities suffocating in smog and some rivers turned into wastelands by industrial chemicals. Congress passed laws then that remain foundational for protecting water, air and endangered species.

The agency’s aggressiveness has always seesawed depending on who occupies the White House. Former President Joe Biden’s administration boosted renewable energy and electric vehicles, tightened motor-vehicle emissions and proposed greenhouse gas limits on coal-fired power plants and oil and gas wells. Industry groups called rules overly burdensome and said the power plant rule would force many aging plants to shut down. In response, many businesses shifted resources to meet the more stringent rules that are now being undone.

“While the Biden EPA repeatedly attempted to usurp the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law to impose its ‘Green New Scam,’ the Trump EPA is laser-focused on achieving results for the American people while operating within the limits of the laws passed by Congress,” EPA spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch said.

Zeldin’s list of targets is long

Zeldin has announced plans to abandon soot pollution rules, loosen rules around harmful refrigerants, limit wetlands protections and weaken gas mileage rules. Meanwhile, he would exempt polluting industries and plants from federal emissions-reductions requirements.

Much of EPA’s new direction aligns with Project 2025, the conservative Heritage Foundation road map that argued the agency should gut staffing, cut regulations and end what it called a war on coal on other fossil fuels.

“A lot of the regulations that were put on during the Biden administration were more harmful and restrictive than in any other period. So that’s why deregulating them looks like EPA is making major changes,” said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of Heritage’s Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment.

But Chris Frey, an EPA official under Biden, said the regulations Zeldin has targeted “offered benefits of avoided premature deaths, of avoided chronic illness … bad things that would not happen because of these rules.”

Matthew Tejada, a former EPA official under both Trump and Biden who now works at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of the revamped EPA: “I think it would be hard for them to make it any clearer to polluters in this country that they can go on about their business and not worry about EPA getting in their way.”

Zeldin also has shrunk EPA staffing by about 20% to levels last seen in the mid-1980s.

Justin Chen, president of the EPA’s largest union, called staff cuts “devastating.” He cited the dismantling of research and development offices at labs across the country and the firing of employees who signed a letter of dissent opposing EPA cuts.

Relaxed enforcement and cutting staff

Many of Zeldin’s changes aren’t in effect yet. It takes time to propose new rules, get public input and finalize rollbacks.

It’s much faster to cut grants and ease up on enforcement, and Trump’s EPA is doing both. The number of new civil environmental actions is roughly one-fifth what it was in the first eight months of the Biden administration, according to the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project.

“You can effectively do a lot of deregulation if you just don’t do enforcement,” said Leif Fredrickson, visiting assistant professor of history at the University of Montana.

Hirsch said the number of legal filings isn’t the best way to judge enforcement because they require work outside of the EPA and can bog staff down with burdensome legal agreements. She said the EPA is “focused on efficiently resolving violations and achieving compliance as quickly as possible” and not making demands beyond what the law requires.

EPA’s cuts have been especially hard on climate change programs and environmental justice, the effort to address chronic pollution that typically is worse in minority and poor communities. Both were Biden priorities. Zeldin dismissed staff and canceled billions in grants for projects that fell under the “diversity, equity and inclusion” umbrella, a Trump administration target.

He also spiked a $20 billion “green bank” set up under Biden’s landmark climate law to fund qualifying clean energy projects. Zeldin argued the fund was a scheme to funnel money to Democrat-aligned organizations with little oversight — allegations a federal judge rejected.

Pat Parenteau, an environmental law expert and former director of the Environmental Law School at Vermont Law & Graduate School, said the EPA’s shift under Trump left him with little optimism for what he called “the two most awful crises in the 21st century” — biodiversity loss and climate disruption.

“I don’t see any hope for either one,” he said. “I really don’t. And I’ll be long gone, but I think the world is in just for absolute catastrophe.”

""Some companies say they're a California company, some say they're a Detroit company.","In an echoing studio in Long Beach, California, an ambitious team of designers is trying to reinvent how electric vehicles are made.

Slate Auto has assembled a team of EV engineers from Tesla, Rivian and elsewhere to develop America's least-expensive EV truck. In the warehouse space near construction supply shops and a Western-themed bar, designers have built clay models and prototypes of a customizable EV truck that could cost half as much as the competition.

The company, which has raised more than $700 million from Amazon's Jeff Bezos and others, says it will have a truck on the market next year for roughly $25,000.

How does it plan to keep its sticker price so low?

Buyers will start with a blank slate — a basic truck without power windows or even paint — and can then customize it however they like.

They can pay extra for power windows, speakers, colored wrap or paint. A $5,000 kit even converts the truck into an SUV.

Squeezing out as much cost as possible while making it as easy as Legos to snap on different options has required complex engineering, which is why the company decided to set up its design studio in Southern California.

The region is full of experts.

Although Slate's headquarters is in Troy, Mich., and its vehicles will be manufactured in Indiana, much of how they will look and be assembled came together in the Los Angeles area, said Jeremy Snyder, Slate's chief commercial officer.

""The design presence on the West Coast, specifically in Los Angeles, has been a huge part of the automotive industry for a very long time,"" he said. ""Having that pool of talent that resides here was super important.""

If the idea clicks with enough consumers, company executives are hopeful that their unique business model will bolster widespread EV adoption.

Skeptics say it has yet to be proved that American consumers really want a vehicle broken down to the basics, but thousands of potential EV owners already have shown interest.

More than 150,000 potential buyers put down $50 deposits to reserve their place in line to buy the truck once it is on the market.

A large slice of that demand is coming from Los Angeles, Snyder said.

""Los Angeles has played such a critical role in the zero-emissions auto industry,"" he said. ""I think that it is going to play a very important role in the roll-out of Slate vehicles.""

The company's first deliveries are expected in late 2026.

Slate is entering the EV market at a difficult moment, as demand for green cars has cooled under the Trump administration. The president ended many tax breaks and regulations that were created to nudge more consumers and companies into EVs.

The EV company Rivian laid off more than 600 workers in October, and Tesla sales have slid this year.

Tesla has shown how tough it is to build a business around an affordable EV by putting its own affordable vehicle plans on the back burner.

These days, Elon Musk seems more focused on developing humanoid robots for the masses than on an affordable EV.

Slate thinks that for a radically reduced price, there will be demand. It is imagining that there are customers who don't need four doors, the size or the power of a standard truck or the autonomous driving tech of a Tesla.

Slate's big bet is that a radically reduced sticker price and a new kind of business model can rekindle excitement about the industry. The company is hoping that customers will be thrilled to save the money and then splurge only on the features they want.

""We're going to make the truck, and then after that, you make it yours,"" said Slate's head of communications, Jeff Jablansky.

Slate trucks have a steel frame and external plastic panels that can be wrapped in any color. If customers want to paint their vehicle, they can do it themselves or take it to a partner shop.

The standard version will have an electric range of 150 miles. That can be increased to 240 miles by paying more for a bigger battery.

And those are some of the most obvious options.

Slate's online customization tool gives customers the freedom to design their EV however they want. Jablansky said potential customers have created more than 10 million different configurations of a Slate truck online.

Slate hopes that if it can make EVs more affordable to buy, a new group of consumers will get to experience that EVs also often cost less to own and maintain.

""The entire company was built around this idea of the affordable vehicle,"" Snyder said. ""We scrutinize every accessory in the same way that we scrutinize the vehicle to keep prices as low as possible.""

Although only about 25 of Slate's 500 employees work out of the Long Beach studio, it has a disproportionate effect on the company's product.

To trailblaze and succeed in the harsh EV market, the company decided it needed a presence in California, as well as near the traditional heart of car building in and around Detroit.

""We knew we needed to have a presence in both places to really understand what people wanted,"" Jablansky said. ""Some companies say they're a California company, some say they're a Detroit company. We need to be an American company.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gmtoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/79/77922f4e-064f-4986-8bfa-8f2282fb574e/69580807eb57b.image.jpg?crop=1851%2C972%2C0%2C74&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-02 23:57:45.685147

Concerns about data centers' impact on electric grids are rising in both red and blue states.
Anger over proposed data centers has even spread to President Donald Trump's primary residential home of Palm Beach County, Florida, where local residents successfully postponed the construction of a proposed 200-acre data center complex.
Corey Kanterman, a local opponent of the proposed data center, told WLRN that his goal is to shut the project down entirely.
""No good comes of having an AI data center near you,"" Kanterman said.","The massive energy needs of artificial intelligence data centers became a major political controversy in 2025, and new reporting suggests that it will grow even further in 2026.

CNBC reported on Thursday that data center projects have become political lightning rods among politicians ranging from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on the left to Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on the right.

However, objections to data centers aren't just coming from politicians but from ordinary citizens who are worried about the impact such projects will have on their local environment and their utility bills.

CNBC noted that data centers' energy needs are so great that PJM Interconnection, the largest US grid operator that serves over 65 million people across 13 states, projects that it will be a full six gigawatts short of its reliability requirements in 2027.

Joe Bowring, president of independent market monitor Monitoring Analytics, told CNBC that he's never seen the grid under such projected strain.

""It’s at a crisis stage right now,"" Bowring said. ""PJM has never been this short.""

Rob Gramlich, president of power consulting firm Grid Strategies, told CNBC that he expects the debate over data centers to become even more intense this year once Americans start getting socked with even higher utility bills.

""I don't think we’ve seen the end of the political repercussions,” Gramlich said. “And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we’ll see a lot of implications. Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents’ policies would raise rates.""

Concerns about data centers' impact on electric grids are rising in both red and blue states.

The Austin American-Statesman reported on Thursday that a new analysis written by the office of Austin City Manager TC Broadnax found that data centers have the potential to overwhelm the city's system given they are projected to need more power than can possibly be delivered with current infrastructure.

""The speed in which AI is trying to be deployed creates tremendous strain on the already tight resources in both design and construction,"" says the analysis, which noted that some proposed data centers are seeking more than five gigawatts, which is more than the peak load for the entire city.

In New York, local station News 10 reported last year that the New York Independent System Operator is estimating that the state's grid could be 1.6 gigawatts short of reliability requirements by 2030 thanks in large part to data centers.

Anger over proposed data centers has even spread to President Donald Trump's primary residential home of Palm Beach County, Florida, where local residents successfully postponed the construction of a proposed 200-acre data center complex.

According to public news station WLRN, locals opposed to the project cited ""expected noise from cooling towers, servers, and diesel generators, along with heavy water use, pollution concerns, and higher utility costs"" when petitioning Palm Beach County commissioners to scrap the proposal.

Corey Kanterman, a local opponent of the proposed data center, told WLRN that his goal is to shut the project down entirely.

The U.S. automaker reported a 16% decline in fourth quarter deliveries, trailing analyst estimates. For the year of 2025, Tesla sales slid almost 9%, its second consecutive annual drop.

BYD, by contrast, increased battery-electric vehicle sales both for the quarter and the full year, delivering almost 2.26 million EVs in 2025 to Tesla’s 1.64 million.

Investors have paid little mind of late to Tesla’s decline in the global EV pecking order, with Musk prioritizing artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. The chief executive officer has drawn attention away from Tesla’s core business by touting progress in his longstanding effort to start a robotaxi service.

Standing up those operations will be crucial in 2026, given the outlook for EV demand in the U.S., Tesla’s largest market. President Donald Trump’s administration has ceased federal incentives supporting plug-in vehicle purchases and hollowed out fuel economy and emissions regulations that had generated billions of dollars in revenue for the company.

“Deliveries barely matter anymore,” Alexander Potter, an analyst with the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, said in a note on January 2. Instead, the performance of Tesla’s shares in 2026 “should be driven by progress in AI and robotics.”

AI Emphasis

Wall Street had been bracing for a “hangover” for Tesla after tax credits for EV purchases ended in the U.S., William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a note. He similarly posited that the company “is valued almost entirely on the transformation to real-world AI.”

Tesla shares fell 2.8% as of 1:35 p.m. on January 2 in New York. The stock advanced 11% last year, paring gains after hitting an all-time high in mid-December 2025.

BYD pulled away from Tesla last year after coming up just shy of the world leader in 2024. While the Chinese manufacturer delivered more fully electric cars in the fourth quarter of that year, Tesla maintained a slim lead on an annual basis.

In addition to selling far more EVs in China — where some of its cars are far cheaper than Tesla’s most affordable vehicle, the Model 3 — BYD has been surging in Europe.

Through the first 11 months of last year, BYD registered more cars than Tesla in both Germany and the U.K., the region’s two biggest EV markets. Tesla’s sales across Europe fell 28% during that span, and the company posted steep December declines in France, Spain and Sweden.

2026 Outlook

Wall Street has grown increasingly skeptical about Tesla’s 2026 sales prospects. This time two years ago, analysts were predicting Tesla would deliver more than 3 million vehicles. The average estimate has plunged to around 1.8 million.

Tesla’s energy storage battery business, on the other hand, has never been stronger.

The company deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of energy storage products in the last quarter of 2025, up from the 11 gigawatt hours a year earlier. Total deployments for the year jumped almost 50% to 46.7 gigawatt hours.

“The sustained growth of energy storage reflects structural tailwinds from AI-driven electricity demand, which is driving incremental storage requirements to support data center buildouts and power grid stabilization,” Tom Narayan, an RBC Capital Markets analyst with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla’s stock, said in a note.

Tesla ended last year by building anticipation for Cybercab, a two-seat compact car with butterfly doors. While prototypes have lacked a steering wheel or pedals, Tesla’s board chair Robyn Denholm told Bloomberg News in October that the company will sell the car with those components if required by regulators.

While Tesla began driverless testing with Model Ys in Austin late last month, consumers thus far are only able to summon rides from small numbers of cars in the Texas capital and the San Francisco Bay area with safety supervisors in the front seats.

For his part, Musk is optimistic about the year ahead.",https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2025/06/21/TESLAS-IN-CALIFORNIA-BLOOMBERG.jpg?height=635&t=1750534362&width=1200,N,,2026-01-02 23:57:31.067187

Listen to the WPR report Milwaukee’s Pettit Center indoor Olympic speedskating oval goes solar was originally published by Wisconsin Public Radio.","The Pettit National Ice Center has made Milwaukee a destination for the Olympic speedskating world. Now, the first indoor speedskating oval built in the U.S. is going solar.

The arena contains enough ice to fill more than five National Hockey League rinks. Like most ice centers, it requires a significant amount of energy to keep its skating surface frozen and dry.

The solar project will cut the 200,000-square-foot facility’s energy use by at least 20 percent and power the building during summer months.

It’s funded by a large donation gifted to the nonprofit by the climate-focused VoLo Foundation.

Paul Golomski is the Pettit Ice Center’s general manager. He believes the project will help the facility use energy more responsibly.

“There’s only five (indoor speedskating ovals) in North America, and there’s only 40 operating in the entire world,” Golomski said. “So I think it’s a really smart thing for us to invest in and to ensure that we’re being responsible stewards of our energy consumption.”

He says over a 20-year period, the system will have the impact of reducing the center’s CO2 emissions by 12,778 tons. That’s equal to 191,000 trees planted, or 29,053,530 miles driven by cars.

Milwaukee-based renewable energy company Arch Solar is leading the project — a 690-kilowatt system consisting of 1,200 bifacial solar panels. This allows each panel to absorb sunlight from its front and back sides, producing more energy.

Andrew Holmstrom is the business development supervisor at Arch Solar. He said the panels will generate enough energy to power a string of Christmas lights from Milwaukee to North Carolina.

“It’s going to be a clean, green rooftop power plant,” Holmstrom said.

Holmstrom previously lived across the highway from the ice center.

“I’ve been able to skate on the ice there, run inside there, and so to be able to be a part of this project and kind of leave our fingerprint on the building, it means so much,” Holmstrom said.

Arch Solar has been on the roof since late November. They hope to have it ready by early April.

The Pettit National Ice Center is an official training site for U.S. Speedskating. It opened in 1992. The facility will host the U.S. Olympic Team Trials Long Track competition Jan. 2-5.

The federal judge considering whether states can ban new gas- and diesel-powered vehicles has indicated he will not weigh the economic interests of disputing parties, including farmers who grow corn for ethanol.

U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. in Oakland has rejected motions from corn growers, truckers, Tesla and others to intervene in a lawsuit between blue states and President Trump.

The financial stakes are high, Gilliam acknowledged in a ruling last month. But the case will turn on whether Congress lawfully retracted federal permission for states to prohibit internal-combustion engines, he said.

The Biden Environmental Protection Agency gave permission by waiving less-strict federal vehicle emission standards. “Critically, this case is not about whether the EPA’s earlier decision to issue the waivers was itself lawful, prudent or good policy,” Gilliam wrote.

Value of EV credits at risk

In June, California, Oregon, Washington and eight other states sued the day Trump signed three congressional resolutions overturning the Biden EPA waivers.

The waivers allowed California and like-minded states to make automakers sell more zero-emission vehicles. One waiver let states ban new cars and pickups powered by fossil fuels beginning in 2035.

The states argue the Congressional Review Act allows lawmakers to overturn agency “rules,” but not “waivers” that only apply to certain states. The Justice Department argues the states don’t have standing to sue Trump over something Congress did.

Texas and private organizations representing the ethanol, trucking, petroleum and construction industries moved to join the lawsuit.

They cited their financial interests in preserving demand for fossil fuels, including ethanol. Some said they were concerned the next White House administration might not be as keen in defending against the lawsuit.

Gilliam said if he adopted that argument, then the government could never adequately represent anyone’s interests.

The Zero Emission Transportation Association, whose members include Tesla, moved to intervene on the side of the blue states.

Investments totaling billions of dollars depend on California’s stringent vehicle emission regulations, the association said in its motion to intervene.

EV makers receive credits for selling zero-emission vehicles and sell them to other automakers. Makers of conventional vehicles need the credits to comply with blue-state emission standards.

“These credits are an important source of revenue for electric vehicle manufacturers,” according to the association. “But as a result of the resolutions, these credits will lose nearly all of their value.”

The National Corn Growers Association and corn farmer associations in 11 states appealed Gilliam’s ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Dec. 31.

As adoption grows, the industry has to take responsibility for how these systems perform years after installation. Longevity, safety, and proper maintenance are no longer optional—they’re essential”

— Nick Ogilvie

CELINA, TX, UNITED STATES, January 2, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — As artificial turf continues its rapid expansion across residential, commercial, athletic, and municipal applications, industry leaders are increasingly focused on long-term performance, safety, and sustainability. One of the earliest and most influential figures shaping this shift is Nick Ogilvie, an artificial turf pioneer based in Celina, Texas, whose work spans more than two decades and nearly every major climate region in the United States.

Ogilvie is widely recognized within the industry for advancing artificial turf beyond surface-level installation and toward fully engineered systems designed for longevity, sanitation, and real-world performance. His career includes industry-first installations, nationally recognized certifications, proprietary product development, and extensive consulting work supporting artificial turf companies and facilities across the country.

National Experience Across Diverse Climates

Over the course of his career, Ogilvie has installed and consulted on artificial turf projects from Los Angeles, California, to Burlington, Vermont, and as far south as Sunset Key, Florida. His work spans arid desert conditions, coastal hurricane zones, cold-weather regions, and high-traffic commercial environments.

Industry professionals note that this geographic diversity has contributed to Ogilvie’s reputation as a system-level expert, with firsthand experience in how synthetic turf behaves under varying environmental, structural, and usage demands. In addition to his consulting work, Ogilvie has led installations through his company, Luxe Blades, assisting property owners, developers, and organizations with both new construction and remediation of underperforming turf systems.

Industry-First Installations and Certifications

Among Ogilvie’s most notable achievements is being the first to design and install an artificial turf Par 3 golf hole on the rim of Palo Duro Canyon, one of the most challenging natural landscapes in the United States. The project required advanced engineering solutions addressing wind exposure, drainage, and sub-base stability in a high-risk environment.

Ogilvie is also the only artificial turf installer to hold a certified wind uplift approval for rooftop turf installations under Miami-Dade Code, validated through independent testing and documentation by Haag Global. This certification is considered a benchmark for rooftop turf safety, particularly in hurricane-prone regions, and has helped establish artificial turf as a code-compliant architectural surface.

Product Innovation Driven by Field Experience

In addition to installation and consulting, Ogilvie has played a central role in developing products designed specifically for artificial turf systems—addressing gaps long recognized by industry professionals.

He developed Luxe Bond Pro, a proprietary turf adhesive engineered to withstand extreme heat, moisture, and shear forces commonly encountered in rooftop and high-stress turf installations. The adhesive was created in response to repeated failures observed with generic construction products not designed for synthetic turf applications.

Ogilvie also helped pioneer the first battery-powered artificial turf power broom, developed to restore turf fibers, rebalance infill, and improve surface drainage without damaging turf backing or seams. The innovation marked a shift away from improvised maintenance tools toward equipment engineered exclusively for artificial turf.

Advancing Eco-Conscious Turf Maintenance

Recognizing growing concerns around sanitation, pet safety, and environmental impact, Ogilvie contributed to the development of a fully natural cleaner and deodorizer designed specifically for artificial turf.

The product is:

Eco-friendly and pet-safe

Designed to eliminate odor-causing organic material at the source

Whole Foods EcoCompliant, making it the only artificial turf cleaner in the industry to meet that standard

The formulation also includes a natural, proprietary static-release technology, addressing static buildup commonly associated with synthetic turf surfaces—an issue long noted by facility managers and turf professionals.

Addressing the Industry’s Maintenance Gap

As artificial turf adoption accelerates nationwide, Ogilvie has consistently highlighted what many in the industry now acknowledge as a critical issue: turf systems are often installed correctly but lack proper long-term maintenance protocols.

Organic buildup, infill compaction, bacterial growth, and fiber fatigue can compromise turf performance, safety, and lifespan. Ogilvie’s work has focused on developing maintenance solutions that protect the integrity of turf systems while extending their usable life.

Industry observers note that his approach has helped shift the conversation from “maintenance-free” marketing claims toward realistic, performance-based stewardship of synthetic turf assets.

A Recognized Voice in a Maturing Industry

With artificial turf increasingly used in public spaces, sports facilities, rooftops, and pet environments, scrutiny around safety, compliance, and lifecycle cost continues to rise. Ogilvie’s experience—spanning installation, certification, product development, and maintenance—positions him as a recognized voice in the industry’s ongoing maturation.

Rather than focusing on short-term trends, his work emphasizes accountability, system integrity, and long-term value.

“Artificial turf has matured into permanent infrastructure, not a novelty surface,” said Nick Ogilvie. “As adoption grows, the industry has to take responsibility for how these systems perform years after installation. Longevity, safety, and proper maintenance are no longer optional—they’re essential.”

____ This story has been corrected to show that BYD sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, not 2.26.","NEW YORK -- Tesla lost its crown as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk's right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It's a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world's richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was down nearly 2% at $441.15 in early afternoon trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk's pivot to different parts of business. He has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory - and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin earlier this year, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

""Regulatory is going to be a big issue,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. ""We're dealing with people's lives.""

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla's autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla's directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world's first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to the public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering. ____

A small section of the Lake/Orange Expressway (State Road 516) is set to link U.S. 27 with State Road 429, and it will have wireless charging beneath its surface that enables EVs to be charged when on the go.

How the Wireless Charging Lane Works in Florida

Under the pilot, they’ll generate a magnetic field by using inductive coils embedded in the roadway to transfer energy to a receiver mounted on the underside of a vehicle. As the car, bus, or truck drives over powered sections, juice flows into the battery without your needing to plug in — ever. Details of the project plans as described by regional officials and reported by TechSpot indicate the energized stretch will measure about three-quarters of a mile, with receivers able to accommodate up to 200 kilowatts — enough to help extend an EV’s range in ways that are more meaningful than wireless smartphone charging but far below what a full charge would take.

Dynamic wireless charging relies on the same concepts as static systems, but has to keep an energy connection in place while traveling at highway speeds and through inches of asphalt. Engineers usually adjust the system to work at specific frequencies and divide coils so that only a portion under a vehicle is charged, improving efficiency and safety. The industry is converging on interoperability through standardization efforts like SAE’s J2954 family of documents, which seeks to establish a common language between vehicles and road hardware.

A Living Testbed on Florida’s New SR 516 Corridor

The CFX is developing SR 516 as a smart corridor that integrates transportation with technology and environmental design. Alongside the wireless charging pilot, there are plans for solar installations that will power roadside systems, wildlife crossings that protect habitat, and a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians. The expressway will open in phases later this decade, and engineers will have a chance to collect data on methods of construction, power delivery, and pavement life.

The perfect proving ground is the state of Florida. Now the second-largest state in terms of EV registrations, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, Florida gets that mix with its blend of commuter traffic and freight movement that make up real-world duty cycles for testing heavy vehicles. If the pilot proves it performs well in heat, humidity, and seasonal storms, it may bolster the case for scaling the technology elsewhere.

Why This Might Change EV Economics for Fleets

Ultimately, continuous top-ups along key corridors might allow vehicles to carry smaller batteries without sacrificing range — a huge thing for trucks and buses, in which the mass of the battery and its associated cost weigh heavily on total ownership costs. Modeling from national labs and industry pilots suggests that dynamic charging lanes can lead to double-digit reductions in battery capacity (on the order of 20–40 percent in some freight scenarios) while still staying on schedule.

Vallee believes more widespread adoption could also relieve some of the burden on stationary fast-charging hubs, which often need grid upgrades and big pieces of real estate. Rather than supplanting plug-in charging, dynamic lanes would complement it, adding energy during the most predictable times and locations: on busy commuter and freight corridors. That dovetails with the buildout of public charging paid for by federal and state programs and by private networks, especially as utilities prepare for heavier loads on highways.

Lessons From Other Pilots in the U.S. and Abroad

The Florida approach is part of a wave of real-world tests. In Michigan, the state worked with Electreon to create a short inductive roadway in Detroit within a broader mobility district. The state transportation department and Purdue University are looking into conductive concrete ideas for truck corridors in Indiana. Overseas, the Gotland project in Sweden showed dynamic charging for buses and trucks on public roads, and Germany tested overhead “eHighway” catenary systems for freight. Each model trades off hardware complexity, vehicle modifications, and cost in different ways; Florida’s in-road induction dispenses with pantographs or overhead wires, seeking a more unobtrusive fit into existing road profiles.

Hurdles Still to Clear Before Wider Deployment

Cost and coordination are still the largest concerns. Mounting coils, power electronics, and utility connections inflate construction and maintenance budgets, and early pilots elsewhere have commanded multimillion-dollar price tags even for short stretches. Agencies will also require clear business models to bill, operate, and upgrade the vehicles — as well as a mechanism for correctly metering energy per vehicle.

Vehicle compatibility is another important consideration. Only EVs with the appropriate receiver will be able to benefit; as a consequence, standards and OEM adoption are vital. On safety, the researchers say systems are engineered to comply with international exposure standards and only power up when a vehicle associated with one is nearby. Agencies will still check for electromagnetic interference and gauge pavement life cycle and performance in standing water before advancing the new technology more broadly.

What to Watch Next as Florida Builds SR 516

Once construction goes forward, see whether the energy-delivered-per-mile data bears out, whether the ramp offers good performance at various speeds, and how Florida’s climate affects aging over time. It is currently unclear if bus fleets and logistics operators will participate, but heavy vehicles should ultimately benefit the most from dynamic charging.

Last year, BYD saw a 28% in sales by selling 2.26 million vehicles. Notably, BYD did not make any sales to American consumers.

Meanwhile, Tesla, which was riddled with controversy due to CEO Elon Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration, sold 1.64 million vehicles last year, marking a 9% drop in sales from the year prior. 2025 marked the second year in a row that Musk’s company experienced a slump in yearly sales.

With Musk taking on the role of leading the Department of Government Efficiency at the beginning of Trump’s second term, he was met with widespread criticism by government employees and liberals alike for his cavalier approach in administrating widespread firings and audits of the federal government.

Protests at Tesla showrooms and dealerships erupted across the country to pushback against Musk. Many of these “Tesla Takedown” campaigns turned violent with showrooms vandalized and vehicles set on fire.

By the end of Tesla’s first quarter, Tesla saw a 71% drop in earnings. Shortly after, Musk announced he would be ending his role with the Trump administration. However, his announcement also corresponded with the end of his 130 day legal limit as a special government employee.

Tesla has also had to navigate the Trump administration’s decision to not extend a $7,500 federal EV tax credit in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The EV tax credit expired in September.

The Korean automaker went big on a family of EVs with long-distance range, class-leading fast-charging and exceptional style. And it even held up the U.S., its most important market, as the place where these cars would be manufactured. But it still got bruised by tariffs, the end of the EV tax credits and even an immigration raid in 2025. Needless to say, the game has changed just a bit.

But Hyundai's push continues in 2026. The Hyundai Ioniq 3 is one of several more affordably priced EVs due to hit the global market this year, alongside the Volkswagen ID. Polo, the reborn Chevrolet Bolt, the Slate Truck and more. As the EV market shifts from wealthy early adopters to more mainstream customers looking for value, Hyundai certainly doesn't want to miss out.

And as Korea's JoongAng Daily reports today, the Ioniq 3 could in some ways be Hyundai's most important EV yet. That's because it's targeted specifically at Europe, a market that's suddenly a priority as President Donald Trump's 15% tariffs on Korean-imported cars start to sting its bottom line. In other words, Hyundai needs the Ioniq 3 to be successful to aid its global EV push and to reduce the pressure on the suddenly more difficult American market. (While Hyundai produces many cars in the U.S., it is still dependent on imports from Korea, including for car parts.)

Stay informed with our newsletter every weekday

More importantly, the Ioniq 3 will do battle in a place where EV sales aren't really slowing down, unlike the U.S. In Europe, it will be positioned against the upcoming compact Volkswagen EV, various models from BYD and other Chinese brands, electric newcomers from Renault and Stellantis, and much more. Hyundai cannot afford to miss out there; the Ioniq 3 has tremendous potential to be a volume-seller EV. (Plus, South Korea now has plenty of competition from Chinese carmakers, too, so it cannot stand down in its home market.)

So what can we expect from the Ioniq 3? We don't know what its final form will be yet. But it was previewed by the Concept Three at last fall's IAA Munich auto show in Germany. That concept was a radical, almost Veloster-like hatchback with sharp window lines, a translucent duckbill spoiler, a thin LED light bar up front, and Hyundai's signature pixelated lights. While the final design will certainly be toned down, Hyundai has a good track record of keeping its concept cars close to the real thing.

Gallery: Hyundai Three Concept

The Ioniq 3 is expected to be a close counterpart to the Kia EV3, a compact EV that has been a strong seller everywhere it's available. As such, it is expected to use a 400-volt version of Hyundai's E-GMP electric platform, with front- or all-wheel-drive, and powered by either a 58.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack and a larger 81.4-kWh unit. Prices in the €30,000 range seem likely.

As we track this surge of next-generation EVs with better value propositions, we'll definitely be watching the Ioniq 3's progress. But will it come stateside? Considering that Kia's Korean-made EV3 is perpetually MIA in the U.S., that feels unlikely for now. With any luck, Hyundai could also find a way to bring it to buyers seeking electric style and value here, too.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for Musk, who once dismissed BYD as a threat. Tesla’s rise had seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make Musk the world’s richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

— Nick Ogilvie

CELINA, TX, UNITED STATES, January 2, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — As artificial turf continues its rapid expansion across residential, commercial, athletic, and municipal applications, industry leaders are increasingly focused on long-term performance, safety, and sustainability. One of the earliest and most influential figures shaping this shift is Nick Ogilvie, an artificial turf pioneer based in Celina, Texas, whose work spans more than two decades and nearly every major climate region in the United States.

Ogilvie is widely recognized within the industry for advancing artificial turf beyond surface-level installation and toward fully engineered systems designed for longevity, sanitation, and real-world performance. His career includes industry-first installations, nationally recognized certifications, proprietary product development, and extensive consulting work supporting artificial turf companies and facilities across the country.

National Experience Across Diverse Climates

Over the course of his career, Ogilvie has installed and consulted on artificial turf projects from Los Angeles, California, to Burlington, Vermont, and as far south as Sunset Key, Florida. His work spans arid desert conditions, coastal hurricane zones, cold-weather regions, and high-traffic commercial environments.

Industry professionals note that this geographic diversity has contributed to Ogilvie’s reputation as a system-level expert, with firsthand experience in how synthetic turf behaves under varying environmental, structural, and usage demands. In addition to his consulting work, Ogilvie has led installations through his company, Luxe Blades, assisting property owners, developers, and organizations with both new construction and remediation of underperforming turf systems.

Industry-First Installations and Certifications

Among Ogilvie’s most notable achievements is being the first to design and install an artificial turf Par 3 golf hole on the rim of Palo Duro Canyon, one of the most challenging natural landscapes in the United States. The project required advanced engineering solutions addressing wind exposure, drainage, and sub-base stability in a high-risk environment.

Ogilvie is also the only artificial turf installer to hold a certified wind uplift approval for rooftop turf installations under Miami-Dade Code, validated through independent testing and documentation by Haag Global. This certification is considered a benchmark for rooftop turf safety, particularly in hurricane-prone regions, and has helped establish artificial turf as a code-compliant architectural surface.

Product Innovation Driven by Field Experience

In addition to installation and consulting, Ogilvie has played a central role in developing products designed specifically for artificial turf systems—addressing gaps long recognized by industry professionals.

He developed Luxe Bond Pro, a proprietary turf adhesive engineered to withstand extreme heat, moisture, and shear forces commonly encountered in rooftop and high-stress turf installations. The adhesive was created in response to repeated failures observed with generic construction products not designed for synthetic turf applications.

Ogilvie also helped pioneer the first battery-powered artificial turf power broom, developed to restore turf fibers, rebalance infill, and improve surface drainage without damaging turf backing or seams. The innovation marked a shift away from improvised maintenance tools toward equipment engineered exclusively for artificial turf.

Advancing Eco-Conscious Turf Maintenance

Recognizing growing concerns around sanitation, pet safety, and environmental impact, Ogilvie contributed to the development of a fully natural cleaner and deodorizer designed specifically for artificial turf.

The product is:

Eco-friendly and pet-safe

Designed to eliminate odor-causing organic material at the source

Whole Foods EcoCompliant, making it the only artificial turf cleaner in the industry to meet that standard

The formulation also includes a natural, proprietary static-release technology, addressing static buildup commonly associated with synthetic turf surfaces—an issue long noted by facility managers and turf professionals.

Addressing the Industry’s Maintenance Gap

As artificial turf adoption accelerates nationwide, Ogilvie has consistently highlighted what many in the industry now acknowledge as a critical issue: turf systems are often installed correctly but lack proper long-term maintenance protocols.

Organic buildup, infill compaction, bacterial growth, and fiber fatigue can compromise turf performance, safety, and lifespan. Ogilvie’s work has focused on developing maintenance solutions that protect the integrity of turf systems while extending their usable life.

Industry observers note that his approach has helped shift the conversation from “maintenance-free” marketing claims toward realistic, performance-based stewardship of synthetic turf assets.

A Recognized Voice in a Maturing Industry

With artificial turf increasingly used in public spaces, sports facilities, rooftops, and pet environments, scrutiny around safety, compliance, and lifecycle cost continues to rise. Ogilvie’s experience—spanning installation, certification, product development, and maintenance—positions him as a recognized voice in the industry’s ongoing maturation.

Rather than focusing on short-term trends, his work emphasizes accountability, system integrity, and long-term value.

“Artificial turf has matured into permanent infrastructure, not a novelty surface,” said Nick Ogilvie. “As adoption grows, the industry has to take responsibility for how these systems perform years after installation. Longevity, safety, and proper maintenance are no longer optional—they’re essential.”

,EPA,2026-01-02 22:05:29+00:00,The National Law Review,Environmental Protection Agency Proposes New WOTUS Rule After Sac,Lisa Rushton,,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/epa-and-army-corps-propose-narrower-definition-waters-united-states,"On November 20, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a proposed rule to update the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA).
The definition of WOTUS affects permitting timelines, project costs, and compliance obligations for industries such as construction, energy, and agriculture.
Background: Importance of the WOTUS Definition The CWA regulates “navigable waters,” defined as WOTUS.
These changes are expected to limit federal oversight, especially in arid regions and areas with seasonal water flow.
.” This change means that even if an upstream portion of a stream met the relatively permanent definition, it would not be considered a tributary if a downstream portion of the stream fails to meet the relatively permanent definition.","On November 20, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a proposed rule to update the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA).

This definition determines the scope of federal jurisdiction for key CWA programs, including permitting for discharges and construction projects.

Why does this matter?

The definition of WOTUS affects permitting timelines, project costs, and compliance obligations for industries such as construction, energy, and agriculture. If finalized, the new rule will likely reduce federal jurisdiction, meaning fewer waterbodies will fall under CWA regulation.

The Agencies are accepting public comments until January 5, 2026—a short window given the holidays.

Background: Importance of the WOTUS Definition

The CWA regulates “navigable waters,” defined as WOTUS. Programs that depend on this definition include:

Section 402 (NPDES) – permits for pollutant discharges

Section 404 – permits for dredged or fill material

However, the Act itself does not define WOTUS. Over decades, rulemakings, court decisions, and injunctions have created confusion and regional differences.

Currently, WOTUS includes five categories of waters (e.g., navigable waters, tributaries, wetlands with continuous surface connection) and excludes eight other types (e.g., waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, certain ditches).

The new proposal aims to align with the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, which narrowed federal jurisdiction over wetlands.

Key Proposed Changes

If adopted, the rule would:

Remove “interstate waters” from the definition of WOTUS;

Add definitions for the following terms:

“Relatively Permanent;”

“Tributary;” and

“Continuous Surface Connection;” and

Modify exclusions of water treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and certain ditches and add an exclusion of groundwater from the definition of WOTUS.

These changes are expected to limit federal oversight, especially in arid regions and areas with seasonal water flow. Overall, the Agencies estimate that only 19% of wetlands in the National Wetlands Inventory would be jurisdictional under this approach.

New Defined Terms

The Agencies propose to add the following defined terms to further clarify the meaning of WOTUS and to align with the Sackett decision.

“Relatively Permanent”

The Agencies propose defining “relatively permanent” as “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.” This term is relevant because tributaries, lakes, ponds, and wetlands must meet that definition to qualify as WOTUS and fall within the CWA’s jurisdiction. Under this proposed definition, “ephemeral waters (i.e., those with surface water flowing or standing only in direct response to precipitation (e.g., rain or snowfall)) are not jurisdictional because they are not relatively permanent.” Further, the Agencies intend the qualification of “at least during the wet season” “to include extended periods of predictable, continuous surface hydrology occurring in the same geographic feature year after year in response to the wet season . . . .” If finalized, many features would likely fall outside the Act’s jurisdiction depending on the hydrology in a certain location—particularly in more arid regions, which may only have water flow during infrequent, but significant, precipitation events.

“Tributary”

The Agencies propose to incorporate the term ‘relatively permanent’ into the definition of a “tributary” as “a body of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and banks, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.” Much of the geographic scope of WOTUS is based on tributaries of navigable waters rather than the navigable waters themselves. As a result, this definition and the definition of “relatively permanent” are critical components of the jurisdictional reach of the CWA.

Importantly, the Agencies propose that “[f]eatures with non-relatively permanent flow . . . would sever jurisdiction upstream . . . , including flow through non-relatively permanent reaches or streams or wetlands . . . .” This change means that even if an upstream portion of a stream met the relatively permanent definition, it would not be considered a tributary if a downstream portion of the stream fails to meet the relatively permanent definition. The Agencies note that this approach may be more likely to affect features “in the arid West and mountainous regions” where “[h]ydrologic regime shifts of relatively permanent flow to non-relatively permanent flow back to relatively permanent flow may be commonly found.”

“Continuous Surface Connection”

The Agencies propose to define “continuous surface connection” to mean “having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.” Effectively, this definition creates a two-prong test to determine whether wetlands, ponds, and lakes qualify as WOTUS—i.e., (a) having surface water during the wet season and (b) abutting another WOTUS. For wetlands, the Agencies also explain that “only the portion of an abutting wetland which demonstrates surface water at least during the wet season would be jurisdictional.” The Agencies recognize that this Rule would likely result in the elimination of many wetlands from coverage under the CWA and estimate that only 19% of total National Wetland Inventory wetlands would fall within the Act’s jurisdiction.

Next Steps

The Proposed Rule likely will result in fewer waterbodies qualifying as WOTUS and therefore subject to regulation under the CWA; however, this Rule likely will also result in a clearer operating directive to regulators and regulated entities implementing the CWA. The Agencies will accept comments in support of or against the Proposed Rule through January 5, 2026.

We expect that the agencies will publish a final rule within the next six months, given the agencies’ stated intent to promptly clarify the regulations for regulated parties and given that the Supreme Court already did the heavy analytical lifting for the agencies. Additionally, we expect the final rule to be largely identical to the proposed rule for the same reason that the purpose of the rulemaking is to incorporate the Sackett decision, so there is little policy choice involved that may change in response to comments.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2026-01/environment%20energy%20legislation%20election%20regulation%20environmental%20protection%20agency%20epa%20sign%20top.jpg.webp?itok=H4fcWQ9t,N,,2026-01-02 17:58:16.814339

Denmark’s Ørsted filed a legal challenge on Thursday against the White House’s decision 10 days ago to suspend the lease for its Revolution Wind site as part of a sweeping move halting all construction of offshore wind.

The attempted injunction is the latest in a series of legal volleys between the renewables industry and Donald Trump, whose administration has sought to block major offshore wind projects from moving ahead since his re-election.

Trump, a vocal supporter of the fossil fuel industry, opposes renewable energy, and wind in particular, saying he finds turbines ugly, costly and inefficient.

On 22 December, officials from the Department of the Interior suspended the leases for five large offshore wind projects that are under construction in US waters over unspecified “national security risks”.

A statement from Ørsted and its partner in the Revolution project, Skyborn Renewables, described the move as a violation of applicable law.

“Litigation is a necessary step to protect the rights of the project,” and avoid “substantial harm” to the project if the suspension order remained in place, according to the statement.

“Revolution Wind secured all required federal and state permits in 2023, following extensive reviews that began more than nine years ago,” it said.

The move emerged months after the Trump administration issued a “stop-work order” against construction of the Revolution project in August, citing a need to “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests”.

The halt to construction sent shockwaves through the industry and pushed the market value of Ørsted, which is partially owned by the Danish state, to record lows. No details of the national security issues were provided by the White House and weeks later a federal judge allowed Ørsted to restart work on the project.

At the time, Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island senator and ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, said: “If Trump’s plan is to raise families’ energy prices, cut American jobs, turbo charge climate change, and accelerate the Great Climate Insurance Crisis, he’s knocking it out of the park with his all-out attack on American offshore wind.”

Construction is now almost 90% complete and the site had been due to begin delivering “reliable, affordable power” to US homes in 2026. Ørsted said it had already installed all offshore foundations and 58 of the project’s 65 wind turbines.

Ørsted shares, which had taken another 12% plunge after the 22 December announcement, were lifted by nearly 4% on Friday on news of the court action.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eab550bc8bf970a9b0998029f89ed3d68f767379/576_0_4182_3346/master/4182.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2b6e0c060f6bab9c265e907962d673e7",N,,2026-01-02 16:13:04.782121

In the Dec. 12 letter, Farley told Cruz through a lawyer that he has a scheduling conflict on the day of the hearing, Jan. 14. In addition, he said the proposed hearing was unfair to other auto executives because it invites “witnesses of different seniorities.”

The Commerce Committee announced in November that it had invited the CEOs of Ford, GM and Stellantis. But for Tesla, the announced witness was the company’s vice president of vehicle engineering.

“As previously discussed with your staff, Ford believes that it is essential that any potential hearing adhere to Congress’s longstanding tradition of ensuring comparable treatment for similarly situated companies,” wrote Brian Smith, a lawyer for Covington & Burling, which represents Ford. Smith added that “if a vice president of engineering is appropriate for the planned hearing, the other companies should have the opportunity to offer a similar witness.”

The Detroit News has since reported that General Motors is following suit. A GM spokesperson has confirmed that ""CEO Mary Barra will attend the hearing if the other companies’ CEOs do the same."" Meanwhile, there have been no official statements regarding Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa.

It’s a similar story with the Japanese brands, which don’t appear to have been invited by Cruz in the first place. This is interesting because several Japanese automakers have massive manufacturing footprints inside the United States. Toyota also tends to lead in terms of U.S. sales most years, with Honda often jockeying for position with Ford and General Motors.

This emphasis on Elon Musk being (or not being) present for the hearings feels rather trivial when Congress doesn’t even seem interested in hearing from representatives of all brands. But this has remained the focus of both the industry and the media.

Cruz has stated that he opted against inviting the Tesla CEO because of concerns that would shift focus away from the core issues and toward his previous role in government — specifically the short lived Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that now looks to have been disbanded by the Trump administration.

It’s not clear whether he’s afraid of what Musk might say about government policy or that the public response would revolve around Elon as a media personality. Perhaps both, as the latter item has already become a problem.

As far as the affordability hearings, which are scheduled to kick off on January 14th, automakers could use it as an opportunity to explain their position to the public while attempting to convince legislators to ease off on regulations. Cruz at least seems highly amenable toward deregulation and the Trump administration has shown similar proclivities.

Tariffs, despite not being the focus of the talks, could also come up — with automakers having previously expressed concerns on how they impact operating costs.

But it’s not abundantly clear that automakers actually want lower prices. While regulations have undoubtedly encouraged elevated MSRPs, companies have likewise been chasing higher margins on vehicles by offering fewer affordable models over the years. Many brands have been able to maintain steady profits despite lower annual volumes.

Financing is another topic automakers would probably like to avoid. Controlling debt and interest has become increasingly lucrative, with financing now comprising anywhere from 20 to 50 percent of dealership profits. While those entities aren't always linked to manufacturers, automakers absolutely have captive finance companies of their own.

Publicly discussing all that at a point where their customers are less-than pleased with the industry and its current products may not go over well. Meanwhile, few individuals in Congress have showcased any sound understanding of the auto industry and hearings often just devolve into long stints of lecturing to win brownie points with voters. The industry likely prefers to deal with the government via lobbying efforts whenever possible, particularly when the alternative could lead to public embarrassment.

In the United States, climate change is polarizing, but one environmental challenge draws rare bipartisan agreement: food waste.

Even as the Trump administration rolls back key climate and environmental protections, in July, senators from both parties reintroduced legislation to simplify food expiration labels — one longtime driver of unnecessary waste. In September, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched a national initiative to connect food donors with communities and keep edible food out of landfills. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. unveiled a national strategy to reduce food waste and expand recycling of organic waste.

Despite this rare consensus, progress has been slow, Floodlight and Sentient report.

In 2023, the U.S. still squandered roughly a third of its food supply, according to the food waste nonprofit ReFED. Food waste is responsible for 8-10% of all global emissions — about five times the emissions from the entire aviation industry. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that if food waste were a country, it would be the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the U.S.

Experts tell Sentient that the problem persists because political follow-through is limited, climate action still focuses heavily on energy and transportation, and ultimately, food waste itself is difficult to tackle. It occurs at every stage of the supply chain, from farms to fridges, making comprehensive action essential.

It’s also a missed opportunity, especially since wasting food is widely seen as wrong.

“Nobody wakes up wanting to waste food,” said Dana Gunders, president of ReFED, during a summit at New York City Climate Week in September 2025.

Many people don’t realize that food waste reduction is a crucial and often overlooked climate strategy. Addressing food loss and waste has enormous climate potential, “but it’s still an underexplored area,” says Brian Lipinski, head researcher on food loss and waste at the environmental research nonprofit World Resources Institute.

‍

The climate cost of wasted food

Most food waste happens in homes, restaurants, and retailers, but nearly all of its climate impact is already baked in by the time the food is thrown away. Every piece of wasted food squanders all the emissions that went into producing and transporting that food.

About 92% of food waste emissions happen during food production — when land is converted from forests or grassland to farmland, when resources are used to grow crops or raise livestock, during transport, in which most vehicles run on diesel or gasoline, and during cold storage. Once that food is tossed, those emissions are wasted. Only 8% of food waste emissions come from the disposal process.

When people are wasting food, “in many ways, we are throwing out a lot of water, a lot of land, a lot of fertilizer, natural habitat, a lot of things,” Paul West, a senior scientist at the climate nonprofit Project Drawdown, tells Sentient.

Fruits and vegetables make up almost half — 44% — of all U.S. food waste, according to ReFED. Meat and seafood, though also quick to spoil, are wasted less often because they are more expensive.

But wasting even a small portion of a burger has far greater environmental impact than wasting the same amount of fruits, vegetables, or chicken, says West. That’s because producing beef requires vast amounts of land, water, and fertilizer; and cattle also release methane — a short-lived but powerful greenhouse gas — with each cow burping about 220 pounds annually.

“If we are going to eat beef and dairy, make sure not to waste it,” says West.

‍

Why prevention matters most

Experts see reducing food loss and waste as one of the most impactful and practical ways to slow the warming of the planet. Project Drawdown calls it an “emergency brake” solution — a measure that can rapidly slash emissions using tools we already have, without waiting for new technologies or nature-based fixes. Other such measures include halting deforestation and shifting away from meat and dairy.

“Preventing food from becoming waste is really the most effective solution, not only from an emissions perspective,” says Minerva Ringland, senior manager of the climate and insights team at ReFED, “but it’s also saving the most money and keeping everyone fed as much as possible.”

In the United States, 35% of food waste comes from households, while 18% comes from manufacturing, 17% from food service, and 24% happens on farms. Household waste is high because people often buy more than what they need, especially in bulk, misinterpret date labels, prepare too much food, and may not know how to store or repurpose ingredients. Limited access to composting programs also makes it harder for consumers to avoid landfills.

Experts suggest households can curb waste by planning meals, buying only what’s needed, using smaller portions, and repurposing leftovers.

Emily Broad Leib, director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic, says the U.S. needs a national consumer awareness campaign, similar to the United Kingdom’s Love Food, Hate Waste campaign. She notes that the Biden administration set aside funding to develop such a campaign, but it has since stalled. Many people don’t realize how significant the issue of food waste is, she says — not just for the environment but for their own finances.

But reducing food waste at home is not just about telling people to be more careful or intentional about their purchases. After all, food waste is rarely intentional. Maybe you buy an ingredient for one recipe and never use the rest, or forget the leftovers in your fridge and they go bad. Lipinski says that retailers and food service providers can help consumers avoid waste by offering smaller portions, clearer guidance, and smarter packaging.

Government agencies can lead by example in reducing food waste in their dining halls, federal buildings, schools, and military bases by requiring vendors to donate surplus food, Broad Leib suggests.

These strategies are worth the effort because preventing food waste at its source offers climate benefits about 10 times higher than other strategies since it reduces the need for producing additional food.

Beyond prevention, the EPA identifies donation and upcycling — turning food into new products — as the most preferred approaches. However, 40% of donated food still goes to waste, and both strategies require energy for transport, storage, and processing.

According to the EPA, using wasted food as animal feed, leaving crops unharvested, composting, and anaerobic digestion do much less to offset the environmental impacts of food production than preventing food waste in the first place.

‍

Where most wasted food ends up

Most of the country’s surplus food still ends up in landfills, compost facilities, incinerators, or anaerobic digesters, according to ReFED. Only about 2% is donated. Food makes up nearly a quarter of combusted municipal solid waste that ends up in landfills.

In landfills, food waste decays and releases methane, a gas 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat over a 20-year period. Landfills produce 17% of human-related methane emissions in the U.S., after oil and gas and livestock digestion. A majority of the methane released from landfills in the U.S. comes from food waste, according to the EPA. A separate analysis by ReFED estimates that surplus food generates nearly 3 million metric tons of methane each year.

Improving landfill management is one of Project Drawdown’s highly recommended climate solutions. To capture or reduce methane emissions, some landfills install systems that divert landfill gas so that it can be burned for energy and sold to industries or utilities, helping replace fossil fuels. Methane that cannot be used for energy is typically burned off using flares.

Another approach uses biocovers — layers of organic material that foster bacteria that convert methane into carbon dioxide and water. Leak detection and repair programs can monitor methane leaks using drones, satellites, or on-site sensors, which helps operators spot and fix leaks.

Encouraging composting instead of putting food scraps in landfills also helps. But West says that while composting and landfill management matter, “you’ll have many times more impact if you stop the waste in the first place.”

‍

A change to these policies could help curb food waste

For something so uncontroversial, food waste has proven remarkably hard to fix.

In 2015, the U.S. set an ambitious goal of halving food loss and waste by 2030 — a target experts say is quickly becoming out of reach. No state is on track to meet the target, researchers from ReFED and University of California Davis found in an analysis published in January.

They warned that food waste levels are unlikely to fall without stronger state and federal action focused on prevention measures such as standardized date labeling, food rescue, and repurposing. Current policies, they noted, focus too narrowly on recycling methods like composting rather than addressing the problem across the entire food system.

Standardized date labeling is one of the most cost-effective fixes, ReFED argues. In the U.S., 6% of all food waste is due to confusion over date labels. Many U.S. consumers don’t know the specifics, but there is no national standard for date labels. Some products have “Sell by” dates, others have “Best before” dates, and still others have “Use by” dates — and they often mean different things in different states. The dates on packaging are “not designed for consumers to understand clearly,” Ringwald says.

As a result, many people toss food after the printed date, assuming it is unsafe to eat. This confusion leads Americans to discard about 3 billion pounds of perfectly fine food worth $7 billion each year. “Sell by,” “Best before,” and “Use by” dates usually indicate how long a product will stay at peak quality, not whether it is still safe to eat.

According to the USDA, the “Best if used by” or “Best before” date shows when the product will taste or look its best. “Sell by” indicates how long a store should keep a product on the shelf, and is meant for communication between manufacturers and retailers, but is often mistaken by consumers for an expiration date.“Use by” is the last date the product is at its best quality.

If you have a can of beans in your cupboard with a “Sell by,” “Use by,” or “Best before” date, it does not necessarily mean you should throw it out once that date passes. ReFED says that many foods, such as canned goods, nuts, and dry packaged goods can remain edible past the printed date.

To address this, ReFED advocates for a two-label system: “Best if used by” and “Use by.” “Best if used by” indicates product quality: it may not taste its best, but it is still safe to consume. This label is recommended for use for canned goods, bread, raw meats, frozen foods, and pasteurized products.

Meanwhile, “Use by” would apply to highly perishable items or those that pose a risk to safety over time, like deli meats, unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses, and smoked seafood. These products should be eaten by the date on the package and tossed afterward.

If passed, the bill reintroduced in the Senate would make that standard nationwide. Similar measures have been introduced in the past, but have not advanced. ReFED estimates that standardizing labels could keep at least 425,000 tons of food — or 708 million meals — out of landfills each year.

“Even though the issue is something that both Republican and Democratic administrations have cared about and worked on, there’s a lot of momentum that gets lost in between administrations,” Broad Leib says. The lack of sustained policies, she adds, has prevented the U.S. from making meaningful progress in reducing food waste.

‍

‘Pockets of progress’

Still, there are signs of progress, especially at the state level. That’s probably where we’ll see more momentum under the Trump administration, says Lipinski.

In 2024, California signed the country’s first legislation to adopt a clear two-label system on food products. Starting July 1, 2026, the law will also ban the use of “Sell by” dates.

Another is the implementation of state-level mandates that prohibit sending commercial food waste to landfills. States including California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Massachusetts have enacted such bans.

However, a study published last year found these policies have largely fallen short — except in Massachusetts, which succeeded in reducing the amount of food waste sent to landfills by 13%. Researchers found that Massachusetts has the country’s most extensive food waste composting network, making it easy and low-cost for businesses and households to follow the ban. The state’s rules are straightforward, with no exemptions, and authorities conduct far more inspections and issue more fines for violations than in other states. These differences point the way toward better implementation in other states.

Experts say that stronger incentives for grocers and restaurants to donate food could also make a significant difference. Some states, like California, now require some commercial establishments to donate edible food that they would otherwise throw out.

“We’re seeing pockets of progress everywhere,” says Ringwald. Because food waste is a complex problem, she adds, “We’re going to need a lot of solutions.” The key is turning these scattered successes into coordinated and sustained action across the supply chain, which can save money, slash emissions, and put food on tables.

China’s BYD ousted Tesla as the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, marking the first time it surpassed the Elon Musk-led automaker in annual sales.

In 2025, BYD sold 2.26 million vehicles compared to Tesla, which sold 1.64 million cars last year, representing a 9% decline from a year earlier, the Associated Press reported.

The New York Times reported that a growing number of those car sales happened outside China, mainly in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Chinese electric vehicles are effectively banned from the United States by high tariffs.

What is BYD?

The backstory:

BYD Auto was founded in 2003 and is an automotive subsidiary of BYD, a multinational high-tech company focused on leveraging technological innovations. According to the company’s website, BYD Auto develops pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The organization noted on its website that it’s the world's first automaker to halt the production of fossil-fueled cars on the electric vehicle shift and has remained top of new energy passenger vehicle sales in China for 10 years in a row.

How much do BYD electric vehicles cost?

By the numbers:

BYD manufactures different electric vehicles like the BYD Dolphin and the HAN, which is displayed on the company's website, although the price isn’t listed.

But in August 2025, BYD introduced the Atto 1 at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show, which is priced around $12,000, FOX News reported.

And there’s also the BYD Seagull, which costs $8,000, and it’s the company’s best-selling EV, Inside EVs reported.

The midterm elections in November will determine whether Republicans maintain a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Amid those uncertainties, my priorities remain the same: continuing America’s national defense rebuild and advocating for Mississippi’s growth.

We can look back on 2025 as a watershed year in the modernization of the U.S. military. Congress passed two major national security laws that will change the course of our defensive capabilities. As the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I led the process for both pieces of legislation.

On July 4th, President Trump signed the Working Families Tax Cuts. The law is most famous for its tax cuts, but it contains major national defense provisions. The legislation made a downpayment on numerous weapons systems. In December, Congress passed, and the president signed, the National Defense Authorization Act. We built on the investments of the summer and reformed the Pentagon’s process for acquiring ships, aircraft, and weapons.

These efforts were necessary first steps to kick-start our military rebuild. In 2026, I plan to pass the next phase of defense investments and to implement the acquisition reforms that will make this rebuild possible. The tyrants in China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea will take any American weakness as an invitation to be aggressive. We must achieve the kind of military strength that can deter these foes from moving against us.

I am working to protect our nation from threats abroad so that we can enjoy peace and prosperity at home. As always, I will advocate for legislation that helps Mississippi stay competitive in today’s economy.

Companies are already choosing to relocate to Mississippi, drawn by our business-friendly laws, low cost of living, and family values environment. I will keep doing what I can to make our state even more attractive. Across the state, I am working with local officials to improve transportation networks, water systems, and energy capabilities. In December, I introduced a bill called the Success for BEAD Act, which would help more Mississippians receive internet connectivity. I will continue pushing for greater access to telehealth and other policies that benefit rural communities.

In 2026, we will all pause to celebrate the 250th anniversary of our country’s founding. As we commemorate this milestone, Americans face rising threats abroad, division at home, and fears for the future. Dictators are working to upset the global balance of power, raising questions about the United States’ role in the world. Families, churches, and communities wrestle with disagreements. Parents worry about the effect artificial intelligence will have on their children’s education and job prospects.

Looking back on our history can provide both comfort and guidance. Our Founding Fathers set up a system of government so ingenious that it withstood centuries of change. The story of our country is one of resilience. Government by the people, the separation of powers, and the rule of law have guided us this far.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October–December quarter, down 15.6 percent from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles or a 12.3 percent drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles, marking the company's second consecutive annual decline.

Shares were up 1.9 percent in trading before the bell.

Tesla's fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in U.S. EV tax credits before they expired at the end of September, followed by a sharper slowdown as incentives rolled off.

EV demand has softened across the industry since the end of September, when the Trump administration ended US$7,500 (HK$58,500) federal tax credits, with Tesla also facing rising competition globally.

BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150 percent from 2024. The company has said it aims to sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down ""Standard"" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about US$5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend volumes after the tax credit loss.

Analysts have said Tesla came under immense pressure in 2025 in North America and Europe, where competition intensified and the company faced brand backlash due to Musk's political rhetoric.

Even as vehicle deliveries have weakened, Tesla shares rose about 11.4 percent in 2025, boosting Musk's wealth.

It's a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world's richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much-reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk's pivot to different parts of business. He has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory — and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin earlier this year, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

“Regulatory is going to be a big issue,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. “We're dealing with people's lives.”

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla's autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024.
Analysts polled by ‌Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles.
Intensifying competition in North America and Europe Growing competition from Chinese and European automakers such as BYD, Volkswagen and BMW has ‍weighed on Tesla's sales momentum.
BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150 percent from 2024.","Tesla ceded its crown as the world's top electric vehicle maker to China's BYD, after annual sales fell for a second year, hit by rising competition, the expiry of U.S. tax credits and brand backlash.

With global EV sales rising 28 percent last year, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time on an annual basis, helped by rapid growth in Europe, where the Chinese automaker has been widening its lead over the U.S. rival.

Tesla, whose sales fell about 8.6 percent in 2025, is facing intense competition, especially in Europe, raising questions about its ability to revive ‍the core auto business as CEO Elon Musk steers the company towards robotaxis and humanoid robots.

Shares of the company fell about 2 percent in afternoon trading.

""Investors are so focused on the future with Tesla that they are ignoring delivery numbers. It's about Optimus, Robotaxi and physical AI,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading, which owns Tesla shares.

End of tax credit in U.S. pinches Tesla

Tesla's fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in $7,500 in ‍federal tax credits after President Donald Trump's administration decided to pull the plug on the incentive in September.

In the ‍U.S., EVs accounted for 6.2 percent of retail vehicle sales in the quarter, down 3.6 percentage points from a year earlier, while ‌average transaction prices rose nearly $6,000 to $53,300, according to J.D. Power data.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October-December quarter, down ‍15.6 percent from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles, or a 12.3 percent drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024. Analysts polled by ‌Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles.

The decline in deliveries was not a major surprise, given the market had already priced in weaker demand after U.S. EV tax credits ended, said Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar.

Meanwhile, Tesla said it deployed 14.2 GWh of energy storage products, a record high. It is set to ‍report fourth-quarter results on January 28.

Intensifying competition in North America and Europe

Growing competition from Chinese and European automakers such as BYD, Volkswagen and BMW has ‍weighed on Tesla's sales momentum.

Tesla registrations declined across much of Europe in December but jumped in Norway, where record sales contrasted with shrinking market share in rest of the region in 2025.

BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150 percent from 2024. The company has said it aimed to ‍sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down ""Standard"" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about $5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend sales volumes after the ⁠tax credit loss and appeal to customers in Europe looking for cheaper options.

The move disappointed some investors who had expected a larger price cut or a meaningfully new mass-market product.

Even as vehicle deliveries have weakened, Tesla shares rose about 11.4 percent in 2025, boosting Musk's wealth.",https://newsimg.koreatimes.co.kr/2026/01/03/40d84cf4-d95d-4e4c-9e22-f3f51ec1d6d9.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 15:57:45.411025

Tech companies invested hundreds of billions of dollars this past year in data centers, which use enormous amounts of electricity. Planet Money's Keith Romer explains the connection to consumer power bills.

KEITH ROMER, BYLINE: Electricity prices have been going up for a lot of Americans, including a retired couple in Granville, Ohio - Ken and Carol Apacki.

(SOUNDBITE OF TYPING ON KEYBOARD)

ROMER: Every month for the last five years...

KEN APACKI: And here's my spreadsheet.

ROMER: ...Ken has recorded every charge on his electric bills.

K APACKI: And so here we start back in July of 2020.

ROMER: In 2020, they paid between 11 and 12 cents per kilowatt hour for power.

K APACKI: And down here in 2025, it's 19.

ROMER: Up 60%. Ken's wife, Carol, suspects the price jump has to do with some new construction nearby.

CAROL APACKI: A hundred and thirty data centers in Central Ohio here. I mean, that is amazing.

ROMER: Let's break down how these data centers could be raising their bills. There are three basic components to an electric bill. The first is distribution. Think the local power lines that bring electricity the last mile to your home. Marc Reitter runs the Apackis' local utility company, AEP Ohio.

MARC REITTER: The grid supports everybody. It's almost a universal service.

ROMER: That grid has to be expanded to bring lots of power to data centers. But the way the electricity system is set up, it's not just data centers that pay for that expansion. It's everyone.

REITTER: And everybody pays fair share. That's the crux of the model - has been for a long time.

ROMER: Reitter's company recently designed new rules to make data centers pay for more of that expansion. But those rules don't extend to the next component of the Apackis' bill - transmission. Think the high-voltage power lines that bring power from far away to your town. The Apackis' transmission company is spending billions of dollars building out its grid for data centers, costs which filter down to residential customers. Still, more than half of the Apackis' increased electricity prices come not from distribution and not from transmission, but from the third component of their bill - generation. Think the power plants that make electricity.

Cathy Kunkel works for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think tank focused on sustainable energy. She says in the region where Ken and Carol Apacki live, prices for generation have gone way up, in part because of data centers' insatiable hunger for electricity.

CATHY KUNKEL: The demand is there, and the supply is maybe not.

ROMER: And those high prices? They are also being shared, even though a lot of that price increase was a result of the new data centers tech companies are building.

KUNKEL: I think it's almost inevitable, the way that these structures are set up, that ordinary people are going to end up subsidizing the wealthiest industry in the world.

ROMER: Unless, Kunkel says, we reform the rules so that more of the costs of expanding electricity infrastructure are paid by the data centers themselves.

A family huddled over the kitchen table, staring at their electric bill. Chalkboard signs in a coffee shop bemoaning Connecticut’s high energy costs. The incumbent Democratic governor promising to open new power plants, even if it means expanding natural gas.

As issues of affordability take center stage in this year’s midterm elections, Connecticut’s nagging struggle with high electricity bills is making its way to the top of early messaging in the state’s budding 2026 gubernatorial race.

Politicians and voters in Connecticut are no strangers to frustrations over their utility bills and the vexing efforts to lower them. For years, and across several election cycles, the state has ranked near the top in the nation for the highest average cost of electricity.

But with electricity prices nationally now rising faster than inflation, candidates in other states have begun to tackle the issue in ways that serve as a prelude to this year’s races.

In a handful of recent elections in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia, for example, Democrats outperformed expectations by running on keeping utility rate hikes in check and raising warnings about the proliferation of power-guzzling AI data centers. The party’s earlier focus on adopting renewable, carbon-free power has given way to promoting the development of new nuclear reactors — and even natural gas — as a way of meeting rising demand without harming voters’ pocketbooks.

The shift in attention toward energy prices was evident at the 2025 national convention of state utility regulators in Seattle, according to Elin Swanson Katz, who previously led Connecticut’s Office of Consumer Counsel, which advocates on behalf of utility customers. Katz, who now works as a consultant on energy issues, said the convention schedule was packed with panels discussing the trends that are driving up prices, as well as ways to maintain affordability while making investments in grid infrastructure and new sources of electricity.

“As someone who has spent my career largely as a consumer advocate and somebody who thinks about public engagement, it was a real sea change, something that I think we should have been talking about all along,” Katz said. “There’s no doubt, based on national polling, that consumers — customers — want affordable energy, but they also want investments in renewable so, I mean, there’s definitely tension on that.”

In April, a poll conducted by Ipsos and the consumer nonprofit PowerLines found that nearly three-quarters of Americans were concerned about rising energy costs, and nearly 60% said they felt their state governments were not doing enough to protect ratepayers.

Already, efforts have been made over the last year to address Connecticut’s energy costs. The results have been mixed.

In June, Gov. Ned Lamont — who is seeking a third term — signed legislation promising to save customers roughly $100 a year on their electric bills, mostly by borrowing money to offset portions of what’s known as the public benefits charge on customer bills.

Those savings were quickly dissipated, however, by a new rate hike for United Illuminating customers and the announcement of higher winter supply rates.

The legislature’s efforts were also largely overshadowed by a clash between utility companies and their regulators at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority that resulted in the agency’s leader, Marissa Gillett, stepping down in October. While Gillett had been hailed by some, including Lamont, as a champion of consumers, critics accused her of skirting laws to exert control over the agency — a charge that was largely upheld in court.

At the same time, President Donald Trump’s efforts to steer federal energy policy in the direction of more fossil fuels has upended long-term investments that states like Connecticut have already made in pursuing cleaner forms of electricity such as solar and wind.

Noah Kaufman, an economist at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, published a paper in November citing rising electric prices as an obstacle to Connecticut’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions. A lack of local fuel resources combined with high delivery costs and certain clean-energy programs all contributed to the state’s high cost of electricity, the paper found.

In an interview, Kaufman said candidates here may have to adjust their pitches to appeal to voters who are concerned about both costs and the climate.

“We have very ambitious decarbonization targets without an obvious plan for how to achieve them at this point,” Kaufman said. “Politicians may have to consider strategies that would have been off the table a few years ago — might not have seemed politically viable — because any sort of reforms are going to go up against constituencies that like the policies in place now.”

Recent elections elsewhere

Historically, electricity prices have tended to take a backseat to other pocketbook issues, such as taxes and gas prices, in political campaigns. That has changed as electricity prices have risen faster than inflation, on average, since 2022.

In New Jersey, one of two states that held gubernatorial elections in November, summer electric rates were up 22% compared to the previous year.

“The No. 1, 2 and 3 issues in our race was Trump,” said Matthew Hale, an expert on New Jersey politics and professor at Seton Hall University. “But four, five and six were all affordability, and so energy was certainly a big deal,” he said.

“Energy costs are something people see every single day. When they jump right in the middle of a campaign, it’s a big issue,” Hale said.

The winner of that race, Democrat Mikie Sherrill, promised to freeze electric rates during her first year in office, though experts as well as New Jersey’s regulated utility companies questioned her ability to do so. She also criticized the state’s grid operator, PJM Interconnection, for approving rate hikes as well as the Trump administration for scrapping federal support for solar panels and energy efficiency programs.

At the same time, Sherrill faced a barrage of attack ads from her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, that used selectively-edited footage of Sherrill appearing to say that voters should support renewable energy programs even if it costs them “an arm and a leg.” Sherrill was actually critiquing how other Democrats had spoken about such issues.

Hale said that Sherrill neutralized those attacks by talking about modernizing natural gas infrastructure and building new nuclear power reactors as part of her energy platform, in addition to her support for renewable energy.

“She didn’t lean into the environmentalists’ wing,” Hale said. “She just sort of said, ‘We need to do better.’ She didn’t back the idea that it was going to be nothing but renewables.”

In Virginia, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger released her own affordability plan that focused on developing more generation from offshore wind, solar panels and small modular reactors — in addition to energy efficiency programs — as a way to bring down bills.

Spanberger also warned that the proliferation of data centers in Virginia was pushing the state toward an “energy crisis.” Her plan called for data center owners to pay their share of the cost to build the new power plants and transmission lines needed to power the facilities.

The Republican in that race, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, said in interviews that Virginia’s data centers were “here to stay” and that she supported an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that included older, dirtier forms of generation such as coal.

Both Spanberger and Sherrill won their respective states by healthy margins.

The 2025 elections also saw Democrats in Georgia flip two seats on the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utility companies. The winning candidates in those races focused on recent price hikes and the need to transition away from fossil fuels.

Still, experts caution that elected officials generally have a limited ability to actually lower the price of electricity.

That’s because a large percentage of customers’ bills go to pay for things like the maintenance of the transmission and distribution system, which is also growing more expensive. In many states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, utilities purchase electricity from power plants, then sell that power to customers without any markup. While elected officials may appoint regulators to approve utility rates — in Connecticut, appointments to PURA are made by the governor — those regulators are typically expected to approve justifiable costs.

“Politicians make those decisions, and it’s going to affect things a little bit, but that’s not going to fundamentally fix the fact that Connecticut has really high energy prices,” said Erik Katovich, a professor of energy and resource economics at the University of Connecticut.

Katz, the former Connecticut consumer counsel, echoed that sentiment saying candidates such as Sherrill and Spanberger now face the tough task of formulating policies that will fulfill their promises to voters.

“I don’t think there’s any really fully developed policy in any of these states, because it’s really, really hard to do,” Katz said. “If there were simple answers we would have done it already. But, I do feel encouraged that so many smart, skilled, experienced professionals are now recognizing that affordability should be in the top two issues that we address around our electric system.”

What Connecticut candidates are saying

Since taking office seven years ago, Lamont has signed numerous climate-related measures, including a 2022 law that promised to eliminate greenhouse gases from the electricity supplied to Connecticut customers by 2040.

But with the cost of utility bills proving a perennial issue throughout his tenure, the centrist Democrat has been wary of pursuing a more immediate decarbonization agenda sought by many environmental advocates and those on the Left.

In a recent interview with the Connecticut Mirror, Lamont said that his is an “all-the-above” energy strategy that includes support for renewable such as solar and wind along with natural gas and the nuclear power supplied by the Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford.

“In most cases, a lot of the renewables are also part of our long term solution to hold down costs,” Lamont said. “Natural gas — which I’ve been talking to our neighboring states and the White House about how it can replace some of the liquefied natural gas with more piped-in natural gas — that would be a lot less expensive and always on as well.”

Early last year, Lamont met with Trump administration officials in Washington, D.C., to discuss an expansion of pipelines that could deliver more natural gas into Connecticut and the rest of New England. In August, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection signaled its intent to approve a pair of compressor stations in Brookfield, expanding the capacity of the existing Iroquois Pipeline.

And while Lamont was an early backer of efforts to grow New England’s offshore wind industry, his administration has opted against buying into any new projects with the states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, citing the rising costs of wind power.

Now, the governor faces challenges from both sides of the aisle over the cost of electricity and his commitment to the climate.

On the Republican side, state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart have both launched campaigns that zero in on the state’s high cost of electricity.

(Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, is also reportedly mulling a run for governor but has yet to formally launch a campaign. Appearing on Newsmax in late December, she criticized offshore wind projects supported by Connecticut and other New England states.)

Fazio, who serves as the ranking Republican on the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee, has been one of the leading voices among lawmakers in favor of eliminating — or at least sharply reducing — the public benefits charge that pays for things such as energy efficiency programs, financial aid and investments in renewable energy that have been mandated by state lawmakers.

Fazio also criticized the costs of some of the renewable investments supported by customers as “obscenely expensive.”

“I think the evidence is there that it’s important to Connecticut residents and voters who are becoming increasingly wise to the fact that it’s actually elected officials in the state government who have been inflating the cost of the public benefits charge and electricity rates in general,” Fazio said.

During the 2025 legislative session, Fazio proposed shifting the cost of the public benefits charge — currently around $1 billion a year — onto the state’s budget. When that effort failed to gain traction, Fazio worked with Democratic leaders and Lamont’s office on a compromise measure, Senate Bill 4, that ultimately passed with bipartisan support. The bill authorized officials to borrow up to $250 million over two years to pay off some of the public benefits charge.

Moving forward, Fazio said lawmakers should examine each of the programs in the public benefits charge to determine whether they should remain a charge to customers, be covered in the state budget or be ended entirely. That would include making decisions over whether to provide public funding for certain programs, such as the low-income discount rate, that are intended to help some customers pay their bills.

“Should we have more of this program, less of this program? That’s, I think, a conversation for the appropriations process,” Fazio said. “On its face, it is not something you just shove in the electricity bill.”

Stewart’s campaign declined to make the candidate available for an interview on energy policy. In April, then-Mayor Stewart posted on X that she attended a signing ceremony for Trump’s executive order supporting the coal industry, where she said she met with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and talked about the state’s “affordable energy future.” Connecticut’s last coal plant, Bridgeport Harbor Station, closed down in 2021 and was partially demolished last year.

In another social media post, Stewart also criticized the bipartisan effort to borrow money to reduce the public benefits charge as “fake relief” because that money would have to be paid back, with interest, by taxpayers. She also called for an end to the public benefits charge and an increase in energy supply, without going into details.

While Lamont supported the bonds included in S.B. 4, he expressed skepticism of proposals for the state to pick up more of the public benefits tab, saying it would merely move around costs without achieving savings.

“Ratepayers and taxpayers are the same people,” Lamont said. “What you’ve really got to do is generate more electricity that will reduce the great spikes … that’s what really drives the cost.”

Lamont is also facing a primary challenge from state Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, a self-described progressive who has said he wants to push Democrats to adopt more left-wing stances.

“The governor wants to be seen as progressive, so he wants the top line to be ‘historic investment in renewable energy,’ and then at his very next breath, he says ‘historic investment in natural gas,’” Elliott said.

If elected, Elliott said that he would seek to finance the cost of building solar and other renewable energy projects through state bonds that are paid back by taxpayers instead of being tacked onto customers’ electric bills. He also said he would take a tougher approach toward the development of data centers than either Lamont or Fazio — both of whom said they would support such projects if the developers agreed to pay their share of the cost to build the electric infrastructure needed to run them.

Elliott said any power plants built for data centers should have to run off of renewable electricity, not natural gas or petroleum. He also questioned the economic benefit of large data centers, noting that they tend to employ relatively few people outside of the construction workers it takes to build them.

“What looks like a boon to our economy ends up being something that, over the long run, is a really bad decision,” Elliott said.

Lori Brown, executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, criticized both Lamont and Republicans for embracing natural gas, which she pointed out is subject to volatile price spikes that can increase the cost of energy, particularly in the winter.

“In Connecticut, the narrative is just being driven as if clean energy is the reason for all the woes in in electric bills,” Brown said. “That’s just such a false narrative.”

Additionally, Brown and other environmental advocates argue that investing in clean energy helps avoid other long-term costs associated with climate change, such as damage from storms and health care costs for people with respiratory illnesses.

Both CTLCV and the Connecticut chapter of the Sierra Club endorsed Lamont during each of his previous two runs for governor. The split over the issue of gas pipeline expansions, however, could push those groups to withhold their endorsements or consider backing Elliott in the primary.

Steve Lewis, the chair of the Connecticut Sierra Club’s political committee, said the group has yet to meet to discuss endorsements but said the pipeline issue is “something we need to consider very seriously.”

In response, Lamont pointed to his administration’s support for solar and wind projects, as well as efforts to improve energy efficiency. He added that any projects to expand pipeline capacity would be subject to the “highest environmental standards,” and compared against other energy resources to determine which have the lowest costs.

“You’re not serious about affordability if you’re not serious about an all-the-above strategy,” Lamont said.

Federal impact

In addition to their Connecticut-specific pitches, each of the the candidates for governor must also navigate the seismic — and at times unpredictable — shifts in federal energy policy being introduced by the Trump administration.

In October, the Trump administration ordered a sudden halt to work on a massive offshore wind farm, Revolution Wind, off the coast of Rhode Island. At the time, the project was nearly 80% completed and employed more than 100 workers at the State Pier in New London.

The move drew swift criticism from Lamont and other proponents of offshore wind, who predicted that the loss of Revolution Wind would increase the risk of blackouts while pushing additional supply costs onto electric customers. Eventually, a lawsuit by the project’s developer succeeded in getting work to resume.

Then, three days before Christmas, the Trump administration again ordered a pause for Revolution Wind and four other offshore wind projects under development.

Even Republicans such as Fazio and Stewart expressed some unease over Trump’s intervention in Revolution Wind, despite their criticisms of wind power.

“To be that far along in the process and then just pull a plug on something just to prove a point was pretty, pretty foolish,” Stewart said in an interview with CT Mirror in December, prior to the administration’s second effort to halt the project.

Fazio has criticized the cost of the power purchase agreement Connecticut entered into with Revolution Wind’s developers, which he said is likely to result in additional charges on customers’ monthly electric bills.

“On the other end, you know, the project is down the path,” Fazio said. “There’s a tradeoff there and I hope that the concerns that the federal government has, that the state and feds can communicate about [them] and work [them] out.”

Trump has also complicated ongoing efforts in Connecticut to utilize federal money to spur investments in climate-friendly programs. As part of a wide-ranging tax and spending bill passed last year, the federal government began phasing out tax incentives and other subsidies for electric vehicles, solar panels and energy efficiency upgrades that had been a centerpiece of President Joe Biden’s energy policy.

“It’s huge,” said Kaufman, the Columbia professor. “The whole premise of [Biden’s] Inflation Reduction Act and the subsidies for clean energy within that law was that the federal government was going to pick up the tab for a lot of investments in clean energy, or energy efficiency, or conservation actions.”

While the Trump administration and Congress have continued to support some investments in low- and zero-emission technologies, particularly nuclear, Kaufman said the changes in federal policy will generally force state officials to choose between picking up the cost of clean energy programs or discontinuing them.

“To keep moving forward, that means more of those costs are going to going to have to be incurred by Connecticut ratepayers and residents,” he added. “That’s a big deal… we’re just in a very different situation here than we were a few years ago.”

In Connecticut, Kaufman said officials could also look to trim some of the costs of clean energy programs — such as subsidies for rooftop solar or tradable credits for renewable energy — without imperiling the broader public push to adopt those technologies.

Last February, Trump announced new tariffs on Canadian energy imports, sparking confusion as to whether they would apply to electricity crossing the U.S.-Canadian border on transmission lines. New England imports about 11% of its electricity from Canada.

A spokesperson for the regional grid operator, ISO New England, said in an email that the federal government has yet to levy tariffs on those imports, and that the additional duties announced by the administration are not believed to apply to electricity.

Meanwhile, the president’s promises to lower electricity costs by keeping open aging coal power plants is unlikely to have much of an impact in New England, where the only operating coal plant shut down in September.

The project will validate wave energy technology under conditions required for large-scale deployment in UK waters.

The project is supported by €19m in funding from Horizon Europe. Its objective is to demonstrate that wave energy can progress from demonstration projects to commercial-scale deployment and become part of the mainstream renewable energy sector.

The POWER-Farm EU consortium includes European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), University of Edinburgh, Ocean Energy Europe, Renewable Risk Advisers, and Kristinehamn Teknik & Service.

The partners will test wave energy systems at EMEC’s site in Scotland to demonstrate survivability, reliability, and performance at farm scale. The UK is estimated to have up to 25GW of practical wave energy deployment potential, with Scotland hosting some of the world’s strongest wave resources. The project supports CorPower Ocean’s plans for global deployment while strengthening the UK’s role as a key early market.

According to research from the Supergen ORE Hub and the Policy and Innovation Group at the University of Edinburgh, wave energy could generate more than £30bn in gross value added for the UK economy under a high-ambition scenario. Combined with tidal stream energy, which could contribute more than £20 billion, the sector could support over 80,000 jobs if a strong domestic supply chain is developed.

The project builds on CorPower Ocean’s wave energy converter technology currently deployed off the coast of Portugal. It also focuses on proving that a European, and particularly UK and Scottish, supply chain can support larger commercial wave energy farms through volume manufacturing.

Anders Jansson, Head of Business Development at CorPower Ocean, said:

“The POWER-Farm EU initiative arrives at a pivotal moment for the wave-energy sector, as the industry shifts from research and development to commercial deployments,” said Anders Jansson, Head of Business Development at CorPower Ocean. “With Europe investing to bring wave energy to farm-scale readiness, we urge the UK to match this ambition and unlock its vast wave-energy potential. The UK is uniquely positioned to become a global leader in this emerging frontier, establishing a major new sector driving economic growth and job creation. With the right support and a clear route to market, developers and investors will have the certainty they need to deliver the nation’s first commercial wave-energy arrays, while ensuring the UK can capitalize on this golden opportunity.”

Wave energy is increasingly viewed as a strategic technology for providing clean, firm power that complements wind and solar generation. Across Europe, policy momentum continues to build. The UK has recently launched a Marine Energy Taskforce led by Energy Minister Michael Shanks, with support from The Crown Estate and Crown Estate Scotland. The taskforce is developing a roadmap covering site development, financing, innovation, and supply chain growth.

Guillaume Unique, Project Manager at CorPower Ocean and for POWER-Farm EU, said: “We are thrilled to deepen our collaboration with the partners in this ground-breaking project. Together, we bring a unique blend of cutting-edge research, advanced manufacturing capabilities, world-class testing infrastructure, and proven bankability expertise creating a powerful foundation for success.”

Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe, added: “The POWER-Farm EU project is a key milestone for Europe’s wave energy sector. Demonstrating scalable and reliable wave energy technology will help unlock investment, industrialisation, and the wider deployment of ocean energy. Initiatives built on strong partnerships and EU support are critical for achieving Europe’s climate and energy targets while reinforcing Europe’s leadership in the sector.”

Wave energy’s more consistent production profile can help stabilise power systems with high shares of wind and solar. Studies indicate that systems including wave energy may require significantly less installed capacity, grid infrastructure, and storage than systems based only on variable renewables.

The transaction was announced in December 2025 and is expected to close in the first half of 2026.

The acquisition helps Alphabet gain more strength for its growing data center operations. It also supports the growth of its artificial intelligence (AI) services.

The deal includes Intersect’s team, energy projects under development, and data center infrastructure. Intersect will keep running independently with its current leaders. It will also collaborate closely with Alphabet’s technical teams.

Why AI Growth Is Forcing Alphabet to Secure Its Own Power

Alphabet runs one of the world’s largest cloud and AI businesses. These services need huge amounts of electricity. AI applications, such as large language models and cloud computing tools, require powerful data centers.

The electricity demand from these centers is growing fast. Many power grids struggle to keep up with this demand. That makes reliable and clean power especially important for companies like Alphabet.

By buying Intersect, Alphabet can gain more control over the supply of electricity for its data centers. The clean energy projects Intersect develops include solar power, battery storage, and other generation capacity. Owning these assets lets Alphabet bring new power online faster. It also reduces reliance on outside energy suppliers.

Alphabet has already worked with Intersect. Google took a minority stake in Intersect in 2024 and partnered on several projects before the acquisition. The full purchase builds on that existing relationship.

SEE MORE: Google’s $20B Deal with Intersect Power and TPG Rise: How Can It Transform Data Centers?

Google CEO Sundar Pichai noted that this deal with Intersect will:

“help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership.”

Intersect Power: Building Energy for the AI Era

Intersect Power was founded in 2016 and grew into a significant player in the clean energy sector. The company builds and develops large solar projects, battery storage systems, and data centers. These projects combine power generation with computing facilities. Intersect has offices in several U.S. states and works with technology and infrastructure partners.

By late 2025, Intersect will manage over 10.8 gigawatts (GW) of energy projects. These projects will be operating, under construction, or in development by 2028. To put that in context, this is more than 20x the electricity production of the Hoover Dam.

Some of Intersect’s clean energy work includes building solar plants in California and battery storage facilities in Texas. These projects are designed to serve both utility grids and data centers with cleaner power sources

Before the acquisition, Intersect had raised more than $2 billion in equity and project financing from investors. It also had existing partnerships with Google and other technology firms.

What Alphabet Is Getting in the Deal: Inside the $4.75B Acquisition

Alphabet is paying $4.75 billion in cash and will also assume Intersect’s existing debt. The acquisition includes the following key elements:

The Intersect leadership team and staff.

A portfolio of energy projects in development or under construction.

Joint infrastructure projects with Google.

Access to emerging technologies in energy generation and storage.

Not every Intersect asset will transfer to Alphabet. Some facilities and projects in Texas and California will stay independent. They will continue to be backed by current investors. Alphabet is focusing on projects that directly support its data center and cloud operations.

Intersect will remain a separate brand and company after the deal closes, led by its current CEO, Sheldon Kimber. The company will continue its broader work while collaborating with Alphabet on shared energy and data center goals.

The Role of Clean Energy and AI

Large data centers consumed 4% of U.S. electricity in 2024, with hyperscale demand hitting 61.8 GW in 2025 (up 22% YoY) amid AI-driven growth to 106-123 GW by 2035.

Alphabet’s facilities used 30.8 TWh in 2024, doubling from 2020 and 95.8% of its total power, for AI model training and cloud services. U.S. grids face record demand in 2025-2026, with data centers projected to double to 9% of electricity by 2030.

Acquiring Intersect Power advances Alphabet’s 24/7 carbon-free by 2030 and net-zero goals. Intersect’s 10.8+ GW pipeline of solar (e.g., 828 MWp TX Lumina) and battery storage (multi-GWh) enables a direct clean supply. This reduces data center emissions intensity, building on Alphabet’s 12% Scope 2 cut in 2024 despite surging demand.

Alphabet aims for net-zero emissions in its operations and value chain by 2030. It also targets 24/7 carbon-free energy for all data centers and offices by the same year. Additionally, it seeks to enable 1 gigaton of annual emissions reductions for users and partners.

In 2024, it secured over 8 GW of clean energy. It achieved 66% carbon-free energy (CFE), matching 80% hourly CFE in 9/20 grids. Despite a 27% rise in electricity use, it cut data center emissions by 12%, bringing them down to 3.1 MtCO2e. Its portfolio includes power purchase agreements (PPAs) and investments in wind, solar, geothermal, and storage. It also has supplier mandates for 100% renewables by 2029.

Intersect plans to explore more technologies. Along with solar and storage, it will look into long-duration storage and advanced generation solutions. This will help diversify the energy supply. These technologies could further support data center growth with more reliable and cleaner power.

Big Tech’s Race to Control Energy Supply

Alphabet is not alone in addressing power needs for AI growth. Other big technology companies are also investing in clean energy, grid modernization, and direct power supply.

Microsoft, for example, has expanded renewable energy contracts and supported nuclear and other low-carbon projects. Amazon has pursued long-term agreements with nuclear power plants and investments in small modular reactor research.

The Intersect acquisition reflects a trend in which cloud and AI companies look beyond simple power purchase agreements. Some companies are adding energy development. This helps them get electricity faster and cut down on grid capacity issues.

Energy infrastructure has become a strategic asset for firms with large data center footprints. Owning or controlling generation and storage helps companies plan capacity better. This way, they can avoid grid connection delays and may reduce long-term costs.

What the Deal Signals for AI and Energy Markets

Alphabet expects the Intersect deal to close in early 2026, pending regulatory approval and standard closing conditions. The acquisition will give Alphabet direct access to clean energy projects. It will also provide talent to support data center expansion.

The transaction also sends a signal about how technology firms are adapting to the challenges of powering AI. Data centers are critical infrastructure for cloud services, search, video, and generative AI. Securing reliable, scalable, and cleaner energy sources is now central to growth strategies for Alphabet and its peers.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2338849359.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 13:13:45.448353

Tesla's fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in $US7500 ($A11,221) in federal tax credits after US President Donald Trump's administration decided to pull the plug on the incentive in September.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October-December quarter, down 15.6 per cent from 495,570 a year earlier.

Analysts ​expected 434,487 vehicles or a 12.3 per cent drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the ‌full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024.

Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles, marking the company's second ​consecutive annual decline.

Tesla reached its peak in 2023, delivering more than 1.8 million vehicles.

The decline in deliveries was not a major surprise, given the market had already priced in weaker demand after ‍US EV tax credits ended, said Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar.

Meanwhile, Tesla said it deployed 14.2 GWh of energy storage products, a record high.

It is set to report fourth-quarter results on January 28.

Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Right now, an attack is occurring from two fronts on the foundational law that protects water quality: the Clean Water Act (CWA).
The two proposals weaken the Clean Water Act in many ways including stripping protections from many seasonal streams and wetlands, leaving them vulnerable to pollution, filling, or destruction with little to no accountability.
Oregonians have worked too hard to restore and protect our state’s waterways to watch the gains under a functioning Clean Water Act erased.
The PERMIT Act passed the House of Representatives on Dec. 11, 2025, and is now heading to the Senate.","We all know that clean water is not optional — it is the lifeblood of our communities, our economy, ecosystems and our very lives.

From the headwaters of the Rogue River to the Applegate and Illinois Rivers, small streams and wetlands feed our drinking water supplies, sustain salmon and steelhead, and support farms and recreation. Right now, an attack is occurring from two fronts on the foundational law that protects water quality: the Clean Water Act (CWA).

Proposed changes by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to the definition of Waters of the United States (WOTUS), combined with Congress’ so-called “Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act” or (PERMIT) Act (H.R. 3898) would both allow the discharge of a range of pollutants into waterways of all kinds and would put the waters we all love and depend upon at serious risk.

The two proposals weaken the Clean Water Act in many ways including stripping protections from many seasonal streams and wetlands, leaving them vulnerable to pollution, filling, or destruction with little to no accountability. These proposals go beyond codifying the Supreme Court’s Sackett v. EPA 2023 decision to further reduce the scope of federal CWA jurisdiction to eliminate oversight of many activities that pollute water.

The new proposals reject the science about how water functions on the landscape and create new definitions and exclusions that further reduce the ability of the CWA to protect water both by the federal government and even the states themselves.

The PERMIT Act is a sprawling and far-reaching bill that strips away long-standing safeguards for rivers, streams and communities. Its most dangerous component targets Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which is the core power Oregon and Tribes use to review and place conditions on certain types of projects (like dams, pipelines, and large developments) to protect water quality.

If the PERMIT Act passes, it would handcuff Oregon’s ability to protect its waters by narrowing the ability of the state to review pollution and forcing the state to ignore cumulative and downstream impacts. One provision would block the ability of states to enforce their own water quality standards if they were stronger than federal minimums.

Even if a state manages to impose conditions on a project, it could not enforce them. That power would be transferred to federal agencies, as the bill takes authority away from the people who know and depend on these rivers most. The bill would also allow political appointees to exclude waters so that top officials at EPA or the Army Corps of Engineers could exclude any waters they choose from protection, without public input, science, or oversight.

The list of harms goes on to include numerous changes to the Clean Water Act that will work to tilt the scales away from science and public oversight in the name of “streamlining” permits, but the reality is fewer protections, less accountability, and more pollution in the waters we depend on.

The hacking away at laws like the Clean Water Act are how self determination and power is taken away from citizens, states, tribes and communities. It is how corporations take control and gain power and our environment loses. Oregonians have worked too hard to restore and protect our state’s waterways to watch the gains under a functioning Clean Water Act erased.

We should be strengthening clean water laws — not rolling them back to benefit polluters at the expense of our health, our fisheries and future generations.

Comments to the proposed changes to WOTUS can be submitted at Regulations.gov to Docket No. EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322 until Monday, Jan. 5, 2026. The PERMIT Act passed the House of Representatives on Dec. 11, 2025, and is now heading to the Senate.

The automaker reported 418,227 vehicle deliveries for the October-December period, falling short of analyst projections by roughly 16,000 units.
For the full year, deliveries reached approximately 1.64 million vehicles against analyst expectations of 1.65 million—confirming the company’s second consecutive annual decline.
BYD demonstrated exceptional international growth, selling 1 million vehicles outside China in 2025—a 150% increase from 2024.
The contrasting performance between Tesla’s declining vehicle deliveries and rising stock price reflects investor focus on the company’s future technology initiatives rather than current automotive sales.","Tesla surrendered its position as the world’s largest electric vehicle seller to China’s BYD after experiencing its second consecutive year of declining sales. The American automaker faces mounting pressure from intensifying global competition, the elimination of U.S. federal tax incentives, and reputational challenges that have dampened consumer demand.

Key Takeaways:

BYD became the world’s top EV seller in 2025, surpassing Tesla for the first time on an annual basis amid 28% global EV market growth

Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down from 1.79 million in 2024, marking two straight years of sales contraction

The company’s fourth-quarter deliveries dropped 15.6% year-over-year to 418,227 units, missing analyst expectations of 434,487 vehicles

BYD’s ascent comes as the Chinese manufacturer rapidly expands its European presence while Tesla struggles to maintain momentum in key markets. The shift raises serious questions about Tesla’s ability to stabilize its automotive operations even as CEO Elon Musk pivots company resources toward robotics and autonomous driving technology to support the company’s premium stock valuation.

Tesla’s fourth-quarter performance followed a temporary surge in third-quarter sales as buyers rushed to claim federal EV tax credits before their September expiration. The subsequent quarter revealed the true impact of losing those incentives. President Donald Trump’s administration ended the $7,500 federal tax credits at the end of September, creating immediate headwinds for U.S. EV adoption.

The automaker reported 418,227 vehicle deliveries for the October-December period, falling short of analyst projections by roughly 16,000 units. For the full year, deliveries reached approximately 1.64 million vehicles against analyst expectations of 1.65 million—confirming the company’s second consecutive annual decline.

“I think the market remains focused on the robotaxi business, where Tesla is testing its Cybercab in Austin,” said Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar. “If deliveries can continue to not be down too much in the coming quarters, I expect market sentiment around the robotaxi will continue to drive the stock,” Goldstein added.

Tesla shares gained marginally in early trading following the announcement and closed 2025 up approximately 11.4%, adding billions to Musk’s personal wealth despite the automotive business setbacks.

Competition Heats Up Across North America and Europe

The company faced unprecedented pressure throughout 2025 in its core North American and European markets. Industry analysts point to two primary factors: aggressive competition from Chinese manufacturers and established European automakers, plus brand perception issues stemming from Musk’s political activities and public statements.

BYD demonstrated exceptional international growth, selling 1 million vehicles outside China in 2025—a 150% increase from 2024. The Chinese automaker has set ambitious targets for 2026, aiming to sell up to 1.6 million vehicles in international markets, though it hasn’t disclosed total global sales projections.

German automotive giants Volkswagen and BMW have also intensified their electric vehicle offerings, capturing market share from Tesla in European territories where the American brand previously enjoyed stronger positioning.

In October, Tesla attempted to defend its market position by introducing “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced approximately $5,000 below previous entry-level configurations. The company designed these stripped-down variants to offset the tax credit elimination and appeal to European buyers seeking more affordable electric options.

However, investors responded coolly to the pricing strategy. Many had anticipated deeper price reductions or the introduction of an entirely new mass-market vehicle rather than simplified versions of existing models. The tepid response highlighted expectations that Tesla needs more aggressive measures to counter competitive pressures and restore sales growth.

The contrasting performance between Tesla’s declining vehicle deliveries and rising stock price reflects investor focus on the company’s future technology initiatives rather than current automotive sales. Wall Street appears willing to look past near-term delivery challenges based on optimism about Tesla’s robotaxi development, artificial intelligence capabilities, and other advanced projects that differentiate it from traditional automakers.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiago-ferreira-sZSczDpZT80-unsplash.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:58:34.636079

____ This story has been corrected to show that BYD sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, not 2.26.","Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for Musk who once dismissed BYD as a threat as Tesla’s rise seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make him the world’s richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales.

The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering.

From ancient pyramids to modern skyscrapers, these landmarks reflect one journey: humanity’s climb upwards.

The challenge now isn’t just to build upward, but to do it smartly, sustainably, and with meaningful social impact. Alat, Saudi Arabia’s advanced manufacturing champion, has taken a decisive step in that direction through its new €160 million venture with European mobility leader TK Elevator, seeking exactly that.

The partnership will manufacture and provide elevator and escalator solutions in Saudi Arabia and the MENA region, anchored by Alat’s industrial platform and global partnerships model, and powered by a shared vision to build the smart cities of tomorrow.

European engineering meets Saudi industrial ambition

Saudi Arabia is no stranger to urban innovation. The Kingdom is rapidly transforming and is integrating cutting-edge architecture with AI-driven mobility and data analytics to enhance daily city life.

The Alat and TK Elevator venture marks the first time a global company will manufacture elevators and escalators locally in Saudi Arabia, with Alat enabling the localisation of advanced mobility technologies in one of the fastest growing and most innovative new installation markets globally.

Through this venture, Alat is further advancing its ambition to build a regional powerhouse for advanced manufacturing, creating a world-class industrial hub in Saudi Arabia and contributing to the Kingdom’s industrial transformation. The partnership leverages TK Elevator’s European engineering excellence while building on Alat’s growing manufacturing ecosystem and local capabilities.

Amit Midha, CEO of Alat, says the partnership is about rethinking how buildings move and breathe, bringing together intelligent vertical mobility with clean energy and AI-led systems to create smarter, more efficient environments. By harnessing data-driven elevator technologies and predictive maintenance powered by artificial intelligence, the venture aims to streamline building flow, cut emissions, and deliver safer, more responsive and accessible experiences for everyone who uses them.

The partnership anchors advanced manufacturing in Saudi Arabia and localises mobility technology while creating high-value jobs through the integration of product development, services and training. Uday Yadav, CEO of TK Elevator, also framed the partnership as essential to meet the surging demand of the Kingdom’s ambitious developments.

Building a smarter city, one lift at a time

Lifts and escalators quietly move billions each day. The new end-to-end elevator and escalator solutions to be produced in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia offer a glimpse into the future of urban mobility, reimagining traditional systems to deliver more user-friendly and energy-efficient experiences.

Lightweight materials reduce resource needs, while smart sensors and IoT-based monitoring minimise breakdowns and ensure smoother, safer journeys.

TK Elevator’s EOX platform is designed to be both eco-efficient and digitally native. Belt-traction systems lower power consumption, adaptive “eco mode” technology learns traffic patterns, and regenerative braking feeds energy back into the grid, reducing shaft-travel energy use by up to 28 per cent.

Local manufacturing, global standards

Combining TK Elevator’s craftsmanship and Alat’s advanced manufacturing platform, the venture creates a model for the future of industrial innovation, scaling impact across the Middle East.

The facility will be built around advanced, AI-guided systems and follow a framework for responsible, circular production that aligns with both European and Saudi quality and sustainability standards.

The venture is also a catalyst for investment, knowledge exchange, and skills development. It is expected to create high-skilled jobs, embed international expertise in Saudi Arabia’s workforce, and strengthen Alat’s role as a bridge between global technology leaders and the Kingdom’s industrial ecosystem, while opening opportunities for European industry to lead smart infrastructure developments worldwide.

TK Elevator has been listed on the CDP A-List for climate transparency several years running and holds an EcoVadis Gold rating, placing it among the top five per cent of companies rated.

A blueprint for future partnerships

The Alat–TK Elevator venture demonstrates how cross-border collaboration is driving innovation, with Saudi Arabia’s strategic location and strong internal connectivity creating a positive climate for global companies seeking to establish a presence in the region.

Supported by strong institutional alignment and long-term national priorities, Alat is positioned to advance partnerships that accelerate industrialisation, technology localisation and capability building across priority sectors.

Alat has already begun leveraging this model in collaborations with global firms. Its US$150 million partnership with SoftBank aims to establish a next-generation industrial automation business in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that will manufacture advanced industrial robots, while its US$2 billion partnership with Lenovo aims to make Saudi Arabia a hub for advanced technology manufacturing.

Lenovo is building its largest factory outside China in Riyadh to produce millions of “Saudi Made” laptops, desktops, and servers. The project also includes R&D operations, driving localisation, innovation, and job creation in line with Vision 2030.

Combining European design and engineering expertise, Saudi Arabia’s exciting high-growth market and Vision 2030 ambition, and Alat’s mission to anchor advanced manufacturing in the Kingdom, the Alat–TK Elevator partnership is laying the foundations for tomorrow’s cities: efficient, human-centred hubs underpinned by sustainability, connectivity and global collaboration, where people and infrastructure rise together.",https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/60/04/56/1200x675_cmsv2_b5bd0ada-5127-5521-b1bf-7533e9e02640-9600456.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:58:43.245087

In recent years, 70-plus US states, cities, and other subnational governments have sued big oil for alleged climate deception. This year, courts repeatedly rejected fossil fuel interests’ attempts to thwart those cases. The supreme court denied a plea to kill a Honolulu lawsuit, and turned down an unusual bid by red states to block the cases. Throughout the year, state courts also shot down attempts to dismiss cases or remand them to federal courts which are seen as more favorable to oil interests.

But challenges against big oil also encountered stumbling blocks. In May, Puerto Rico voluntarily dismissed its 2024 lawsuit under pressure. Charleston, South Carolina also declined to appeal its case after it was dismissed.

In the coming weeks, the supreme court is expected to decide if it will review a climate lawsuit filed by Boulder, Colorado, against two major oil companies. Their decision could embolden or hinder climate accountability litigation.

“So far, the oil companies have had a losing record trying to get these cases thrown out,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, which backs the litigation against the industry. “The question is, does Boulder change that?”

After Colorado’s supreme court refused to dismiss the lawsuit, the energy companies filed a petition with the supreme court asking them to kill the case on the grounds that it is pre-empted by federal laws. If the high court declines to weigh in on the petition – or takes it up and rules in favor of the plaintiffs – that could be boon for climate accountability cases. But if the justices agrees with the oil companies, it could void the Boulder case – and more than a dozen others which make similar claims.

That would be a “major challenge”, said Wiles, “but it wouldn’t be game over for the wave of litigation”.

“It would not mean the end of big oil being held accountable in the court,” he said.

The American Petroleum Institute, the nation’s largest oil lobby group, did not respond to a request to comment.

3. Accountability shield

Big oil ramped up its efforts to evade accountability for its past actions this year, said Wiles. They were aided by allies like Trump, who in April signed an executive order instructing the Justice Department to halt climate accountability litigation and similar policies.

In July, members of Congress also tried to cut off Washington DC’s access to funding to enforce its consumer protection laws “against oil and gas companies for environmental claims” by inserting language into a proposed House appropriations bill. A committee passed that version of the text, but the full House never voted on it.

2025 also brought mounting evidence that big oil is pushing for a federal liability shield, which could resemble a 2005 law that has largely insulated the firearms industry from lawsuits. In June, 16 Republican state attorneys general asked the Justice Department to help create a “liability shield” for fossil fuel companies against climate lawsuits, the New York Times reported. Lobbying disclosures further show the nation’s largest oil trade group, as well as energy giant ConocoPhillips, lobbying Congress about draft legislation on the topic, according to Inside Climate News.

Such a waiver could potentially exempt the industry from virtually all climate litigation. The battle is expected to heat up next year.

“We expect they could sneak language to grant them immunity, into some must-pass bill,” said Wiles. “That’s how we think they’ll play it, so we’ve been talking to every person on the Democratic side so that they keep a lookout for this language.”

4. What to watch in 2026: plastics and extreme weather cases

Despite the challenges ahead, 2026 will almost definitely bring more climate accountability lawsuits against not only big oil but also other kinds of emitting companies. This year, New York’s attorney general notched a major win by securing a $1.1m settlement from the world’s biggest meat company, JBS, over alleged greenwashing. The victory could inspire more cases, said Merner, who noted that many such lawsuits have been filed abroad.

Wiles expects more cases to accuse oil companies of deception about plastic pollution, like the one California filed last year. He also expects more lawsuits which focus on harms caused by specific extreme weather events, made possible by advances in attribution science – which links particular disasters to global warming. Researchers and law firms are also developing new theories to target the industry, with groundbreaking cases likely to be filed in 2026.

“Companies have engaged in decades of awful behavior that creates liability on so many fronts,” he said. “We haven’t even really scratched the surface of the numerous ways they could be held legally accountable for their behavior.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38995d2c47863ea1f1e0c9954052cf86b8a62e27/2345_1336_3174_2538/master/3174.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57409f9691b7113b35ba2e5be427e3c1",N,,2026-01-02 12:14:16.831060

By integrating an existing solar park with a 200 MWh battery energy storage system, the project has become the largest solar-plus-storage facility in Northern Europe.

The solar park has been operational since 2022, with battery modules installed within the existing site. European Energy completed the battery works in just seven months, covering full installation, electrical integration with the solar plant and the grid, and the construction of supporting infrastructure.

Following energisation, the project will now enter a commissioning phase, during which the battery system’s technical components will be prepared for full commercial operation.

“The energising of the Kvosted solar and battery park marks the beginning of European Energy’s large-scale implementation of yet another technology. This will increase during 2026 with large-scale batteries expected to come into operation,” says Mads Lykke Andersen, Head of Technology Development at European Energy.

Solar power already plays a central role in Denmark’s electricity mix, at times covering more than 60% of national demand on days with high irradiation. This underscores the growing need for energy storage to smooth production fluctuations and support grid stability.

“In the future, we will place strong emphasis on batteries across our project portfolio. Kvosted solar and battery park is a project where we show that the roll-out of battery systems is now beginning in earnest,” says Thorvald Spanggaard, EVP and Head of Project Development at European Energy. “Towards 2027, we will across our European Markets install more than 1 GW of battery capacity. This development will mean that our energy facilities will be able to store electricity so it can be used when there is the best match between supply and demand for power.”",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/to.png,N,,2026-01-02 12:58:51.737580

Often called “forever chemicals,” PFAS are associated by the Environmental Protection Agency with an increased risk of kidney and testicular cancer, and liver damage.
Both proposed rules require facilities that detect the substances to submit a mitigation plan to NCDEQ.

The proposed “monitoring and minimization” rule would require industrial facilities to sample their wastewater and, if the compounds are detected, submit a plan to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality to reduce levels over time. However, it leaves out discharge limits and has some critics calling the rules “toothless.”

The vote, scheduled for Jan. 7 and 8 in Raleigh, represents a shift in strategy from 2024, when state scientists proposed setting hard caps on the concentration of chemicals allowed in the water. Under the current draft, there are no fixed numeric limits and no automatic civil penalties for facilities who continue to discharge the chemicals, provided they are following a state-approved minimization plan.

ALSO: CFPUA assesses treatment options for 1,4 dioxane, pilot-test could come next year

The new rules were developed in March 2025 following a directive from the EMC’s Water Quality Committee to focus on identifying the source of the pollution rather than installing concentration levels. The previous 2024 draft proposed a limit of 0.35 parts per billion for 1,4-dioxane and near-zero levels for eight PFAS compounds, including PFOA, PFOS, GenX, PFBS, PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, and PFNA. Often called “forever chemicals,” PFAS are associated by the Environmental Protection Agency with an increased risk of kidney and testicular cancer, and liver damage.

1,4-dioxane is a synthetic industrial solvent the EPA classifies as a “likely human carcinogen,” linked to liver and kidney toxicity.

EMC Water Quality Committee Chairman and EMC Commissioner Steve Keen noted in a previous public meeting from March 2025 much of the current draft’s language originated from the NC Water Quality Association. The NCWQA represents the state’s largest public utilities — including the Cape Fear Public Utilities Authority — but is often criticized by environmentalist groups as a pro-industry lobby because it also advocates for industrial dischargers.

NCWQA members Asheboro, Greensboro, and Reidsville successfully sued the state in 2024 to overturn 1,4-dioxane limits, a move currently being challenged by the Southern Environmental Law Center. Despite being a member, CFPUA executive director Kenneth Waldroup has distanced the utility from the proposed rules, noting in a May 2025 letter to the EMC that regulation without enforceable targets is “no more than an action in name only providing empty promises to the people of North Carolina.”

By allowing the association to help write the rules, critics like the SELC argue the EMC essentially allowed chemical dischargers to set their own terms.

The 15-member EMC body — appointed by the governor, General Assembly leaders, and the agricultural commissioner — is charged with reviewing and enacting rules for NCDEQ. The commission is considering the regulatory package as a single item, though it technically consists of two rules addressing different classes of contaminants. The first targets three specific PFAS compounds — PFOA, PFOS, and GenX — and the other rule for 1,4-dioxane.

PFOA and PFOS are “legacy” chemicals phased out of production years ago, but continue to persist in the environment and contaminate local waterways. In contrast, GenX is a modern replacement chemical still actively manufactured at the Chemours Fayetteville Works facility.

Although the EPA established federal limits of 4 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS in 2024, the agency moved in May 2025 to rescind protections for several other chemicals — GenX, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFBS. It leaves North Carolina without any enforceable federal or state limits on GenX discharge, meaning the monitoring and minimization rules currently before the EMC are now the only active regulatory proposal on the table for the compound.

There is currently no enforceable federal limit for 1,4-dioxane, though the EPA maintains a non-enforceable health advisory level of 0.35 parts per billion.

Both proposed rules require facilities that detect the substances to submit a mitigation plan to NCDEQ. The plans would outline how a facility intends to lower its discharge and be subject to a state review every two years.

For downstream communities like Wilmington, the primary question is how the lack of hard discharge limits affects water treatment costs. In 2024, an NCDEQ fiscal analysis suggested setting numeric limits at the source of pollution could save the state $9.96 billion over 36 years, primarily by reducing the need for expensive filtration at municipal water plants.

The Cape Fear Public Utilities Authority installed granular activated carbon filters in 2022 for $46 million, to remove PFAS to non-detectable levels in the water, but the filters are less effective at removing 1,4-dioxane. Unlike PFAS, which sticks to the carbon filters, 1,4-dioxane stays bonded to water molecules and passes right through them.

To manage 1,4-dioxane, CFPUA utilizes ozone and biological filters at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant, which breaks down the chemical rather than just trapping it. While the current system removes about 52% of 1,4-dioxane from raw water, the utility is exploring alternative and potentially expensive methods to remove the chemical completely.

Because the proposed rule does not mandate a specific reduction in upstream pollution, local filtration systems would remain the primary line of defense. Hannah Nelson, attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, wrote in a December 2025 letter to the commission the rules represent a “polluter wish-list” allowing industries to continue discharging toxic waste without facing consequences.

“By moving to a monitoring-only model, the state is allowing these companies to prioritize their profits over the health of communities downstream,” Nelson said to Port City Daily. “Water utilities and their ratepayers are ultimately left paying the bill for infrastructure that should have been funded by the polluters themselves.”

However, the NC Water Quality Association defends its approach as a “practical necessity.” In a letter to the EMC from September 2024, supported by the cities of Greensboro, Asheboro, and Raleigh, association attorney Paul Calamita argued setting immediate numeric limits would place an expensive burden on municipal taxpayers and utility ratepayers. He contended many local wastewater plants were never designed to remove industrial chemicals like 1,4-dioxane and would require “large capital investments” for infrastructure upgrades, the cost ultimately trickling down to ratepayers.

CPUA’s GAC filters have led to two specific rate increases on Wilmington taxpayers since 2022. The initial jump went into effect on July 1, 2022, when the average monthly bill increased by $5.39 — a hike CFPUA leadership said was 70% driven by the need to treat Chemours’ PFAS. A second 4.6% increase followed in 2024, attributed to a $1.3 million rise in annual operating expenses for the GAC filters.

CFPUA is pursuing a federal lawsuit against Chemours to recover treatment costs, which, if successful, CFPUA director Waldroup noted in 2022 would lead to a reduction in customer rates.

Because the substances are costly to treat, the NC Water Quality Association maintains the state should first find exact industries that are sending chemicals to city wastewater treatment plants. The association contends mandating strict reduction targets is unrealistic until the state better understands the source.

SELC’s Nelson countered, without numeric limits the new rules do not provide enough incentive for industries to change their practices.

“NCDEQ’s rules would have made sure that polluters kept their pollution below a level that it determined would not threaten health,” Nelson said. “In contrast, the EMC’s polluter-written rules do nothing to reduce pollution from industry or wastewater treatment plants. There is no level that dischargers must meet, and there are no consequences if a polluter fails to reduce its toxic pollution at all.

The SELC also warns the new rules remove public transparency. While the state currently tracks 40 different “forever chemicals” at various facilities, the proposed framework would only require industries to report data for three — PFOA, PFOS, and GenX.

In practice, SELC attorney Jean Zhuang argues this creates a “redaction loophole.” Because labs typically test for dozens of chemicals at once, a facility will receive a report showing the full extent of its pollution.

“In practice, this means that dischargers will receive a lab report showing the levels of dozens of PFAS compounds and will then redact all but the PFOA, PFOS, and GenX data,” Zhuang wrote.

The timing of the EMC’s vote is significant due to the REINS Act, H.B. 402, which became law in August 2025. The act requires any regulation with a projected financial impact of $20 million or more over five years must be approved by the General Assembly, regardless of its public benefit.

Implementing numeric limits for PFAS and 1,4-dioxane would likely exceed the $20-million threshold because of expensive infrastructure costs required to remove the compounds. Since many facilities across the state would need technology like CFPUA’s GAC filters, the total cost statewide would be in the hundreds of millions. The city of Pittsboro already operates its own GAC system, while Greensboro and Fayetteville are currently in the process of constructing GAC facilities.

“The REINS Act made it very difficult for strong — science-based rules to get passed,” Nelson stated. “We know that rules designed to protect water quality can be expensive, but they come with a lot of benefits and often more benefits than costs.”

The EMC Water Quality Committee will meet Wednesday, Jan. 7, to consider and vote on the proposed rules, with the full EMC is expected to take a final vote on Thursday, Jan. 8, at 9 a.m. Both meetings will be held at the Archdale Building in Raleigh and are open to the public, though a livestream is also available.

If the EMC moves forward with the proposal, it does not immediately become law. Instead, the vote starts a mandatory 60-day public comment period, a window advocates say is the last chance for residents to influence the outcome.

“I hope that the EMC listens to the public opposition to these rules and changes their mind,” Nelson said. “I hope they realize that their job is to protect the water we drink and the communities that rely on it, not polluters’ profits.”

If denied, the state would remain without formal rules for the chemicals and the process to establish those rules would effectively restart.

NCDEQ leadership did not respond to requests for comment by press. A spokesperson for the agency cited limited staff availability during the holidays and indicated a formal response would not be available until the first week of the new year; this will be updated upon their response.

The company reported 418,227 deliveries in the fourth quarter, down 16% year-over-year and below the 422,850 consensus estimate of 20 analysts it had reported Monday in advance of the release.

Tesla delivered 1,636,129 vehicles in 2025, 9% below the previous year's figure. It was the company's second straight yearly decline, which allowed competitors to gain ground.

After narrowly coming up short of Tesla's EV sales in 2024, Chinese rival BYD announced that it had surpassed the American firm in 2025 with 2,256,714 deliveries, up 28% year-over-year.

Despite slumping EV sales, the year saw some bright spots for Tesla: In October, the company posted revenue growth in the third quarter, likely as buyers took advantage of expiring tax credits for EVs. And in mid-December, despite Morgan Stanley downgrading its rating on the company shortly before, Tesla's stock climbed to an all-time high, setting its first record high in a year.

The stock's comeback—it more than doubled from its March lows—could be traced to excitement about the company's plans for robotics, AI and the rollout of its robotaxi service, as well as for CEO Elon Musk's renewed commitment to the company after spending the earlier part of 2025 heading President Donald Trump's DOGE cost-cutting effort.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives predicted in a December note that 2026 will be a ""game changer"" for the company. “We believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,” wrote Ives, who thinks Tesla stock could rise to $800 by the end of this year.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/g-KjGwSoTxsaZI4N3cup4GYvs50=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-2250976740-9c9eaee537484d328e1c65f7016f1934.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:58:39.448355

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Commissioner Amanda Lefton today announced $22.7 million in Climate Smart Communities Grant awards for 43 projects to help municipalities take action to address climate change. This year’s funded projects reduce flood risk by retrofitting or relocating critical infrastructure, support decreasing transportation emissions through cycling and walkability projects, reduce emissions from food waste and landfills, and undertake engineering feasibility studies to advance future climate projects, among many other actions.

“DEC’s Climate Smart Communities grants support municipal investments to reduce pollution, protect the environment, and increase community resilience to climate impacts and severe weather,” Commissioner Lefton said. “Governor Kathy Hochul recognizes reducing harmful emissions and advancing climate equity is critical to improving New Yorkers’ health and quality of life, while also helping save money on energy costs. DEC is proud of our partnerships with local governments taking the lead on climate adaptation and resilience statewide.”

Funding for the Climate Smart Communities (CSC) Grant Program is supported by the $4.2 billion Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act and the State's Environmental Protection Fund, which was increased to a record $425 million in the 2025-26 State Budget. Since the program's inception in 2016, DEC awarded more than $109 million to municipalities through the CSC Grant program in support of local climate mitigation and adaptation projects.

As part of the CSC Grant Program, municipalities are required to provide a local match of 50 percent of the total costs for most projects. Last year’s New York State budget made grants more accessible to more communities by authorizing DEC to provide up to 80 percent of the cost for municipal projects that meet criteria for financial hardship and for projects located in disadvantaged communities.

The full list of grant awards include:

In Portugal, guaranteeing a sustainable future.

EDP supported the X Congress of Environmental Sciences of Andalusia, which brought to the debate the circular economy as one of the essential models to guarantee a sustainable future.

The future must be circular

EDP sponsored the X Congress of Environmental Sciences of Andalusia on circular economy, organized by the College of Environmentalists of Andalusia (COAMBA), on November 3 and 4, 2022, in Seville.

Among the main conclusions of the invited experts, the following stand out:

The circular economy should be the guiding axis of all actions, of individuals and companies, and there is an urgent need for a change in business models;

The circular economy is a paradigm that affects production, consumption and financing. If we want the economy to be circular, it is necessary to transform the rules of the game. The solution will be to seek collaboration mechanisms between entities, so that we can face the challenges that lie ahead in the coming years;

The planet is sick, and there continues to be an increasing extraction of resources, which are finite. It is essential that we are able to take advantage of the raw materials present in products;

A more efficient use of raw materials should require that products remain in the economy as long as possible. It is essential that we find ways to make products last longer;

Making money, being more competitive and having a better relationship with the planet is possible. The future will have to be circular or we probably won't have a future;

If it is so important and urgent to move from the linear to the circular model, why don't we do it?

#firefighters #electricvehicles","Charlotte, NC Adds ALL-ELECTRIC Vector Fire Truck, Opens the Southeast’s First All-Electric Firehouse. The City of Charlotte, North Carolina Fire Department announced a major milestone in fleet electrification with the addition of a Spartan Corp. all-electric Vector fire truck, designated Engine 30. The new apparatus represents a forward-looking investment in cleaner, quieter, and more cost-effective emergency response technology. The department partnered with Atlantic Coast Fire Trucks to customize the vehicle to its operational requirements, aligning it with the needs of Charlotte’s new all-electric fire station. See EVinfo.net's article: https://lnkd.in/g4zGvNvE The station itself is part of a broader city investment in public safety infrastructure. Built by Swinerton Builders, the facility carries a total project budget of $16.39 million and is now fully operational. Together, the new station and Engine 30 signal Charlotte’s commitment to sustainability while maintaining high standards for emergency response and community protection. The Vector™ Electric is North America’s first fully electric fire truck capable of performing 100 percent of fireground operations using electric power alone. Designed by Spartan Emergency Response, the vehicle is powered by a high-capacity 327 kWh battery, delivering the longest electric pumping duration currently available in the industry. Its electric motor replaces the traditional diesel engine, driving both the pump and rear axle in a split-shaft configuration. For resilience in extraordinary circumstances, an optional diesel range extender is available for off-grid emergencies such as prolonged outages or natural disasters, though it is not required for routine urban operations. The Vector meets NFPA and ULC certifications, offering pumping capacities of up to 1,250 GPM on electric power and up to 1,500 GPM with the range extender, along with water and foam tank options up to 530 gallons. With a low center-of-gravity battery placement, the Vector improves handling, stability, and occupant safety. Its modular cab, body, and pump house allow full customization while preserving the familiar feel of traditional fire apparatus. Backed by Spartan ER’s century-long legacy and extensive dealer network, the Vector Electric demonstrates how zero-emission technology wins. CONGRATS and THANK YOU City of Charlotte, Spartan ER. This is just more proof that electrification is the best option for fire and all emergency response. Faster, cleaner, most cost effective EV.

The two companies have agreed to jointly use 8,990 metric tons of UCOME second-generation biofuel, enabling an estimated 25,000 metric tons of CO2e well-to-wake emission reduction for ocean freight transported under DHL's GoGreen Plus service. This initiative empowers DHL customers to significantly reduce the carbon intensity of their international supply chains while accelerating the industry's transition to alternative marine fuels.

""This collaboration marks another milestone in our mission towards low-carbon supply chains,"" said Casper Ellerbaek, Head of Global Ocean Freight at DHL Global Forwarding. ""By leveraging sustainable marine fuels, we help our customers achieve their climate goals and drive real progress toward decarbonization.""

Driving lower-carbon ocean freight solutions

Through DHL's GoGreen Plus and CMA CGM's ACT+ low-carbon transport offering, shippers can integrate sustainable maritime transport into their logistics operations. CMA CGM will physically bunker the biofuel across its fleet, ensuring that emission reductions correspond to DHL's Book & Claim approach. DHL's GoGreen Plus service enables customers to cut well-to-wake emissions by selecting sustainable marine fuel options for their transport, allowing reductions of up to 80% GHG emissions compared to conventional maritime fuel.

Shared ambition for Net Zero

While DHL aims to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, Olivier Nivoix, Executive Vice President Shipping, CMA CGM Group, confirmed: ""Our partnership with DHL demonstrates how collaboration can accelerate the shift to low-carbon shipping. ACT+ offers reliable and scalable solutions backed by our fleet designed for alternative fuels. CMA CGM, committed to Net Zero Carbon by 2050, has already cut the carbon intensity of its shipping activities by 57% since 2008 and is investing heavily in alternative fuels and dual-fuel vessels.""

Both companies will continue to explore opportunities to scale up lower-carbon fuel usage and develop collaborative approaches to decarbonize international supply chains.

What is GoGreen Plus?

DHL's GoGreen Plus products provide decarbonized solutions across DHL's core offerings by leveraging sustainable fuels and low carbon technology. GoGreen Plus products are based on true value chain decarbonization. This is enabled by the 'book & claim' approach. Book & claim enables DHL to directly replace fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within the logistic company's network and allocate environmental benefits to paying customers, even when their shipments are not physically transported with the assets using these fuels. GoGreen Plus allows DHL's customers to reduce their indirect Scope 3 emissions in their value chain arising from upstream and downstream transportation and distribution. It also helps customers with voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and progress against their decarbonization targets.

The laws cover a range of categories, from business and real estate, to healthcare, adoption and gender identity. The laws, reflecting a legislative process that often saw the state legislature pitted against the governor, as the two power centers looked to weigh proposed legislation in their favor.

NEW NORTH CAROLINA LAW STRICTLY DEFINING SEXES AS MALE OR FEMALE GOES INTO EFFECT

House Bill 805 was passed after a legislative override of the governor’s veto. The bill began life as a bipartisan effort to protect women and children from online sexual predators. After passing the state House, the bill was re-shaped in the Senate into what became an effort to codify gender identity into North Carolina law. The new law, which recognizes only two genders on all official state documentation, requires individuals to be identified by their gender at birth and not by their chosen gender identity or presentation. The change would most notably affect identification, such as driver’s licenses. While state senator Kevin Corbin (R) calls it “fair for everyone,” state senator Julie Mayfield (D) calls it “another example of importing to North Carolina this national anti-LGBTQ agenda.”

Senate Bill 248 takes a significant step in reducing the differences in birth certificates for those who are adopted. The new law allows for adoptive parents to be named on a child’s birth certificate, while making it easier for counties to issue certified birth certificates to adopted individuals.

Senate Bill 690 covers a range of business/broker-related issues. Most notably, its provision changes what is allowed on a real estate purchase offer. The change allows compensation paid (or commission to be paid) to a buyer’s agent to be included in the offer. The full disclosure could have an effect on the negotiation process and the purchase price of a property.

House Bill 67 is designed to increase the number of healthcare professionals serving patients in North Carolina. The legislation clears a pathway for licensed physicians and physician assistants to be employed at North Carolina hospitals. It also allows for more internationally trained medical professionals to gain entry to hospitals in the state. The law includes a provision allowing PAs who are licensed in North Carolina to practice in other states.

Time to kick him in the tender parts.
Here’s an idea: Jane Bolin (1908-2007), the first Black woman to serve as a New York State Judge, was from nearby Poughkeepsie.
Lewis Morris: I’m sorry Mr. President, but the simple fact is that our legislature has never sent us explicit instructions on anything!
[turns to the Congress as he returns to his seat] Lewis Morris: I beg the Congress’s pardon.","Why in the world does New York still have the Donald J. Trump State Park?

You might have missed it, but while most normal Americans were celebrating the New Year, Donald Trump continued his serial ransacking of public spaces and buildings. On New Year’s Eve, the Administration announced the cancelling of leases of three DC golf courses, with the intention of transferring the leases to the Trump Organization. As golf reporter Kevin Van Valkenburg noted,

This hasn’t resonated yet outside golf, but what this administration is essentially doing is taking over a national park for invented reasons so that the Trump Organization can run it and profit from it. Imagine if Yellowstone suddenly cost $1,000 but mostly served lobbyists.

If you don’t care about golf [this includes me – JZ], that’s fine. If your politics differ from mine, that’s totally fine too. Some issues can involve politicians but still be above politics. There isn’t any justification for this beyond a transfer of public land use to a wealthier class of people.

Because populism, of course.

It didn’t stop there. The Oval Office Occupant announced that his building of his new triumphal arch in DC will begin in around two months.

Now, Donald Trump is a constant bullsh*tter (in the Frankfurtian sense): he just says things if they sound good and make him feel good. He doesn’t care whether they are true. And in the latter case, his action is likely illegal (as was his purporting renaming of the Kennedy Center). Although with the current, comically-corrupt Supreme Court, one as always is tempted to ask: what is this legality of which you speak?

This is straight-up Nazi stuff. That is not hyperbole. As I explained a few months ago, this is pretty much what Albert Speer tried to do to Berlin: rip out people and make it full of monuments to the Reich.

In addition to lawsuits, What Is To Be Done?

Let me introduce you to Donald J. Trump State Park in the Hudson Valley. Huh?

Turns out that a quarter century ago, Trump attempted to build a golf course and resort on the site, and – always on-brand – proposed doing so by filling wetlands and despoiling the local environment.. After resistance from neighbors and environmental laws, he gave up and “donated” the property to the state.

In typical fashion it involved fraud:

Despite the purchase price of $2.75 million, and a county assessment of $5.5 million at the time of the donation, Trump’s 2016 campaign said in a list of charitable donations published by The Washington Post that the land was worth $26.1 million.

Then-Governor George Pataki agreed to name it after him, although as far as I can tell that was not a requirement. Trump, of course, boasted that it would be the greatest park in the state.

And as with all of Trump’s boasts, it didn’t turn out that way. A local television station reported in 2019 that

An hour’s drive north of Manhattan, Donald J. Trump State Park is what New York euphemistically calls a “passive park,” meaning it has no trails, picnic tables or other amenities. The state stopped maintaining it in 2010, and the land lies covered in brambles, mud and rocks.

In 2017, an article on website The A.V. Club framed the park as an “abandoned wasteland”, with “muddy fields, overgrown tennis courts, and dilapidated buildings” and a swimming pool in disrepair.”

And there it sits. So now the New York Legislature has the chance to do a very funny thing and rename it. Trump is acutely sensitive to what he perceives as personal slights: at times, I think he doesn’t really have a personalities, but just a series of impulses, bigotries, and grievances. Time to kick him in the tender parts.

Who to rename it after? The touchstone for me is what would enrage Trump the most. That would suggest an African-American or a woman or both. There already is a Shirley Chisholm State Park. Here’s an idea: Jane Bolin (1908-2007), the first Black woman to serve as a New York State Judge, was from nearby Poughkeepsie. Or perhaps a certain former President, despite his lack of connection to the area.

In any event, now is the time. I mean, except for all the other times that different legislators have talked about it, gotten press for claiming it should be renamed, and then nothing happens. Back in 2023, blogger Michael Balter wrote a thoughtful post noting that legislators had made a big deal about changing the name, but when you look at the fine print, it just proposed a commission to study the name change:

This does not look, to me, like a serious attempt to give the people of New York a nice park that is not named after a terrible man. It looks like an attempt by local Democrats to generate a little publicity and then hide behind some lawyer’s cowardly interpretation of the law to throw up their hands and say, we tried, but nothing can be done. That would continue to save the state the money it has not spent on the park every year since 2006, and provide a great excuse to keep on not spending that money.

It all reminds me of one of my favorite musicals, 1776, a dramatization of the creation of the Declaration of Independence. It’s terrific, and hilarious, and bears little resemblance whatsoever to actual history. One of the funniest subplots is that throughout all the tense political battles and arguments, the New York delegation never votes on anything. It always abstains, no matter the issue, no matter the stakes. The delegation head, Lewis Morris, always rises and “abstains, courteously.” Which, after weeks and weeks and dozens of abstentions in an increasingly hot and humid (not to mention “foul, fetid, fuming, foggy, filthy“) Philadelphia, leads to this colloquy between Morris and Congress President John Hancock:

Lewis Morris: [as John Hancock is about to swat a fly] Mr. Secretary, New York abstains, courteously.

[Hancock raises his fly swatter at Morris, then draws back]

John Hancock: Mr. Morris,

[pause, then shouts]

John Hancock: WHAT IN HELL GOES ON IN NEW YORK?

Lewis Morris: I’m sorry Mr. President, but the simple fact is that our legislature has never sent us explicit instructions on anything!

John Hancock: NEVER?

[slams fly swatter onto his desk]

John Hancock: That’s impossible!

Lewis Morris: Mr. President, have you ever been present at a meeting of the New York legislature?

[Hancock shakes his head “No”]

Lewis Morris: They speak very fast and very loud, and nobody listens to anybody else, with the result that nothing ever gets done.

[turns to the Congress as he returns to his seat]

Lewis Morris: I beg the Congress’s pardon.

John Hancock: [grimly] My sympathies, Mr. Morris.

Enough. It’s time. Rename the park.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Donald-J-Trump-State-Park-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:14:21.261075

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for Musk who once dismissed BYD as a threat as Tesla’s rise seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make him the world’s richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Much is gloomy, but there are positive developments all the time — so many, in fact, that it’s easy to miss some of the things that have been happening.

For the past few years, I’ve been compiling year-end lists of the more neglected good and bad climate stories to give an idea of the immense amount of change as the world transitions to new sources of energy amid a gathering environmental crisis.

Here’s my selection of major developments over the past 12 months:

Some grids have almost decarbonized

You might not know it from the prevailing mood of Trump-era defeatism, but in some parts of the world, decarbonizing electricity is approaching its endgame. Roughly three-quarters of power generation in the UK and Europe this year came from non-fossil sources, putting them in about the same place as Brazil and Canada, whose vast hydroelectric resources traditionally gave them some of the cleanest grids.

With more renewables added each year, current projects under construction and in late-stage development should put Europe’s grid between 80% to 90% clean energy, the level at which further advances will start to get far more difficult without massive battery usage, new flexible technologies, or both. That means a looming slowdown in renewable deployment, something that many will regard as some sort of failure. In fact, it’s a testament to the monumental achievement so far, and an example the rest of the world should now emulate.

We may have passed peak cement

As much as 8% of the world’s emissions come from the production of cement — but the collapse of China’s real estate boom is turning that tide. The country’s output through October was the lowest since 2009, suggesting that the full-year total will be in the region of 1.7 billion metric tons. Combined with the sluggish 1% to 2% pace of growth forecast in the rest of the world, that suggests global consumption will be the lowest since 2012.

There may be further to fall. China still consumes 1.2 tons of cement per capita, about four times the rate of the rest of the world — but construction starts, a leading indicator for demand, are collapsing even faster, with commercial groundbreaking at its weakest since 2005. Developed countries use only about 16% of global cement, and China is now developed in all but name. A boom like the one we saw over the past decade will never return. Even India and sub-Saharan Africa won’t be big enough to take its place.

EVs are going global

If you were looking only at the parlous state of electric vehicle sales in some developed markets — the U.S., say, or Japan or Italy — you might think the entire technology is faltering. Far from it. Plug-in cars have been comprising more than half of all sales in China and just under a third in Europe in recent months. More dramatic, though, is what’s been happening in less-noticed developing countries.

EVs have had a sales share of more than 20% in recent months in Turkey, Thailand, and Vietnam, while Indonesia isn’t far behind. Markets as diverse as Nepal, Ethiopia, Laos, Armenia and the United Arab Emirates are adopting EVs far faster than many developed countries. Some 27.3% of all passenger vehicle sales worldwide in the September quarter came with a plug, according to BloombergNEF. If you think the EV revolution is losing speed, it’s probably just a sign that your own domestic market is getting left behind.

The course of the energy transition never did run smooth — but I’ve noticed over the past few years of writing these lists that events in retrospect look much better than the depressing prospect you get from a cursory look at the news. Let’s hope that pattern plays out in 2026, too.

He has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory — and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin earlier this year, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

“Regulatory is going to be a big issue,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. “We’re dealing with people’s lives.”

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla’s autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

It's January 2, 2026, and this is The Morning Shift — your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. This is where you'll find the most important stories that are shaping the way Americans drive and get around.

In this morning's edition, we're looking at Tesla's ever-dropping sales, as well as BYD taking its place as the top-selling EV maker globally. We'll also look at how things are going in Norway, EV-wise, and Zeeker's plans to sell to ze Germans.

For years, Tesla has been the top-selling EV maker globally. It really defined the market, getting into pure-EV sales before any other company did so at the same scale, and it's been the company to beat ever since. Until 2025, at least, when it was finally beaten. Now, BYD is the top-selling EV maker in the world. The BBC has BYD's sales numbers:

China's BYD is set to overtake Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs), marking the first time it has outpaced its American rival for annual sales.

On Thursday, BYD said that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million.

Tesla, which is due to reveal its total sales for 2025 later on Friday, last week published analysts' estimates suggesting that it had sold around 1.65 million vehicles for the year as a whole.

Since that writing, though, we've gotten Tesla's numbers in.They're a bit better than predicted by the BBC, but not by much: Tesla delivered 1,636,129 cars in 2025, far from the 2.25 million EVs that BYD sold. BYD has beaten Tesla in sales before, technically, but those numbers included PHEVs alongside fully-electric cars. Now, BYD wins with no caveats: It sold more EVs than Tesla, end of sentence.

Tesla is circling the sales drain. The company's CEO seems more focused on robotics (and, for some reason, fast food) than actually selling cars, which has had a predictably detrimental effect on car sales. Well, that, and the whole ""shoving his nose into politics"" thing. In most of Europe, things are looking bad for Tesla. From Reuters:

Tesla registrations fell in some key European markets in December, but surged in Norway confirming a trend of record sales in Europe's EV trailblazer while the U.S. automaker's market share crumbled across the rest of the region in 2025.

Elon Musk's EV brand has seen slowing sales in Europe since late 2024 due to growing competition, its aging lineup and protests against Musk's public praise of European right-wing political figures. It is also expected to report a sharp drop in global fourth-quarter delivery numbers later on Friday.

...

In France, Europe's third-biggest car market after Germany and Britain, Tesla registrations – a proxy for sales – slumped 66% last month to 1,942 vehicles, data from French car body PFA showed on Thursday.

Registrations fell 37% in France in 2025 as a whole.

In Sweden, Tesla registrations fell 71% to 821 vehicles in December leading to a 70% drop in 2025, according to Mobility Sweden.

They also dropped in Portugal and Spain, by 13% to 1,207 cars and 44% to 1,794 respectively, official data showed. For 2025 as a whole, sales fell 22% in Portugal and 4% in Spain.

As we talked about above, Tesla's own numbers paint a bad picture. Fourth-quarter deliveries are down 15%, while full-year numbers are down 9%. Yet, while Tesla, the company that builds and sells cars, seems to be doing worse and worse every day, Tesla the stock is doing just fine. As of this writing, shares in $TSLA are actually up today despite the bad sales news.

Tesla's global sales decline has one exception, though: Norway. Of all countries, Europe's big oil exporter is the one that boosting Tesla sales, buoyed by a market that's gone almost entirely electric. Nearly every car sold in Norway in 2025 was an EV, and that rising tide lifted even Tesla's boat. From Reuters:

Almost all new cars registered in Norway last year were fully electric, official data showed on Friday, headed by booming Tesla sales as the Nordic country cements its global lead in phasing out petrol and diesel-powered vehicles.

Oil-producing Norway's rapid switch to battery-powered vehicles contrasts with the rest of Europe, where weak demand for EVs prompted the European Union last month to reverse its planned 2035 ban on internal combustion engine cars.

Driven by tax incentives, 95.9% of all new cars registered in Norway in 2025 were EVs, with that number at almost 98% in December. The annual figure was up from 88.9% in 2024, Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) data showed.

Norway is such an interesting case, because you'd expect such a major oil producer to be big on getting folks into cars that use oil. Turns out the country's pride in its natural beauty wins out, though, and EVs are heavily incentivized.

Germany has a whole market for company-provided cars, and new rules around how much those cars can cost are limiting the market. Enter Zeekr, which hopes to provide a better offering than Germany's own car companies for that specific market. From Automotive News:

Corporate cost ceilings are reshaping Germany's company-car market in ways that favor Chinese EV newcomers over established European brands.

As fleet program bosses impose a top limit of about €60,000 for company car leases while mandating rapid electrification, employees who traditionally pick an Audi or BMW now face a choice: accept lower-spec European EVs or consider Chinese alternatives with better range and features at the same price point.

Geely-owned Zeekr is betting this cost squeeze will overcome German buyers' historical preference for domestic brands. Unlike many Chinese rivals that have focused on retail buyers or rental fleets, Zeekr is prioritizing the corporate car market, particularly higher-margin company vehicles.

I can honestly say that I don't think anyone I know has ever had a company car. I've heard of them, obviously, I know they exist, but I don't think I've ever personally known anyone who's had one. Sounds like they're a much bigger deal over in Germany, if car companies are explicitly targeting them as a pricing strategy.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/teslas-bad-sales-year-means-byd-is-now-the-best-selling-ev-maker-in-the-world/l-intro-1767367731.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 11:59:07.033203

To get there, the Environmental Protection Agency has taken on an unexpected role. Instead of focusing first and foremost on protecting people and the environment, the EPA is increasingly focused on clearing the regulatory path for rapid growth in data centers, chip factories and other AI-related infrastructure.

That shift has created a striking imbalance.

The agency is sprinting in helping companies build the physical backbone of the AI economy but dragging its feet when it comes to using those same powerful tools to improve environmental protection and public health.

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA has positioned itself as a facilitator for the tech sector and the fossil fuel industry. Reviews of new chemicals are rushed, hurdles lowered for air pollution permits and approvals streamlined, all under the pretext of keeping the U.S. competitive.

The emphasis is clear: move fast.

This deregulatory zeal stands in stark contrast to the agency’s own lethargic embrace of AI to actually improve environmental and public health outcomes for communities across America.

So far, the EPA’s most visible efforts focus on basic office functions, such as sorting and summarizing public comments. These tools may save staff time, but they barely scratch the surface of what AI could do for the agency’s core work.

The same technologies that power large language models could help flag dangerous chemicals earlier, identify pollution hotspots more precisely or focus inspections where problems are most likely to occur. Instead, AI is largely being treated as a productivity aid, not a mission-critical tool.

This isn’t just a missed opportunity — it’s a growing risk. Companies across the economy are rapidly adopting AI to improve efficiency, predict failures and optimize complex systems. If the EPA doesn’t keep pace, it risks becoming a referee who no longer understands the speed of the game. In a fast-moving field, that kind of mismatch matters.

One way forward can be found in the agency’s own past.

Three decades ago, the EPA launched Project XL, an initiative that encouraged companies to try new approaches, as long as they could demonstrate better environmental results. Instead of following rigid rules, participating companies were allowed to experiment with innovative methods that delivered stronger outcomes. The idea was simple: reward better performance, not just box-checking. It was meant to be a new paradigm for environmental regulation and provide a way of moving state-of-the-art technology into the mainstream.

That effort ultimately faded, weighed down by complexity, high costs and concerns about oversight. But the core idea remains sound — and may be even more relevant in the age of AI.

A modern version of Project XL could invite companies to use AI in ways that go beyond minimum expectations. Instead of reacting after problems occur, companies could use predictive tools to prevent them. AI could help fine-tune emissions controls, better match clean energy supply with demand, reduce reliance on backup generators or detect leaks and equipment failures before they become serious. Pilot projects could also show how complex environmental and health data can be made clearer and more accessible to the public, helping communities better understand what’s happening around them.

For the EPA to truly play a constructive role in the AI era, it needs to do more than remove obstacles for industry and cut red tape.

Administrator Zeldin must empower the agency to use AI to defend the environment with the same zeal he applies to cutting the protections that safeguard it and our communities. A carefully designed, next-generation version of that earlier experiment could help the agency learn alongside the private sector, without losing sight of its public purpose.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%, as investors hope Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.

With global EV sales rising 28 per cent in 2025, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time on an annual basis, helped by rapid growth in Europe where the Chinese automaker has been widening its lead over the US rival.

The annual deliveries figure raises questions about whether Tesla can stabilise its core auto business following two consecutive years of sales declines, even as it pivots to futuristic projects such as robotics and self-driving cars to justify its steep valuation.

Tesla shares were marginally up in early trading.

“I think the market remains focused on the robotaxi business, where Tesla is testing its Cybercab in Austin,” said Mr Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar.

“If deliveries can continue to not be down too much in the coming quarters, I expect market sentiment around the robotaxi will continue to drive the stock,” Mr Goldstein added.

Tesla’s fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in US EV tax credits before they expired at the end of September, followed by a sharper slowdown as incentives rolled off.

EV demand has softened in the US since the end of September, when President Donald Trump’s administration ended US$7,500 (S$9,600) federal tax credits.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October–December quarter, down 15.6 per cent from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles or a 12.3 per cent drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles, marking the company’s second consecutive annual decline.

Intensifying competition

Analysts have said Tesla came under immense pressure in 2025 in North America and Europe, where competition intensified and the company faced brand backlash due to CEO Elon Musk’s political rhetoric.

Growing competition from Chinese firms and European automakers such as Volkswagen and BMW has weighed on Tesla’s sales momentum.

BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150 per cent from 2024. The company has said it aimed to sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about US$5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend sales volumes after the tax credit loss and appeal to customers in Europe looking for cheaper options.

The move disappointed some investors who had expected a larger price cut or a meaningfully new mass-market product.

The American company led by Elon Musk logged 418,227 deliveries in the final three months of the year, taking its full-year sales figure to around 1.64 million EVs.

This marked a drop in sales of more than eight percent compared with 2024.

A day prior, BYD said that it sold 2.26 million EVs last year.

Analysts had expected Tesla's sales in the final quarter to slow less, to 449,000, according to a FactSet consensus.

The pullback comes amid the elimination of a $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025, with industry watchers noting it will take time for EV demand to rebalance.

But even before then, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of US President Donald Trump and other far-right politicians.

Tesla has also been grappling with rising competition from BYD and other Chinese companies, and from European giants.

Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid cars, unveiled record EV sales in the past year on Thursday.

Known as ""Biyadi"" in Chinese -- or by the English slogan ""Build Your Dreams"" -- BYD was founded in 1995 and originally specialized in battery manufacturing.

The automotive juggernaut has come to dominate China's highly competitive market for new energy vehicles, a term used to describe various vehicles from fully electric ones to plug-in hybrids. China is the world's largest market for new energy vehicles.

BYD is now looking to expand its presence overseas, as increasingly price-wary consumption patterns in China weigh on profitability.

While BYD and other Chinese EV producers come up against hefty tariffs in the United States, the company's success is picking up in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and in Europe.

Tesla only narrowly beat BYD in annual EV sales in 2024, with US company's 1.79 million outpacing the latter's 1.76 million.

Nonetheless, Tesla shares ticked up in pre-market trading in New York on Friday.

Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities noted that Tesla's quarterly sales figure remained much better than some had speculated.

He flagged that the company faces a ""more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.""

Ives noted that the company still sees challenges obtaining certain regulatory approval in Europe, with sales potentially rebounding once the regulatory hurdles are cleared.

""Sales around smaller and emerging markets have started to see larger growth metrics than expectations which look to offset the declines in key regions like China and Europe,"" he added.

The 21,000-member, Scott City-based co-op beat out three large investor-owned utilities in Michigan, New York and New Jersey in the final round to win top honors in the utilities category of the 2025 Drive Electric Awards. The awards are given by Plug In America, a national, nonprofit organization that advocates for affordable, accessible EVs and charging stations.

“Though small, Wheatland Electric Cooperative leads with innovation—bridging the gap in rural America and proving no community is too small, too rural, or too remote to be part of the clean transportation future,” the group said in announcing the award.

Since 2021, WEC has installed three ChargePoint® Level 2 public charging stations—with two charging ports each—across an area where no chargers existed within a 100-mile radius. As of October, the stations have supported more than 1,500 charging sessions by nearly 670 different drivers. The co-op created them at its own expense.

“We’re in a part of the country that’s often overlooked, simply because we’re so rural,” said Shajia Donecker, the co-op’s multimedia specialist. “We are always striving to put our region on the EV maps, and I think Plug In America recognized that.”

The co-op also invites community members to test drive EVs at special events, which included a “Dine and Drive” lunch in 2024 in Great Bend that attracted 150 people for a free lunch and a chance to get behind the wheel of three different types of EVs.

The co-op brought its own two electric vehicles—a Hyundai Kona and a Ford F-150 Lightning—and an employe shared his Tesla Model Y. The co-op’s member services team won NRECA’s 2025 Service Excellence Gold Award for creating the “best external event.”

This year, the co-op held “EVs & Espressos” events at or near several local coffee shops, providing free coffee to help entice people to explore EVs as part of National Drive Electric Month.

“Our whole goal is to make EVs more approachable,” said Alli Conine, WEC’s director of member services and corporate communications. “When we give people those hands-on experiences, their perspectives change. We want them to have fun while learning more about EVs.”

EVs are still relatively scarce in the area and no local car dealers display them, making the co-op events the only chance many residents have to test drive an EV, Donecker said.

“We try to meet people where they are,” she said. “You get all kinds of reactions. Some people will say, ‘no, absolutely not, I don’t want anything to do with an EV.’ But you also get, ‘wow, I had no idea how much power an EV has.” About 99% of the time, the reaction is good after they get a chance to drive.”

WEC’s grassroots efforts have focused on EV “accessibility, reliability, and cost savings to resonate locally,” Plug In America said.

“Beyond consumers, Wheatland has provided training and education to first responders, chambers of commerce, and civic leaders. The co-op is also electrifying its fleet, mentoring cooperatives in Kansas and Oklahoma, and providing a replicable playbook for other rural coops across the U.S.”

EVXL’s Take I’ve been covering Tesla’s sales decline all year, from Q1’s 9% U.S. drop to October’s three-year China low to Europe’s 39% collapse.","I’ve spent a year documenting Tesla’s sales collapse across every major market, and this week’s numbers crystallize something prospective buyers need to understand: Tesla has told Wall Street it doesn’t need to sell more cars. For anyone shopping for an EV in 2026, that’s the most important signal in this entire earnings preview.

Tesla is expected to report approximately 440,900 Q4 deliveries on Friday, down 11% year-over-year, according to Bloomberg data. The company took the unusual step of publishing its own analyst consensus showing an even more pessimistic 15% decline to around 422,850 vehicles. This marks Tesla’s second consecutive year of declining deliveries while the global EV market grew roughly 25%.

Yet Tesla’s stock hit an all-time high on December 16, adding $915 billion in market capitalization in just eight months. The disconnect is the story.

The Numbers Wall Street Is Watching

Two years ago, analysts predicted Tesla would deliver more than 3 million vehicles in 2026. That estimate has collapsed to roughly 1.8 million. The company that once promised 50% annual growth is now bracing for flat to 5% growth at best.

“Investors have fully bought into his autonomous vision, which comes at a good time, as Tesla’s EV business will likely be flat to up 5 percent next year,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told Bloomberg. “At this point, Elon only needs the car business to stabilize over the next year to satisfy investors.”

Read that again. The car business just needs to “stabilize.” Not grow. Not improve. Not compete more aggressively on price. Just hold the line.

What This Means for Buyers

For anyone cross-shopping a Tesla against competitors, this investor-focused strategy has concrete implications. When a company explicitly signals that vehicle sales growth isn’t the priority, don’t expect aggressive pricing moves, significant model refreshes, or urgency to match the competition.

Tesla’s record Q3 deliveries of 497,099 vehicles were built entirely on buyers rushing to claim the $7,500 federal tax credit before it expired September 30. As we documented in November, October EV sales collapsed 24% the moment those incentives disappeared. Tesla responded with its most aggressive incentives ever, including 0% APR financing for 72 months and $0-down leases, essentially self-funding the subsidies taxpayers used to provide.

Those incentives couldn’t fully offset the structural demand shift. And now CEO Elon Musk himself has warned of “a few rough quarters” ahead.

BYD Has Already Won 2025

While Tesla’s sales declined, China’s BYD executed exactly the aggressive expansion we’ve been tracking. BYD confirmed 2.25 million battery-electric vehicle sales in 2025, a 28% increase year-over-year. Tesla’s expected 1.64 million represents an 8% decline.

This marks the first time BYD has outsold Tesla in annual BEV volume. The Chinese automaker had already beaten Tesla for four consecutive quarters heading into Q4, and analysts expect that streak to extend to five.

The contrast is stark: BYD grew 28% while Tesla shrank 8%. One company is fighting for market share with aggressive pricing and new models. The other is telling investors the car business just needs to hold steady.

As we reported last week, Tesla’s European market share has effectively halved in 2025, from 2.2% to 1.3%, while BYD and other Chinese manufacturers captured the customers Tesla lost.

The Robotaxi Bet

Tesla’s valuation now rests almost entirely on autonomous vehicle promises. The company launched an invite-only Robotaxi service in Austin in June with safety operators supervising each ride. Vehicles violated traffic laws on day one, drawing federal investigations, but investors shrugged off the safety concerns.

Tesla’s board proposed a new compensation package for Musk in September potentially worth $1 trillion, tied to milestones including delivering millions of robotaxis. This week, Musk confirmed Tesla has begun testing truly driverless rides in Austin without safety operators.

Meanwhile, California regulators are threatening to suspend Tesla’s sales license for 30 days over allegations the company misled consumers about Full Self-Driving capabilities. Tesla has 60 days to rebrand “Autopilot” or face the suspension in its largest U.S. market.

The irony isn’t lost: Tesla’s stock hit all-time highs on autonomous driving promises the same week a judge ruled the company’s marketing of those features was deceptive.

The Bigger Picture: Legacy Automakers Are Retreating

Some Tesla bulls see a silver lining in the post-subsidy chaos. Ford announced a staggering $19.5 billion writedown on December 15, the largest EV-related charge in Detroit history, as it abandons the fully electric F-150 Lightning and kills planned EV models. General Motors took a $1.6 billion charge in October and warned more would follow.

The argument: as legacy automakers retreat from EVs, Tesla and other pure-play EV makers will capture share from a smaller but less contested market.

The counterargument: that smaller market is getting demolished by Chinese competition that isn’t retreating at all. BYD is opening factories in Hungary, Brazil, and Thailand. It’s eating Tesla’s lunch in Europe and dominating China. The retreat of Ford and GM doesn’t mean Tesla wins by default; it means the U.S. cedes the global EV race to China.

EVXL’s Take

I’ve been covering Tesla’s sales decline all year, from Q1’s 9% U.S. drop to October’s three-year China low to Europe’s 39% collapse. This Bloomberg piece crystallizes something that’s been building for months: Tesla has made a strategic choice to prioritize robotaxis and AI over the car business.

For investors betting on autonomous vehicle breakthroughs, that might be the right call. For someone shopping for an EV today, it’s a warning sign.

Here’s what I expect: Tesla’s Q4 numbers will come in around 410,000 to 430,000 units. The company will pivot the narrative entirely to robotaxi progress, FSD adoption rates, and energy storage growth. Vehicle deliveries will be framed as “stabilizing” rather than declining. And the stock will probably go up anyway.

But if you’re a prospective buyer hoping Tesla will respond to BYD’s pricing pressure with more competitive vehicles, this earnings preview is telling you not to hold your breath. The company has explicitly told Wall Street it doesn’t need to sell more cars.

Believe them.

While other states have filed lawsuits in an effort to keep their funding, South Carolina did not.","South Carolina lawmakers and utility executives have been grappling with how to meet the state’s growing power needs. But the state has been slow to make use of federal programs that aid the energy crunch from another direction — by reducing the amount of power used.

That could change, pending final approval from the U.S. Department of Energy.

South Carolina’s Energy Office is expected to award the operator contract for a pair of consumer rebate programs by Jan. 14, according to a state procurement notice, nearly 3½ years after the passage of the Biden administration’s hallmark clean energy package that funded them.

How long it will take for the state’s $137 million share to go out after the contractor is chosen remains to be seen. The federal energy agency has left other states in limbo for months.

What the programs do

The Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program reimburses up to $14,000 to low- and middle-income residents who install high-efficiency electric appliances in their homes.

Another program is available to homeowners of all income levels. The Home Efficiency Rebates program, dubbed HOMES, pays for home improvements. That could include insulating and sealing homes or installing smart thermostats that automatically reduce heating and cooling use during hours when no one is home.

While any homeowner can apply for HOMES, low-income families are allowed the biggest rebates. Caps range from $2,000 to $16,000, depending on applicants’ income and their project’s estimated energy savings.

Renters may be eligible for either program with written permission from the property owner, according to the state Energy Office.

And residents that meet income eligibility, earning no more than one and a half times the area median income for their county, can apply for funding under both programs. To qualify for appliance rebates in Richland County, for example, a household income can’t exceed $139,000. In Charleston County, the income cap is about $166,000. In Greenville County, it’s about $146,000.

South Carolina’s share of the federal funding package is to be split almost evenly between the two programs, according to a database maintained by Atlas Public Policy, a Washington, D.C., climate policy research firm.

Where the programs stand

A handful of states had fully executed contracts and access to funding before President Joe Biden left office. Five states, including North Carolina and Georgia, as well as Washington, D.C., already have both programs in place, according to the database. Seven other states have at least one of the programs in operation.

North Carolina’s programs have been running since Jan. 16, 2025. Georgia started with a pilot program in November 2024 and began full operations in March 2025.

As of Dec. 2, 2025, Georgia had paid out $1.9 million total to 184 households under the appliance-rebate program. Its HOMES program had awarded 684 households a total of $7.1 million, according to the state’s online dashboard.

North Carolina is rolling its programs out one county at a time. As of June 13, the state had received more than 4,100 applications.

But the U.S. Department of Energy has slow-walked a review of Biden-era funding, leaving the remaining 36 states and five territories that applied wondering whether their share of funding will actually come.

South Carolina’s Energy Office started the application process near the end of September 2023, which included opting to participate. Nearly 1½ years later, in mid-January 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy gave the initial funding nod, but the state still had to come up with a plan for how to give those funds out and what to focus the spending on.

Five days later, President Donald Trump took office.

On day one, the president signed an executive order freezing clean energy-related funding in the previous administration’s massive energy and infrastructure laws. This threw the future of the two energy efficiency programs into question, alongside several other initiatives, including grants for solar programs that help low-income communities and funding to expand the availability of public electric vehicle chargers along the U.S. interstate system.

In early June, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright told a U.S. House energy panel that his agency’s review was ongoing.

“By the end of this summer or middle of this summer, we are going to have clarity on most of the big projects,” Wright said.

But where the energy efficiency rebates fit into that review is unclear, and nothing appears to have changed since that hearing.

South Carolina joined the queue near the end of July, submitting its plan for final approval.

While the Energy Office is prepared to select a contractor, it too will remain on hold until federal sign-offs resume.

Other programs

As for those other energy-related programs, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced in August it was terminating a $124 million Solar For All grant won by South Carolina’s Office of Resilience. While other states have filed lawsuits in an effort to keep their funding, South Carolina did not.

The state Office of Resilience was still in its first year of planning when the funding was pulled, so the agency had yet to work out details for spending the grant.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin pointed to a provision in Republican’s “One, Big, Beautiful” spending package repealing the fund that housed the money.

​“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program, or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to social media.

The provision applied only to “unobligated” funds, however, and the states suing to hold on to the money argue the environmental agency had awarded all $7 billion of the program’s grant money.

SC can restart electric vehicle charging program after federal funding restored

Court battles also took place earlier in 2025 over electric vehicle charging funds.

The Federal Highway Administration stopped sending out dollars for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, known as NEVI, in February.

Twenty states, the District of Columbia and half a dozen environmental groups sued the Trump administration over the paused funding. The money remained on ice until a federal judge, in June, ordered the freeze be lifted.

So power prices are going to go up, with data center power growth as a major cause.""
A huge, noisy, visually intrusive data center right next to homes can depress nearby residential values; we’ve seen that concern in fast-growing data center hubs in Virginia and Texas,"" he said.","As data center proposals accelerate across Northwest Indiana, residents are packing council chambers and planning meetings to raise concerns about water use, energy demand, noise and environmental impacts — issues local officials must weigh as developers seek approvals for projects tied to the region’s growing role in the digital economy.

The massive facilities that store, process and transmit digital information are expanding rapidly nationwide to support artificial intelligence, or AI, as well as streaming, e-commerce and cloud services. Northwest Indiana has emerged as an attractive location because of its access to power, water and industrial land, putting local governments on the front lines of decisions that could reshape land use, utility systems and environmental oversight for decades.

Experts say the impacts of data centers can vary widely depending on their design and scale. Many of the largest proposed projects are hyperscale data centers built to support the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, said Isak Nti Asare, executive director of the Indiana University Cybersecurity Clinic. Other types include colocation data centers rented by multiple companies, edge data centers designed to reduce latency, and private facilities that serve individual organizations such as hospitals. Dimitrios Nikolopoulos, the John W. Hancock Professor of engineering at Virginia Tech, whose state is home to one of the country's highest concentrations of data centers in what's become known as Data Center Alley, said data centers aren't one-size-fits-all.

""They range from sprawling hyperscale campuses — think the size of several football fields — to compact, container-sized outdoor installations or enterprise sites. Hyperscale facilities can draw 100 MW or more, comparable to the electricity use of tens of thousands of homes, and can reshape land use, soak up local grid capacity, and place big demands on water supplies,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""On the other end of the spectrum, smaller, distributed 'mini' or outdoor centers can tuck into industrial parks or campus corners, with a lighter physical footprint and more modest infrastructure needs. Personally, I think we should encourage a shift toward many smaller, nimble facilities that sit close to where data is generated and used— not just a handful of mega-farms isolated in the middle of nowhere.""

More data centers are being built to keep up with the demand for e-commerce, streaming, social media, gaming and other uses, Asare said. AI in particular has created more demand at a rapid pace, but more data center capacity is also needed to handle the increased volume of traffic websites like Amazon are getting, he said.

""Data centers are the underlying infrastructure of the digital age,"" Asare said. ""The scale of computing power is increasing so rapidly.""

Tech giants are building larger data centers not only because of the growing demand for data but also because it's more efficient and cost-effective to build one large data center rather than several small data centers, Asare said. Despite price tags that run into hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars to build them, massive data centers reduce the per-unit cost, he said.

The impact on local communities and the environment can vary widely, depending on the size and scope, as well as on how the data center is powered and cooled, Nikolopoulos said.

""When it comes to environmental impact, cooling, power, and siting are the big levers. Air-cooled sites in hot, dry places can gulp down a lot of energy — and often water — while modern liquid or immersion cooling can sharply cut both energy and noise. Companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are already pushing chip-level and liquid-cooling designs that reduce water use and cooling energy for AI data centers,"" Nikolopoulos said.

He added that data centers that combine efficient liquid-cooling systems with renewable energy and are located on already developed industrial land can significantly reduce environmental impacts. Locating near existing substations or industrial zones also means less strain on the grid and less need for new construction, he said.

""We’re also going to see them being more aggressive on-chip cooling, tiny fluid channels built into the silicon, 3D-stacked packages with integrated liquid loops, and phase-change materials near hot spots,"" said Nikolopoulos. ""That helps pull heat directly from the source, so you can pack far more AI compute into each rack while shrinking everything else: size, noise and energy use included.""

How much water and power will data centers use?

Residents have raised concerns that data centers can consume huge quantities of water. Asare said there's wide variation in how much water data centers use, depending largely on design. Data centers that use evaporative methods are a cause for concern, but in most cases the water is discharged after it's used for cooling, he said.

A closed-loop cooling system is ideal, as it ensures all the water is returned to the source, Asare said. Local governments need to look at putting in requirements about water usage during the permitting process, to ensure, for instance, that it's discharged back to the source and not allowed to evaporate, he said.

Data centers use so much water that they can put stress on aquifers, but likely would not do much to drain abundant sources of water like Lake Michigan, Asare said.

Hyperscale data centers can guzzle significant amounts of water, but can be designed to minimize water consumption, Nikolopoulos said.

""Big data centers can be very thirsty — especially those using evaporative cooling in hot climates — but actual water use depends heavily on design and location. A typical large hyperscale facility can consume on the order of a few hundred thousand gallons of water per day for cooling, and some proposed or extreme cases are in the millions of gallons per day, comparable to a town of tens of thousands of people,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""By contrast, air-cooled or closed-loop liquid systems can drive direct cooling water use close to zero in many climates, and Microsoft’s latest designs aim for zero water cooling for AI-heavy sites. Personally, I think any new data center, especially in water-stressed regions, should stick to strict water budgets or go water-free entirely, and smaller, high-density systems make this much more practical.""

A common concern among residents is that data centers will drain groundwater or harm Lake Michigan, the main source of drinking water for the Chicago metro area which is home to around 9.5 million people. Since data centers use water strictly to cool computer servers, the main source of pollution is heat, Asare said. Data centers discharge heated water back into the source, which can adversely affect aquatic life.

Steady discharges can raise temperatures, making it uncomfortable for fish and plant life.

""The biggest worries are about heat and treatment chemicals from cooling systems getting into local water, or pulling so much water that it disrupts local hydrology. Poorly managed facilities could warm rivers or lakes or leak biocides and anti-corrosion chemicals if discharge isn’t tightly controlled,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""Around major freshwater bodies like the Great Lakes, some proposed data center projects have raised alarms for their planned withdrawals from sources like Lake Michigan and their potential impacts on already stressed watersheds. In those locations, I’d push for strict regulation, closed-loop or low-water cooling wherever possible, and clear, public monitoring of every withdrawal and discharge. Opting for smaller, modular centers that use little or no water is a much safer bet.""

What do data centers mean for utilities and land use?

Residents who spoke at meetings earlier this year in Starke County said they worry about energy consumption and how data centers could drive up electric bills. Data centers consume vast quantities of power, Asare said. They currently use around 5% of the nation's electricity, a figure that's expected to skyrocket to 12% by 2028, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Data centers often will require new infrastructure, such as new electric power generation and new transmission lines, Asare said. Agreements are needed to ensure the data center operators foot those costs to spare ratepayers, he said. Renewable energy power purchase agreements can require that wind and solar be used to minimize the carbon footprint.

They tend to consume large amounts of energy, due in part to running around the clock 24/7, Asare said.

Large data centers typically require the addition of new electric capacity generation. NIPSCO, for instance, plans to build 3 GW of new capacity to accommodate Amazon Web Services' plans for a major data center campus in Hobart.

""Data centers pack a serious energy punch, and a big facility can quickly drive up local electricity demand if the grid isn’t ready for it. For example, a 100-MW hyperscale campus can use as much power as tens of thousands to around 100,000 households, putting real pressure on regional grids,"" Nikolopoulos said.

High energy usage and new infrastructure costs can be passed on to existing ratepayers, depending on how the data centers are handled.

""My preference? Spread things out with lots of smaller, efficient edge or enterprise centers that fit the local grid, team up with renewables or waste-heat users (for example, feeding heat into district networks), and actively work with utilities,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""That way, they can be flexible, grid-friendly neighbors — not giant, inflexible energy hogs.""

Residents express fears that data centers will drive up electric bills, which have been soaring in Northwest Indiana and around the nation. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports electricity costs have jumped by 7.4% over the past year.

""Data centers are driving increased investment by utilities in generation, transmission and energy storage,"" University of Chicago Professor of Computer Science Andrew A. Chien said. ""These investments must be covered by the ratepayers, and there is also increased competition for power. There are several examples of areas where auctions for future power supplies have already jumped dramatically — showing increases to come. So power prices are going to go up, with data center power growth as a major cause.""

Studies that have not found a correlation between data centers and increased energy bills are flawed, Chien said.

""While done by good researchers, these studies are backward looking and don't accurately capture the macro effects that data center power growth is driving increased power prices,"" he said.

Can communities limit noise and light impacts?

Noise pollution has also been brought before city councils and other local officials. Data centers do generate an audible hum that varies depending on the size, Asare said. Fan, cooling equipment and backup generators all can create noise. Experts say it can be mitigated with shrubbery, building setbacks and other techniques to minimize the effect on neighbors.

Many municipalities have noise regulations that require 45 decibels or fewer at night and could seek to further regulate data centers to ensure they don't disrupt nearby homes or neighborhoods, Asare said.

The volume of noise can vary depending on the size of the data center and it can be mitigated, Nikolopoulos said.

""Traditional air-cooled data centers can be pretty noisy, especially when they’re big and running at full tilt — you’ll often hear a steady low hum from fans and chillers,"" he said. ""This is typically in the 60 to 75 decibel range at the fence line, comparable to loud conversation or busy street noise. But this isn’t inevitable. With smart building design, acoustic barriers and newer cooling methods like direct liquid cooling (which reduces reliance on huge air handlers), noise can be dialed way down. Small, outdoor, or modular centers are even easier to make quiet, as long as noise is treated as a top-tier design constraint from the start.""

Light

Residents, especially those who live in rural areas, have said they worry about light emanating from data centers, including at public hearings in Starke and Porter counties. Security or perimeter lights are not unique to data centers and could be found on any comparable commercial or industrial building, Asare said. Barriers of shrubs and other techniques can be required to shield neighbors. Communities could require warmer colors, mandate motion control or ban stadium-style lighting during the review process, he said.

The lighting is akin to what one might find on a large building like a supermarket, home improvement or big box store, Nikolopoulos said.

""Most of the visible light impact comes from security lighting, not from the servers themselves,"" he said. ""Poorly designed sites can create light pollution that annoys neighbors and confuses wildlife, but this is a very solvable problem. With shielded fixtures, downward-facing LEDs, and smart lighting controls, a data center can be almost invisible after dark — something already implemented at many Nordic and campus-style sites. Smaller, spread-out centers are easier to blend into their surroundings with thoughtful lighting than massive, highly visible campuses.""

What is the impact on property values?

Hammond residents earlier this year expressed worry about data centers sinking property values. Asare said data centers could affect the resaleability of a home if it was close enough, but would not necessarily affect the value, merely the perception among some buyers. Having one in the community could end up being a boon for property values if it resulted in more tech companies and jobs, increasing the economic opportunity in town, he said.

Nikolopoulos said it comes down to location, location, location.

""Property values depend a lot on context. A huge, noisy, visually intrusive data center right next to homes can depress nearby residential values; we’ve seen that concern in fast-growing data center hubs in Virginia and Texas,"" he said. ""Put the same facility in an industrial or commercial zone with good buffers and design, and it can have neutral or even positive effects through job creation and a stronger tax base. Personally, I think the smart move is to keep the very large sites away from neighborhoods and focus on smaller, human-scale edge or enterprise centers that fit naturally into mixed-use or commercial areas.""

How will data centers affect nearby neighborhoods?

Residents also fear new development will disrupt wildlife habitats, driving out deer, turtles, birds and other fauna. The four homeowners who sued to block data centers in Hobart specifically raised concerns about migrating birds and families of deer that frequent their properties. Data centers could fragment habitats, but no more than any other massive development would, Asare said. The night lighting could affect nocturnal species like owls, birds could vary their migration patterns and discharges could affect heat levels, affecting aquatic life.

Locating data centers in already developed areas instead of greenfield sites can help preserve habitats for flora and fauna, Nikolopoulos said. Data centers in Scandinavia minimize impact on the natural environment with careful siting, low-noise cooling and dark-sky lighting.

""Wildlife feels the effects of data centers mostly through land conversion, noise, heat, light, and water use,"" he said. ""Building a large campus on undeveloped land can fragment habitats and disrupt migration routes. By contrast, compact, modular centers sited on already-developed sites — parking lots, brownfields, rooftops, or former industrial properties — cause very little additional habitat loss.""

Water stewardship in pharmaceutical operations Access to clean water remains fundamental to both public health outcomes and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.","The pharmaceutical sector faces mounting pressure to demonstrate environmental responsibility alongside clinical innovation.

As healthcare systems worldwide grapple with the dual challenges of expanding access and reducing carbon footprints, pharmaceutical manufacturers are increasingly recognising that patient outcomes cannot be separated from planetary health.

Merck (known as MSD in the UK) exemplifies this shift in thinking.

The global healthcare and pharmaceutical company is working to align its net-zero commitments with its core mission of improving patient care.

""Our purpose to save and improve lives is inextricably linked to fostering a healthy planet. It is why we embed our commitment to enabling a safe, sustainable and healthy future within our Corporate Strategic Framework,"" says the company.

Renewable energy in healthcare manufacturing

Healthcare manufacturing requires significant energy inputs, from maintaining sterile production environments to powering cold chain logistics for biologics and vaccines.

Merck is addressing this challenge by reducing energy demand whilst simultaneously increasing renewable energy use.

The company's renewable footprint is expanding through Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs), long-term contracts that help bring new clean energy projects online.

Over the past five years, Merck has secured 209 megawatts (MW) of VPPA commitments across North America (118 MW) and Europe (91 MW), with its second US VPPA beginning operation in 2024 and a new solar project in Spain commencing in the second quarter of 2025.

""Our long-standing commitment and focus on advancing access to health, operating responsibly and implementing strategies that protect the health of people, animals and the planet is unwavering,"" says Robert M. Davis, Chairman and CEO of Merck.

""As we continue to navigate the rapid pace of change happening all around us, I am proud of the progress we've made thus far and I remain optimistic about our future.""

Merck has committed to sourcing 100% of purchased electricity from renewable energy by 2025 and has reached 61% to date.

The organisation is working towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across global operations by 2045, aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative, supported by more than 400 supplier partnerships.

As of late 2024, Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 16% below its 2019 baseline, while Scope 3 emissions were 6% below baseline, with a target of a 30% reduction by 2030.

Water stewardship in pharmaceutical operations

Access to clean water remains fundamental to both public health outcomes and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.

""Water is a key input to our manufacturing operations and we assess water risk throughout our network as a standard business practice,"" says Merck.

The company's global water strategy supports United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 on clean water and sanitation.

This includes ensuring wastewater discharges meet local and national standards, understanding and controlling its operational water footprint, managing water risk at facilities and within the supply chain and reporting publicly on water use and goals.

Merck's Water Management Standard requires sites to comply with relevant regulations, minimise discharge-related impacts and identify water reduction opportunities.

Reduction measures include integrating water considerations into process design, optimising cooling systems, recovering and reusing steam condensate and 'reject water' for non-potable applications and optimising process water purification systems.

Biodiversity protection and healthcar

Merck recognises that protecting and restoring nature and biodiversity is essential to a healthy planet and the company's long-term growth because nature provides critical ecosystem services such as air and water purification and genetic resources for medicines.

The company supports biodiversity by monitoring species, improving its understanding of wild populations, survival rates and migration patterns.

Merck also aids in providing medicines, vaccines and technologies that advance aquaculture and conservation, alongside solutions that protect species ranging from salmon and sturgeon to sea turtles, penguins and bats.

Over the past eight years, Merck has invested annually in habitat restoration and reforestation projects linked to its UN CEO Water Mandate Commitment, working with partners such as The Nature Conservancy and One Tree Planted.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/332efb18e0661afdf153e9545dbbc90e:61fa549e32a18fbcacb4640bbf0a7bf6/msd-main.webp.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:59:17.361797

The company was also out-sold by China-based chief rival BYD, which is likely the biggest seller of EVs for 2025

Tesla's rough year took it to its second straight annual sales decline.

Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker on Friday posted deliveries well below Wall Street's already-low expectations.

Austin, Texas-based Tesla (TSLA) said it delivered 418,227 vehicles to customers between October and December, compared with the 440,000 expected by Wall Street, according to FactSet estimates. Earlier this week, the company published a consensus of sell-side analyst expectations that forecast 422,850 units sold. Compared with a year earlier, Tesla's December quarter sales dropped 16%.

For 2025, Tesla's sold 1.63 million vehicles, falling short of the 1.78 million vehicles it delivered in 2024 and the 1.8 million sold in 2023. It's the company's second straight annual decline. When Tesla in 2024 failed to match its 2023 performance, it was the company's first year-over-year sales drop since 2011.

On Thursday, Tesla rival BYD said its sales of battery electric vehicles rose 27% to 2.25 million, while plug-in hybrid car sales fell 7% to 2.25 million. The Chinese automaker's unaudited results would make it the biggest global seller of battery-powered vehicles for 2025.

Earlier: China's BYD just raised the bar on EV sales. Tesla may struggle to catch up.

Tesla shares were up by almost 2% in premarket trading after the company's sales announcement.

Tesla sold 406,585 Model Y sport-utility vehicles and Model 3 sedans, which overwhelmingly account for the bulk of its sales, last quarter. The company also sold 11,642 other vehicles, which it groups together when reporting deliveries. That includes the Model X SUV, Model S sedan and Cybertruck pickup truck.

Last year saw Tesla struggle in Europe after consumers rejected the company, largely over Musk's embrace of far-right political figures. It's also been losing market share to expanding Chinese automakers scooping up market share in Europe and China.

Sales in the U.S. got a boost in the third quarter as consumers took advantage of tax credits that expired at the end of September. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, estimates that added 55,000 deliveries to Tesla's record quarter that would have otherwise been spread through the following two quarters.

Analysts expect U.S. electric car sales to be slightly weaker over the next few quarters as affordability remains a barrier for some consumers to purchase EVs. That will impact EV sellers across the industry, although some expect Tesla to ultimately benefit.

""Only brands with strong products, cost discipline, and loyalty are positioned to keep/gain [market] share. That's a good thing for Tesla,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas in Dec. 22 note to investors.

Despite the company's focus on artificial-intelligence, the EV business still accounts for the majority of Tesla's revenue. Analysts expect Tesla to report $70.8 billion in automotive revenue for 2025, down from $77 billion a year earlier, according to FactSet estimates.

Tesla on Friday also said it delivered a record 14.2 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products in the December quarter, showing the growth of its energy business. Its previous record was set in the third quarter of 2025, when it deployed 12.5 GWh of energy storage products.

____ This story has been corrected to show that BYD sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, not 2.26.","NEW YORK (AP) — Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for Musk who once dismissed BYD as a threat as Tesla’s rise seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make him the world’s richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering. ____

Global electricity demand is now rising far faster than overall energy consumption.
As Birol noted, electricity demand growth, rooted for decades in household appliances, industrial processes, and air conditioning, is now being accelerated by “artificial intelligence, air conditioners, and electric cars driving further the global electricity demand growth.” However, the scale of the shift is unprecedented.
While electricity still accounts for roughly 20% of global final energy use, it already “supplies energy to more than 40% of the global economy,” he said.

The world has firmly crossed into the “Age of Electricity.” That is a unifying finding in the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) 2025 edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO), which shows a global power sector being reshaped simultaneously by surging demand, a geographic pivot in consumption, record solar manufacturing capacity, a wave of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export development, heightened energy security concerns, and a widening gap between generation deployment and grid readiness.

1. The Age of Electricity. As IEA Executive Director Dr. Fatih Birol observed at the report’s launch, the shift reflects the sector’s rapid pivot away from a period dominated by fossil fuel price volatility and post-pandemic overcapacity toward structurally accelerating electricity demand. For years, “IEA has been saying that the electricity demand is growing very strongly among all the fuels, and recently we said the world may enter the age of electricity, and looking at the data today in the WEO I think we can comfortably say that the age of electricity has arrived,” Birol said.

Global electricity demand is now rising far faster than overall energy consumption. Demand has already increased near 3% per year over the past decade, almost twice the growth rate of total energy demand, and accelerated to more than 4% in 2024. Under the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)—which reflects current and announced government policies (without assuming future targets are achieved)—electricity consumption expands by nearly 1,000 TWh annually through 2035, driven by growing industrial electrification, rising appliance ownership, expanding cooling demand, electric vehicles (EVs), and data center growth. As Birol noted, electricity demand growth, rooted for decades in household appliances, industrial processes, and air conditioning, is now being accelerated by “artificial intelligence, air conditioners, and electric cars driving further the global electricity demand growth.”

However, the scale of the shift is unprecedented. While electricity still accounts for roughly 20% of global final energy use, it already “supplies energy to more than 40% of the global economy,” he said. IEA Director of Sustainability, Technology, and Outlooks Laura Cozzi further underscored the cumulative magnitude: “Electricity demand growth from now to 2035 is nearly identical in our STEPS and [Current Policies Scenario (CPS)],” which sets out a pathway for the future of the energy system in which there is no change in energy-related policies scenarios, she said. “The electricity demand growth is 10,000 TWh—the electricity that is consumed today in the U.S., Canada, all of Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia, all advanced economies, combined. That’s added in just 10 years. This is a very, very big shift that will demand a lot of investment and planning.”

2. Geographic Pivot—China to India, Southeast Asia. However, the report suggests the global center of electricity demand growth is shifting decisively away from China toward India and Southeast Asia, driven by stark demographic divergence and evolving consumption patterns. “China has reached a peak in population, and we are expecting that by 2035, China will have around 50 million people less than today, reaching the type of demographic structure that we see in advanced economies such as Japan or Italy,” Cozzi said. At the same time, she noted, “We are seeing this passing of the baton to other emerging economies—to India and Southeast Asia, where we receive 230 million more people living there.” The consumer transition is already evident: “Over 50% of car sales in the next decade will happen in emerging and developing economies outside of China—a very profound shift compared to the past decade where this was happening in China.”

Investment flows, however, remain uneven. In the U.S., enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has tightened foreign-content rules and revised tax credits affecting clean power, carbon capture, EVs, efficiency programs, and critical minerals. Globally, total energy investment reached $3.3 trillion in 2025 (more than 20% greater than 2015 levels) and is now roughly two-thirds directed toward low-emissions technologies, primarily driven by energy security concerns. Yet most capital remains concentrated in China, the U.S., and Europe, while Africa and Latin America continue to lag despite accelerating demand. Southeast Asia, notably, stands out as a fast-emerging growth pole, with electricity consumption rising 7% to 1,300 TWh in 2024 and projected to reach 2,100 TWh by 2035, driving new generation additions across natural gas, coal, wind, solar, and storage.

3. Reshaping the Electricity Mix—All Fuels in Transition. The global power-generation mix is undergoing a rapid structural shift across all fuel types. Under the IEA’s STEPS (Figure 1), the share of fossil fuels in electricity is slated to fall from about 60% in 2024 to below 40% by 2035, and to just 20% by mid-century. Renewables, now roughly one-third of global generation, surpass 50% by 2035 and exceed two-thirds by 2050, driven primarily by wind and solar, whose combined share rises from 15% today to 40% by 2035 and 55% by 2050.

Nuclear will maintain a steady share—just under 10% of global generation—supported by uprates, plant restarts, and new construction, particularly in the U.S., France, and Japan. After two decades of stagnation, global nuclear capacity is projected to expand by at least one-third by 2035, with more than 70 GW currently under construction worldwide, among the highest build rates in 30 years. In advanced economies, nuclear accounts for nearly 10% of incremental electricity demand growth to 2035, while generation in emerging market and developing economies is expected to roughly double over the same period as countries look to firm low-emissions supply alongside variable renewables.

The report suggests, crucially, that in advanced economies, low-emissions power generation could grow about 50% faster than electricity demand through 2035, while in emerging economies (where power demand is slated to climb roughly 50% over the period), low-emissions sources could expand even faster. China accounts for two-thirds of the increase. Coal remains the most significant single power source in developing markets by 2035, despite declining utilization, while gas-fired generation continues to grow to provide flexible capacity.

Still, solar is slated to remain the dominant growth technology within that transition. “Solar is going to play a pivotal role here,” Birol said. “Big growth coming from solar. It is also important to see that the bulk of electricity demand growth will come from countries where we see a huge amount of solar radiation—solar-rich countries.” Solar supplies about 60% of incremental demand growth across emerging economies, but integration challenges are mounting. “Curtailment of wind and solar output is on the rise, as are incidences of negative pricing in wholesale markets, but slow permitting is holding back grid projects,” he said. At the same time, supply chains are outpacing deployment: “In 2024, there was sufficient manufacturing capacity to have produced more than twice as many solar PV modules as were actually deployed, and almost three times as many battery cells.”

4. Gas Power’s Resurgence—and the LNG Wave. The global natural gas market, meanwhile, is being reshaped both by record LNG investment and by a sharp rebound in gas-fired power generation across fast-growing electricity regions. As IEA Chief Energy Economist Tim Gould noted, “2025 has been a really remarkable year for approvals of new LNG export facilities. This year we’ve seen almost 100 billion cubic meters [Bcm] worth of new export projects approved—just short of the all-time record we saw in 2019.” He added, “If we stack up all of those existing and new projects from the U.S., Qatar, Canada, and elsewhere, we have 300 billion cubic meters of new capacity coming onto the market.”

Bolstering the build-out is rapidly rising demand for gas-fired electricity. In emerging Asia alone, about 35% of incremental natural gas demand through 2035 comes from the power sector, supporting nearly 270 GW of new gas generation capacity—an increase of about 70% over current levels. China is slated to add roughly 200 Bcm of new demand, while India could nearly double it to 140 Bcm by 2035, driven largely by power generation and city-gas expansion. The Middle East contributes another 240 Bcm of demand growth linked primarily to electricity and industrial use. LNG has already overtaken pipelines as the dominant mode of long-distance gas trade, with supply flows increasingly aimed at these growth markets.

Lower prices will help to bring gas into markets like India, where imports double to 2030, and Southeast Asia, where they triple, Gould said. Still, “That is not enough to absorb all of the new LNG that’s coming to market in the STEPS,” Gould warned. He added, “There’s really ample potential for more coal-to-gas switching, but the sorts of prices you would need to make that switch an economic proposition are very difficult for LNG exporters to match.”

5. Energy Security & Critical Minerals. The WEO finds energy security now extends beyond fuel supply to the mineral and technology supply chains essential to modern power systems. In 2024, 91% of rare earth element refining occurred in a single country, and even if all planned projects are completed, that share would fall only to 75% by 2035. China remains the dominant refiner for 19 of 20 strategic energy minerals, while the top three producers control an average 86% of global refining capacity, creating growing vulnerability across clean-energy supply chains.

“Even if we assume that all projects that are planned or under construction are implemented successfully, this 91% goes only to 75% in 10 years—still a very big concentration in one country,” Birol warned. As electrification accelerates worldwide, he added, “Energy security is now similar at the same level as economic security and national security in many cases.”

6. System Integration & Flexibility. Finally, as generation capacity surges worldwide, grid investment and system flexibility are struggling to keep pace. “Investments in electricity generation have charged ahead by almost 70% since 2015 to reach $1 trillion per year, but annual grid spending has risen at less than half the pace to $400 billion,” the WEO notes. Operational friction is mounting, it suggests. Growing curtailment and negative pricing signal widening system integration constraints, while accelerating battery deployment addresses short-term needs but remains insufficient to meet rising seasonal flexibility requirements.

And, while storage is scaling rapidly, it remains only a partial solution. “Battery storage additions rose to more than 75 GW in 2024, but batteries cannot provide all the answers—especially where seasonal flexibility needs rise alongside short-term ones.” Additional flexibility is expected from consumers: “Demand response activation grows more than threefold by 2035, driven by participation from buildings and transport sectors through smart air conditioners, heat pumps, and EVs.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/lightbulb-pixabay-1024x683.png,N,,2026-01-02 09:58:52.951364

Tax credits and financing Helene costs will help mitigate energy bill changes beginning in 2026

GREENVILLE, S.C., Jan. 2, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Beginning in January, Duke Energy will implement changes to customer bills that reflect investments made to recover from the historic damage from Hurricane Helene, strengthen the grid against storms and outages, maintain and upgrade its power generating fleet, and serve a growing customer base while supporting economic growth in South Carolina.

Our view: ""Duke Energy is committed to meeting the expectations our customers have around reliability, responsiveness and value – striking the right balance that delivers these at the lowest possible cost for customers,"" said Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president. ""That means investing in what matters, delivering results efficiently, and remaining transparent about what customers are paying for and why.""

The Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) recently approved these updates for customers of Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP), the company's two utilities in the state.

Recovering from Helene: Securitization – selling low-interest, long-term bonds – is one way Duke Energy can generate savings and keep costs lower for customers while also recovering large and unexpected expenses like those that resulted from Hurricane Helene. The PSCSC recently approved a securitization plan that will save DEC customers more than $140 million on Helene expenses.

Beginning in January, a typical residential DEC customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per month will see a new storm charge on bills reflecting a 3.2% increase, or $4.58. This modest increase still delivers 20% savings for customers over the recovery period compared to traditional cost recovery methods.

""We appreciate the legislature providing tools like securitization to address extreme storm costs as we continue to pursue ways to reduce these impacts on customer bills,"" Pearson said.

Powering growth, driving reliability: Duke Energy has made investments in the things our customers expect: upgrades to strengthen the grid, improve reliability and storm resilience, and maintain and upgrade our generation fleet. These investments are already in place and delivering benefits to South Carolina, from faster restoration times to improved reliability and operational efficiency.

For example, as part of ongoing grid upgrades, Duke Energy has nearly tripled the number of South Carolina customers served by self-healing technology over the past two years, with more than 70% of customers now benefiting from this innovative automated power restoration tool.

""Meeting the needs of our customers means prioritizing investments that enhance the grid while also minimizing the cost impact for customers,"" Pearson said. ""For example, Duke Energy's nuclear units are expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of annual tax credits in the coming years – savings that will be passed to our customers beginning in 2026.""

Bottom line: The PSCSC recently approved comprehensive agreements between diverse groups of stakeholders that will apply these tax credits to bills and include shareholder-funded contributions to residential customers, helping to mitigate the impacts of recent infrastructure investments on customer bills over the next two years.

DEP: Beginning Feb. 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEP residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $11.20 a month – from $153.82 per month to $165.02.

DEC: Beginning March 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEC residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $0.84 a month – from $148.02 per month to $148.86 (this includes the securitization charge previously mentioned).

DEC serves about 680,000 households and businesses primarily in Upstate and north central South Carolina, including Greenville, Anderson and York counties, while DEP serves about 177,000 customers in the Pee Dee region and northeastern South Carolina, including Sumter, Florence and Darlington counties. If approved by regulators in 2026, the proposed combination of the two utilities would save customers in the Carolinas more than $1 billion in future costs.

Helping customers manage costs: ""Customers expect us to manage our costs, but they also want options to manage their own energy usage and give them tools to impact their own bills,"" Pearson said. ""That's why we're helping customers lower their energy use – and lower their bills – through programs that make a measurable difference.""

Across the Carolinas, Duke Energy's aggressive energy efficiency programs deliver annual savings 150% better than the national average. Improving efficiency benefits all customers by reducing costs for the entire system. In South Carolina, the company recently increased the incentives of many of these programs, expanding ways customers can save money.

Why should I care?

For markets: The future story is strong but the car business sets the math.

Tesla shares were up about 11% in 2025 despite weaker deliveries, suggesting investors are putting more weight on robotaxis, self-driving software, and robotics than on near-term EV sales. But repeated delivery declines typically mean more discounting, which can compress margins and make earnings more sensitive to volume. The key question for markets is whether Tesla can stabilize its core auto demand without permanently training customers to wait for the next price cut.

Zooming out: Subsidies don’t just boost sales they reshape them.

The Q3 pull-forward and Q4 hangover show how policy can shift demand across quarters, then leave a tougher baseline once incentives vanish. When that happens, automakers often choose between slowing production or cutting prices to keep factories busy – neither is great for profitability. Over time, fewer incentives also forces the sector to compete more on price, features, and brand strength, raising the pressure on weaker lineups.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2026_newsml_L4N3Y30E1_279960018.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=136f104b39b5a9c6b64096c4d076f21f,N,,2026-01-02 09:58:57.061173

Conservation groups and legislators alike are looking to take another bite of the apple on several $50-million bond issues and settle emerging issues with wastewater sludge at the state-owned Juniper Ridge Landfill in Old Town when lawmakers convene again this month.

As in 2025, the mitigation of “forever chemicals” is at the forefront of many 2026 legislative proposals, along with support for the wastewater treatment facilities that confront them daily.

Several forestry industry advocates are also hoping that the Legislature affirms its support of Maine loggers and provides them financial relief amid challenging market conditions.

Conservation and infrastructure funding

— L.D. 362: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Replenish the Land for Maine’s Future Program

Lead sponsor Sen. Russell Black (R-Wilton) is proposing a $50 million bond to replenish Maine’s conservation program and help purchase high-value agricultural land, critical wildlife habitat and public access points to Maine’s coast.

Without this bond, Maine will lose even more land to development, taking the state’s dwindling rural workforce of farmers along with it, Black wrote in legislative testimony.

“As a farmer and a fiscal conservative, I believe we should only spend taxpayer dollars when it’s absolutely necessary and when it delivers real, lasting value — and protecting Maine’s farmland does just that,” Black said.

— L.D. 836: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Upgrade Municipal Culverts at Stream Crossings

Another bill — this time from Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) — would dedicate a $50 million bond to Maine municipalities looking to replace or expand their aging, undersized culverts that channel water under or around roads.

Culverts can be an achilles heel for municipalities facing heavy rainstorms and floods. Roads blow out when they’re overwhelmed and undermined, stranding residents trying to evacuate. Improving culverts would both mitigate flood risks and help aquatic wildlife travel from stream to stream, Daughtry wrote in testimony.

— L.D. 25: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Fund Wastewater Treatment Facility Planning and Construction of Infrastructure Projects

Another $50 million bond measure from Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Scarborough) is for municipal and quasi-municipal wastewater treatment plants to purchase equipment that would help reduce the amount of wastewater sludge or biosolids they produce.

This is the scum that gets filtered out during wastewater treatment and often contains forever chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Maine municipalities often truck that waste to landfills such as Juniper Ridge in Old Town for burial and disposal.

“This will save landfill space, reduce the volume and weight of sludge when it is transported … and will make sludge easier to handle,” wrote Melanie Loyzim, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.

— L.D. 1904: An Act to Establish the Municipal Shoreline Protection Legal Fund

This bill from Sen. Senator Tim Nangle (D-Windham) has a smaller price tag — a minimum of $100,000 — and would build on Nangle’s prior legislation to help municipalities hold developers responsible for damage to fragile shoreline habitat.

The fund would help municipalities pay for legal action against violators of shoreline zoning restrictions and would be reimbursed if the municipalities win in court.

Climate priorities

— L.D. 1870: An Act to Establish a Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program to Impose Penalties on Climate Polluters

This bill from lead sponsor Brenner would charge fossil fuel companies operating during a certain timespan and emitting a certain amount of greenhouse gases for some costs of Maine climate adaptation projects. It prompted more than 100 letters of testimony when it was introduced last May and has been carried over into the second half of the legislative session.

Other Democratic-led states have introduced similar “climate superfund” bills — 11 total, according to Grist — but only New York and Vermont have been successful. They’ve been mired in legal challenges ever since.

Forest products industry relief

— L.D. 1313: An Act to Promote Equity in the Forest Products Industry by Allowing Commercial Wood Haulers to Be Eligible for Certain Sales Tax Exemptions and Refunds

Spearheaded by Sen. Brad Farrin (R-Norridgewock), L.D. 1313 would provide relief for one link in the forest products industry’s broader supply chain: a sales tax refund or exemption on the purchase of logging equipment and vehicles, from semitrucks to the long-armed machines that cut and haul timber. It would result in an estimated loss in tax revenue to the state of $269,000 in fiscal year 2026-2027, with slightly increasing losses in the years after.

“It’s on the special appropriations table, and, honestly, that one has such a painfully small fiscal note, it would be great if we could get that one to move,” Krysta West, executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council, told The Maine Monitor.

Maine’s multi-billion dollar forest products industry has been hit by inflation, falling market prices for certain timber products, tariffs on logging equipment and an overall decline in manufacturing.

— L.D. 798: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Fund Mass Timber Manufacturing

L.D. 798 proposes another $50 million bond that would boost the manufacturing side of Maine’s forest products sector. The bill from Rep. Samuel Lewis Zager (D-Portland) would finance the creation or retrofitting of manufacturing equipment that produces refined timber products such as wood paneling and construction materials.

‘Forever chemicals’ and drinking water

— L.D. 1696: Resolve, to Study Maine’s Absolute Dominion and Beneficial Use Laws Relating to Water Rights

Recurring drought over the past five years has prompted concern about the health of Maine’s aquifers and underwater reserves, especially in relation to the impact of large-scale water extractors such as Poland Spring.

Lead sponsor Rep. Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) told attendees of a Maine Conservation Voters meeting last week that she hopes this bill will study how other states are regulating their water and create actionable policy proposals for Maine.

“We need to really have an examination of what our legal framework is for water,” Gramlich said.

— L.D. 1177: Resolve, to Study the Public Health and Environmental Risks from Synthetic Turf

A second study proposal from Gramlich directs the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to study the health impacts of synthetic or artificial turf on humans, with specific concern about their use of forever chemicals.

The bill needs $100,000 in funding. Gramlich said she was working with state officials to try to lower that price tag.",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/statehouse-building-closeup.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 10:59:37.256358

Tax credits and financing Helene costs will help mitigate energy bill changes beginning in 2026

GREENVILLE, S.C. – Beginning in January, Duke Energy will implement changes to customer bills that reflect investments made to recover from the historic damage from Hurricane Helene, strengthen the grid against storms and outages, maintain and upgrade its power generating fleet, and serve a growing customer base while supporting economic growth in South Carolina.

Our view: “Duke Energy is committed to meeting the expectations our customers have around reliability, responsiveness and value – striking the right balance that delivers these at the lowest possible cost for customers,” said Tim Pearson, Duke Energy’s South Carolina president. “That means investing in what matters, delivering results efficiently, and remaining transparent about what customers are paying for and why.”

The Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) recently approved these updates for customers of Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP), the company’s two utilities in the state.

Recovering from Helene: Securitization – selling low-interest, long-term bonds – is one way Duke Energy can generate savings and keep costs lower for customers while also recovering large and unexpected expenses like those that resulted from Hurricane Helene. The PSCSC recently approved a securitization plan that will save DEC customers more than $140 million on Helene expenses.

Beginning in January, a typical residential DEC customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per month will see a new storm charge on bills reflecting a 3.2% increase, or $4.58. This modest increase still delivers 20% savings for customers over the recovery period compared to traditional cost recovery methods.

“We appreciate the legislature providing tools like securitization to address extreme storm costs as we continue to pursue ways to reduce these impacts on customer bills,” Pearson said.

Powering growth, driving reliability: Duke Energy has made investments in the things our customers expect: upgrades to strengthen the grid, improve reliability and storm resilience, and maintain and upgrade our generation fleet. These investments are already in place and delivering benefits to South Carolina, from faster restoration times to improved reliability and operational efficiency.

For example, as part of ongoing grid upgrades, Duke Energy has nearly tripled the number of South Carolina customers served by self-healing technology over the past two years, with more than 70% of customers now benefiting from this innovative automated power restoration tool.

“Meeting the needs of our customers means prioritizing investments that enhance the grid while also minimizing the cost impact for customers,” Pearson said. “For example, Duke Energy’s nuclear units are expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of annual tax credits in the coming years – savings that will be passed to our customers beginning in 2026.”

Bottom line: The PSCSC recently approved comprehensive agreements between diverse groups of stakeholders that will apply these tax credits to bills and include shareholder-funded contributions to residential customers, helping to mitigate the impacts of recent infrastructure investments on customer bills over the next two years.

DEP: Beginning Feb. 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEP residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $11.20 a month – from $153.82 per month to $165.02.

DEC: Beginning March 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEC residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $0.84 a month – from $148.02 per month to $148.86 (this includes the securitization charge previously mentioned).

DEC serves about 680,000 households and businesses primarily in Upstate and north central South Carolina, including Greenville, Anderson and York counties, while DEP serves about 177,000 customers in the Pee Dee region and northeastern South Carolina, including Sumter, Florence and Darlington counties. If approved by regulators in 2026, the proposed combination of the two utilities would save customers in the Carolinas more than $1 billion in future costs.

Helping customers manage costs: “Customers expect us to manage our costs, but they also want options to manage their own energy usage and give them tools to impact their own bills,” Pearson said. “That’s why we’re helping customers lower their energy use – and lower their bills – through programs that make a measurable difference.”

Across the Carolinas, Duke Energy’s aggressive energy efficiency programs deliver annual savings 150% better than the national average. Improving efficiency benefits all customers by reducing costs for the entire system. In South Carolina, the company recently increased the incentives of many of these programs, expanding ways customers can save money.

The power generation sector enters 2026 at a critical inflection point. Electricity demand is surging—driven by data centers, manufacturing reshoring, and transportation electrification—even as the industry navigates an unprecedented transformation in how power is generated, transmitted, and consumed. Utilities and independent power producers face the dual challenge of maintaining grid reliability while transitioning to cleaner energy sources, all amid regulatory uncertainty and shifting market dynamics.

This year promises to be pivotal for decisions that will shape the industry’s trajectory for decades. From the continued buildout of renewable capacity to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into grid management, 2026 will test the sector’s ability to balance innovation with pragmatism.

AI Enhances Efficiency

“The grid will become even more AI-enabled in the next year as AI becomes necessary for utilities to be more efficient,” Pradeep Tagare, head of Investments with National Grid Partners, told POWER. “In our recent Utility Innovation Survey, we saw this in real time: utilities are no longer treating AI as ‘nice to have,’ but rather as a strategic tool to manage load growth, enable reliability, and accelerate grid expansion. Due to the pressures that the electrification of heating, transport, and data center expansion place on the grid, AI-driven forecasting, risk mitigation, and infrastructure planning tools will become essential.”

Albert Hofeldt, Chief Product Officer with Power Factors, said optimization has always been a priority for renewable energy operators, but it has taken on a new significance over the past few years. “Returns for renewable energy projects are shrinking, a sign of our current economic context and a signal of maturity for the market. Rising interest rates have increased the cost of capital, while financial support from state and federal governments disappear, pushing costs back onto developers. The renewable energy market is mature enough now to handle these changes, but it increases the pressure to build a bulletproof business model. In many cases, renewable energy companies are realizing that improving production and reducing future costs can actually deliver a greater and safer return over time than a new development,” he told POWER.

“Machine learning and AI have a big role to play in increasing production from existing assets,” Hofeldt added. “AI can predict issues with underperforming assets earlier, making it possible to conduct maintenance with less downtime, ultimately maximizing energy production and revenue. It can also identify the root cause of underperformance, helping operators prioritize issues quickly and plan maintenance so that the highest-impact fixes are done first.”

How Much Power Will AI Demand

While AI is rapidly becoming indispensable for optimizing grid efficiency and predictive maintenance, this very success is fueling a new massive challenge, that is, meeting the unprecedented increase in power demand that is predicted from the data centers that house AI infrastructure.

“For years, the conversation was about gradual electrification,” Sonya Montgomery, CEO of The Desoto Group, told POWER, referring to electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps, as examples of the slow but steady shift. “Recently, however, the need to find gigawatts, not megawatts, almost overnight due to AI-computing demands is something the industry must adapt to.”

A report published in December 2024 by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy projected total data center energy use through 2028. Researchers presented a range of estimates to reflect various scenarios. Their low- and high-end projections were roughly 325 TWh and 580 TWh in 2028, which represented 6.7% to 12.0% of total U.S. electricity consumption forecasted that year. However, since that time, new developments have put in question almost all estimates of future data center energy demand.

“The DeepSeek R1 model release was probably the most pivotal point in 2025,” Ryan Luther, director of Energy Transition Research with Enverus, reflected. “It made the entire market second guess the load growth from data centers.”

Developed by Chinese startup DeepSeek, R1 is a powerful open-source reasoning model known for its high performance in coding and mathematics at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. DeepSeek R1’s efficiency breakthrough showed that algorithmic innovation could drastically reduce the energy footprint per AI task, casting doubt on the exponential power-growth curves currently driving data center planning.

“I think we will continue to see moments like that in 2026 that will have major impacts on the outlook for power markets,” Luther continued. “For instance, Meta is clearly losing the AI race and wasting hundreds of billions pursuing it. If they don’t turn it around quickly, they might have to abandon the endeavor. That would cut a fifth of the data center build-out and reset expectations on power demand growth.”

Utility-Scale Solar Surges On

Regardless of what happens with data center demand, solar photovoltaic (PV) technology will remain the powerhouse of the energy transition (Figure 1). Its unprecedented growth will continue to reshape power markets in 2026 and beyond.

“Renewables and storage will continue to do the bulk of the heavy lifting,” said Peter Davidson, CEO and co-founder of Aligned Climate Capital. “Solar, wind, and batteries are the fastest, cheapest, most scalable way to add firm power—and anyone who thinks otherwise is clinging to an outdated narrative.”

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects in its Renewables 2025 report, which was released in October, that solar will account for about 80% of the total increase in global renewable power capacity over the next five years. It estimates about 3.68 TW of solar capacity will be added by 2030. This is an astounding figure. At least one detailed study suggests fixed-tilt PV systems require on average 2.85 acres per MW and that tracking systems take even more space—4.17 acres/MW. (Tracking systems use mechanisms to follow the sun, which increases energy yield but requires more spacing between rows to avoid shading as panels tilt and rotate.) Assuming 3.5 acres/MW are used on average for all the new solar PV being added in the next five years, nearly 13 million acres of land will be needed. To put that into perspective, that’s like covering the entire country of Slovakia or most of the state of West Virginia completely with solar panels.

“The solar industry’s resilience is real, but it’s not guaranteed,” Jorge Vargas, CEO of Aspen Power, told POWER. “The biggest potential disruptor would be supply chain friction, especially if trade policies shift in the coming years. Another leading indicator is the health of the tax equity market. If there’s any contraction in available tax credit capital, that would slow growth more than any technical factor.”

Residential Solar Has Gone Mainstream

Driving the decentralized energy movement, U.S. residential solar installations are now measured in the millions, with the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reporting well over 5 million total installations across the country. However, recent economic headwinds and policy transitions have led to a notable contraction in the rate of new residential installations through the first half of 2025. Still, SEIA’s base case forecast projects that the residential solar market will grow by 3% annually on average from 2025 to 2030.

SolarTech, a leading solar company with offices in California and Arizona, released its own study on the state of solar in December, which was created based on a survey of 2,000 homeowners. “What we’re seeing in the 2025 State of Solar report is a decisive shift in homeowner mindset,” Sonny Gonzalez, director of Marketing at SolarTech, told POWER. “Solar is no longer viewed as an experimental or early adopter investment—it’s becoming a standard part of long-term home planning. With roughly 70% of homeowners either already using solar or expecting to adopt it within the next five years, the market has clearly moved into the mainstream. This level of interest reflects not just improved technology and affordability, but a growing desire among homeowners to take control of their energy future.”

“Right now, the biggest driver is still the fundamental economics,” said Vargas. “Solar is cost-effective, scalable, and increasingly flexible across customer segments. Utility rates are expected to rise sharply over the next several years, which makes solar an even more compelling hedge against those escalating costs. The Inflation Reduction Act [IRA] provided a significant tailwind for project development, but as those incentives begin to phase out, developers and customers will have to rely more heavily on intrinsic project economics and risk management. Going forward, development will increasingly be driven by cost savings, energy resilience, and load-side management. The projects that get built will be those that help customers control costs and mitigate exposure to rising utility prices, even in a world without IRA-backed subsidies.”

“While utility savings remain the single strongest motivator for going solar, the data shows that homeowners are thinking far beyond monthly bills,” said Gonzalez. “Rising concerns about grid reliability, unpredictable outages, and increasing electricity rates are reshaping how people evaluate their energy options. Solar is now seen as a pathway to stability and independence. For many homeowners, adopting solar is as much about resilience and control as it is about reducing costs—and that marks a major evolution in the residential solar mindset.”

FEOC Rules Take Hold

The Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements are a set of restrictions established by Congress across several laws, beginning with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the IRA, and later expanded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, Figure 2). They are designed to prevent entities with strong ties to adversarial nations from benefiting from U.S. clean energy tax credits and to reduce U.S. reliance on these nations—specifically China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, which are defined in statute as “covered nations”—for critical components in the clean energy supply chain, such as solar panels and electric vehicle (EV) batteries.

FEOC and related “prohibited foreign entity” restrictions represent a significant shift in how clean energy projects qualify for federal tax incentives. Building on IRA and modified by OBBBA, these rules can deny technology‑neutral tax credits—including the Section 48E Investment Tax Credit, Section 45Y Production Tax Credit, and Section 45X Manufacturing Tax Credit—to power plants, energy storage projects, and U.S.‑made products that have too much ownership, control, or critical content traceable to entities linked to covered nations. Compliance analyses focus on several dimensions, including whether the taxpayer is a specified foreign or foreign‑influenced entity, the share of project or product costs attributable to covered‑nation equipment and materials, and whether contractual or financing arrangements give a prohibited foreign entity effective control or “material assistance” in the project.

“We may hear a lot more about FEOC in 2026,” Jim Nutter, managing director with Stout, told POWER. “Developers have tried their best to prepare, but the new part of the law and its interpretation might be hard to navigate in practice.”

Luther suggested uncertainty around the requirements remains. “For 2026, everyone is looking at FEOC to see where the rules end up,” he said.

The stakes are high. For certain technology‑neutral investment tax credits, projects can face full or substantial recapture if, within 10 years of being placed in service, the taxpayer makes payments that give specified prohibited foreign entities effective control or otherwise trigger the new ownership and “applicable payment” restrictions, depending on how the U.S. Department of Treasury ultimately interprets those rules. As the industry awaits clearer Treasury guidance, many developers are working to start construction before key effective dates to take advantage of grandfathering provisions, while also navigating tariff exposure and trying to secure FEOC‑compliant supply chains in a constrained and rapidly evolving market.

Supply Chain Issues Persist, but Some Improvement Seen

Supply chain disruptions have plagued the power industry since at least 2020 when the pandemic upset the normal flow of products, creating cascading delays in everything from transformers to turbines to solar modules. For years, developers have grappled with extended lead times, price volatility, and equipment shortages that stretched project timelines and squeezed margins.

Brandy Johnson, Chief Technology Officer with Babcock & Wilcox (B&W), suggested the problem was lingering long before the pandemic. “The power industry supply chain has retracted because power build-out in the U.S. has been so minimal for so long. But now, especially due to growing demand from AI and data centers, we have a projected build-out in the U.S. energy sector for more generation capacity in a shorter period of time than we’ve potentially seen in our lifetimes,” she told POWER.

“But the lack of manufacturing capacity means supply chains are really showing weakness in their ability to meet the industry’s needs,” Johnson said. “We’re seeing very long lead times on gas turbines, for example, because demand is greatly outpacing the rate at which they can be manufactured. The capacity to build pressure parts for boilers in the U.S. also is diminished, which means suppliers have to look overseas. It’s not just one thing. It’s all of the pieces of the supply chain that are affected.”

Still, it’s not all doom and gloom—the pressure is lessening in some areas. “We’re seeing some easing in the supply chain for basic construction materials, such as steel, which was a major bottleneck during the pandemic,” said Montgomery. “However, more complex materials are still facing delays, particularly those related to transmission line components and high-voltage equipment. High-voltage direct-current cables are an example of procurement that can take up to 24 months to source. The North American Electric Reliability Corp. states that the lead time, the wait between placing an order and the product being delivered, has reached around two years, with large power transformers [Figure 3] taking up to four years.”

“We will begin to see supply chain … challenges easing for sectors tied to electrification or distribution level, but continue to see long lead times for power transformers,” said Charles Murray, CEO and co-founder of Switched Source. “New investments in domestic transformer manufacturing at the distribution level are starting to have an impact, but do not expect prices to come back down for transformers or cables.”

“There have been major investments in domestic manufacturing of grid-critical equipment,” Tagare said. “In fact, National Grid is investing £35 billion over the next six years to help strengthen and unlock long-term supply chain capacity and skills across England and Wales.”

Luther suggested developers need to consider all of their options when sourcing components, not simply focus on one possibility while belaboring its lack of availability. “Everyone is talking about the backlog on utility-scale gas turbines, but there’s over 25 GW in annual global production of sub-100-MW generators that could be used,” he noted. “It’s a significant amount of smaller-scale generation that no one is talking about.”

Johnson also suggested developers should think about alternatives when an originally contemplated form of generation is unavailable. “Especially with data centers, B&W is trying to offer alternatives to build new power generation capacity when supply chain issues limit developers’ options,” she said. “For example, if a developer can’t get gas turbines for a combined cycle plant, we have alternatives that can help them get their plant online much sooner. Alternative technologies are coming to light because they may have supply chains that are more readily accessible.”

Another way companies can find a workaround for supply chain issues is through standardization. “One of the things B&W is doing to address this is more standardization in our boiler and plant designs,” Johnson said. “We’re telling customers that we can speed up the design and construction of a plant if we do less customization. With power producers wanting to bring projects online quickly, speed through standardization is critical.”

The T&D Dilemma

Even as supply chain constraints are overcome, or accounted for, a more fundamental bottleneck threatens to limit how quickly new generation can actually reach customers: the transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure itself. Interconnection queues have swelled to historic levels, with gigawatts of ready-to-build projects waiting years for grid connection studies and upgrades. While new solar farms and battery storage facilities can be constructed in months, the transmission lines needed to deliver their power often require a decade or more of planning, permitting, and construction. This growing mismatch between generation development timelines and grid infrastructure timelines has pushed T&D constraints to the forefront of industry challenges (Figure 4) for 2026 and beyond.

“Much of the focus on electricity growth is on new power generation, but power transmission and distribution constraints don’t seem to get as much attention in public discourse,” David Carter, industrials senior analyst at RSM US, told POWER. “Further, just like in generation, these transmission and distribution constraints need an ‘all-of-the-above’ approach. That includes not just new power lines, but expanding the capacity of existing ones by ‘reconductoring’ them with more modern cables and using technology solutions to make better use of what is already in place. In a time where permitting is such a challenge, having options to increase capacity without a years-long process to obtain new rights of way will be key.”

“Queue reform and transmission buildout are make-or-break for the [solar] industry’s ability to scale sustainably,” said Vargas.

Mark Feasel, vice president of Sales with Mission Critical Group, suggested limitations in power delivery could force developers to find other options. “Grid constraints will push organizations toward rapid adoption of distributed generation and on-site power strategies that bring energy closer to the load this year,” he said. “As data centers consume increasing portions of available capacity, hospitals, manufacturers, and other critical infrastructure operators will be forced to rethink how they secure not just reliable power, but resilient power, when the utility can no longer meet their needs.”

Luther suggested self-generation is already a growing trend. “A lot of hyperscalers are looking to bring their own generation and go behind the meter to avoid the long lead times of getting grid connected, which means the load might not materialize on the grid but off of it,” he said. “At the same time PJM, MISO [Midcontinent Independent System Operator], and SPP [Southwest Power Pool] are all accelerating queue timelines for dispatchable assets. So, if both of these trends emerge, its very likely these markets end up being better supplied than they are today.”

Meanwhile, leaders in Washington could also play a role this year. “The administration and Congress both seem to recognize the importance of permitting reform, and a streamlined process that reduces uncertainty would help power projects come online faster, with better project economics,” Carter noted.

Closing Thoughts

All of the leaders POWER spoke to expressed genuine optimism about the year ahead. Their confidence stems not from abstract hope but from tangible opportunities they see emerging in many areas. Yet, aside from the big talking points—AI, data centers, solar power’s future, supply chains, and infrastructure—three interesting items emerged.

“There is a growing importance of collaboration across the utility-startup ecosystem. Too many promising technologies stall in the ‘pilot doom loop’ because utility leaders and innovators lack the shared frameworks, data access, and operational pathways needed to move from experimentation to real system impact,” Tagare said. “The most successful solutions emerge when utility leaders and startups collaborate on deployment models early—aligning on integration requirements, regulatory considerations, and measurable value from day one.”

“With the increasing electrification of things such as transport, heating, and cooking, it’s important to recognize and plan for a shift in peak power from a summer afternoon to a winter evening as the heat gets going, dinner is cooking, and EVs are charging,” said Carter. “One leader for a distribution utility recently highlighted the importance of how ‘EVs come in gangs’ to neighborhoods as neighbors influence other neighbors on EV adoption, it can quickly overload local transformer capacity during peak periods without proper planning or load-shifting capabilities.”

“Most people understand that storage is important for solar, but the reality is that it still does not always make financial sense. Making storage work requires careful project design, timing, and alignment with grid needs. That is why we are so focused on it. Projects that get storage right will capture real value, while others risk underperforming,” Vargas said. “Another misconception is that solar growth will stall once IRA incentives fade. Projects with strong underlying economics will continue moving forward, and developers who integrate storage effectively will lead the market.”

The common thread running through these perspectives is clear: success in 2026’s power sector will belong to those who move beyond siloed thinking, whether that means utilities partnering earlier with innovators, grid planners anticipating neighborhood-level adoption patterns, or developers designing projects around actual grid value rather than subsidy availability. It’s a fascinating time to be involved in the power industry—the challenges are out there to be solved, and pioneering industry leaders are finding the answers.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-power-industry-forecast-1024x747.png,N,,2026-01-02 09:13:01.410022

A recent manifestation of the malaise is that the federal government rejected the recent “low-ball” bid from the sole bidder (Navajo Transitional Energy Co.) to acquire 167 million tons of coal on federal public lands in Montana. The company bid $186,000 (less than a penny per ton). The failed lease sale would have been the biggest federal government coal sale in more than a decade.

The failed Montana coal lease sale vividly demonstrates the lack of interest for coal among utilities generating electricity throughout the country. They are turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables. In spite of the administration’s interest in reviving the coal industry, economists say federal attempts to boost coal are not going to reverse its years-long decline.

Actions During President Trump’s First Term (2017–2021)

In its first term, the Trump administration tried to reverse the coal policies of the Obama administration through various actions, including:

Ending the Federal Coal Leasing Moratorium. A 2016 moratorium, which temporarily halted new coal leases on federal lands to allow for an environmental review, was lifted in March 2017. This Trump administration change reinstated the ability for companies to acquire new leases.

Rescinding New Valuation Rules. The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) repealed new rules that calculated royalties for coal extracted from federal land based on the sales price, rather than a lower figure. This move effectively reduced the cost for mining companies to extract coal.

Actions During Trump’s Second Term (2025–present)

President Trump’s second administration has continued and expanded the pro-coal policies of his first term. In April 2025, Trump signed a series of executive orders to boost the coal industry. These orders declare that “coal is essential to our national and economic security” and direct federal agencies to take several actions, such as:

Prioritize Coal Leasing. Agencies must identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to mining, and prioritize coal leasing.

Rescind Anti-Coal Policies. Agencies must overturn policies aimed at transitioning the country away from coal.

Promote “Clean” Coal Technology. Agencies must allocate $625 million toward recommissioning or modernizing aging coal plants.

Expand Federal Land for Mining. Agencies must open more than 20,000 square miles of federal land to mining.

Executive Orders

The recent executive orders and proclamations also include directions to various agencies to:

Promote coal for new technologies such as using coal to power new artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

Investigate and challenge state-level laws that restrict the use of coal and other fossil fuels.

Sharply reduce royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands.

Extend, by two years, the date by which coal-fired power plants were to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The same week that the U.S. Department of Energy allocated $625 million in funding for retrofitting and recommissioning aging coal plants to extend their lifespans, the DOI issued a press release stating that it would open 13.1 million acres of federal land to coal mining and streamline approvals for projects in Montana, Wyoming, and Tennessee.

Economics and the Markets Ultimately Drive Coal (or Any Energy) Development

Federal policies have not been able to reverse the decline in the demand for coal, even when those policies are favorable to the industry. Political attempts to support coal have not, for example, increased employment or production significantly. Some argue that regulations have been a factor, but market forces are the primary driver. Regulations can affect decisions, but market competitiveness remains the larger issue.

Ultimately, market fundamentals are the main drivers of coal development. While federal, state, and local policies can influence the market, they cannot override economic realities that demonstrate that the cost of coal development is rising, and other energy sources are more competitive. Simply put, the cost of coal is increasing, and coal plants have become more expensive to operate. Those realities contrast dramatically with the fact that newer energy alternatives will continue to drive down interest in the use of coal.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coal-free-image-from-rawpixel.png,N,,2026-01-02 09:13:05.905497

It's cold and snowy in much of the U.S. right now, but hard as it may be to believe in some parts of the country, heat season will eventually come again, and hotter summers are increasingly a risk for American workers. This year, the federal government is considering new rules to protect employees from excessive heat. A new study looks at what matters most for keeping workers safe. NPR's Alejandra Borunda reports.

ALEJANDRA BORUNDA, BYLINE: People have known forever that hot weather can be dangerous for workers. Even ancient Egyptians worried about dehydration for people building the pyramids. And the problem is just as critical for people working outside now. And it's not just heatstroke that's a risk.

ADAM DEAN: Heat makes people slower to react and worse at making decisions.

BORUNDA: Adam Dean is a political scientist who researches labor conditions at George Washington University.

DEAN: And that means that farm workers driving a tractor or a construction worker operating equipment is more likely to have a fatal accident on a hot day.

BORUNDA: Dean is the lead author of a new analysis in the journal Health Affairs. It looked at workplace deaths related to heat in California, which was the first state to pass protections for people who work outdoors. The researchers compared deaths in California with states nearby that didn't have those rules. The study found California's rules likely saved dozens of lives every year, even as climate change has made those heat risks more intense. But Dean says fine-tuning the rule took some trial and error.

DEAN: When California first adopted a heat standard in 2005, it was ineffective.

BORUNDA: Dean says the original guidelines weren't specific enough. They said employers, like farmers, for example, had to offer their workers water, shade and rest when it's hot. But when inspectors showed up, they sometimes found problems, like undrinkable water. So the state clarified. Water had to be drinkable and free, not just there, and there needed to be enough shade for all workers during breaks. The state also ramped up their inspections and launched an intensive campaign to educate workers about their rights. Dean says all those changes made a real difference.

DEAN: I think a critical lesson is that merely passing a heat standard is not enough. And it was only after the state launched a statewide enforcement campaign that we started to see deaths decrease relative to surrounding states.

BORUNDA: The new study was published as the federal government is currently considering new heat rules that would apply nationally. Worker advocates want it to mimic California's more specific rules, while many employer groups prefer a more flexible standard. The new study joins several other analyses published this year that found standards, especially strict ones, can protect workers. Barrak Alahmad is an occupational health researcher at Harvard University. He says all the studies use different datasets and methods.

BARRAK ALAHMAD: And in science, you like to see that. You like to see this consistency and these additional layers of evidence.

BORUNDA: The future of the federal heat rules is uncertain. They were first proposed under President Biden's administration, and the Trump administration is now reviewing them. In the meantime, several states and cities have adopted their own rules in recent years, and others, like New Mexico and Arizona, are currently considering them.

Environmental groups are yet again challenging Louisiana regulators in their decision to reissue a previously suspended permit for a liquified natural gas export facility in Cameron Parish.

The Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade filed a lawsuit in Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy.

The environmental groups say that the agency “violated its constitutional, statutory and regulatory duties,” as well as the court’s previous judgment when it reissued a permit for the construction of Commonwealth LNG’s export facility on the coast of Cameron Parish.

​​“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.

“The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club managing attorney.

Huber said the Department of Conservation and Energy “is attempting to shrug off its responsibility” by relying on studies done by other agencies— the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission— rather than doing its own analysis.

The lawsuit is the latest in back-and-forth between regulators, environmentalists and industry as the liquified natural gas industry pursues its expansion along the Gulf Coast.

Louisiana district judge Penelope Richard ruled in a surprise move in October that the state agency did not adequately consider the effects of climate change and impacts to environmental justice communities nearby the planned facility when it issued its first permit to Commonwealth LNG.

About a month later, the state reissued the permit, citing the need for haste in part to align with the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda.

The BREATHE report addresses the need for climate solutions as the nine-county Knoxville Metro area grows to an estimated one million residents by 2028.

Poor air quality is just one of many climate concerns, along with extreme weather conditions such as severe storms and flooding. The BREATHE plan is to cut climate-altering emissions by 75% (compared to 2022) by 2050. It includes involvement and support from the mayors of Knoxville, Maryville, and Alcoa.

Key areas of concern with room for improvement include energy use and building efficiency, transportation emissions, waste management, and the preservation of green spaces. Grassroots ideas are to make weatherization and energy upgrades more affordable for people. The ideas also point to more jobs in building technologies such as HVAC.

The report summarizes with:

“The BREATHE Plan is a roadmap for how to collectively act across the region to advance climate action in an equitable and sustained manner. Success depends on action from governments, businesses, nonprofits, and residents. Whether by weatherizing buildings, riding public transit, planting trees, or supporting local farms, every action counts. Together, we can build a Knoxville region that breathes easier, lives healthier, and thrives for generations to come.”

BREATHE is funded by an Environmental Protection Agency grant and was organized by the City of Knoxville’s Office of Sustainability and the Knoxville Regional Transportation Planning Organization. The plan itself includes no enforcement power, but rather serves as a guide for governments, nonprofits, and communities in general to make climate-wise decisions moving forward.
