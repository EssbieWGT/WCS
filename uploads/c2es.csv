Japanese automakers, including Nissan, have had to reassess parts of their strategy in the region as new U.S. trade rules, the expiration of EV tax credits, and reduced demand have created challenges.

The two midsize electric SUVs — one for Nissan and the other for luxury brand Infiniti — were expected to begin production at the automaker’s plant in Mississippi in 2028.

However, the timeline has now been delayed to late 2028 or early 2029, Nikkei reported.

The company had initially planned to launch five electric vehicles in the U.S., but has since canceled development of a small SUV and a sedan, reducing its pipeline to three EV models.

The shift comes after the Trump administration’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ eliminated EV tax credits effective September 30. The Biden-era incentives, worth up to $7,500, were initially aimed at boosting sales of North American-made EVs.

A 2023 revision under the Biden administration expanded eligibility to include leased vehicles made overseas, which lifted EV lease penetration from 10% in early 2023 to 66% by March 2025, according to Cox Automotive.

Japanese and South Korean automakers lacking U.S. EV production facilities depended on leasing provisions to maintain their competitive edge.

EV demand faces additional pressure from incentive elimination while also struggling with high vehicle costs, insufficient charging stations, and widespread preference for gasoline SUVs. Currently, EVs account for just 7% of new vehicle sales in the U.S.

In April, EV incentives averaged 14.5% of sticker prices — double that of gasoline cars — but demand remains sluggish.

Meanwhile, Nissan’s battery supplier, AESC, has suspended construction of a plant in South Carolina. If EV demand continues to stagnate, U.S. battery production capacity could become excessive, Nikkei reported, citing a finance industry source.

Separately, Nissan reportedly halted production in May of three Canada-bound models — the Pathfinder and Murano SUVs, built in Tennessee, and the Frontier pickup, produced in Mississippi — following the Trump administration’s decision in April to impose a 25% tariff on auto imports.

Mazda also paused Canada-bound production at its Alabama plant and is shifting output to the U.S. market, the company said.

Other Japanese automakers are also adjusting. Toyota has postponed EV production in Indiana by two years and is increasing the output of hybrid and gasoline versions of the Grand Highlander SUV. Honda has halted the development of a large electric SUV it had positioned as a key product for the U.S. market.

On Stocktwits, retail sentiment for Nissan was ‘bullish’ amid ‘extremely high’ message volume by late Tuesday.

Nissan’s U.S. shares have declined 26.8% so far this year.

The deficit-boosting bill President Donald Trump signed into law last Friday included provisions that will undermine US clean energy development. Indeed, a team led by Princeton energy expert Jesse Jenkins estimates that it will reduce US solar and wind output by at least 300 gigawatts by 2035—enough to power some 225 million homes.

But some Republicans still thought the bill didn’t go far enough. After a failed last-minute bid to add further subsidy cuts and an industry-killing renewables tax to the bill, Republicans agreed to vote yes after Trump promised to take matters into his own hands.

He delivered on Monday with an executive order titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.”

The order basically instructs the Treasury Department to deny a developer’s application for soon-to-disappear clean energy subsidies “unless a substantial portion” of their project is already built. It also directs the Department of the Interior to revise policies favoring renewables. “While many executive orders have limited effectiveness, this one might actually have some bite,” says Yale energy economist Kenneth Gillingham.

“The Trump administration is taking every opportunity it can find to assert its authority not to spend money on things with which it disagrees,” says Don Kettl, a professor emeritus and former dean at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “The implications here are enormous.”

Because of the time it takes to permit and site US projects, Gillingham says, the order’s stringent interpretation of the statutory language will have “the effect of quashing the market sooner than would have happened otherwise.”

Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a national organization of business leaders advocating for smarter climate policies, isn’t too pleased with the order. “Just in case last week’s legislative sledgehammer didn’t do enough damage to our economy, our environment, and the pocketbooks of anybody who pays an electricity bill, the Trump administration is taking yet another swing,” he said.

Trump’s decree asserts that renewables threaten “the fiscal health of the Nation,” a claim Gillingham deems entirely false. “Renewables cost something, but they create jobs and generate clean energy.”

“Our workforce is growing, businesses are expanding, and communities are saving money with consistent, reliable energy,” explains Bill Johnson, the owner of Brilliant Harvest, a Florida solar company, but the legislation and subsequent order put that progress at risk, he says.

The order, Keefe told me, suggests that the administration “either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that solar, wind, and batteries are the cheapest, quickest, made-in-America energy we can deploy.”

And although Trump questions the reliability of renewables, Gillingham insists that “at the levels of renewable energy we have today, we have nothing to worry about.” He adds, “If anything, adding more renewable capacity could help us meet additional electricity demand.”

As for the notion that the renewable energy market is “dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries,” well, sure, China dominates the sector, but that’s the result of supportive policies, Gillingham says—and the policies Trump is targeting were enacted to help US firms compete: “We would have to support our clean energy industries if we wanted to increase our share of clean energy manufacturing.”

Solar company stocks took a hit after the order was released. Gillingham says “the combination of high tariffs and removing the tax credits is a one-two punch that will greatly suppress the market for renewable energy.”

Johnson, the renewable energy businessman, concurs: “These federal policies create uncertainty [which] threatens to stall projects already in the pipeline and make it harder to keep building here at home.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25189618341984.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:01.540664

Trump’s EO Ends Support for “Unreliable” Green Energy

Trump’s administration labeled these renewable sources as unreliable, expensive, and overly dependent on foreign supply chains. According to Trump, clean energy policies threaten U.S. national security, disrupt the electric grid, and harm the natural environment.

This executive order marks a major reversal from the direction set by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Democrats, which offered strong incentives for clean energy projects.

Now, Trump’s energy policy shifts back to conventional energy sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear—those he calls “reliable and dispatchable.” His administration argues that green energy has received unfair advantages and is weakening the nation’s energy system.

Tax Breaks for Renewables Face the Axe

As part of the executive order, the Treasury Department is now required to end tax credits for wind and solar production. It must also apply stricter rules concerning foreign-controlled companies involved in renewable energy supply chains.

In addition, the Interior Department must revise current policies that have so far favored renewables, such as streamlined permitting and lease arrangements. Both agencies have 45 days to submit detailed reports of their actions to the White House.

Moreover, the order freezes new permits and approvals for wind energy projects, especially offshore developments. Until a full government review is completed, federal agencies are barred from issuing new loans or contracts for wind projects. This decision creates immediate uncertainty in a sector that has been growing rapidly due to both state and federal commitments.

Wind Power at Risk: What’s at Stake

As per EIA, currently, wind energy plays a vital role in the U.S. electricity mix, contributing about 10% of the nation’s power, making it the largest single source of renewable energy. In states like Iowa and South Dakota, wind supplies more than half of all electricity.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, over 131,000 Americans are employed in wind energy-related jobs. These workers now face an uncertain future as federal support for their industry is scaled back.

Under the new law, developers will only be able to claim tax benefits for wind and solar projects if construction begins before the end of 2026. Furthermore, these projects must be completed and placed in service by the end of 2027.

Previously, developers could rely on tax incentives through 2032 under the 30% tax credit program. The shorter timeline could discourage companies from launching new renewable projects due to the higher financial risks and increased upfront costs.

Offshore Wind Goals in Limbo for States

This dramatic shift in policy could most severely impact states with ambitious climate targets. For instance, New York aims to install nine gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2035, enough to power roughly six million homes. The state has already invested heavily in infrastructure and workforce development to support this target.

Similarly, New Jersey plans to develop 11 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2040 and transition to a 100% clean energy power sector by 2050.

Offshore wind was a central pillar in both states’ strategies. Now, with federal support in question, these states may be forced to revise their energy roadmaps or find alternative funding solutions. Several state officials have already expressed concerns that their clean energy timelines may slip, which could push critical emissions targets further into the future.

Solar Slowdown: Cheap Power Faces New Roadblocks

The clean energy sector, especially solar, has made remarkable progress in lowering costs. Today, solar energy is one of the cheapest sources of new electricity in the United States. However, despite falling prices, large-scale projects still rely heavily on financial incentives to offset their high upfront expenses.

According to Wood Mackenzie, the U.S. solar industry installed 10.8 gigawatts (GWdc) of new capacity in Q1 2025. This was a 7% drop compared to Q1 2024 and a 43% decrease from Q4 2024.

If these federal benefits are removed, it could significantly slow the pace of new solar developments. It may also discourage private investors at a time when international competition in green energy is heating up.

What’s Next for U.S. Energy Policy Under Trump?

Supporters of the move believe that Trump’s new policy will help restore American energy independence and reduce unnecessary government spending. His energy policy puts the spotlight back on fossil fuels and nuclear power. On his first day back, he declared a “National Energy Emergency” aimed at eliminating what he calls bureaucratic barriers to energy production.

Fossil Fuels Back in the Spotlight

So, as part of this plan, he established the National Energy Dominance Council, which will focus on increasing fossil fuel production, attracting private investment, and accelerating domestic energy production.

According to Trump, returning to traditional energy sources will strengthen the economy, create well-paying jobs, reduce trade deficits, and improve the U.S. position on the global stage.

A Major Clean Energy Setback

Countries across Europe and Asia are increasing their investments in renewables, treating green energy as both an environmental and economic priority.

According to the IEA’s World Energy Investment 2025 report, global energy investment is projected to reach $3.3 trillion in 2025.

Out of this, approximately $2.2 trillion will go toward clean energy sources like renewables, nuclear, power grids, storage, low-emission fuels, energy efficiency, and electrification. That’s twice the amount, around $1.1 trillion, allocated to fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal.

So if the U.S. steps back from clean energy leadership, it could fall behind in both technology development and global market share.

Thus, critics warn that this approach overlooks the long-term risks of continued reliance on fossil fuels, especially in a world already experiencing the impact of climate change.

Many cities, companies, and even Republican-led states have embraced renewables, not just for environmental reasons but also for economic growth. Pulling back federal support now, they say, risks stalling progress and undermining years of clean energy investment.

The Bottom Line: U.S. Climate Goals at Crossroads

In the near term, this executive order is expected to cause major uncertainty across the wind and solar industries. Projects currently in the pipeline could be delayed or canceled entirely.

Developers who had planned on receiving federal tax credits now face stricter deadlines and higher costs. Meanwhile, states will need to reevaluate their clean energy goals and consider alternative funding methods to stay on track.

Over the next several months, federal agencies will begin to implement the executive order. Their decisions and the public and state-level responses will shape the future of U.S. energy policy. Whether this move marks a new era of energy dominance or a costly detour from climate leadership remains to be seen.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2551753511.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:30.918212

Stronger storms often lead to more damage and higher insurance rates.

The aerodynamic shape of Tener's home is built to reduce wind pressure by 30%. Inside, trusses fan out like spokes on a bicycle wheel, distributing storm forces to help keep the roof in place.

""You worry about the wind blowing off the roof,"" Tener said of the main concerns for any home during a hurricane. ""You worry about the rain. And you worry about flooding.""

Anchored deep into the ground, the home also includes flood vents to relieve water pressure and protect the foundation. With these features, the house is rated to withstand 190-mile-per-hour winds — a very strong Category 5 hurricane.

""The inspector, when he came and inspected, he says, 'If we have a hurricane, I'm coming here,'"" Tener said.

A different kind of builder

Tener's home was built by Deltec Homes, a family-run company based in Asheville, North Carolina. The company has built more than 5,000 homes around the world, many designed specifically for resilience in extreme weather.

""We're taking that great shape and we're pairing it with amazing materials,"" said Matt Oblinsky, Deltec's lead engineer. The company estimates its homes cost about 10% more than traditional construction, but they often fare far better in storms. ""We're 99% successful,"" Oblinsky said of the homes' performance in past hurricanes. But he adds a note of caution: ""There's no such thing as a hurricane-proof home. We're very careful to say these are hurricane-resistant.""

Testing the limits

At the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) in South Carolina, engineers are working to make both new and existing homes more resilient. Using a massive wall of over 100 fans, the institute can simulate a Category 3 hurricane to test how well homes hold up under intense conditions.

In essence, IBHS builds homes and then destroys them.

And we do it all in the name of science,"" said Sarah Dillingham, senior meteorologist at IBHS.

The tests often reveal the vulnerabilities that can lead to catastrophic damage.

""Your roof is your first line of defense,"" Dillingham said. ""And it is what helps hold everything together in your home.""

She recommends storm-ready upgrades like high-impact windows, reinforced doors, and — crucially — wind-rated garage doors. ""Your garage door is your biggest opening of your home,"" she said. ""Because when wind gets in, it will find the weakest link.""

Longterm savings

For Tener, investing in a storm-resilient home has paid off financially as well. He even canceled his optional flood insurance saving him $12,000 per year.

""You put a little more money into it and it lasts forever,"" he said. ""It pays off in the long run.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/08/dc5b9fb7-3111-4ba3-b18a-4e8715751b4a/thumbnail/1200x630/d9e98a4e0dc4cfc3bf7cc663eadc7c60/f5-hurricane-homes-transfer-frame-2013.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 00:01:23.543838

Once fully operational, the sites will target a liquefaction capacity of up to 540,000 tonnes a year of LNG. This represents an investment of between $240m and $270m across the three facilities.

UE LNG hopes to reach financial close on its first three sites by Q1 2026, with commissioning expected by Q1 2027.

Brian Guinn, CEO of United Energy LNG, said, “By 2028, we aim to operate a network of scalable LNG hubs serving a portfolio of contracted customers across the US.”

The company is targeting a US market opportunity of over two billion cubic feet of natural gas per year, worth more than $3bn.

Fermi, co-founded by Rick Perry, a former U.S. energy secretary, wants to build four AP1000 reactors at a facility it is calling a ""hypergrid."" The up to 11 gigawatt (GW) facility in Amarillo powered by nuclear, natural gas, and renewable energy, is planned near the Department of Energy's Pantex nuclear weapons plant and in partnership with Texas Tech University.

Fermi said in its application at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the regulator made public on July 8, that it is engaging in talks with many Big Tech companies, known as ""hyperscalers,"" on letters of intent and term sheets, or preliminary documents that are usually non-binding.

The application said that the hyperscalers would be tenants, apparently meaning they would not own part of the plants. Fermi did not immediately answer questions about financial arrangements being discussed with Big Tech companies or which or how many hyperscalers it is in talks with.

The last two reactors built in the U.S. were AP1000, completed in Vogtle, Georgia. They cost a total of more than $30 billion, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Those plants were delayed by years and came in billions of dollars above projected costs. But nuclear backers say lessons learned should cut construction time and final costs of the next AP1000 reactors.

Fermi said in the application that the nuclear complex, which it calls the Donald J. Trump Generating Plant, will be eligible for financing from the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office. The only time the president tapped the LPO in his first term was for the Vogtle plants.

The company said other plans to finance construction and operation include equity capital contributions from institutional infrastructure and real estate investors, structured bond offerings, and clean energy tax credits.
