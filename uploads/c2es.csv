In Europe, for example, Tesla’s sales fell over 22% in August (year-on-year), shrinking Tesla’s EU EV market share to ~1.5% [70].
The anticipation alone helped drive Tesla’s stock up 5% on Monday Oct 6 ahead of the reveal [77].
Outlook: The Road Ahead for Tesla As of October 11, 2025, Tesla stands at an important inflection point.
If it stalls (perhaps due to economic factors or insufficient charging infrastructure in some regions), Tesla’s growth could moderate.","Stock Price & Performance: Tesla’s share price recently surged to the mid-$450s (up ~5% in one day on Oct 6) after strong sales news, adding roughly $70+ billion to its market cap [1]. However, after a new product reveal on Oct 7, TSLA slipped about 4% (a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” reaction), settling in the low-$430s by week’s end [2]. As of Oct 10, 2025, the stock trades around $435, near the higher end of its 52-week range ($212 – $488) [3]. Tesla is up roughly 12% year-to-date (lagging the S&P 500’s ~17% gain) and an astounding ~80% in the past 12 months [4] [5]. Daily volatility is high, with 4–5% swings not uncommon in recent sessions [6].

Record Q3 Sales:Tesla shattered delivery records in Q3 2025, handing over 497,099 vehicles worldwide [7] – far above Wall Street’s ~443k estimate [8]. Production was ~447k, meaning Tesla sold more cars than it built by drawing down inventory [9]. The 7% YoY delivery growth was fueled by a last-minute demand surge before the U.S. EV tax credit expiration on Sept 30 [10]. Tesla’s aggressive end-of-quarter discounts and financing deals “pulled forward” buyers to beat the deadline [11]. While investors cheered the blowout sales, analysts cautioned it may steal from Q4 demand now that the $7,500 federal incentive has lapsed [12] [13]. Indeed, TSLA initially dipped ~3% on the delivery report as the market pondered a possible Q4 sales slump [14].

“Affordable” Model Y/3 Launch: On Oct 7, Tesla unveiled new lower-cost “Standard Range” versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, priced at $39,990 and $36,990 respectively [15]. These models offer >300 miles of range on smaller batteries but omit premium features (no Autosteer, rear seat heaters, etc.) to cut costs [16] [17]. CEO Elon Musk pitched the trims as “affordable” Teslas for a broader market, acknowledging many people “don’t have enough money” for pricier EVs [18] [19]. However, investors were underwhelmed – TSLA stock tumbled ~4–4.5% after the announcement [20] [21]. Even bullish analysts like Wedbush’s Dan Ives expressed “disappointment” that prices were only ~$5k lower than existing trims [22] [23]. The consensus: this was “a pricing lever, not a product catalyst,” unlikely to unlock massive new demand [24] [25]. Many experts say Tesla “needs a sub-$30k EV” to truly expand its market long-term [26].

Analyst Sentiment & Targets: Wall Street’s view on TSLA is highly divided. Big-name bulls remain optimistic: Morgan Stanley recently reiterated an Overweight (Buy) rating with a $410 target [27], Piper Sandler hiked its target from $400 to $500 [28], and Wedbush’s Dan Ives is all the way up at $600, one of the Street’s highest forecasts [29]. They cite Tesla’s momentum in EVs, software, and energy as justification for a premium valuation [30] [31]. However, the average 12-month price target is only ~$351, implying analysts on the whole think the stock is overvalued at current levels [32]. Roughly half of analysts rate TSLA a Hold or Sell [33], flagging the lofty valuation (~250× earnings) and slowing growth as concerns [34] [35]. Notably, HSBC recently stuck to a “Reduce” (Sell) rating and a mere $127 target despite the strong Q3 sales – implying ~70% downside [36]. In short, sentiment ranges from ultra-bullish to deeply skeptical, reflecting Tesla’s polarizing dual identity as both carmaker and high-growth tech play.

Tesla’s Strategic Shifts: Tesla is doubling down on its core EV business while also branching into new frontiers. The company’s energy division just had a record quarter, deploying 12.5 GWh of battery storage (Powerwalls, Megapacks, etc.) – more than all of 2024’s total – signaling rapid growth in Tesla’s solar/storage segment [37]. Musk is also heavily emphasizing AI and automation: Tesla’s vehicles have logged 7+ billion miles on Autopilot/FSD, giving it the world’s largest self-driving dataset [38], and in 2025 Tesla even launched a pilot robotaxi service (using driverless Model Ys in Austin) [39]. Musk touts upcoming Full Self-Driving software updates that feel “almost sentient” [40], and Tesla continues to showcase its “Optimus” humanoid robot prototype – though that remains a longer-term project [41]. On the automotive side, Tesla’s lineup is both expanding “broader and cheaper” (e.g. the new Model Y/3 variants) to fend off competition, and looking ahead to futuristic products (Cybertruck, Robotaxi) and services. Investors are watching whether Tesla can execute on these initiatives without sacrificing margins, as recent price cuts have squeezed profitability (automotive gross margin has slid to mid-single digits) [42]. Overall, Tesla’s current strategy aims to balance near-term growth (via volume and price tweaks) with long-term innovation in AI and clean energy – a tricky but potentially rewarding path.

Recent Stock Performance: From Rally to Pullback

Tesla’s stock has seen dramatic swings in early October 2025. After trading in the low-$400s to start the month, TSLA spiked on October 6 ahead of a big product announcement, jumping ~5.4% in one session to close at $453.25 [43]. That surge – adding over $70 billion in market cap – was fueled by optimism around record Q3 sales and a teased new model. It capped a strong short-term run: Tesla shares climbed roughly 7–8% over the first two weeks of October, outperforming the broader market (the S&P 500 rose more modestly) [44] [45]. Notably, 7 of 10 trading days were positive during that stretch [46]. At mid-$450s, Tesla was trading near its 52-week high (~$488) and more than 50% above its yearly low (~$212) [47]. In fact, over the past 12 months TSLA was up about 81%, a huge run compared to ~17% for the S&P 500 in the same period [48].

However, volatility remains part of Tesla’s story. After the Oct 6 rally, traders turned skittish once details of the new product came out. On Oct 7–8, TSLA pulled back roughly 4% – essentially erasing the early-week pop [49]. The stock dropped from the mid-$450s back to around $430–$435, as investors “sold the news” when Tesla’s “affordable” Model Y/3 pricing disappointed some expectations [50]. By the end of that week, Tesla settled in the low-$430s (still up slightly from a week prior). These whipsaw moves underline Tesla’s elevated volatility: in recent weeks, daily swings of 4–5% have been common [51]. Short-term traders note the stock became overbought after the run-up – technical indicators like RSI signaled stretched conditions [52]. Indeed, TSLA’s relative strength index hit levels that often precede a breather, and some chart analysts pegged support around ~$410 and near-term resistance around ~$530 [53]. In other words, the stock’s momentum is strong, but it wouldn’t be surprising to see consolidation or profit-taking after such a steep rise.

From a broader lens, Tesla’s year-to-date performance is decent but not market-leading. As of early October, TSLA was up roughly 12% in 2025 [54]. That trails the S&P 500 (which is up ~17% YTD) [55], reflecting that Tesla had some choppiness earlier in the year. However, the recent rally significantly boosted Tesla’s market capitalization to around $1.5 trillion [56] – putting it among the world’s top 10 most valuable companies. The stock’s 52-week range (about $212 to $488 [57]) highlights how far it has climbed from last year’s lows, but also the fact that it’s only ~6–10% shy of new all-time highs. This lofty perch means valuation metrics are stretched (more on that later), and it raises the stakes for Tesla to deliver consistently strong results to justify the price. In sum, Tesla’s recent stock performance has been a mix of euphoria and volatility – typical for TSLA – with rapid gains driven by excitement over sales and products, tempered by quick pullbacks whenever reality checks in.

Recent News: Record Q3 Deliveries and New Model Reveals

Tesla kicked off October with headline-grabbing news on multiple fronts. First, on October 2, the company reported record-breaking vehicle delivery numbers for Q3 2025. Tesla delivered 497,099 cars in the quarter [58], an all-time high and well above analyst forecasts in the mid-440k range [59]. This marked about 7.4% growth year-over-year [60], a notable rebound considering Tesla’s deliveries had actually declined YoY in the first half of 2025 amid economic headwinds [61]. The Q3 production figure was ~447k vehicles [62], meaning Tesla sold more cars than it built, drawing down some inventory – a sign of strong demand (at least temporarily). The Model 3 and Model Y remained the workhorses, accounting for the vast majority of sales (over 481k of the 497k) while higher-priced Models S/X and the new Cybertruck comprised the remainder [63].

What drove this Q3 sales surge? In a word: incentives. U.S. buyers rushed to take delivery before a major federal EV subsidy expired on Sept 30. Tesla had been benefiting from a $7,500 federal tax credit on many of its models, but due to how the law was structured (with volume and battery sourcing criteria), that credit was set to phase out for Tesla at the end of Q3 [64]. Knowing this, Tesla “pulled out all the stops” in Q3 – offering discounts, special financing deals, and even running social media ads – to entice customers to buy before the credit vanished [65]. The strategy worked: many would-be buyers hurried to lock in the expiring $7.5k credit, resulting in a huge end-of-quarter sales push [66]. Analysts described it as “pulled-forward” demand – essentially Tesla borrowed sales from the future (Q4) to boost Q3 [67]. An ETF manager, Elliot Johnson, warned this won’t be sustainable, predicting “we could see a soft couple of quarters” ahead [68]. Indeed, Tesla’s stock initially dropped ~3–4% on the delivery report [69], as investors digested the idea that Q4 might slump now that the tax-credit rush is over.

Tesla’s team acknowledged some regional weaknesses despite the record global number. In Europe, for example, Tesla’s sales fell over 22% in August (year-on-year), shrinking Tesla’s EU EV market share to ~1.5% [70]. European consumers are increasingly drawn to a flood of new EV options – including popular plug-in hybrids and lower-cost Chinese-made EVs – forcing Tesla to respond with price cuts and promotions [71]. By contrast, China was a bright spot: strong demand for the refreshed Model Y and a new long-wheelbase Model Y “L” variant helped boost Tesla’s sales in China [72]. (Tesla introduced the Model Y “L” in September specifically to appeal to Chinese families, as part of a strategy to tailor products to local markets [73].) Tesla also notched a win in its energy business during Q3: it deployed 12.5 GWh of battery storage (Powerwall home batteries, grid-scale Megapacks, etc.), exceeding analyst expectations (~11 GWh) and even surpassing the total storage deployment in all of 2024 [74]. This suggests Tesla’s energy segment – often overshadowed by the car business – is scaling quickly, providing a valuable additional revenue stream [75].

Just as the dust settled from the delivery report, Tesla teased a major product announcement for Oct 7, 2025. Over the prior weekend, the company’s official account on X (Twitter) posted cryptic teaser videos – glowing headlights in the dark, a spinning wheel – ending with the date “10/7” [76]. This sparked rampant speculation of a new, more affordable vehicle launch. The anticipation alone helped drive Tesla’s stock up 5% on Monday Oct 6 ahead of the reveal [77]. Come October 7, Tesla indeed unveiled “Standard Range” versions of the Model Y and Model 3, positioned as cheaper trims to broaden the buyer base. The Model Y Standard now starts at $39,990, and the Model 3 Standard at $36,990 [78] – roughly a 15% price reduction compared to the previous base models [79]. To hit these lower price points, Tesla trimmed some features: the Standard versions have slightly smaller batteries (but still ~320 miles of range), slower acceleration, and they lack certain amenities like Tesla’s Autosteer driver assist, rear heated seats, the upgraded audio system, and even minor touches like the LED lightbar on the Model Y [80] [81]. They also come with manual side mirrors and textile (cloth) seats by default, though buyers can pay extra for vegan leather in the Model 3 [82].

Musk’s pitch for these models was straightforward: boosting affordability to counter a tough market. “The desire to buy the car is very high… [it’s] just people don’t have enough money,” Musk said on a prior earnings call, “so the more affordable we can make the car, the better.” [83] By launching sub-$40k versions, Tesla is attempting to revive demand amid sagging sales growth and the loss of U.S. tax credits [84] [85]. Importantly, these new Standard Range cars can be ordered immediately, with deliveries slated to begin in Dec 2025–Jan 2026 in many regions [86] – timing that could help Tesla shore up Q4 and early 2026 sales.

Market reaction, however, was mixed. While some applauded Tesla for finally breaking below the $40k psychological barrier, many analysts felt the move was “not enough” to significantly expand Tesla’s audience [87]. The ~$5,000 price cut versus prior base models was seen as relatively small – “basically a pricing lever and not much of a product catalyst,” as Futurum Research strategist Shay Boloor put it [88] [89]. The fear is that these “affordable” Teslas might simply prompt existing Tesla intenders to choose a cheaper trim (cannibalizing some higher-trim sales) rather than bringing new budget-conscious buyers into the fold [90] [91]. Wedbush’s Dan Ives (a longtime Tesla bull) bluntly said he was “disappointed” by the modest price drop, expecting more aggressive cuts to fend off competitors [92]. Meanwhile, Shawn Campbell of Camelthorn Investments argued “I just don’t know that this is enough… Tesla needs a sub-$30k EV” to truly counter the onslaught of lower-cost Chinese models globally [93]. On Wall Street, traders had largely priced in a big announcement, so when the news proved incremental, TSLA’s stock fell ~4.5% on Oct 7 [94]. Essentially, the market “bought the rumor, sold the news” – Tesla’s huge rally earlier that week was given back once details emerged [95].

Despite the initial stock dip, Tesla executives likely view the Standard Range launch as a strategic pivot to defend market share. It shows Tesla is willing to sacrifice some margin for volume, which could be crucial as EV competition heats up. The move also anticipates new rivals: for instance, GM’s Chevrolet is launching an Equinox EV around ~$30k in 2024–25, and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 and Kia’s EV4 are targeting similar segments [96]. By pricing just under $40k, Tesla at least narrows the gap. Still, some industry watchers nicknamed Tesla’s approach as “dropping its Steve Jobs turtleneck for a Walmart hoodie” – i.e. Tesla shedding a bit of its premium aura to play in the mass market [97]. One investment officer quipped that Tesla is “no longer the cool rebel at the edge of innovation – it’s the establishment trying to play both Tesla and Toyota at once.” [98] Time will tell if this balancing act pays off by boosting unit sales without diluting Tesla’s brand or profits.

Analyst Ratings and Market Sentiment: Bulls vs. Bears

Tesla is one of the most polarizing stocks on Wall Street, and the recent developments have only amplified the divide between bulls and bears. Optimistic analysts (“bulls”) view Tesla not just as a car company but as a transformational tech leader spanning electric vehicles, software, and energy – a narrative reinforced by the Q3 delivery beat and new product momentum. For example, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed its Overweight (Buy) rating right after the blowout delivery report, keeping a $410 price target [99]. Morgan Stanley’s lead auto analyst Adam Jonas highlighted Tesla’s “strong momentum” and multi-pronged growth engines (EV market dominance, Full Self-Driving software potential, and a booming energy storage business) as reasons Tesla can justify a rich valuation [100] [101]. Similarly, Piper Sandler’s team (led by Alexander Potter) has been bullish – they reportedly raised their TSLA target from $400 to $500 in late September while maintaining an overweight stance [102]. And perhaps the most outspoken bull, Dan Ives of Wedbush, is at the high end with a ~$600 price target [103]. Ives believes Tesla’s recent catalysts (the record deliveries, new cheaper Model Y, progress in AI/robotaxis) could significantly boost long-term earnings power [104]. These bullish analysts argue Tesla is far more than an automaker – pointing to its vast trove of driving data (over 7 billion miles on Autopilot) and its subscription-like revenue from software and energy products as evidence that Tesla can eventually deliver higher-margin tech/services revenue alongside car sales [105] [106]. Firms like Cantor Fitzgerald have likewise chimed in, recently reiterating an Overweight rating and praising Tesla’s execution after the delivery surprise [107]. In short, the bull camp believes Tesla’s growth story is intact and expanding – and that its hefty valuation will be earned as the company grows into new markets (energy, autonomous ride-hailing, possibly robotics).

On the flip side, a large segment of analysts take a cautious or neutral stance, and a minority are firmly bearish. As of early October, the consensus 12-month price target for Tesla was only about $351 [108]. With the stock hovering around $450, that implies the average analyst sees ~20–25% downside risk from current prices [109] [110]. Ratings-wise, the Street is roughly split down the middle: out of ~34 major analysts covering Tesla, about 11 rate it a Buy, 16 as Hold, and 7 as Sell [111]. Those in the neutral camp often acknowledge Tesla’s strengths and recent wins but express concern that expectations have run ahead of fundamentals. One illustrative data point: Tesla’s trailing 12-month revenue (~$93 billion) was actually down ~12% year-over-year (due to earlier slowdowns and price cuts), even as the stock price climbed, leading to what one report called an “extreme valuation expansion.” [112] In concrete terms, Tesla is trading around 250 times earnings and ~16–17 times sales – sky-high multiples that assume significant future growth [113] [114]. By comparison, other carmakers trade at single-digit P/Es, and even most tech giants trade at a fraction of Tesla’s valuation. Margin pressure is another worry: with all the price reductions, Tesla’s vehicle gross profit margins have fallen from around 25%+ a year ago to the mid-teens or even single digits now [115]. (Some estimates put Tesla’s automotive gross margin ex-credits in the high single digits in recent quarters [116].) Slower growth + thinner margins = caution for these analysts, who fear Tesla might not meet the lofty earnings implied by its stock price.

Bearish analysts take it a step further, arguing that Tesla is dramatically overvalued and could have a nasty come-down. A notable example is HSBC, which in October reiterated a “Reduce” (Sell) rating. After the strong delivery report, HSBC did raise its price target – but only to $127 [117]. That’s essentially saying Tesla’s stock could fall over 70%. The bear case typically asserts that Tesla’s growth is maturing and facing headwinds: competition is eroding its market share (as seen in Europe’s decline), Tesla’s repeated price cuts indicate demand needs artificial boosting, and if you value Tesla more like a normal automaker (even a premium one), the current valuation is absurdly high [118] [119]. Bears also point to Tesla’s reliance on regulatory credits to pad profits and the possibility that as EV markets mature, Tesla’s first-mover advantage will shrink. Some skeptics are wary of Elon Musk’s unpredictable management style as a risk factor – for instance, concern that Musk’s other ventures (SpaceX, running X/Twitter, etc.) could distract him, or that his cavalier approach to things like timelines and regulatory issues might backfire. Overall, the bearish view is that Tesla’s stock price already reflects “perfection” – any stumble in execution or demand could lead to a major correction.

This stark divergence in views is encapsulated by the extremely wide range of analyst price targets: from about $120 on the low end to $600 on the high end [120] [121]. Such a spread is highly unusual for a company of Tesla’s size and speaks to the unique nature of Tesla’s investment thesis. Is it a high-growth tech disrupter that will double its value with new businesses, or a highly valued car company that could crash back to earth? At present, the average target of ~$351 implies many analysts think TSLA has overshot its fundamentals by ~20-30% [122] [123]. Those fundamentals will be tested soon – Tesla’s Q3 financial results in late October and any guidance about Q4 demand will be key inputs for analysts updating their models [124]. For now, sentiment remains split, and Tesla’s stock continues to trade on future potential vs. present reality, depending on whom you ask.

Expert Commentary and Forecasts

Amid the analyst debates, financial experts and commentators have been offering insight into Tesla’s future performance. On the bullish side, many point to Tesla’s expanding opportunities in software and services. “Tesla’s dominant position in EVs, first-mover advantage in autonomy, and burgeoning energy business support its extraordinary valuation,” noted one analysis [125]. Bulls often highlight cross-platform synergies – for instance, Tesla’s ability to leverage data and AI from its car fleet into other areas like self-driving taxis or even robots, and to use its automotive scale to grow its stationary battery business. These unique combinations, they argue, make Tesla more than the sum of its parts and justify thinking of it as a high-growth tech platform rather than a car company.

On the cautious side, some experts flag Tesla’s recent financial trends as a sign of overextension. One report observed that Tesla’s revenue growth has stalled relative to its stock price – in fact, trailing 12-month revenue slightly declined (due to earlier delivery dips and pricing actions) while the stock ran up, leading to an unsustainable spike in valuation multiples [126]. That same report pointed out Tesla’s P/E above 250 and price-to-sales ~17, calling it an “eye-watering” valuation more fitting a cloud software company than a manufacturer [127]. To put it in perspective, even looking ahead a few years: Bloomberg analysts project Tesla might earn around $5.5 billion in annual profit by 2028, and if one applied a generous tech-sector P/E of 20× to that, it would only imply a $150–$250 stock price – far below today’s $450+ [128] [129]. This kind of exercise underscores why some value-focused investors think TSLA could halve in price if growth disappoints [130]. On the flip side, the most optimistic forecasts see Tesla doubling from here if things like robotaxi networks or mass-market cars take off and dramatically boost earnings [131] [132]. Such extreme outcomes – both up and down – are what make Tesla such a hot topic; it’s a high-reward, high-risk story.

We also heard direct commentary from Tesla’s Q3 delivery fallout. Elliot Johnson of Evolve ETFs, as mentioned, cautioned that the Q3 surge was not likely sustainable and that “we could see a soft couple of quarters” ahead as the pulled-ahead demand leaves a gap [133]. Regarding the new Standard models, Shay Boloor (Futurum Equities) commented that Tesla’s move is “not unlocking new demand at scale” and is more of a one-time pricing adjustment [134]. Dan Ives (Wedbush) – normally very bullish – voiced rare disappointment, essentially saying Tesla underwhelmed with only a minor price trim when expectations were higher [135]. On the other hand, some experts see the lower-priced models as necessary chess moves. “Dropping below $40k will help drive sales as [Tesla] competes next year with Chevy’s Equinox EV, Hyundai, Kia, etc.,” one investor noted [136], even if they hoped for a bigger cut to <$30k. There’s also acknowledgment that Tesla’s execution in Q3 was impressive – nearly 500k deliveries in a quarter was once unimaginable for an EV company. “Nearly 500k deliveries in a quarter is unprecedented for an EV maker,” as one commentator noted, adding that it shows Tesla can deliver volume when it pulls the right levers (in this case, incentives and pricing) [137].

Looking ahead, expert forecasts diverge mainly on whether Tesla can maintain its growth and expand into new markets fast enough to justify its valuation. Bulls like ARK Invest (Cathie Wood’s firm) – not quoted above but known publicly – have extremely high long-term targets based on scenarios of Tesla dominating autonomous ride-hailing and other fields. More conventional bulls, as we saw, peg upside around $500–600 if things go well [138]. Bears use more traditional models and often come out with targets in the low $100s (or even double-digit stock prices) if Tesla’s growth slows or if it gets valued more like an automaker. Many neutral analysts are in the $250–$350 range, essentially betting Tesla will execute decently but not perfectly. A key near-term factor will be Tesla’s Q3 earnings report on Oct 18 (and any guidance given) – analysts will parse margins, any commentary on order backlogs post-tax-credit, and Tesla’s cost management, especially with these new lower-priced vehicles in the mix. Additionally, Tesla’s 2025 outlook (perhaps hinted at in January’s Investor Day or in guidance) will shape forecasts: if Musk and team guide to reaccelerating growth (perhaps with the Cybertruck ramp or a next-gen vehicle), bulls will feel vindicated; if they emphasize margin and moderate growth, the valuation concerns could grow.

In summary, expert opinions range from “Tesla will continue to conquer new markets and justify its sky-high valuation” to “Tesla’s stock is due for a reality check.” This dynamic tension in forecasts is part of why Tesla’s stock is so volatile – news that supports one side or the other (e.g. a big beat or miss, a new product reveal, etc.) can swing market sentiment sharply. For the average observer, it’s wise to recognize that Tesla’s future is hard to pigeonhole: it has elements of an auto business, a tech company, and even a renewable energy utility. As one report put it, Tesla encapsulates a “dual nature: part established automaker, part speculative tech disruptor.” [139] This duality will likely continue to drive debate among experts and keep Tesla a closely watched stock.

Tesla’s Strategic Direction: EVs, Energy, AI, and More

Underpinning both the bull and bear cases is Tesla’s multifaceted strategic direction. The company is not standing still – it’s simultaneously pushing the envelope in technology and adjusting its core business strategy in the face of competition.

Electric Vehicles (EVs) remain Tesla’s core, and here the strategy has evolved in 2025 to defend its market lead. Tesla once rarely advertised or cut prices due to overwhelming demand; now it’s entering a phase of competitive pricing and product segmentation. The launch of the Standard Range models is a prime example – Tesla is willing to trim features and margin to broaden its customer base, signaling a more pragmatic, volume-driven approach as the EV market matures. Tesla is also tailoring cars to regions: e.g., the Model Y “L” variant in China (a longer-wheelbase Model Y to cater to Chinese families) [140], and constant software updates to adapt to local needs (charging standards, languages, etc.). On the horizon is the Cybertruck, Tesla’s futuristic pickup, which finally started deliveries in limited numbers (reportedly ~52,000 units sold since its late-2023 debut, which is modest) [141]. The Cybertruck is part of Tesla’s strategy to enter new segments (pickups, which are huge in the U.S.) and showcase engineering innovation (its stainless-steel body and novel design). However, its slow initial ramp shows Tesla faces challenges scaling completely new models. Musk has hinted at even more vehicles: a next-generation “$25k car” (often dubbed the Model 2 by fans) and a purpose-built robotaxi vehicle. In the recent earnings calls, Musk tempered expectations by noting a $25k personal car isn’t a priority (focusing on robotaxi development instead) [142] [143]. Tesla says an actual robotaxi vehicle (with no steering wheel) might debut around 2026, but that’s still speculative. In sum, Tesla’s automotive strategy is two-pronged: maintain dominance in premium EVs (with continuous improvements to Models S,3,X,Y and new high-end tech like Plaid drivetrains), and expand into new niches and price points to keep growth going (trucks, cheaper cars, etc.).

Beyond cars, Tesla’s Energy & Storage division is becoming a bigger part of the strategy. Q3’s record 12.5 GWh of battery storage deployments [144] highlight that Tesla is effectively building a second business alongside automotive. Products like the Megapack (a large battery for utilities) are in high demand from power companies and large facilities aiming to store renewable energy. In fact, Tesla’s Q3 storage deployments beat Wall Street estimates by ~14% [145], and even exceeded what Tesla installed in all of last year [146]. Musk and CFO Zach Kirkhorn have often said that Tesla’s energy business could one day rival its automotive business in size. The strategy here is to leverage Tesla’s battery know-how and scale (from making car batteries) into grid storage and home energy. This provides a more stable revenue source (energy contracts can have long-term orders) and helps even out the cyclicality of auto sales. It also aligns with Tesla’s mission of accelerating sustainable energy. By investing in more battery production (the Nevada Gigafactory expansion, a new cathode facility in Texas, etc.), Tesla is ensuring it has the capacity to grow both the car and energy sides. Analysts note that a booming energy segment could stabilize Tesla’s margins over time, since software and services can be layered on (e.g., Tesla’s Autobidder software that helps utilities manage energy storage) [147]. Tesla’s solar panel/roof business is also part of this division, though it’s been relatively quiet – solar installations are steady but not growing explosively. The bigger focus is on stationary battery packs, where Tesla sees huge global demand as grids transition to renewables.

Arguably the most exciting (and controversial) aspect of Tesla’s strategy is its focus on Artificial Intelligence and autonomous technology. Musk has famously said “Tesla is as much an AI company as it is a car company.” In practice, this means Tesla is pouring resources into its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, its Dojo supercomputer (a custom AI training computer to process video data from Tesla cars), and even AI robotics. In 2025, Tesla’s FSD Beta is still classified as a Level 2 driver assist (the human driver must remain attentive), but Musk insists they are inching towards higher autonomy. He recently hyped FSD version 14, hinting it might make cars feel “almost sentient” [148] – an exaggeration perhaps, but indicative of Tesla’s rapid software iterations. Tesla has a unique strategy of deploying beta self-driving features to hundreds of thousands of customers, collecting massive amounts of real-world driving data (over 7 billion miles driven on Autopilot/FSD to date) [149]. This data feeds Tesla’s AI models to improve the system. In mid-2025, Tesla even launched a pilot robotaxi service in Austin, Texas – essentially letting a small fleet of Model Ys with FSD give rides with no human driver, within a limited geo-fenced area [150]. While still very early (and with safety personnel overseeing), it marked one of the first attempts at a commercial driverless ride-hailing service by an automaker [151]. Tesla’s strategy contrasts with players like Waymo or Cruise, which use custom hardware and have limited operations; Tesla is betting it can achieve autonomy via consumer cars that double as robotaxis. Regulators remain cautious – no country yet allows full Level 5 autonomy at scale, and U.S. regulators (NHTSA) are investigating Tesla’s Autopilot safety in some contexts [152]. But Musk’s vision is that once the tech and regulatory pieces fall into place, Tesla could activate a vast robotaxi network, generating revenue from rides (think of Teslas earning money for owners while they’re not in use). This potential is a key part of Tesla’s long-term strategy and one reason some investors value it like a tech company.

Tesla is also exploring humanoid robots with its Optimus prototype, revealed in 2022 and updated in 2023. In 2025, Optimus is still in development, but Musk occasionally shows progress (videos of the robot walking, picking up objects). The strategy here is leveraging Tesla’s AI (vision, neural nets, actuators from car manufacturing) to eventually create robots for factory work or other tasks. It’s a moonshot project – not contributing to revenue now – but it underscores Tesla’s willingness to invest in futuristic tech that could pay off in the long run. Musk even said the humanoid robot market might become bigger than the car market someday. While that’s speculative, it’s clear Tesla wants to be at the forefront of AI-driven robotics, not just vehicles.

Finally, Tesla’s strategy involves heavy vertical integration and investment in manufacturing to support all the above. The company continues to expand its Gigafactories (a new plant in Monterrey, Mexico is planned, as well as expansion of the Nevada and Texas factories). It produces its own batteries (with Panasonic and others as partners) and is developing in-house battery chemistries (like 4680 cells) to improve range and reduce costs. Tesla’s ability to control much of its supply chain (from software down to many hardware components) is a strategic advantage that it’s carrying into new areas – for example, designing its own AI chips for self-driving (the FSD computer and Dojo chips) rather than relying on third parties. This integration often lets Tesla move faster or achieve better efficiency, though it also means it shoulders more of the upfront R&D costs.

In summary, Tesla’s strategic direction in late 2025 is a blend of offense and defense: offensively pushing into new realms like AI services, robotaxis, energy storage, and perhaps one day robots, while defensively cutting prices and expanding its product lineup to protect its EV lead against a growing pack of competitors. It’s a lot to juggle, and it explains why Tesla’s story is both exciting and, at times, concerning to investors. The company is effectively rewriting the playbook for what an automaker can be, aiming to be a renewable energy and technology powerhouse. Success in even a few of these domains could justify bulls’ optimism; stumbling in them could validate the skeptics. Tesla’s strategic bets will be critical to watch as we head into 2026 and beyond.

Competitive Landscape: Tesla vs. Automakers and Tech Rivals

Tesla’s rise has spurred virtually every automaker in the world to race toward electric vehicles, and that competition is now intensifying markedly. In 2025, Tesla still leads in many metrics – it’s often the top seller of EVs in markets like the U.S. and Europe, and it enjoys better profit margins on EVs than most peers – but the gap is closing.

U.S. competition: Legacy giants General Motors and Ford have rolled out high-profile EVs (e.g. Ford’s F-150 Lightning electric pickup, GM’s Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Chevy Bolt/Equinox EV, etc.). While none has matched Tesla’s sales yet, they are starting to nibble at various segments. However, these companies face their own challenges: in 2025 both GM and Ford saw slowing EV sales growth and even pulled back some targets, citing supply chain issues and weaker demand than expected. They also dealt with a major UAW labor strike in 2025, which disrupted production and could raise their labor costs, potentially affecting their EV rollouts. Tesla, notably, is not unionized and didn’t face that issue, which some analysts view as a competitive cost advantage (though it’s a point of contention socially). Rivian and Lucid, two U.S. EV startups, also compete in the high-end space. Rivian’s electric trucks/SUVs have gotten good reviews but are still produced in modest volumes (perhaps ~50k/year), and Lucid’s luxury sedans are niche and pricey. So in the U.S., Tesla’s main competition in 2025 is actually coming from future models promised by the big automakers (like Chevy’s ~$30k Equinox EV or Ford’s next-gen crossovers) rather than any one model beating Tesla’s Model 3/Y in sales right now. But Tesla’s U.S. market share in EVs has slipped from its near-monopoly a few years ago as more models enter – consumers can now choose a Mustang Mach-E, a Kia EV6, etc., whereas before Tesla was one of few options. This is partly why Tesla has been cutting prices in the U.S., to stay ahead of new entrants.

China competition: The fiercest EV battlefield is China, the world’s largest auto market. Here, Tesla faces dozens of competitors, from established players to startups, often with backing from tech giants or the government. The standout is BYD, which has become an EV powerhouse. BYD sells EVs (and plug-in hybrids) at a variety of price points – many models undercut Tesla on price in China, and BYD’s yearly sales (including hybrids) are on par with or higher than Tesla’s global sales. BYD is selling roughly 3 million vehicles annually (many of them in the affordable segment) [153] [154]. Tesla’s response has been to repeatedly cut prices in China on models like the Model Y, to the point where its cars have at times been cheaper in China than in the U.S. for identical configurations. Despite that, Tesla’s China sales have grown, but market share is tough to hold because domestic brands are so numerous (NIO, Xpeng, Li Auto, Geely’s Zeekr, SAIC’s brands, etc.). Chinese EV makers have also started expanding globally – for instance, BYD and NIO are entering Europe with compelling models. This is significant: Tesla’s rumored $25k car or the new Model Y Standard are essentially aimed at countering the BYD effect – i.e., the rise of sub-$30k electric cars that could flood markets worldwide [155] [156]. China was a strong point for Tesla in Q3 thanks to the refreshed Model Y and a localized strategy, but it’s a constant fight. The Chinese government’s policies also play a role: they had EV subsidies that were reduced in 2023, sparking a price war (which Tesla participated in). Now China’s economy has been a bit shaky (property market issues, etc.), so demand isn’t unlimited. Tesla navigates this by producing very efficiently at Giga Shanghai (which is one of Tesla’s most cost-efficient plants) and exporting some output to Europe and other Asian markets when Chinese demand softens.

Europe competition: Europe is a mature auto market with strong domestic brands, and they’ve aggressively pushed into EVs, partly due to EU emissions regulations. Companies like Volkswagen Group (VW, Audi, Porsche, etc.), BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis (Peugeot, Fiat, etc.), and newcomers like Hyundai/Kia (Korea) are all vying for European EV buyers. Europe also has several EV incentives and mandates (though some subsidies have been reduced recently [157]). Tesla’s market share in Europe has seen pressure: as noted, its share fell to around 1.5% in the EU for new car sales, after a sharp drop in its European deliveries in Q3 [158]. Part of that was the winding down of backlogged orders and increased local competition. Notably, European consumers have many choices under €30k that Tesla doesn’t match – e.g. the Renault Zoe, VW ID.3 (with subsidies), various smaller EVs, and even plug-in hybrids which remain popular (and Tesla doesn’t make any hybrids) [159] [160]. Additionally, some analysts speculate that Musk’s polarizing public persona (political comments on X, etc.) may have dented Tesla’s brand in parts of Europe, which is generally more climate-conscious and sometimes put off by controversy [161]. To fight back, Tesla opened a factory in Germany (Giga Berlin) to localize production of Model Y and eventually Model 3, which helps avoid import tariffs and improves delivery times. It also slashed prices in Europe multiple times in 2023–25. Still, as of late 2025, Tesla is facing an “EV price war” in Europe too, especially with a wave of Chinese-made EVs starting to hit Europe (brands like MG, BYD, NIO) and with European incumbents offering lease deals and incentives. Tesla’s new standard models and any future cheaper car will be crucial for Europe, where a significant chunk of the market is below €35k – a segment Tesla hasn’t played in until now.

Tech company competition: While no tech giant directly sells EVs yet (Apple’s long-rumored car is not out; Google’s Waymo is focusing on self-driving tech, not selling cars), Tesla often finds itself compared to or competing with tech firms in specific areas. For example, in autonomous driving, Waymo (Google) and Cruise (GM, but run like a tech startup) are rivals in creating robotaxi services. In 2023–2025, Waymo and Cruise began offering limited robo-taxi rides in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. However, they hit some roadblocks – for instance, in late 2023, Cruise’s permit was suspended in San Francisco after some safety incidents. Waymo is methodical but slow, expanding carefully. This actually made Tesla’s approach look better to some investors, because Tesla avoids the regulatory bottleneck by selling “self-driving” to consumers rather than operating public taxis (so far) [162] [163]. Apple is another potential competitor – while no Apple Car exists yet, the tech giant has poached Tesla engineers and reportedly aims to launch an autonomous EV later in the decade. If Apple or others succeed, Tesla would be competing on tech, brand, and ecosystem (imagine an Apple car integrated with iOS – Tesla would need to match that experience). In the energy space, Tesla’s competitors include battery makers and industrial firms (like LG, Panasonic – though Panasonic is also a partner – and energy storage firms like Fluence). But Tesla’s brand recognition in energy isn’t as strong as in cars, so it’s carving its niche with the Megapack which currently is selling as fast as they can make them.

Overall, the competitive landscape means Tesla can’t rest on its laurels. This is evident from its changing tactics: more frequent pricing adjustments (in 2023–25, Tesla cut prices globally dozens of times, something it rarely did before), actual marketing efforts (Tesla has started running ads for the first time in its history, albeit small-scale, and Musk said in 2023 they’d “try a little advertising”), and focus on cost-cutting to preserve margins while prices fall. It’s a new phase – for years Tesla demand outstripped supply; now supply is catching up industry-wide, and Tesla must compete for each sale. The good news for Tesla is that the overall EV market is growing – EVs are now ~15% of new car sales worldwide and climbing [164]. As the pie grows, Tesla can grow even if its slice gets a bit smaller percentage-wise. But Tesla’s lofty valuation is predicated on being a dominant leader, so the company is clearly fighting to retain an edge. Its scale (expected ~1.8 million+ deliveries in 2025), strong brand, and technology lead (especially in software and charging network) are advantages that competitors respect. In fact, Ford, GM, and others agreed in 2023–24 to adopt Tesla’s charging plug standard (NACS) for their EVs – effectively bowing to Tesla’s superior charging network. Moves like that indicate Tesla is still setting industry norms. Yet, competition will only intensify from here, so Tesla’s next steps – whether it’s launching that $25k car, continuing to cut prices, or innovating in autonomy – will be crucial to maintain its position in an increasingly crowded field.

Macroeconomic and Policy Factors Influencing TSLA

While company-specific news often grabs headlines, broader macroeconomic trends and government policies play a big role in Tesla’s performance and valuation. Here are a few key factors as of late 2025:

Interest Rates and Economic Climate: After a period of high inflation and rapid interest rate hikes in 2022–2024, the macro backdrop in 2025 is at a turning point. High-growth stocks like Tesla are sensitive to interest rates because higher rates reduce the present value of future earnings (and Tesla’s valuation depends on big profits years from now). Throughout 2023 and into 2024, as central banks raised rates, growth stocks saw pressure. By October 2025, however, there’s a growing hope that the Federal Reserve is done hiking rates – and might even cut rates in 2026 if inflation continues to cool [165] [166]. This prospect has improved sentiment for tech and growth stocks broadly, Tesla included. Indeed, part of Tesla’s strong stock rebound in 2023–25 was due to a market-wide shift back into tech/growth as investors anticipated a peak in rates. Additionally, the U.S. economy showed resilience (no official recession through 2025, unemployment stayed relatively low), which meant consumer spending on big-ticket items like cars held up reasonably well. That said, borrowing costs are still much higher than a few years ago – auto loan rates in 2025 are significantly above those in 2020. For a company like Tesla that sells cars averaging $50k, high interest rates are a headwind because they make monthly payments more expensive for consumers. Tesla has addressed this by offering its own discounted financing deals (e.g. low APR promotions via Tesla Financing) to spur sales [167]. Going forward, if the economy stays solid or interest rates begin to ease, it’s a tailwind for Tesla – more affordable financing and a risk-on attitude in markets. Conversely, any economic downturn or credit crunch would quickly hit auto demand (cars are discretionary purchases for many) and could make investors less willing to pay high multiples for Tesla’s stock. So far, Tesla navigated the post-pandemic chip shortage and inflation period by cutting costs and prices to keep volume growing. It will continue to be influenced by macro trends like GDP growth, consumer confidence, and interest rate moves.

EV Tax Credits and Government Policy: Government incentives have been both a boon and a challenge for Tesla. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 introduced generous EV tax credits, but with complex rules about manufacturing location and vehicle price caps. Tesla benefited initially – many Model 3/Y variants qualified for $7,500 credits in 2023 – which effectively made Teslas more affordable and boosted demand. However, as of Sept 30, 2025, most Tesla models lost eligibility for the $7,500 federal credit (due to hitting certain production volume limits and sourcing requirements) [168]. This led to the Q3 sales rush (as discussed) and now poses a headwind for Q4. The removal of incentives means Tesla has to stand on its own pricing, or find other ways to entice buyers (hence the Standard Range models). Notably, some competitors like GM and Ford still have vehicles that qualify for credits (though they too will phase out over time). In response, some automakers found ways to effectively extend incentives – e.g. by offering lease deals that pass on credits, or lobbying for rule tweaks [169]. Tesla’s strategy was to pre-emptively cut prices so that after credits expired, their cars wouldn’t suddenly seem too expensive. In Europe, EV subsidies have also been dialed back in major markets (Germany reduced EV purchase bonuses, for instance, especially for higher-priced cars – which hurt Tesla more than cheaper local models) [170]. China had a long-running EV subsidy program that ended in 2023, which triggered a price war among EV makers (including Tesla) to keep demand up [171] [172]. The policy backdrop is a bit two-sided: on one hand, global governments are pushing toward electrification (banning gas car sales after 2035 in some regions, emissions credits, etc.), which structurally benefits Tesla as an EV leader. On the other hand, as EVs go mainstream, governments are tapering direct financial support, which means Tesla will increasingly compete on level ground with other makers. Another policy angle: trade and tariffs. Tesla has managed to avoid some tariff issues by building factories locally (cars made in China for China, in Germany for Europe, etc.). But there are still sensitivities – e.g., if U.S.-China relations worsen, tariffs on components or materials could increase costs for Tesla (which uses minerals and battery components from various countries). The EU also launched an inquiry in 2023 into China’s subsidies for its EV industry, potentially leading to tariffs on Chinese-made EVs imported to Europe. If that happens, Tesla’s exports from Shanghai to Europe might be affected. So far, Tesla navigates these by localizing production (its approach is essentially to have a factory on each major continent to sidestep tariffs and shipping costs).

Consumer Income and Fuel Prices: Broader economic factors like inflation and fuel costs also influence Tesla. High inflation in essentials (food, rent) can squeeze consumers, leaving less disposable income to buy new cars. Tesla’s recent move to lower prices is partly recognition that a lot of potential buyers might be stretching their budgets. If inflation continues to moderate and wage growth picks up, that’s positive for auto demand. Gasoline prices are another interesting factor: historically, when gas prices spike, interest in EVs rises (as a cost-saving measure). In 2022, gas prices soared and Tesla had huge waitlists. In 2023–2025, gas has been volatile but generally not at extreme highs. If gas stays moderate or low, the economic incentive to switch to EVs is less urgent for some buyers (EVs still often save money on fuel, but the payback period lengthens when gas is cheap). However, many buy Teslas for performance/tech or environmental reasons, not purely fuel savings. Still, if oil prices jump (due to geopolitical events, etc.), it could give Tesla a demand boost. Conversely, if a recession hits and oil plunges, gas cars become cheaper to run and some cost-sensitive buyers might delay EV purchases. Global economic health matters too: Europe’s economy has been soft (with some countries near recession in 2024–25), which could partly explain Tesla’s sales slump there [173]. China’s economy has had issues (property sector crisis, slower growth) which could affect its rising middle class – a key demographic for Tesla in China [174]. Tesla, being a relatively premium product, needs healthy economies or at least healthy upper-middle-class consumers worldwide.

Tech Sector Sentiment (AI Narrative): Tesla’s stock often trades in tandem with the tech sector, especially anything related to AI. 2023–2024 saw a massive boom in AI-related stocks (Nvidia, etc.) on the promise of generative AI. While Tesla isn’t an AI chip provider, it has positioned itself as an AI-driven company (with autonomous driving, the Dojo supercomputer, etc.). This means at times Tesla benefits from the general “AI hype” – investors lump it in with tech names that could exploit AI advances [175]. If tech stocks are in favor, Tesla often rides that wave; if there’s a tech pullback, Tesla can be dragged down even if its auto business is fine. For instance, if there’s disappointment in the pace of self-driving adoption (say, a competitor has a setback or there’s a regulatory crackdown on AI vehicles), that could cool investor enthusiasm for Tesla’s lofty autonomy promises [176]. On the other hand, wins in tech – like if Tesla demonstrates a big breakthrough in FSD or if Dojo allows some leap in AI training – could further bolster the narrative that Tesla is a cutting-edge AI company, not just a carmaker, and thus deserves a high valuation. Also, stock market liquidity and risk appetite in general matter: when the market is in a “risk-on” mode (often due to macro factors like easing rates or positive growth), high-beta stocks like TSLA tend to outperform. When fear rises (e.g. during banking scares or geopolitical crises), those stocks can swing harder to the downside.

In summary, Tesla’s fate is not only tied to its own execution and innovation, but also to these macro and policy currents. The near-term removal of U.S. tax credits is a challenge that Tesla is trying to meet with pricing adjustments. The potential for lower interest rates is a silver lining that could support its high valuation. Competition, partially spurred by policy (like emissions rules forcing others to go EV), is a constant factor that interacts with macro conditions (e.g. if a rival struggles financially in a downturn, that could slow their EV push, indirectly aiding Tesla). And overarching it all, Tesla’s status as a market darling means it will likely continue to react to broad market sentiment about growth stocks and technology. Investors in Tesla thus keep one eye on Musk’s tweets and delivery numbers, and another on Fed statements and government EV announcements.

Elon Musk’s Influence and Next Moves

It’s impossible to discuss Tesla without considering Elon Musk, the company’s CEO and figurehead. Musk’s influence on Tesla is profound – he’s often described as both Tesla’s greatest asset and a potential liability, depending on the context [177].

On the positive side, Musk is the visionary force driving Tesla’s ambition. He has led Tesla from its startup days (selling a few thousand Roadsters) to a global enterprise delivering nearly 2 million cars a year [178]. His bold vision for a sustainable future – electric cars, solar energy, interplanetary travel (via SpaceX) – has inspired an almost fanatical customer and investor following. This Musk factor has tangible benefits: Tesla spends almost nothing on traditional advertising, yet Musk’s ability to generate buzz (through product unveilings, tweets, media appearances) serves as a constant stream of publicity [179]. For example, the cryptic tweets about the Oct 7 event garnered tens of millions of views on X (Twitter) [180], creating hype that no conventional marketing campaign could match. When Tesla’s stock soared 5% in a day recently, Musk’s personal net worth jumped accordingly, reaching about $465 billion (making him by far the richest person alive) [181]. In late 2025, he even briefly surpassed a $500 billion net worth – the first person ever to do so – thanks to Tesla’s stock rally [182]. Musk’s wealth is essentially tied to Tesla’s success, aligning his interests with shareholders in a big way.

Recognizing Musk’s centrality, Tesla’s board has moved to secure his commitment long-term. In 2025, Tesla proposed a massive new CEO performance award for Musk – potentially granting him ~12% of Tesla’s shares (worth up to $1 trillion) if he meets extremely ambitious targets over the next 10 years [183]. Those targets include Tesla achieving a $10+ trillion market cap and producing 20 million cars per year by around 2035 [184]. For perspective, 20 million cars is more than 10× Tesla’s current annual volume, and $10T market cap would be roughly 5× the combined value of Apple and Saudi Aramco today – truly heroic goals. The logic, as the board sees it, is that Musk responded brilliantly to a similar 2018 incentive plan (which had lower but still huge targets that Tesla met, skyrocketing the stock and earning Musk tens of billions). So, they want to “challenge him to do it again” [185]. Shareholders will have to approve this plan, but it underscores a key point: keeping Musk at Tesla’s helm is considered critical. Musk has a lot on his plate – he also runs SpaceX, he acquired and runs X (Twitter) as of 2022, and has other ventures (Neuralink, The Boring Company). Investors have at times been nervous that Musk might get distracted or even eventually leave Tesla. This new compensation package is designed to keep him focused on Tesla through the coming decade [186] [187].

However, Musk’s influence is a double-edged sword. His unfiltered communication style and forays into controversy can and have had repercussions for Tesla. In recent years, Musk has been very active on social media (X/Twitter), often wading into political and social debates that are unrelated to Tesla’s core business [188]. He has taken stances or made comments about topics like COVID-19 responses, gender pronouns, politics, and more. While some of his followers appreciate his candor, these actions alienated certain groups of consumers – notably more liberal, environmentally conscious people who were once core to Tesla’s early adopter base [189]. Reuters reported that Tesla insiders saw Musk’s polarizing political comments as having “at times hurt Tesla’s brand perception,” particularly among those left-leaning customers [190]. For instance, in 2022–2023 after Musk took over Twitter (and espoused some right-leaning views), there were anecdotal reports of some customers canceling Tesla orders, and competitors like GM even cited Tesla’s brand “baggage” as an opportunity for them. Musk himself has acknowledged that his tweets can be “a distraction” but often insists he won’t “divorce” his public persona from his business – it’s all the same to him. This creates a delicate dynamic: Musk’s celebrity and online presence keep Tesla in the news constantly (mostly for free), but if he veers into highly divisive territory, it can create reputational risks and potentially soften sales in some markets [191] [192]. So far, Tesla’s sales are at record highs, indicating that product appeal wins out over controversy for many buyers, but it’s something both the company and investors monitor closely.

Another concern was Musk’s bandwidth. In late 2022 into 2023, when Musk was consumed with running Twitter (after buying it and making sweeping changes), Tesla’s stock fell sharply, partly on fears that Musk was “AWOL” from Tesla or selling Tesla shares to fund Twitter. By mid-2023, Musk hired a CEO for X (Linda Yaccarino) and publicly stated he’d refocus on Tesla, which helped reassure investors [193]. This episode showed that Musk’s personal actions (even outside Tesla) can materially impact Tesla’s stock – a rare level of key-man risk. It appears Musk has since balanced his time better, but the “Musk overhang” (the risk of him getting distracted or selling shares) is an ongoing consideration.

On the strategy front, Musk’s bold promises both inspire and sometimes frustrate. He often sets extremely aggressive goals – like fully self-driving cars by year X (a moving target he’s pushed out repeatedly), or huge production ramps that end up delayed. Critics argue Musk’s overpromising could land Tesla in hot water – for example, regulators have probed whether Tesla’s marketing of “Full Self-Driving” is misleading since the feature is not actually autonomous yet [194] [195]. There have been investigations and even lawsuits related to accidents involving Autopilot, putting scrutiny on Musk’s claims. Yet, one has to note that Musk’s high-risk, high-reward approach has often paid off in the end. Tesla’s Model 3 ramp in 2017–2018 famously went through “production hell” – Musk set near-impossible production targets, missed deadlines, slept at the factory, but eventually succeeded in mass-producing the Model 3 and effectively transforming Tesla into a mainstream automaker. This pattern of “aim ridiculously high, sometimes fall short initially but eventually achieve something significant” has earned Musk credibility with a lot of investors and fans. It’s why many are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on ambitious projects like robotaxis or humanoid robots – Musk has defied the skeptics before. Still, it also means Tesla’s journey can be bumpy, with delays and flashbacks of chaos that have to be managed.

Importantly, Musk is essentially the face of Tesla. Unlike GM or Toyota, where the average person might not know the CEO’s name, Musk is a celebrity CEO. This personal branding entwines with Tesla’s brand. It gives Tesla a certain edge – customers often feel like they’re part of Musk’s mission when they buy a Tesla – but it also means any misstep by Musk (personal or professional) can directly affect Tesla’s public image. If, hypothetically, Musk had to step away (due to health or other reasons) or shifted focus drastically, it could rattle Tesla’s stock and perhaps the company’s direction. This “key man risk” is something analysts mention – Tesla without Musk is hard to imagine for many, which is why the board’s huge incentive is aimed at keeping him engaged [196] [197].

As for Musk’s next moves: in the near term, he appears laser-focused on Tesla’s product roadmap and expansion. He’s been hyping the upcoming Cybertruck deliveries, the next FSD update, and this recent affordable model launch – indicating he’s very much in Tesla CEO mode right now. The new compensation plan, if approved, also suggests he’s locking in to try to make Tesla not just a trillion-dollar company but potentially the biggest company in the world by far. Musk also continues to push the envelope on Tesla’s culture of innovation – hosting AI Day events, encouraging big engineering bets, etc. One “next move” to watch is how Musk handles the balance between growth and profit. Tesla’s price cuts have dented margins; investors will listen intently if Musk addresses at what point he’s aiming to stabilize prices or if he’s willing to sacrifice short-term profit for longer-term dominance. Additionally, Musk’s influence will likely be critical in navigating regulatory relations – for instance, how Tesla deals with safety regulators on self-driving, or how it participates in policy discussions (Musk has recently engaged more with Washington D.C., attending EV industry meetings and advocating against too much regulatory overreach on self-driving).

In conclusion, Elon Musk remains a central figure in Tesla’s narrative. His vision and leadership have been key to Tesla’s success, and recent actions (teasing new models, aligning a huge personal incentive with Tesla’s future growth) reassure many that he’s all-in on Tesla’s mission at this point [198]. At the same time, Musk’s unpredictability – whether in tweeting or taking on side ventures – injects an element of risk. The company’s challenge (and perhaps advantage) is to harness Musk’s brilliance and charisma, while minimizing the turbulence that sometimes comes with it. As Tesla embarks on the next chapter (mass market cars, AI, expansion in a competitive landscape), Musk’s role will undoubtedly continue to be a major asset, as long as he can balance his audacious goals with effective execution and avoid unnecessary controversies. Tesla’s brand is in many ways Musk’s brand of innovation and audacity. How that brand evolves – staying edgy and exciting but not alienating – will be a key storyline as Tesla drives forward under Musk’s guidance.

Outlook: The Road Ahead for Tesla

As of October 11, 2025, Tesla stands at an important inflection point. The company has immense momentum – record sales, a soaring stock, and new product lines – but also sky-high expectations to live up to. In the coming months, several factors will determine how Tesla’s story unfolds:

Financial Performance: Tesla will report its full Q3 2025 earnings (including profits and margins) and perhaps give hints about Q4. Investors will watch if Tesla’s aggressive pricing hurt its margins or if cost efficiencies (and the energy business boost) helped offset that. Guidance on Q4 deliveries (if provided around Oct 18 or in investor calls) will be crucial. Any indication of a significant post-incentive drop in demand could spook the market, whereas signs that orders remain robust (maybe helped by the new Standard models) would reassure that Tesla can grow even without tax credits. Tesla’s ability to manage costs – through things like cheaper battery designs, simplified manufacturing (single-piece castings, etc.) – will be key to maintaining profitability as they chase volume.

Product Deliveries and Innovation: The much-anticipated Cybertruck launch is slated around late 2025. The success of the Cybertruck’s ramp (can Tesla produce them in volume and with good quality?) will be closely watched. It’s a test of Tesla’s ability to tackle new segments and could open up a new profit stream if truck buyers flock to it – or be a drag if production is too slow or costs too high. Meanwhile, incremental improvements to existing models (like rumored Model 3 “Highland” and Model Y “Juniper” facelifts) can refresh demand. On the innovation front, Full Self-Driving technology progress remains a wild card – a major breakthrough or regulatory approval for robotaxis could massively boost Tesla’s value proposition, while setbacks could reinforce critics’ view that autonomy is always “just around the corner.” Musk’s promise that Tesla vehicles will achieve truly driverless operation has yet to fully materialize; if 2026 is proclaimed (yet again) as the year for robotaxis, investors may react with either excitement or skepticism depending on credibility.

Market Expansion: Tesla is constructing new factories (Mexico is planned to host a next-gen vehicle platform factory). How quickly Tesla can expand capacity and into which markets will influence growth. If Tesla announces concrete plans for an actual $25k car launch (the oft-mentioned “Model 2”), it would be a game-changer for outlook – but also could raise questions about margin impact and cannibalization. Internationally, India has been a market Tesla talks about (Musk met India’s PM about possible investment), and further expansion in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, or Eastern Europe could be on the horizon. Each new market could add sales, but Tesla will face local challengers too.

Competition & EV Industry Health: The competitive landscape will heat up further in 2026–2027 with many new EV models coming. For Tesla’s outlook, a key factor will be how well its competitors execute. If traditional automakers continue to struggle with EV profitability or scaling (as some have in 2025), Tesla can keep gaining share. But if a competitor hits a home run – say, an extremely compelling $30k EV with high range or a superior autonomous system – that could pressure Tesla’s growth or pricing power. Additionally, the overall EV adoption rate matters. We’re at ~15% global new sales being EVs, projected to grow each year. If that growth accelerates (due to climate policies or consumer preference), Tesla benefits as a leader. If it stalls (perhaps due to economic factors or insufficient charging infrastructure in some regions), Tesla’s growth could moderate.

Macro and Policy Environment: As discussed, if interest rates come down in 2026, it could be a tailwind for Tesla’s stock and for auto sales. Conversely, if inflation resurges or a recession hits, Tesla might face a tougher environment of slackening demand. Policy-wise, new government actions like the EU possibly imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs (which could help Tesla’s pricing in Europe) or the US potentially reinstating some incentives (for cheaper EVs or batteries) could influence Tesla’s outlook. Also, environmental regulations like stricter emissions targets effectively force the market toward EVs by mandate, which is a tailwind for Tesla relative to any laggards that still rely on combustion vehicles.

Investor Sentiment and Valuation: Tesla’s current valuation assumes a lot of future success. To maintain a $1.5T+ market cap, Tesla will need to execute nearly flawlessly or spring positive surprises. Any sign of growth significantly slowing (e.g., dropping to single-digit percentage growth without a clear re-acceleration plan) could prompt a valuation reset. On the other hand, Tesla has often surprised to the upside – whether it’s delivering cars faster than expected or opening new revenue streams (like selling software upgrades). Investors will be looking for new revenue streams in coming years: perhaps a launch of a Tesla Network (ride-hailing) if robotaxis become viable, or growth in energy revenue as Megapack factories expand, or even monetizing things like insurance and services better. These could bolster the outlook beyond just car unit sales.

In essence, Tesla’s outlook is bright but challenging. The company sits as the leader of an EV revolution it helped spark, with tailwinds like technological leadership and a strong brand, but it’s now navigating a more crowded highway with many others chasing it. The next year will test Tesla’s ability to keep scaling rapidly while defending profitability – a balancing act that will influence whether TSLA stock continues its upward trajectory or takes a pit stop.

For the public and investors, Tesla remains a captivating story: a company at the intersection of technology, sustainability, and automotive history. The coming quarters will reveal whether Tesla can continue defying odds and justifying the hype, or whether it will face a phase of growing pains as the EV competition catches up. Given its track record, few would want to bet outright against Tesla, but the company certainly has to prove itself anew in this next chapter. In any case, Tesla’s journey ahead promises to be closely watched, full of innovation, and undoubtedly, not a smooth ride – just the way Elon Musk likes it.

China is leading the world in renewable energy. Not only does it generate more of it than any other nation, it is also exporting its clean energy technology to other countries at a furious pace. This week the New York Times published two reports about renewables in China that explain how that country is making all this happen and point out that there are costs to China’s push for renewables that seldom get reported.

162 Square Miles Of Solar Panels

Last month, China President Xi Jinping told the United Nations his country would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across its economy and would expand renewable energy sixfold in coming years. The New York Times called it “a moment of global significance for the nation that is currently the world’s biggest polluter.”

China is an enormous country. 90 percent of its people live in the eastern part of the country, where sunshine is muted and winds are normally too slow to power turbines reliably. The western part of China is just the opposite. It has abundant sunshine, wind, and rushing rivers, all of which are ideal for making renewable electricity. But it is a thousand miles or more from China’s densely populated cities. More about that later.

China has made a portion of Tibet into a center for its clean energy plans. In an area that includes mountains and plateaus, it has constructed a 162-square-mile renewable energy development. 10,000 feet high, solar panels stretch from horizon to horizon across an area 7 times larger than Manhattan.

Because the air at that elevation is so clear, those panels are bathed in bright sunshine. Cooler temperatures also help maximize the output from the panels. There are also dozens of wind turbines that spin in the evening breezes just as the sun begins to set. A number of dams on Tibet’s fast flowing rivers add hydropower to the clean energy mix.

The primary group of solar farms, known as the Talatan Solar Park, dwarfs every other cluster of solar farms in the world. It covers 162 square miles in Gonghe County, an alpine desert in the sparsely inhabited Qinghai province in western China. The primary objective for building such massive clean energy facilities is to uncouple China from its dependence on imported fossil fuels — coal, oil, and LNG.

Renewable energy helps China power 30,000 miles of high-speed train routes and its growing fleet of electric cars. At the same time, cheap electricity enables China to manufacture even more solar panels, which dominate global markets and power artificial intelligence data centers, Times reporter Keith Bradsher wrote.

The Talatan solar project provides a massive 16,930 megawatts of power and is still expanding. Within three years, it will grow to be 10 times the size of Manhattan. The wind turbines nearby contribute another 4,700 megawatts of power, and hydroelectric dams nearby contribute another 7,380 megawatts.

To put that into perspective, at the turn of the century, China built the Three Gorges Dam — the largest hydroelectric project in the country’s history. Today, Bradsher reports, it adds enough solar panels to match the output from the Three Gorges Dam every three weeks.

Clean Energy Attracts Industry

Two pumped hydro projects are under construction in the mountains near the Talatan Solar Park. They will use excess solar power generated during the day to pump water up to reservoirs several miles high. At night, the water will flow back downhill to power turbines.

The prospect of inexpensive electricity is attracting new industries to the area. Some will use that electricity to turn quartzite into polysilicon for solar panels. Others want that electricity to power data centers. Those data centers will consume 40 percent less electricity because air conditioning is hardly needed to cool the computers at such high altitudes, where average temperatures are lower than near the coast. Air warmed by the data centers will be circulated through underground pipes to heat other buildings in the area, replacing coal-fired boilers in the process.

China has leveraged smart ideas to address the issue of having too much renewable energy at some times. The pumped hydro facilities will take care of that. They also are taking advantage of nature to reduce the demand for electricity in data centers, while abundant clean energy is being put to good use to manufacture more clean energy resources. If all this sounds too good to be true, perhaps it is.

China & HVDC Transmission

China has massive amounts of clean energy in its western provinces, but only 10 percent of its people live there. The demand for all those lovely electrons is in the coastal areas in the south and east. That is also where much of its industry is located. How does it get the electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed?

It will come as no surprise that China, with its penchant for detailed planning, has considered that problem and come up with a solution. Times reporter Keith Bradsher filed a companion story this week that focuses on the country’s massive network of ultra-high-voltage transmission lines and it reveals that there may be an ugly downside to clean energy miracle taking place in China.

“In China, the longest ultra high voltage power line stretches more than 2,000 miles from the far northwest to the populous southeast — the equivalent of transmitting electricity from Idaho to New York City,” Bradsher wrote. China has 41 high-voltage DC transmission lines with more in the works.

Many of China’s ultra-high-voltage lines use direct current technology, which allows them to carry electricity for long distances with barely any of the transmission losses that affect most high-power lines in other countries. According to data from the end of last year, the most recent data available publicly, 19 transmission lines operate at 800 kilovolts (800,000 volts). Another 22 operate at 1,000 kilovolts (1 million volts) and one uses 1,100 kilovolts.

That is some serious power. Those transmission lines use massive pylons that march across the landscape like Martian war machines. We don’t hear much about ordinary Chinese citizens complaining about government polities — NIMBY is not much of an issue, in other words. But those power lines have an impact on those who live and work near them.

A million volts overhead can lead to some powerful effects on people and structures nearby. Xu Shicai, a farm manager in Xuchong, a village next to lines that pass within 30 yards of homes, told Bradasher he has concerns about those transmission lines.

“When you hold an umbrella in the rain, sparks will fly from it, and you’ll feel numb,” he said. “When fishing, it’s hard to hold the pole under the wires, as your hands feel very numb.” Oooh, that doesn’t sound good!

The village’s small fish pond lies directly under the power lines. A “no fishing” sign has a cartoon of a skeleton being electrocuted and a graphic photo of a badly burned man who was apparently electrocuted. But Xu and other residents said that did not stop many villagers from fishing because the pond was so close by. He said he accepted the power line because it was an important national project, but he worried it might scare off visitors. “I’m used to it now,” he said. “But honestly, we don’t want more lines built here.” That is as close to NIMBY as you are likely to get in China today.

But despite the downsides, there is little question renewable energy has had a powerful impact on life in China. After the disaster at Fukushima in 2011, China abruptly cancelled plans to build more nuclear reactors and transitioned to building up its renewable energy capabilities.

The construction of ultra-high-voltage power lines has helped China reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the toxic air pollution that once blanketed its most industrialized regions. A University of Chicago analysis of satellite data in August found that air pollution in China had declined by 41 percent since 2014 — adding almost two years to the country’s average life expectancy.

The UC Air Quality Life Index says: “Air pollution is the greatest external threat to human life expectancy on the planet. The AQLI’s latest 2023 data reveals that permanently reducing global PM₂.₅ air pollution to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline would add years onto average human life expectancy — or a combined 15.1 billion life years saved. The impact of PM₂.₅ on global life expectancy is comparable to that of smoking, more than 4 times that of high alcohol use, more than 5 times that of transport injuries like car crashes, and more than 6 times that of HIV/AIDS.”

In light of those benefits, a few sparks from your umbrella when it rains might be acceptable. We often speak of renewable energy in terms of how many homes it can power or how many jobs it will add to the local economy. Seldom do we address the benefits of breathing cleaner air. Perhaps renewable energy advocates should emphasize that part to the equation more forcefully.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Talatan-Solar-Park.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 23:00:49.146987

On June 25, 2024, the National Energy Policy Council (NEPC) approved a pilot policy intending to enable data centers to directly procure renewable energy through Direct Power Purchase Agreements (Direct PPAs), facilitated by Third Party Access (TPA) through the national grid for up to 2,000 MW. Please also refer to Hunton’s client alert published back in September 2024 when the Direct PPA and the TPA Code were introduced, the client alert can be accessed here.

The initiative is being jointly implemented by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO), Board of Investment Thailand (BOI), and the governmental utility operators, i.e., the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).

On October 3, 2025, 16 months after the NEPC’s approval of the Direct PPAs pilot policy, the ERC finally released draft regulations on the Direct PPAs (Draft Direct PPA Regulation) and the draft TPA Code. While the release of both drafts represent important steps in market reform in Thailand, our current focus is on the Draft Direct PPA Regulation.

It is important to note that the Draft Direct PPA Regulation and the draft TPA Code are currently in draft forms and remain subject to revision through the public hearing and legislative processes. Stakeholders should be aware that the provisions outlined here may evolve as part of ongoing regulatory consultations.

Purpose and Policy Intent

According to BOI data published on March 17, 2025, between 2022 and 2024, 27 projects in data centers and cloud services applied for investment promotion, representing a combined investment value of over THB 290 billion.

This increase reflects Thailand’s strategic positioning as a regional hub for digital infrastructure and its commitment to enabling large-scale, sustainable operations through regulatory and energy market reforms. In addition, according to Krungsri Bank’s Industry Outlook 2025–2027: Data Center Industry, the total revenue of Thailand’s data center industry is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 7.5–8.5%.

With the industry predicting substantial growth, data center operators are scrambling to secure energy at competitive prices, especially renewable energy that will also help them align with various ESG goals. As part of Thailand’s ongoing efforts to support the development of the data center ecosystem in the country, Thailand continues to refine various laws and regulations to align with the country’s strategic objective to position the country as a regional hub for digital infrastructure. Thailand’s policy movements on the energy front not only facilitate individual project development but also contribute to the broader ecosystem necessary for sustainable growth in this sector.

The implementation of the pilot framework is designed to support BOI-promoted data centers in meeting global sustainability mandates by allowing the data centers to sign direct power purchase agreements to quickly procure renewable energy throughout the country. As such, companies producing renewable energy will be able to supply power to data centers via Thailand’s national grid, promoting market liberalization and competition in Thailand’s energy industry.

At a Glance: Contractual Structure for Direct PPA Scheme

The chart below illustrates contractual structure under the Direct PPA scheme as contemplated by the Draft Direct PPA Regulation.

1. Qualification of the Power Producer and Power Plant

Power producers must only use renewable energy sources. Based on our discussion with an ERC officer, a combination of renewable energy sources with battery energy storage system is permissible. The power plant must be a newly established generating facility without any pre-existing PPAs whether with a private offtaker or a governmental utility operator.

Each generating facility must have an installed capacity of at least 1,000 kVA and must have successfully secured a feeder capacity check by the governmental utility operator.

There are no restrictions on foreign ownership; however, foreign investors must ensure compliance with the Thailand’s Land Code, which generally prohibits foreigners (including a foreign majority-owned Thai company) from owning plots of land. However, if a foreign investor receives BOI promotion, land ownership may be permitted if it has been approved by the BOI.

Based on the draft TPA Connection Code, if the installed capacity of the generating facility is at least 6 MW, the generating facility must pass a system study conducted by EGAT.

2. Qualification of the Data Center

The eligible data center must be owned and operated by an entity that:

Receives an investment promotion by the BOI for its data center project (which includes server colocation and data hosting services.

Intends to utilize renewable energy for 100 percent of its power demand.

Is mandated by its group to use renewable energy and to align with its investments in other jurisdictions.

Has a minimum IT base load of 50 MW per building and submits a comprehensive ten-year electricity plan detailing proposed Direct PPAs, grid usage, and total load projections.

Has not yet generated income from such data center project as at the date on which it submits an application to ERC for the Direct PPAs quota.

Has secured a backup supply contract with the relevant governmental utility operator to provide backup supply during off-peak periods or times of excess demand.

Has developed a work plan and obtained a commitment from a power producer to utilize this Direct PPA regime. From our discussion with ERC officers, the commitment could be in the form of a non-binding MOU or LOI, where the relevant power producer expresses intention to sell electricity to the data center through the TPA and a Direct PPA.

3. Other Key Conditions and Compliance

Power producers must comply with both the governmental utility operator’s Grid Code and the TPA Code.

Power producers are required to enter into grid service agreements for the full Direct PPA capacity within specified timelines. If they fail to do so, the data center will be forfeited of any unused Direct PPA quota.

A single data center may be supplied by multiple power producers.

No specific form of Direct PPA is prescribed by the ERC; it is subject to commercial terms and negotiations between the power producers and the data center. A data center may be considered a “large scale customer” and therefore the power purchaser agreements must at least contain provisions related to rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to the ERC Notification on Standards of Contracts on Power Service Provision for Large Power Users B.E. 2561 (2018).

The grid service agreement between the power producer and utility must follow the format provided under the TPA Code.

Implications and Future Prospect

For data centers, it facilitates compliance with global renewable energy mandates while strengthening sustainability credentials.

Renewable energy producers benefit from expanded market opportunities, reducing dependence on government-backed PPAs.

Governmental utilities operators must prepare for the operational demands of wheeling services and system balancing under TPA Code.

An expert at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), a leading policy think tank, notes that clean energy is critical for global trade competitiveness. While the current ERC regulation limits Direct PPAs to data centers, the introduction of the TPA Code creates a pathway for expanding this scheme to other industries aiming for carbon neutrality and Net Zero. This evolution could strengthen Thailand’s export potential and overall competitiveness.

Next Steps

Stakeholders are encouraged to review the Draft Direct PPAs Regulation and TPA Code, and prepare for compliance and implementation.

It is anticipated that government agencies, such as ERC, BOI and the governmental utility operators, will issue further guidance as the pilot project advances, prescribing criteria, procedures, and conditions.

China met all of its power demand growth in the first half of 2025 through clean electricity generation, while cutting fossil fuel generation and emissions, according to Ember's Global Electricity Mid-Year Insights.

Remaining the clear frontrunner in global clean energy growth, China accounted for 55 percent of the global rise in solar generation and an 82 percent rise in wind generation, said the report.

The surge in solar and wind power outpaced the growth in global electricity demand in the first six months of 2025, the report said, adding that record solar growth and steady wind expansion are reshaping the global power mix, as renewables overtake coal for the first time on record.

Noting China's remarkable progress in energy transition, the report underlined that China is driving global growth in solar and wind power. The country's solar output grew by 43 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2025, well above the global average of 31 percent, while its wind generation rose by 16 percent, more than double the global average.

Another report from Ember has shown that China's exports of clean technologies reached a record 20 billion US dollars in August, marking a new high.

It also pointed to a rapid adoption of clean technologies in China. Electric vehicles accounted for about 52 percent of new car sales in August, while China installed more than twice as many solar panels as the rest of the world combined in the first half of the year.

According to Ember's China Energy Transition Review 2025, the country's clean energy transformation is fundamentally reshaping the global energy economy.

Accelerating the deployment of renewables, grids and storage -- coupled with the electrification of transport, buildings and industry -- is rapidly pushing China toward a peak in energy-related fossil fuel use, while reducing costs and driving the adoption of clean electro-technologies worldwide, the report said.

""China's clean energy development benefits the world by making renewables and related technologies cheaper and more accessible,"" said Xiao-Ping Zhang, professor of electrical power systems at the University of Birmingham.

Union MoS (Environment, Forest and Climate Change), Shri Kirti Vardhan Singh today shared India’s vision for sustainable, nature-positive urban development that puts people and planet at the center. He was participating in the Ministerial Panel at the High-Level Dialogue on ‘Transforming our Urban Environment: Pathways to Sustainability’, on the sidelines of the IUCN World Conservation Congress, 2025 at Abu Dhabi.

Shri Singh informed that India’s efforts to foster carbon markets and promote renewable energy generation are a step towards achieving the clarion call of ‘Mission LiFE’ given by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, which serves as a guiding principle for sustainability initiatives across the globe. The Government of India’s approach emphasises integrated planning, scalable missions, and citizen-centric behavioural change, he stated.

Flagship initiatives such as the Smart Cities Mission mainstream energy efficiency, renewable integration, sustainable mobility, and resilient infrastructure. The Minister informed about the Government providing support to India’s cities through three key pillars, that are:

Enabling frameworks and standards for green buildings, energy codes, and municipal finance.

Financing and risk-sharing being advanced through central grants, targeted viability-gap funding, and ongoing efforts to expand the city’s access to municipal bond markets, including green bonds.

Capacity-building and knowledge systems including training, data platforms, and model projects under Smart Cities, AMRUT, and urban-planning reforms.

Shri Singh noted that with the right vision, finance, and citizen engagement, urbanisation can become a powerful driver of low-carbon, inclusive development. India has adopted a holistic approach combining policy support, targeted schemes, and financial incentives. He talked about some of India’s National programmes such as:

The Smart Cities Mission, covering 100 cities, blends central funding with local planning to roll out smart street-lighting, rooftop solar, and building-energy management systems — reducing electricity use while improving urban services. Energy-Efficient Building Codes guide cities in ensuring new construction is climate-friendly.

The Energy Conservation Act, amended in 2022, strengthens energy-efficiency standards for buildings, appliances, and industries, and enables the establishment of a domestic carbon-credit market that rewards cities and businesses for reducing their energy footprint.

The AMRUT programme has enabled municipalities to upgrade to energy-efficient water-supply and pumping systems, lowering both costs and energy demand.

Looking ahead, Shri Singh said, the role of national governments is to provide stable policy frameworks that support cities in updating their bylaws and development regulations. They must work to expand access to innovative finance and deepen technology partnerships.

This, in turn, would encourage compact, transit-oriented, and energy-efficient urban growth. With such support, cities can advance faster toward energy-efficient, low-emission, and climate-resilient pathways that benefit their citizens and the planet.

As the countries of Global South including India are urbanizing rapidly, our goal must be to create cities that are livable, green, and inclusive — places where aspirations can thrive without losing the human touch, the Minister concluded.

Their unique operational principles and lower production costs have garnered significant interest worldwide. In recent years, extensive research has focused on the optimization of the materials used in DSSCs, leading to remarkable advancements. The work presented by Dahri et al. highlights significant breakthroughs in flexible counter electrodes, which play a critical role in the overall efficiency and functionality of these solar cells.

The flexible nature of these solar cells is a game-changer. The traditional rigid panels are often limited in their applications due to their weight and fragility. In contrast, flexible DSSCs can be applied to a variety of surfaces, including textiles, curved structures, and even wearable technologies. This adaptability opens up a multitude of possibilities not only for generating energy in unconventional settings but also for enhancing the aesthetic value of energy generation systems.

Material advancements have been pivotal in enhancing the performance of flexible counter electrodes. These components are vital for facilitating the necessary electrochemical reactions that occur within the solar cell. The selection of materials that can effectively serve as conductive substrates while maintaining flexibility is crucial. Research has diversified into various materials, including carbon-based nanomaterials, conducting polymers, and new metallic compounds, all of which have their unique advantages and challenges.

Among the wide range of materials explored, carbon nanotubes and graphene derivatives stand out for their exceptional electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. Leveraging these materials in the construction of counter electrodes enhances electron transport while ensuring durability under bending and stretching conditions. This is particularly relevant for applications that require the solar panels to be installed on dynamic surfaces or in wearable gadgets where flexibility is non-negotiable.

Another material that has gained traction in recent studies is conducting polymers. These organic materials provide inherent flexibility and can be easily processed into thin films.

Incorporating these materials into hybrid designs can yield innovative solutions that combine the benefits of both metal and carbon-based systems.

One of the critical challenges remaining in the field of flexible DSSCs is ensuring long-term stability under varying environmental conditions. Investigating degradation mechanisms in flexible electrodes is paramount to enhance their lifetimes. This includes understanding the interaction between the electrolyte and the electrode materials in flexible configurations, as well as how these interactions affect the electrochemical stability over time. Ongoing research aims to identify optimal combinations and protective coatings that can trap moisture and prevent exposure to oxygen, which are primary contributors to material degradation.

The application of advanced manufacturing techniques plays a considerable part in evolving the fabrication methods of flexible DSSCs. Techniques such as roll-to-roll printing and inkjet printing are becoming more mainstream, enabling scalable production of these cells. These methods facilitate more uniform and precise material application, significantly reducing manufacturing costs and enabling mass-market adoption of flexible solar technologies.

Moreover, the integration of flexible DSSCs in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) represents another pillar of sustainability in modern architecture. Incorporating solar cells within building materials makes it possible to harness solar energy without compromising aesthetic appeal. The advancement of flexible counter electrode materials simplifies the integration of solar technologies into new construction projects, allowing architectural designs to marry functionality with sustainability seamlessly.

As the demand for renewable energy increases, so does the pressure to enhance the efficiency of solar technologies.

The Fusion Innovative Research Engine Collaboratives will receive $128 million of the $134 million earmarked for two programs working to advance the sector, Inside Climate News reported.

FIRE comprises seven teams that are creating an ""innovation ecosystem,"" according to a DOE news release. The Innovation Network for Fusion Energy program will receive $6.1 million to support 20 teams in commercializing the clean power source through private-public collaboration.

The DOE could invest another $92 million over four years in the FIRE Collaboratives. The INFUSE projects selected each earned $100,000 to $500,000 for research in materials science, laser technology development, high-temperature superconducting magnet assessment, and artificial intelligence learning for fusion modeling and simulation.

One expert told ICN that the total outlay is not much considering the technical and cost challenges of fusion energy development. The outlet noted that building fission reactors requires complex, time-consuming regulatory and safety steps, and that the process would be similar for fusion reactors.

But it may be decades before the technology is realized. Fusion power mimics what happens in the sun, combining nuclei instead of splitting atoms. The problem is that researchers have been unable to maintain or contain a reaction. The massive amounts of energy it takes to get to that step also make it impractical — for now, at least.

""Nuclear development, ​​whether it's fission or fusion, requires a level of seriousness that I think is just not present in most of these projects right now,"" Edwin Lyman, the aforementioned expert and director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, told ICN.

The potential for nearly limitless clean power, however, has enthralled scientists for decades. Fusion power could usher in an era of resource efficiency, potentially eliminating electricity bills for individuals, businesses, and cities. And because it doesn't produce the long-lasting radioactive waste that fission does, it would be a better choice for the warming world. A planetwide transition from dirty energy sources to renewable energy ones is necessary to reduce the production of heat-trapping gases that harm human health, and the cleaner these alternatives are, the better.

The Trump administration wants to quadruple the United States' nuclear power production by 2050, ICN pointed out. It has gone the other way with many other renewable energy projects, including stopping construction of the nearly complete Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island and canceling incentives for homeowners to install solar panels earlier than expected.

Most vehicles depreciate over time, and the first five years are when most models lose the majority of their value. There are exceptions to vehicle depreciation once a car reaches a certain age, among other factors, but those are few and far between. According to a study by iSeeCars, the average depreciation rate across the industry is 45.6% after five years. EVs are among the worst vehicles when it comes to holding their value, with a five-year average depreciation rate of 58.5%. There is one model in particular that manages to outdo all others when it comes to losing value, though.

The Jaguar I-Pace loses over 70% of its value in five years

The Jaguar I-Pace loses 72.2% of its value after five years, making it the fastest depreciating EV. Not only that, but, according to the iSeeCars study, it may lead the industry with the highest depreciation rate overall. No other vehicle included in the study broke the 70% barrier, although the BMW 7 Series was close at 67.1%.

The 2019 Jaguar I-Pace was originally priced from $69,500, which isn’t exactly out of the ordinary for a luxury EV. The 2019 Audi e-tron, for example, started at $74,800. The I-Pace was the cheaper of the two, and it also offered up to a 234-mile range, topping the Audi e-tron’s 204-mile offering.

Unfortunately, Jaguar doesn’t have the best track record when it comes to reliability. Combine that with an EV’s accelerated depreciation, and you’ve got the perfect storm. According to Kelley Blue Book, the fair purchase price of a top-of-the-line 2019 Jaguar I-Pace EV400 First Edition is just $21,617. That model was initially priced at $86,895, which means it is currently worth just 24.9% of its original purchase price.

An EV doomed by the manufacturer

Jaguar was quick to jump into the luxury EV arena, launching the I-Pace in late 2018 for the 2019 model year. While it was rather pricey for all but early adopters, the I-Pace offered an impressive combination of luxury appointments, performance, and range. Fast forward to 2024, and that was no longer the case. Jaguar’s EV hadn’t seen many major updates over those five years, and the brand was getting ready to launch an all-new EV for the 2025 model year.

Naturally, those plans have gone out the window. Jaguar isn’t currently manufacturing any vehicles as it transitions to reestablish itself as an all-electric automaker. Not only that, but maintenance and repairs tend to be on the expensive side.

The Jaguar I-Pace has also been the subject of multiple recalls, most of which concern the risk of battery fires. Per the NHTSA, the first recall took place in May 2023, but the manufacturer can’t quite seem to get it right, as there were five additional recalls through December 2024 covering the same overheating battery issue.

As new competition entered the fray and Jaguar failed to keep up, the I-Pace was quickly overshadowed by competitors that were more luxurious, powerful, and efficient. Just as when they were new, no one seems to want them used, especially not when there’s a pool of used EVs to choose from. Some top competitors include the Maserati Grecale Folgore, Audi SQ6 e-tron, Cadillac Optiq, and Genesis GV60.

Final thoughts

Jaguar was once a highly regarded performance brand, but it has since fallen into a rather desperate state. Plagued by high prices and questionable reliability, the British manufacturer wasn’t doing so hot when it stepped back to rebrand. Hopefully, its time away from production will help the brand find itself and unleash an entirely new slate of performance EVs into the world. Frankly, as much as I like the idea of Jaguar, it’s not a brand I would ever put in my garage in its current state.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/98b237ac294f9b8e75001a660d843f0f,N,,2025-10-11 20:59:11.827701

The announcement signals the automaker's commitment to electrification while also maintaining options for drivers not yet fully ready to switch to electric vehicles.

The expansion comes as the company continues rolling out new electric models, including the subcompact EX30 and mid-size EX90 SUVs introduced over the past year. The XC60 remains one of Volvo's top sellers, with U.S. sales jumping 23 percent in the first half of 2025 compared to last year.

The Swedish automaker is planning to manufacture the next-generation hybrid model at its Ridgeville plant before 2030. Volvo designed the vehicle specifically for American customers, and the company expects it to join the XC60, EX90, and Polestar 3 in the production lineup. The Ridgeville factory is aiming for full utilization of its 150,000-vehicle annual capacity, backed by $1.3 billion in investments and upgrades since 2015.

It's no secret that drivers who choose electric or hybrid vehicles save money on routine maintenance, as EVs eliminate oil changes and many fluid replacements. They also cut down on fuel costs, enjoy quieter rides, and produce no tailpipe emissions. One MIT study found that traditional gas-powered cars create an average of 350 grams of carbon air pollution per mile driven over their lifetimes, while EVs operating on batteries charging from an average U.S. power grid produce only 200 grams per mile.

Charging an EV at home costs less than using public chargers, potentially saving hundreds of dollars annually. Qmerit helps homeowners to install powerful Level 2 EV chargers, providing free, instant installation estimates. Adding solar power into the equation really ups the savings, and EnergySage makes it a cinch to compare quotes from vetted local installers to save up to $10,000 on new solar installations.

Unlocking new business and investment opportunities, including in the areas of manufacturing and agro-processing as well as regional and continental value chain development, forms aspects of raising confidence among a number of African countries.

The European Commission’s report explicitly indicated that this approach mirrors the new strategy and is within the context of geopolitical rivalry and competition. Its policy titled “Global Gateway Strategy” primarily aims at refining the dynamic partnerships and advancing step-by-step for establishing bilateral mutual benefits with Africa. In terms of reciprocity, African leaders and businesspeoplemust explore available possibilities and windows that have been opened, as Europe has unveiled a €300 billion (US$340 billion) alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative—an investment program the bloc claims will create links, not dependencies.

In the latest report, Europe has allocated €618 million for renewable energy projects across Africa, according to the latest reports of the European Commission. The funds are for implementing these projects in eight African countries. In Kenya, the €55 million project is the green energy system to increase generation of and strengthen the power grid. In Uganda, with €60 million, the project will electrify rural areas with a population of over 250,000 people. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, funding is for electrifying the city of Kisangani and the surrounding areas, and in Mauritania, €125 million is allocated for creating a regional energy transport corridor for a rapidly growing population.

In Nigeria, €20 million is for planned technical support and for scaling up renewable solutions, particularly for farmers and small businesses, while in Cape Verde, €39 million is given for the expansion of wind generation and energy storage systems as part of the Cabeolica project. In addition, €30 million is allocated to strengthen the energy system between Zambia and Tanzania, and the largest funding—€199 million—is for Togo, where a renewable energy and energy storage project is implemented in the city of Kpalime.

In an opinion article published by AllAfrica.com, Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has expressed candid views about the economic progress on the continent and the outstanding challenges and the unfolding opportunities there. According to the IMF director, Africa is on a new sustainable growth trajectory. But this transition is costly—at least initially—for a region that already strives to finance other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and as a result, some of these development initiatives must be shared by the international community.

Despite the new challenges, it has become important to strengthen dialogues and focus on the search for more effective financial ways to scale up sustainable development in Africa. The European Commission has to keep in mind and try to incorporate the economic diplomacy with the continent, particularly most aspects of directions that meet the commitments of the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations and Agenda 2063 of the African Union.",https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/energy-transition.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 23:00:57.224412

Glenn Youngkin once again came back to the long-struggling city last Wednesday to highlight a major new economic development project — but unusually for such an event, one that did not involve any state support.

Independence Hydrogen officially opened its first plant in Petersburg, capturing hydrogen that’s otherwise an unused byproduct of Bleachtech LLC’s plant in the southern part of the city.

Bleachtech makes sodium hypochlorite, also called “hypo” or “bleach,” and sells it to water and wastewater treatment plants across the mid-Atlantic and Midwest. Until now, it vented hydrogen from the five-story stacks on top of its plant.

“We said, ‘We’ll take your trash and pay you for it,’” Independence Hydrogen co-founder Bill Lehner told the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Youngkin said the hydrogen operation marks a milestone in his “All American, All of the Above” state energy plan, which calls for using natural gas as well as wind and solar generation while pushing for development of small modular reactors and hydrogen as an energy source.

“What’s really exciting is that this project stands on its own economically, and they’re building because this is where they want to be, and this is the opportunity that sits in front of them with a great customer ... like Walmart and a great location, like they’ve got right here,” Youngkin said.

Walmart is the firm’s current main customer, buying the hydrogen for use in fuel cells — basically, devices that bring hydrogen and oxygen molecules together to make water. It is a process that releases electrons when the molecules combine, a process that also releases one of the two oxygen atoms in an oxygen molecule.

But Lehner said Virginia’s main natural gas utilities are also looking at using the firm’s hydrogen. Blending hydrogen with natural gas results in a fuel that emits less greenhouse gases, the cause of climate change.

The Independence plant takes hydrogen from Bleachtech, purifies it for fuel cell use and compresses the purified gas so it can be transported to end users. It employs 10 local residents.

The plant can process 1.2 metric tons of hydrogen a day, and do so at a lower cost than the other main ways of obtaining hydrogen, by zapping water with electricity to break apart the one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that form a water molecule or by exposing methane to high-pressure steam to break free its hydrogen atoms, a process that releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.

The Japanese industrial giant Sumitomo has recently invested in Independence Hydrogen, joining Suburban Propane and early-round investors from the Hivers & Strivers group, which invests veterans’ savings in veteran-run firms.

Last year, the Danish chemicals firm Topsøe Holding A/S said it would build a $400 million plant in Chesterfield County that will make a new kind of hydrogen fuel cell, one that the company says can generate clean energy for fossil fuel users like steel mills and shipping companies that cannot simply electrify operations and that generate nearly a third of the world’s greenhouse gases.

The Topsøe plant will employ 150.

Some $136 million in tax credits through the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) Program are supporting the Topsøe project.

North Carolina is once again America’s Top State for Business. When businesses look to move and grow in North Carolina they look at our welcoming business climate but a company they also look at our investments — in our people and our infrastructure.

A company is only as good as the people that work for it, and North Carolina boasts a skilled work force. But in order to keep business booming we have to continue to make the lives our citizens and workers better. Right now, people across North Carolina are struggling. Rising costs at the grocery store and energy bills that climbed nearly 6% nationwide last year are impacting us all. With that we have to be proactive and think about the future, not just how North Carolinians can work but how business can work for us. We can’t afford to be complacent.

There’s been a lot of talk about data centers in the news recently and some have argued that new data centers will automatically make energy more expensive for everyday customers. I’ll admit that I have had my hesitations, but I believe that when you hold reputable companies to high standards and even higher commitments, data centers can help stabilize costs and put downward pressure on energy rates.

We’ve seen this work in other states. In Georgia, utility leaders have credited large customers with allowing them to freeze base rates for three years. In Virginia, the world’s largest hub for data centers, billions in annual tax revenue have generated budget surpluses and even property tax cuts for homeowners. And in South Carolina, large facilities are paying higher costs instead of pushing that cost on tens of thousands of households. Oregon passed a law as well creating a new customer category specifically for data centers to assign energy responsibility equitably.

The key is responsibility. Data centers are going to continue to move into North Carolina but it’s important that we put in safe guards to protect North Carolina families, our communities and the environment. Data centers are required to sign long-term contracts, guarantee minimum payments, and cover the infrastructure costs their projects trigger. Many also agree to reduce or shift their power use during peak times, which relieves stress on the grid and helps avoid costly new capacity. Far from pushing bills higher, these steps help spread fixed costs more broadly and fairly.

We also have to address the root drivers of rising energy costs—aging infrastructure, volatile fuel prices, and extreme weather events. Seventy percent of our transmission lines are more than 25 years old. Utilities are being forced to make costly upgrades, and those costs shouldn’t be passed on to consumers. Add in inflationary pressures and billion-dollar damages from hurricanes and wildfires, and it’s no surprise bills are climbing.

It’s no secret that, data centers and artificial intelligence have a large energy demand, but we can take the time now to build new clean energy projects that add supply to the grid. This will also help spread out the fixed costs of running the grid, which means households aren’t carrying those expenses alone. And when new lines or maintenance is needed, it will be the data centers that are required to pay for those upgrades upfront, leaving the grid stronger and more reliable for everyone. That means more investment in energy infrastructure, steadier rates, and a fairer distribution of costs across all customers.

Communities also see direct benefits. Data centers create thousands of good-paying jobs, first in construction and the skilled trades to build the facilities, and then in long-term operations and maintenance once they’re running. And by partnering locally, data centers can help fund community projects, from weatherization upgrades that lower utility bills to resilience hubs that keep schools and community centers open during storms.

Here in North Carolina, the task before us is not to slow growth but to manage it responsibly. That means holding companies accountable for their share of infrastructure costs, prioritizing projects that deliver strong local economic value, and ensuring visible benefits for families – from weatherization upgrades that cut monthly bills to training programs that prepare workers for the clean energy jobs of the future. At the end of the day ensuring that

North Carolina families don’t shoulder the burden of rising energy usage and keep costs down.

North Carolina has the opportunity to show the rest of the country how to do this right: attract transformative investments, protect ratepayers, and strengthen our grid for the long haul. Data centers are not a threat to affordability, but a part of the solution, if we insist on clear rules and fair contributions.

US farmers are facing the quadruple whammy of tariffs, inflation, worker shortages, and climate impacts, leading to a spike in the number of bankruptcies this year. New developments in agricultural science can’t overcome all of those challenges at once, but a new agrivoltaic project in Virginia aims to demonstrate that the new energy crop of the 21st century — solar energy, that is — can help provide a lifeline to farmers and local communities in these challenging times.

Solar Panels And The New Energy Crop Of The 21st Century

Energy crops have been a familiar feature across the modern global agriculture industry for generations, with corn and soybeans currently dominating the production of ethanol and biodiesel here in the US. Although a carbon-recycling sustainability case can be made for biofuels, these traditional, land-based crops are industrial operations requiring herbicides, pesticides, heavy machinery, and transportation to and from refineries before they reach the energy consumer.

The UK consulting firm Cerulogy is among the energy analysts to run the numbers on biofuels and carbon emissions, and their numbers say that biofuels are not a particularly effective alternative to fossil fuels. “Global biofuels production emits 16% more CO2 than the fossil fuels it replaces,” explains the organization Transportation & Environment, citing a new report commissioned from Cerulogy.

“The same land could feed 1.3 billion people, while using just 3% of that land for solar panels would produce the same amount of energy,” T&E adds.

Indeed. Unlike traditional energy crops that involve long periods between harvest cycles, photovoltaic panels capture solar energy from the sun and convert it to electricity with every passing moment of daylight, delivering it directly to energy consumers or to energy storage systems as the case may be.

Small Agrivoltaic Project, Big Impact

The global solar industry could chip away further at Cerulogy’s land use estimate of 3%, by applying agrivoltaic principles that enable farmers to continue using the land in between solar panels.

Agrivoltaics is a new science, emerging on the heels of the initial solar boom of the early 2000s. Back then, the cost of solar equipment was relatively high and developers cut their costs by planting solar panels on beds of low-maintenance sand and gravel, at best seeding the land with monocrops of clover or short grasses. By 2018, though, researchers were compiling ample evidence that the shade from solar panels conserves soil moisture while enabling other shade-tolerant plants and grasses to thrive, opening the door to a powerful new tool in the farmland conservation toolkit. Since then, reducing wildfire risk has also emerged as a follow-on benefit.

To date, most agrivoltaic operations in the US focus on livestock grazing, which also helps reduce maintenance costs by preventing vegetation from overgrowing the panels. Habitat restoration to boost pollinator populations is also beginning to emerge.

Growing crops for human consumption is a next-level challenge, and that’s what the Piedmont Environmental Council in Virginia has set out to tackle. The organization’s pilot project at Roundabout Meadows in Aldie, Virginia, surfaced briefly on the CleanTechnica radar last month, when it earned the title “Plan of the Year” in the 2025 North American Agrivoltaics Awards program. Although the project weighs in at the practically minuscule size of half an acre, NAAA described the forthcoming project as a “deeply strategic installation that could have statewide ripple effects,” with the aim of launching the agrivoltaic field beyond fields for grazing and pollinator habitats, and into the human food crop area.

Agrivoltaics In Action

Activity at the PEC site was well underway by the time NAAA tapped the project for Plan of the Year, with the solar panels up and running along with an onsite energy storage system. Last week, PEC kindly emailed additional details to CleanTechnica in advance of a formal launch to be held on October 17.

The energy storage component may surprise certain high-ranking public officials who doubt that such systems exist, but there it is. “The Roundabout Meadows project will include a smart panel, which enables the farm to measure energy usage, as well as on-site battery storage,” PEC notes. The battery will enable onsite equipment to continue running on solar energy after the sun goes down, including well pumps, refrigerators, and heated greenhouses.

“Intended as a demonstration site and proof-of-concept for multiple applications, we’ve designed the 42-panel solar panel installation with four rows of vegetables directly in the ground to mimic a traditional farm setup,” PEC explains, “And four in raised beds to make the project equally relevant to smaller applications, including urban settings, rooftops, and other built environments.” Wineries, breweries, and parking lots are also on PEC’s radar.

PEC also draws attention to the broader context that supports agrivoltaic solutions for farmers and their communities. “PEC’s agrivoltaics pilot project is also part of a bigger story about agricultural and food system security and clean energy generation, battery storage, and net metering, all in a state facing unprecedented energy demands from data center development.”

15 Agrivoltaic Projects To Rule Them All

If all goes according to plan (and so far, it has), the Roundabout Meadows project will demonstrate that 42 solar panels can co-exist with eight rows of vegetables on a relatively small plot of land. Installed by the firm Tiger Solar, the solar panels are situated in three rows of 14 panels each, placed 12.5 feet apart to allow more sunlight onto the crops. The panels are also mounted on high racks measuring six feet tall, further easing access to the crop rows.

The plantings include lettuces and other vegetables known to thrive in partial shade, along with sun-loving staples like tomatoes and potatoes. The diverse selection will enable the researchers to collect data leading to recommendations for optimal plantings.

In a detailed article about the project last year, PEC described how the agrivoltaic movement has grown into a sprawling knowledge base. To launch the new project, PEC has drawn upon its experience engaging with other projects, solar industry stakeholders, and conservation groups. The new project also taps into Virginia Tech’s agrivoltaic stakeholder group, and it has earned technical assistance from agrivoltaic researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, through a Clean Energy to Communities grant. Last year, NREL also selected PEC to join a new cohort of 15 organizations conducting next-generation work in the agrivoltaic field.

PEC is already lined up to make a significant contribution to the effort. The project is designed to generate more energy than the farm currently needs, opening up the potential to replace its current stock of fuel-burning tools and equipment with electric ones.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/agrivoltaic-Piedmont-Environmental-Council-.png,N,,2025-10-11 19:02:33.096317

The Strategic Importance of American Cobalt and Copper

As we advance into 2025, American cobalt mines and American copper mines have become pivotal elements in the global strategy to secure critical minerals and foster clean energy transitions. The landscape has shifted dramatically due to growing demand for cobalt and copper—two minerals that are indispensable for the United States’ strategic industrial ambitions. These ambitions, focused on foundational clean energy technologies, electric vehicles (EVs), and advanced infrastructure development, underscore the metals’ importance not only for the economy but also for defense and national security.

Cobalt: An essential component in lithium-ion batteries, powering EVs and grid-scale energy storage solutions. Its critical role in batteries makes it a cornerstone for the green transition.

Copper: Renowned for its unparalleled electrical conductivity, copper is omnipresent in electric wiring, modern infrastructure, and virtually all renewable energy systems. Demand from EV charging networks, wind turbines, and solar infrastructure has never been higher.

However, the global supply chain for these minerals reveals serious vulnerabilities. Major cobalt production remains concentrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, while copper output is dominated by Chile and Peru. Recent geopolitical instability and supply chain disruptions have pushed the U.S. to boost domestic mining capacity and encourage investment in new mining projects—a move set to define the sector in 2025 and beyond.

State of American Cobalt Mining in 2025: New Companies and Advanced Production

American cobalt mining companies are gaining momentum, marking a resurgence that responds directly to escalating global demand and evolving clean energy initiatives. Historically, the United States played only a minor role in global cobalt production, representing a fraction of worldwide output. Yet, as strategic importance has become clear, a new wave of mining projects is underway—particularly in Idaho, Nevada, and Minnesota.

Key Developments in American Cobalt Mining Companies

Expanding Mining Capacity: Projects like the Idaho Cobalt Operations (ICO) are extracting cobalt from existing polymetallic deposits. These efforts are enabled by federal initiatives that streamline permitting processes and provide financial incentives.

If all you care about is the car itself, the best two-row crossover that Consumer Reports has reviewed is the recently refreshed Tesla Model Y.
Most of the categories on this list include more than one option that Consumer Reports recommends.
If that ""something fancy"" happens to be an electric crossover, then Consumer Reports says you won't do better than the Genesis GV60.
But in Consumer Reports' testing, the GV60 beat them all.","Electric vehicles promise a lower cost of ownership, quick acceleration, quiet rides, and the opportunity for a more spacious cabin that isn't constrained by the limits of a gasoline powertrain. They also offer the opportunity to never visit a gas station ever again. Some enthusiasts may miss having a manual transmission and an actual exhaust note, but for most people, EVs are basically the ideal daily drivers. The only problem is, it can be hard to tell which ones live up to their promises and which ones fall short.

The good news is, our friends over at Consumer Reports recently put together a list of the EVs that performed the best in its testing, while also offering the safety and reliability that you want out of a new car. This isn't just a list of the EVs with the highest overall score, either, since that isn't always super helpful. Instead, they broke the list down into five different categories and made recommendations based on which EV scored the highest in that particular segment. Let's take a look at which vehicles topped Consumer Reports' list in each category.

If you're on the hunt for a good old electric sedan, Consumer Reports says you should skip the Tesla Model 3 and get the Hyundai Ioniq 6 instead. The styling is a little controversial, but the benefit is better aerodynamics, and a more slippery design means better range. Depending on the size of the battery and the configuration you go for, the Ioniq 6 offers between 240 and 361 miles of range, and when you run out of juice, it also offers seriously fast charging.

The Ioniq 6 doesn't have the biggest trunk in the world, and CR didn't love the window and mirror controls, but it's still quick, comfortable and probably more spacious than you might expect based on the design. If you want something with more of a hatchback-like shape, though, CR's second-ranked electric car is the Kia Niro EV. It's front-wheel drive and doesn't quite have the range of a higher-end Ioniq 6 or its fast charging, but as far as practical daily drivers go, the electric Niro is still a compelling, relatively affordable EV.

The BMW 3 Series is one of the best-reviewed gas-powered sport sedans, and the BMW i4 is basically an electric 3 Series with a liftback. As it turns out, that's a recipe for a seriously compelling EV. Some of the controls could take some getting used to, and you may wish the rear seat were larger, but aside from those two, relatively small issues, there really isn't much to complain about with the i4.

It's quick, sporty, offers a nicely put together cabin, the seats are comfortable, and it's also Consumer Reports' top-ranked electric luxury sedan. On the low end, an i4 M50 on 20-inch wheels only gets 227 miles of range, but if you're really concerned about range, there's always the i4 eDrive 40 on 18-inch wheels that gets 318 miles. Either way, you'll get a sporty, fun-to-drive EV that's also incredibly quiet for those times when you aren't carving canyons and just want to relax. If you want more space, though, CR's second-ranked electric luxury sedan is the larger i5, which is more or less, you guessed it, the electric version of the 5 Series.

If all you care about is the car itself, the best two-row crossover that Consumer Reports has reviewed is the recently refreshed Tesla Model Y. It's quick, corners well, offers solid range and can charge on Tesla's Supercharger network, which road trippers will appreciate. That said, the ride and controls still aren't great, there's no support for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, and every dollar you spend on a Tesla helps enrich Elon Musk, who made it his personal mission to destroy the federal government from within.

Those of you who prefer not to enrich a guy who's responsible for babies being born with HIV, Consumer Reports' second-ranked two-row electric crossover is the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which is also quick, sporty, and quiet. As far as range is concerned, there's one Mach-E that offers only 240 miles, but if you don't need all-wheel drive, Ford offers a version that's rated at 320 miles.

Most of the categories on this list include more than one option that Consumer Reports recommends. If you're looking for an electric minivan replacement, though, CR says there's only one SUV worth considering: the Kia EV9. EPA range can be as low as 230 miles, but frequent road trippers will probably want the long-range version and its 304 miles of range. You probably won't want to carve canyons in this family hauler, but it's spacious, comfortable and charges pretty fast, which you'll appreciate on a road trip.

In fact, even if you have the budget for a luxury EV, if you want that third row, Consumer Reports says you should still seriously consider the EV9. It might not have the most prestigious badge that you can afford, but in CR's testing, it outperformed the more expensive Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV, Tesla Model X and Rivian R1S. Even if it isn't perfect, that's some seriously high praise for a Kia.

Sometimes you want something a little fancy, and as long as you can afford it, you know what? That's okay. If that ""something fancy"" happens to be an electric crossover, then Consumer Reports says you won't do better than the Genesis GV60. It looks outstanding, and the cabin is just as nice, if not nicer, than you may have been expecting. The styling means some compromises have to be made when it comes to rearward visibility, but it's a lot easier to forgive that when the GV60 looks as good as it does.

The performance version is only rated at 235 miles, but the longest-range version still does a commendable 294 miles. You'll have to give up all-wheel drive if you want to squeeze every mile out of the GV60 that you can, but it's the same story with pretty much every other EV, too. Could you buy from brands with more prestigious badges and longer histories? Sure. But in Consumer Reports' testing, the GV60 beat them all. Plus, you can't forget it also looks great.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/the-5-best-evs-you-can-buy-in-2025-according-to-consumer-reports/l-intro-1755886944.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 17:02:15.365039

Auto industry is installing many times more battery capacity than it will need, Reuters review shows

Federal raid at Hyundai’s Georgia plant marked another setback for one of the largest EV projects

STANTON, Tenn., Oct 10 (Reuters) – Stanton, Tennessee – population 450 – welcomed a massive new neighbor a few years ago: a Ford (F.N), electric-truck factory and a joint-venture battery plant slated to employ 6,000 workers.

Ford’s 2022 groundbreaking triggered an influx of construction activity into the former cotton-and-soybean farmlands outside of Memphis. Hard-hatted workers filled local diners. Developers scrambled to build homes and fire stations.

Stanton is quieter these days. Ford over the past 18 months repeatedly delayed phases of the project. The EV truck plant is slated to begin initial production in 2027 and start sending deliveries the next year, a timeline delayed several times from the original plan of coming online in 2025.

Ford said it “will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.”

The Ford complex is part of the so-called Battery Belt, a swath of factories stretching across the U.S. heartland that spans from Georgia to Indiana. Roughly two dozen battery projects worth tens of billions in investment have been announced this decade, promising to inject tens of thousands of jobs in Republican-dominated states like Georgia and Kentucky.

By last year, though, Americans’ waning enthusiasm for electric cars led automakers to delay or scrap some factory projects. Now, the additional fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent policy changes is descending on the Battery Belt.

Ford CEO Jim Farley last week offered the prediction that electric-car sales could fall by around 50% following the Sept. 30 expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for buyers, echoing other gloomy forecasts for the EV market.

The uncertain fate of these massive, high-tech factories and their employment has rattled the small rural communities that spent years hitching their economic futures to these projects.

Allan Sterbinsky, who retired as mayor of Stanton in December and advocated for the site for years before Ford came to town, said:

That’s on everybody’s mind, quite frankly,

Some residents worry that Ford will never follow through on the plant, the former mayor says. Others hope the company will repurpose the 3,600-acre site if demand doesn’t increase for EVs.

A Ford spokesperson pointed to the automaker’s community work in Stanton, including grants to public safety organizations as part of a broader $9 million commitment to the area.

A Reuters review of U.S. battery-investment plans shows those worries are justified. The industry appears headed toward a huge glut of factory capacity, if all those projects were to move ahead as planned.

By 2030, the planned battery plants would provide the capacity to produce 13 million to 15 million EVs annually, according to figures provided to Reuters by research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. But the industry now might only need about one-quarter of that factory space. S&P Global Mobility predicts only around 3 million EVs will be produced that year, and some would likely use batteries imported from other countries.

Some of that excess roughly 10 million-EV worth of battery capacity would likely be used for hybrids and extended-range EVs as well as the booming energy storage industry, but there is still a sizable gulf, said Stephanie Brinley, S&P Global Mobility automotive analyst.

The demise of the $7,500 tax credit – which had been in place for more than 15 years to persuade Americans to try green cars – is only the highest profile of several anti-EV measures put forth by the Trump administration. Combined, they further jeopardize battery projects and other electric-car-related investments, experts say. In the last few months several automakers have canceled, delayed or downsized EV projects.

Meanwhile, a pot of tens of billions of dollars available to companies that make EV batteries domestically has tighter restrictions that will likely reduce the amount of federal money that flows to the battery sites.

Jennifer Stafeil, tax auto sector lead for KPMG, said:

All of a sudden, much of what was originally going to benefit from these credits now no longer can to a large degree

Trump has said he is not anti-EV, but prefers that consumers decide what cars to buy, without government influence. He also has criticized EV-friendly regulations implemented under former President Joe Biden, which Trump has said were costly and threatened American auto jobs.

One of the nation’s largest EV projects, Hyundai Motor’s $12.6 billion assembly plant and joint-venture battery factory near Savannah, Georgia, is moving ahead. Last month the project suffered a setback when federal law enforcement raided it. Hyundai has said the fallout would delay the battery plant by at least two to three months.

In the three years since Hyundai (005380.KS), announced the megasite, 21 suppliers have opened operations near the site.

A spokesperson said:

Hyundai is committed to offering a diverse product lineup, including internal combustion, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and EV models.

“We understand that every customer is unique, and we strive to meet a wide range of needs,”

The complex is gearing up to hire 8,500 employees by 2031, and is paying wages 25% above the county average, said Trip Tollison, president of the Savannah Economic Development Authority.

Tollison acknowledged that some in the community worry about the uncertain future of the nascent EV industry that underpins all that development. He is hopeful Hyundai can flexibly shift to hybrid production if the EV market doesn’t take off.

He said:

That’s how you provide opportunities like this to lift people out of poverty,

The project can generate leasing money for landowners and farmers while powering tens of thousands of homes, according to Clean Wisconsin.
It makes sense to combine solar and wind energy because solar energy peaks during the day, while wind is typically stronger at night or during different times of year.","Wisconsin is returning to the wind energy game after 14 years without new projects, which is a lot for the US. The Public Service Commission (PSC) authorized a 118 megawatt wind farm in Grant and Iowa counties on September 26, 2025. The decision, according to campaign leaders like Rick Coelho and advocates like Clean Wisconsin, means huge progress on climate change, more renewable energy on the grid, and stronger local economies.

At the same time, regulators approved the 180-megawatt Whitewater Solar Farm, showing the synergy between solar and wind energy. When combined, these actions show that cleaner power can reduce emissions, create jobs, and boost environmental health. The approvals also point to a larger trend: state leaders are viewing renewables as useful tools for long-term resilience instead of just carbon cutters.

What Wisconsin approved—and why it matters

Wisconsin’s first wind farm since 2011 was approved by the PSC and this 118 MW project is located in Grant and Iowa counties, proving that wind development is once again on the rise.

The project can generate leasing money for landowners and farmers while powering tens of thousands of homes, according to Clean Wisconsin.

Renewable energy projects progress when regulations are clear, communities are involved, and environmental objectives are well-defined. And so the state authorized the 180 MW Whitewater Solar Farm, located close to the Jefferson–Walworth county boundary, in the same round of rulings. It makes sense to combine solar and wind energy because solar energy peaks during the day, while wind is typically stronger at night or during different times of year.

According to research by Clean Wisconsin, there are other benefits, like better water quality when solar panels reduce fertilizer from specific crops. Therefore, regulators see these permits as a reaction to climate policy, local economic strength, and environmental health. Initiatives like the Badger Hollow Project, that help the state in gaining knowledge in operations, location, and community benefits, are also part of this environment.

What “energy transition” means for communities

The effects that have on families show up in three simple ways:

Reliable electricity: By incorporating wind and solar energy, Wisconsin’s clean energy supply is improved. These resources work in parallel to reducing reliance on fossil fuels because their peaks happen at different periods. This helps many states achieve their bigger energy transition goals.

Local opportunity. For farmers and landowners, land leases can offer regular revenue, and construction and maintenance create jobs. Communities benefit more when they are involved from the beginning, helping to choose appropriate sites, establishing project guidelines, and communicating the outcomes, according to advocates like Rick Coelho.

Cleaner surroundings: Since renewable energy sources don’t burn fuel, they don’t emit any pollutants while they’re in use either. In order to improve the project execution, regulators are also pushing for bigger and more effective turbines that are made to produce less noise and collect more energy per unit. By linking renewable energy to cleaner lakes and streams, the state also demonstrated possible improvements in water quality with the Whitewater Solar Farm.

A transparent planning and siting process provides a fair approach for developers and communities, making easier the development of the projects.

The road up ahead

Wind and solar energy can power homes, provide income in rural communities, and reduce pollution all at once thanks to the wind projects in Iowa and Grant counties. Wisconsin already has a foundation to grow around, as shown by projects like the Badger Hollow Project. Now that new wind is coming online after years of silence, the state can develop more quickly and wisely.

What comes now? Continue involving communities, monitoring outcomes, refining design, and finding benefits that people can observe.",https://www.blanquivioletas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wind-farm-Wisconsin.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 18:01:05.781438

I write with respect to our continuing effort to reopen the government, negotiate a bipartisan spending agreement and decisively address the Republican healthcare crisis.

In the coming weeks, hardworking American taxpayers will experience dramatically increased healthcare premiums, copays and deductibles. Tens of millions of Americans will see their insurance payments increase by thousands of dollars per year, in an environment where the cost of living is already too high. That is why we must extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits immediately.

At the same time, Republicans have enacted the largest cut to Medicaid in American history, ripping healthcare away from millions of people. As a result of the Republican healthcare crisis, hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health centers are closing throughout the country. Urgent action is needed now.

Democrats remain ready to reopen the government and pay our troops. We will continue to strongly support federal workers who have been under vicious attack from the Trump administration all year. Unfortunately, Donald Trump and Rubber Stamp Republicans in Congress have pursued a my way or the highway, go-it-alone approach from the very beginning of his presidency. They would rather close the government than continue Affordable Care Act tax credits for working-class Americans and middle-class families.

Equally troublesome, Republicans have completely abdicated their governance responsibility by cancelling votes in the House for a third consecutive week. Instead of voting on legislation to reopen the government, pay our troops and address the Republican healthcare crisis, they remain on vacation.

That is why it is critically important for House Democrats to once again return to Washington to stand up for the healthcare of everyday Americans, pay our active duty troops and support hardworking federal civil servants. On Tuesday, October 14 at 6:00 p.m., we will convene at the Capitol for an in-person House Democratic Caucus meeting to discuss the path forward in connection with the Republican Shutdown and the healthcare crisis they have created. The next day, on Wednesday, October 15, there will be a full slate of work-related activities, including an action on the Capitol Steps, another Caucus meeting, a Steering & Policy hearing on rising healthcare costs, press engagements and our third virtual National Town Hall as we speak directly to the American people.

Thank you for your continued leadership and strength of purpose. I look forward to seeing you back in Washington as we fight to reopen the government, cancel the cuts, lower the cost and save healthcare.

Sincerely,

Hakeem Jeffries

In 2024, almost two trillion dollars were invested worldwide in clean energy, and for every euro dollar spent on fossil fuels, more than two went into clean energy.
We will never unlock the full potential of clean energy abundance if the stories we tell focus on scarcity and sacrifice.
Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said: “We are entering the age of renewable abundance and this Global Renewable Summit proves it.
On energy security, energy justice, energy independence, there are so many new elements that have come together to drive lower prices, create simpler technologies and growth through easier to install infrastructure.”","In Short : Global leaders from governments and businesses have pledged to accelerate the transition toward renewable energy abundance. The commitment focuses on expanding clean energy investments, enhancing technology adoption, and strengthening international cooperation. By promoting large-scale deployment of solar, wind, and green hydrogen, the initiative aims to achieve global climate goals and drive sustainable economic growth worldwide.

In Detail : New York, USA – An exceptional group of government leaders, private sector executives, and figureheads from civil society financiers came together today for the High-Level Session on Renewable Energy Abundance, a flagship event of Climate Week NYC and the high-level opening of the Global Renewables Summit.

The event showcased their commitment to accelerating the build-out of zero-emissions infrastructure, driving a transformation that will reshape entire economies and societies. These technologies are already ushering in a new era of global prosperity, innovation, competitiveness, and resilience, while reducing energy costs for businesses and communities.

The leaders discussed the coordinated action needed to raise ambition, set policies to significantly increase renewable capacity, and tackle obstacles that are holding back progress.

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen took to the stage alongside leaders such as the Hon President William Ruto of Kenya; the Hon Prime Minister Philip Davis of the Bahamas; Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen of Australia; founder and Executive Chairman Andrew Forrest of Fortescue; CEO and Founder Bruce Douglas of the Global Renewables Alliance; and Chair of the Board Mike Rann of Climate Group.

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: “The energy transition has truly taken off. In 2024, almost two trillion dollars were invested worldwide in clean energy, and for every euro dollar spent on fossil fuels, more than two went into clean energy. And the economic case is clear. The momentum is real. But we all know that momentum alone is not enough. We need action. So to usher in a true age of renewable abundance with clean, affordable energy for all, we must act decisively. We must act as governments and industry, and we must act together, across borders, across continents. Clean energy is not only about addressing climate change. It is, in my view, also about energy security and about prosperity.

So my message to the CEOs and investors that are here today, is please tell us what you need, what guarantees, what risk sharing tools, or what is the regulatory conducive environment that you need, that we can provide that will allow you to invest at scale where it matters most. And what must governments do to help you deliver. In return, of course, we ask you to put your capital, your technologies, your innovation to work in the regions where it will have the greatest impact, so that together, we deliver on net zero, strengthen energy security, and that together we drive prosperity.”

The high-level session, organised by Climate Group, Fortescue and the Global Renewables Alliance, took place at a critical time for the global energy transition; just two days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, where many countries are expected to announce their NDCs (national climate action plans).

Hon Prime Minister Philip Davis of of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas said: “We need to be the most passionate and effective evangelists for the proposition that energy reforms will expand our possibilities, not limit them. We need decision makers everywhere to understand that replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will not come at the expense of prosperity, but is a prerequisite for future prosperity. We will never unlock the full potential of clean energy abundance if the stories we tell focus on scarcity and sacrifice. Instead, let’s do a better job at painting a vivid picture for our citizens of a future in which clean energy generates prosperity that is broadly shared.

We know the work of energy reform is complex, expensive and at times overwhelming. Yet we also know that every panel installed, every regulation modernized, every grid, moves us closer to a world where energy abundance is real. The point is not perfection. The point is progress, and the belief that by working together, each step we take strengthens the chance of success for us all.”

The leaders discussed how the global economy is moving from an era of energy constraints to one defined by energy possibilities, and how renewable energy and electrification are becoming the bedrock of future prosperity, productivity, and competitiveness. They delved deep into the need to work towards a future in which energy security, affordability, and sustainability reinforce one another, creating widespread social and economic benefits.

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said: “We are entering the age of renewable abundance and this Global Renewable Summit proves it. Renewables now lead the way in new power generation, with investments growing 14% annually since 2018, despite pandemics, inflation, and geopolitical shocks. But the story is incomplete: emerging markets and developing economies, representing a third of global GDP, still capture less than 10% of energy transition finance. As we head toward COP30 and deliver on the UAE Consensus mandate to triple renewables by 2030, we must put equity and impact at the heart of this transition.”

For families and communities, this will mean lower energy costs, enhanced energy security, and new economic opportunities. For industry, it will mean an unprecedented chance to scale innovation — from artificial intelligence to advanced manufacturing — powered by near-limitless clean energy.

Bruce Douglas, CEO of the Global Renewables Alliance underlined: “The path is clear: phasing out volatile fossil fuels whilst delivering renewable energy abundance is how we create prosperity, stability and real energy security. However – if we want to build the clean, resilient and competitive energy system of the future – we must all stand up, come together and act now.”

Ambassador André Correa do Lago, President-Designate, COP30 said: “The association of renewables with other agendas is a very important step forward. On energy security, energy justice, energy independence, there are so many new elements that have come together to drive lower prices, create simpler technologies and growth through easier to install infrastructure.”",https://www.eqmagpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/International-Renewable-Energy-Agency_IRENA-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 16:02:22.188070

Governments want EVs. Automakers are racing to deliver them. But for car enthusiasts, this all-electric rush isn’t just about saving the planet—it’s reshaping the hobby we love. And not in a good way.

The EV Mandate: Killing ICE Icons

Automakers are dumping R&D money into EVs to meet global emissions rules, and guess what’s getting cut?

Manual transmissions are disappearing almost completely.

Affordable sports cars like the Camaro and Challenger are gone.

Even long-running models like the Mustang and Porsche 911 face uncertain futures beyond the next decade.

And the few ICE performance cars still around? They’re more expensive than ever because they’re being treated like “last hurrah” halo products.

EVs Aren’t Cheaper—For Anyone

Enthusiasts were told EVs would make performance accessible, but the reality is brutal:

The average new EV price in 2025? Nearly $54,000.

Lightweight, affordable sports EVs basically don’t exist yet—everything’s a heavy crossover or a 1,000-horsepower hyper-sedan.

Battery replacement costs still scare off buyers, especially for cars meant to be driven hard.

EV Performance is Impressive… But Soulless

Yes, Teslas and Rimacs are blisteringly fast. But enthusiasts aren’t just here for 0-60 times. We want:

Manual gear changes.

Exhaust crackles and engine character.

Lightweight cars with personality—not 5,000-lb torque monsters.

As great as EV acceleration is, many enthusiasts describe it as “video-game fast”—instant, efficient, but emotionally flat.

Who’s Still Fighting for Us?

All is not lost. Some automakers are still throwing us a bone:

Toyota & Lexus – Developing synthetic fuels and keeping manual transmissions alive in GR models.

Porsche – Promising to preserve ICE 911s as long as possible.

Dodge – Experimenting with “eMuscle” that mimics V8 sound (cringe? maybe… but at least they’re trying).

And synthetic fuels, hybrids, and biofuels could extend the life of enthusiast cars well past the EV deadline.

The EV push was supposed to move us forward. But for enthusiasts, it feels like we’re being shoved into an expensive, characterless future while our favorite ICE cars die off early. The good news? Enthusiast demand isn’t dead. If we keep buying, sharing, and supporting the brands that fight for ICE cars, they’ll keep building them—at least for a little while longer.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zlfdFiPcFZNp3ia8nmBTyw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_auto_wire_articles_747/6a731484fd240cdaf12b4601ba3942bf,N,,2025-10-11 16:03:34.290867

As of June of this year, there were 91.5 GW of module manufacturing capacity across various technologies and wattages with ALMM certification, and 13.5 GW of cell capacity was listed under ALMM List-II out of all installed cell production capacity.
On day one, he stated that the United States would implement tariffs on India, which has now affected the solar manufacturing sector.","India is among the most industrious countries in the world, and as such requires vast amounts of energy to meet the rising power demands that the nation needs to provide its citizens with a quality way of life. The Indian government has recently announced that it has installed 44 GW of module capacity during the first half of 2025. A report from Mercom has stated that India’s solar manufacturing sector has seen significant growth in H1 2025, which underscores the nation’s efforts to increase the capacity in the market.

Mercom Capital Group reports an increase in solar manufacturing in India

For a nation with the exceedingly large population that India has, fostering renewable energy is needed to deliver acceptable electricity levels to the grid, while keeping the non-renewable energy sector relatively productive.

In a move that is unprecedented for India, solar imports declined while exports saw a significant increase during the first half of 2025. A new Mercom India Research report states that PV module production capacity is rising by 44.2 GW and cell capacity by 7.5 GW.

The total capacity listed under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) List-I and List-II has now reached 109.5 GW for modules and nearly 17.9 GW for cells, respectively.

According to Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu, despite the huge PV production capacity, actual operational capacities can be 30% to 40% lower. Mr Prabhu believes that ALMM-certified capacities deliver a more accurate reflection of supply, even though wattage breakdown is not specified.

As of June of this year, there were 91.5 GW of module manufacturing capacity across various technologies and wattages with ALMM certification, and 13.5 GW of cell capacity was listed under ALMM List-II out of all installed cell production capacity.

“New module lines typically take several months to stabilize before reaching full utilization, while smaller facilities continue to operate at lower levels, constrained by outdated technologies, lack of scale, and lower wattage modules that are no longer in demand. This has led to fewer orders and accelerated consolidation with only larger manufacturers that possess scale, efficiency and credibility remaining competitive” – Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu

Donald Trump’s tariffs have affected the export of Indian made solar capacity

The world became aware of Donald Trump’s plans to implement tariffs on a variety of nations when he began his second term. On day one, he stated that the United States would implement tariffs on India, which has now affected the solar manufacturing sector.

During the reporting period of the Mecom report, India imported 44.6 GW of solar modules and cells, with the former accounting for 34% and the latter 66%, which underscores the progress being made by India in the sector.

“Exports have also been hit hard. Shipments to the United States, which accounted for more than 95% of Indian module exports, have come to a halt after the recent 50 tariff.” – Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu

As the United States will continue to rely on solar and storage capacity in its nation, India will need to consider its next move to alleviate the pressure on the solar manufacturing sector.

Now, a logistical crisis looms on the horizon.

Equinor’s Empire Wind is a 810-megawatt project being built about 20 miles off the shore of Long Island, promising enough energy to power 500,000 homes once completed in 2027. The Trump administration halted construction in April, but allowed it to resume in May. The latest challenge came on Thursday with the unexpected cancellation of a contract for the massive new wind-turbine installation vessel that Equinor had been planning to use on the project next year.

Two shipbuilding companies broke out into a public skirmish — one unexpectedly cancelling a contract and the other threatening legal action — over the construction of the specialized ship. The fate of the vessel, which is already more than 98% complete and floating in Singapore’s waters, is now uncertain.

The cancelled $475 million agreement leaves Equinor scrambling to figure out how to maintain progress and bring Empire Wind online on schedule.

“We have been informed by Maersk of an issue concerning its contract with Seatrium related to the wind turbine installation vessel originally contracted by Empire Offshore Wind LLC for use in 2026,” said an Equinor spokesperson via email. ​“We are currently assessing the implications of this issue and evaluating available options.”

Only a handful of vessels in the world are capable of lifting, carrying, and piecing together the massive steel components of offshore turbines.

Thursday’s news highlights the complexity of bringing just one U.S. offshore wind farm over the finish line, given the combination of logistical difficulties and political obstacles put up by the Trump administration.

In an email to Canary Media, Maersk Offshore Wind spokesperson Caroline Knox confirmed that the company terminated its building contract with Seatrium ​“due to delays and related construction issues.” Knox declined to comment further.

Seatrium told Reuters it was evaluating its options for the vessel, including via ongoing talks with Empire Wind, and considering legal action.

Singapore-based Seatrium is fresh off the monumental achievement of berthing a first-of-its-kind offshore-wind installation vessel in U.S. waters. In September, the company delivered the $715 million Charybdis from its Brownsville, Texas, shipyard to the Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Virginia. The American-made vessel is owned by utility Dominion Energy, which immediately put it to work building the largest offshore wind farm in the U.S. The ship’s smooth delivery is a major reason why the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind farm is progressing fast enough to have a new March 2026 launch date.

The ship’s hull is 472 feet long and 184 feet wide, making it one of the biggest vessels of its kind in the world. And, more importantly, it was built to serve the entire U.S. sector — not just Dominion Energy’s project. In other words, the Charybdis could be a solution to Equinor’s new problem.

“Upon the completion of its charter with [Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind], the versatile Charybdis will be available to support a variety of projects, including offshore wind and other critical heavy lift shoreline projects, such as salvage operations or other energy projects,” said Jeremy Slayton, a Dominion Energy representative, in an email to Canary Media.

An Equinor spokesperson provided no comment about Charybdis but reiterated that the company is exploring all options.

The nations in attendance were some of the biggest economies in the world, which laid out their nationally determined contributions. The world has become acutely aware that the need to adopt renewable energy has become as urgent as ever, and several countries, like China, have taken significant steps towards reaching their lofty ambitions of decarbonization.

The nations of the world are working hard to meet the goals set out by the Paris Agreement

When the nations of the world came together in Paris to discuss and make commitments to the global decarbonization efforts, the meeting was hailed as an epitome of global cooperation. Throughout history, rarely have the biggest nations of the world come together to agree on anything, let alone something as divisive as the climate.

However, in an unprecedented move, the nations of the world laid out their countries ‘ commitments to reaching the decarbonization goals. While every nation in attendance at the event in New York has taken significant steps to reduce its emissions, China has done more than any other nation.

Of the nations shown attended, the majority outlined their nationally determined contributions, while those who did not are expected to do so in the coming weeks before the leaders meet in Belem, Brazil, for the 30th meeting of the U.N. Conference of the Parties (COP30). Among the nations that have already expressed their NDCs are:

China

The European Union

Peru

Türkiye

several small island states

Several nations have already expressed their NDCs before the event, while some are yet to release theirs, but are expected to do so in the near future.

While progress has been made, more needs to be done to reach the global decarbonization goals

The NDCs already expressed are commendable, but praise will only get you so far before more tangible action is required. Every nation can claim they are doing its best to reach its emission goals, but a lack of investments and slow adoption of the renewable energy sector has led to many pointing out that the pace of transformation is not fast enough.

“It is hopeful, but not fast enough, nor at the scale needed. Good direction of travel notwithstanding, this is not enough action to avert the worst impacts climate change will visit upon the people of this planet. Countries need to keep turning these promises into clear action at home.” – Manish Bapna, president and CEO of NRDC

China has emerged as a leader in the global community regarding actual steps taken by the government in reducing the reliance on fossil fuels. Europe has seen robust demand for renewable energy capacity, but more needs to be done to adopt the technology.

China has outlined its ambitions during President Xi’s speech to the assembly. He highlighted several measures the Chinese have taken, which include bringing the total installed wind and solar capacity to 3,600 gigawatts, among others.

It is a curious twist of fate that Scotland’s oil and gas reserves are declining just as climate change creates a need to move towards low-carbon sources of energy. And it is a hugely serendipitous one that Scotland is so well placed to become a global leader in renewable energy.

However, a new report by Future Economy Scotland spells out just how poorly this country has been capitalising on its good fortune. For, while 18,000 direct and indirect jobs in oil and gas have been lost since 2014, only 6,000 have been created in clean energy.

Missed opportunities will be snapped up

The report warns oil and gas jobs could decline by anything from 20 per cent to a staggering 50 per cent by 2030. If correct, this is the kind of situation that should be regarded as close to a national emergency.

The Scottish and UK governments should be urgently working with both each other and the energy industry to find ways to ensure the loss of oil jobs is slowed and the growth of green energy jobs is dramatically increased. If the overall rate of decline across both sectors continues, the wider economic consequences will be severe, particularly for the North East, and overseas competitors will snap up our missed opportunities.

However, according to the report, there are reasons to be optimistic. It estimates that a well-managed industrial transition could create up to 40,000 more energy jobs than are lost over the next five years. This must be our goal.

There has been much talk about a ‘just transition’ for oil and gas workers, so that they can move to well-paid jobs in renewables and avoid the fate of 1980s coal miners. But all too often it has been ‘just talk’. Now is the time for action.","https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2025/10/10/16/06/PA-80113493.jpeg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&trim=75,41,196,80&crop=",N,,2025-10-11 17:02:12.192160

Scotland has lost three oil and gas jobs for every one clean energy job created over the past decade, new research has shown, with the impact described as “devastating”.

A report published by the think-tank Future Economy Scotland (FES) warns the country risks repeating the mistakes of past deindustrialisation.

The research said total employment supported by North Sea oil and gas had fallen by a third (32 per cent) since 2014, amounting to 34,000 job losses.

The findings come as a Chinese company piles pressure on the UK government to approving its controversial plans for a massive wind turbine factory in Scotland.

Ming Yang unveiled details of its proposals for a project earmarked for Ardersier port in the Highlands, which would involve investment of up to £1.5 billion and create as many as 1,500 jobs.

But the UK government has not yet given the company permission to move ahead with the plans and a source told The Scotsman ministers would not be “rushed into anything when there are several factors, including national security, to consider”.

FES said just 6,000 new direct and supply chain jobs in clean energy have been created since 2014, compared to 18,000 equivalent oil and gas jobs lost.

And forecasts show oil and gas jobs could decline by another 20 to 50 per cent by 2030, threatening tens of thousands more roles, the think-tank said.

The new report calls for pro-active policy decisions to ""fully seize the economic opportunities offered by decarbonisation"". It argues the energy transition could create up to 40,000 more jobs than will be lost by 2030 if decisive action is taken.

The report is published today as the SNP gathers in Aberdeen for the party's annual conference.

""Our research shows that, with the right ambition and policy support, the net zero transition can create more energy jobs than will be lost. But to make that happen, we need far more pro-active policies to create green jobs, retrain workers, and guarantee a just transition for the workers and communities.”

The report recommends the Scottish Government develops a clear transition roadmap while implementing an ambitious green industrial strategy.

It also calls for expanded retraining programmes and a boost to college funding, as well as improved pay and conditions in green sectors.

Scottish Conservative energy spokesman Douglas Lumsden said: “This grim report exposes the devastating impact on jobs in the oil and gas sector due to the SNP and Labour’s hostility towards it.

“Everyone wants action on an energy transition, but reckless policies from the UK and Scottish governments mean a demolition of the oil and gas industry is happening at a rapid pace.

“While we still rely on oil and gas, it’s just common sense we should be producing it here in Scotland.”

He added: “Our oil and gas sector stands at a cliff-edge, but the Scottish Conservatives will continue to fight their corner and demand an affordable transition that protects jobs and brings down bills for consumers.”

A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “Renewable energy is already boosting Scotland’s economy and will provide many more jobs for the communities across the country as well as wider infrastructure benefits.

“We are also very clear in our support for a just transition for Scotland’s valued oil and gas sector, recognising the maturity of the North Sea basin and in line with our climate change commitments and energy security.

“Workers are at the heart of the transition, and we are supporting them with the powers available to us. Through initiatives such as the Just Transition Fund and the Energy Transition Fund, we have already invested £120 million to support the North East’s transition to net zero helping to create green jobs, support innovation and secure the highly skilled workforce of the future.”

Under the first of three phases, Ming Yang said it would invest up to £750 million in an advanced manufacturing facility – with the first production taking place by late 2028.

Latter phases would see the facility expand and create an “offshore wind industry ecosystem” around the hub.

Ming Yang announced its plans on Friday following discussions with the Scottish and UK governments over the past two years, and just days after a huge global investment summit in Edinburgh attended by Ming Yang UK chief executive Aman Wang.

The company has been waiting since the spring for UK government approval for them to enter the British renewables supply chain, amid national security concerns.

Ming Yang signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government in 2021 but has not yet received permission to proceed.

A UK government source told The Scotsman the company “seems to be trying to pre-empt us”, adding that “we’re not being rushed into anything when there are several factors, including national security, to consider”.

Ming Yang is the only company that can produce floating wind turbines for the European market, with 60 per cent of the ScotWind contract for floating wind - making up around 15GW of energy.

First Minister John Swinney has previously said that floating offshore wind is “central to my vision for Scotland’s future as a modern and dynamic nation”.

Ardersier, near Inverness, is one of the “green freeport” initiatives which offer tax and customs incentives to encourage investment.

Last month Ming Yang and Octopus Energy announced they would be in partnership to develop new wind projects.

Zhang Chuanwei, founder and chairman of the Ming Yang group, said: We are excited by the prospect of investing in the UK and look forward to finalising our investment decision.”

Mr Wang said: “We firmly believe that by moving forward with our plans to create jobs, skills and a supply chain in the UK, we can make this country the global hub for offshore wind technology.

“We fully support the Government’s mission to become a clean energy superpower, and I’m confident that once the plans are approved we can make a valued contribution to this goal.”

A UK government spokesperson said: “This is one of a number of companies that wants to invest in the UK. Any decisions made will be consistent with our national security.”

In November last year, Conservative MP Nick Timothy asked energy minister Michael Shanks about Ming Yang’s plans to invest in Scotland, saying the Government should rule out investment from “hostile states”.

He said Ming Yang “benefits from huge subsidies in China but there are serious questions about energy security and national security”.","https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2025/10/10/15/45/Scotland-has-lost-three-oil-and-gas-jobs-for-every-one-created-in-clean-energy.jpeg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&trim=94,0,96,0&crop=",N,,2025-10-11 18:01:10.461168

On September 12, 2025, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") proposed to effectively put an end to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (""GHGRP""), which currently requires certain industrial facilities in the U.S. to measure and report greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions to EPA (the ""Proposal""). The proposal would remove reporting obligations for all but one source category in the current rule (petroleum and natural gas systems). This alert explains the Proposal and comments on its potential effect on certain affected industries.

Background

The Clean Air Act (""CAA""), the main federal law in the United States that governs air pollution,1 sets out a comprehensive regulatory framework administered largely by EPA but implemented in partnership with state governments to improve air quality and regulate sources of air pollution. The CAA was first enacted in 1970 and received its last significant overhaul in 1990. The CAA did not expressly provide EPA with the authority to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide or other GHGs, but Congress and the EPA have still tried to use it to that end.

EPA created the GHGRP in 2009.2 The GHGRP requires large GHG emitters to monitor and report their annual GHG emissions to EPA, and thus functions as an information-collection and transparency program. According to the Proposal, approximately 8,200 facilities, suppliers, and CO2 injection sites submit annual data under the GHGRP. Over time, EPA has expanded the GHGRP to cover 47 different industries, ranging from petroleum and natural gas systems to landfills and manure management facilities. EPA estimates that compliance with the program costs affected industries $303 million annually ($256 million of which is incurred by companies in the petroleum and natural gas industries).

EPA issued the rule under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act. Section 114 states (in relevant part) that the EPA Administrator may require owners or operators of emissions sources, equipment manufacturers, or others subject to the CAA to make reports to the EPA for the purpose of (i) developing implementation plans, standards, and regulations, (ii) determining whether any person is in violation of such plans and standards, or (iii) carrying out any provision of the CAA other than a provision of Title II (relating to motor vehicle emissions).

The Proposal

The Proposal seeks to completely eliminate reporting obligations for 46 of the 47 industries required to report under the GHGRP (referred to as source categories). The Proposal does not remove those obligations for most petroleum and natural gas systems, as the data collected from those systems under the GHGRP are necessary to calculate the waste emissions charge enacted in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. However, because the collection of the waste emissions charge was postponed until 2034 by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Proposal suspends the reporting requirements for affected systems until that time.

The Proposal points back to the express terms of Section 114 of the CAA as the legal basis for the repeal of the GHGRP. As previously discussed, Section 114 authorizes EPA to require regulated entities to submit information necessary for EPA to carry out certain responsibilities under the CAA. In the Proposal, EPA asserts that its authority under Section 114 is not unlimited, and that the agency must show that any information it requires is relevant to EPA's actions or obligations under the CAA. The Proposal points out that data collected under the GHGRP (from 47 source categories over more than 10 years) has rarely been used by EPA to inform new source performance standards. Moreover, the Proposal expressly states that EPA is not planning to develop any such regulations at this time. The Proposal therefore concludes that EPA lacks authority to continue to collect GHGRP data under Section 114 because the reporting requirements do not serve any underlying statutory purpose.

Alternatively, the Proposal characterizes the GHGRP as discretionary under Section 114, since the statute says that EPA ""may"" collect information. Current EPA leadership thus argues that it can simply terminate the GHGRP on the grounds that the Administrator no longer considers the information necessary to carry out the requirements of the CAA. The Proposal states that, if information submitted under the Program is needed for any purpose, the Administrator could simply issue a new information request under Section 114, as done for other purposes under the CAA.

What does the Proposal mean for companies?

The practical effect of the repeal of the GHGRP is expected to be fairly limited for most industries. The Proposal notes that $256 million of the total $303 million annual cost of the program are concentrated in the petroleum and natural gas industries. For all other industries subject to the program, the total annual cost of the program is only approximately $50 million. When that figure is spread across all of the companies required to report, the total annual cost of the program appears to be fairly modest for most of the regulated industries.

Arguably, larger companies are less likely to be affected by the Proposal. Those companies often collect and disclose GHG emissions data for reasons unrelated to U.S. federal law. For example, those companies may have foreign legal obligations, internal and/or publicly-stated ESG commitments, and buyer/supplier demands for greener products that require them to calculate and report their GHG emissions on a regular basis. Thus, we do not expect many larger companies to cease tracking and reporting of GHGs based solely on the Proposal. Some smaller and domestic entities, however, such as municipal landfills and wastewater treatment plants, have fewer competing obligations. Those entities may therefore see some practical benefit from no longer having to collect and report GHG emissions data to EPA.

The Proposal also notes that some 20 U.S. states implement state-level greenhouse gas reporting that either incorporates 40 CFR Part 98 by reference or relies on data collected under the GHGRP. Facilities in those states may continue to have an obligation to collect and report their data to state regulators. The administration's proposal to repeal federal data collection requirements may also spur additional states to pass their own programs that apply within their borders.

Since the data collected by the GHGRP is used for a variety of purposes, we also expect to see some impacts on other federal regulatory programs. The Proposal notes that the data is used to inform the phase down of hydrofluorocarbons under the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, and in the implementation of federal tax credits for carbon dioxide sequestration (45Q) and clean hydrogen production (45V). EPA acknowledges that the data collected by the GHGRP is important for those programs, but argues that those benefits are not required to carry out the Agency's functions under the CAA, and should be collected in different, more efficient ways. If the Proposal goes through, we would anticipate further regulatory action will be required by EPA, the Treasury Department and some state governments to implement new reporting specific to those programs.

Repeal of the reporting requirements would also lead to the loss of detailed information about GHG emissions in the United States beyond 2024. That information is currently collected by the Electronic Greenhouse Gas Reporting Tool (e-GGRT) and made available to the public through the Envirofacts and Facility Level Information on Greenhouse Gases Tool (""FLIGHT""). The Proposal states that EPA does not intend to ""maintain the electronic functionality of the information collection system"" after repeal, so it is unclear whether the GHG data in those systems will remain available. That information is widely used by researchers and policymakers to track, inform, and evaluate policy regarding GHG emissions. While that information can be collected through other means, the loss of that information may impact policy making in the future.

Broader context

The Trump administration has not hidden its skepticism about climate change and the risk it poses to human health and the environment. In July 2025 the Department of Energy (""DOE"") issued a report titled ""A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate."" According to the DOE's website, one of the key findings of the report is that ""carbon dioxide (CO2)-induced warming appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and that aggressive mitigation strategies could be more harmful than beneficial."" The administration has taken several steps that are consistent with that view, including (a) withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, (b) proposing to repeal the 2009 ""endangerment finding"" which found that certain GHGs cause or contribute to air pollution that endangers public welfare (and thus established the need to regulate GHGs under the CAA), (c) proposing to repeal all GHG emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants, and (d) announcing its intent to spend $625 million to expand power generation fueled by coal and open 13 million acres of federal land for coal leasing. Those actions, plus the proposed repeal of the GHGRP, demonstrate that the current administration has committed to reduce, if not eliminate, GHG regulation at the federal level in the U.S.

Next steps

The EPA is collecting comments on the Proposal until November 3, 2025. For more information on the Proposal and instructions on how to comment, please see EPA's fact sheet.

If adopted, the final language of the Proposal would take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. The Proposal states that, if implemented, 2024 would be the final reporting year, meaning affected entities would not need to submit 2025 data in 2026.

The Proposal may face legal challenges. Potential challengers include environmental advocacy groups, states, and local governments or tribes that rely on GHGRP data for policymaking and enforcement. Litigation may focus on EPA's interpretation of its authority under the CAA (particularly Section 114) or the consistency of the Proposal with the CAA's statutory purposes. Plaintiffs may also seek to stay implementation of the rule once finalized, pending judicial review.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12122_4252.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:43.990867

The “Work and Save” program would allow those who opt in to save directly through a payroll deduction before they even see their paycheck.
The money is professionally managed through private-sector investment managers selected by the North Carolina Small Business Retirement Savings Program Board.
Lowery announced his resignation from the North Carolina General Assembly on the House floor on Sept. 23.
“This proposal, over 10 years, would save Medicaid a half a billion dollars,” said Steven Hahn, North Carolina AARP communications lead.","For some North Carolinians, the road to retirement is anything but even.

While some workers can count on employer-backed savings plans, nearly half of North Carolinians will be left navigating the path to their golden years without a map, according to an AARP analysis.

The AARP Policy Institute found that in 2020, over 48 percent of North Carolina’s private sector employees — roughly 1,823,000 people — were employed by a business that does not offer any type of retirement plan.

A proposal to help people save for retirement that’s before the General Assembly could help bridge that gap by giving hundreds of thousands of uncovered workers a clearer path toward financial security in their later years.

“It is a great way to not only save the state money, but really push for a kind of self-reliance, and encourage folks to create that culture of saving,” said Chris Brandenburg, North Carolina AARP manager of state and federal advocacy.

A 2021 Employee Benefit Research Institute study found that about 82 percent of employees with access to a retirement plan had more than $25,000 in total savings and investments, and 63 percent had $100,000 or more. However, only 28 percent of those without access to such a plan had over $25,000 saved, and only 9 percent had $100,000 or more.

House Bill 79 would provide the pathway to access through a public-private partnership retirement savings program. The “Work and Save” program would allow those who opt in to save directly through a payroll deduction before they even see their paycheck. Participation would be optional and free for small businesses, employees and even self-employed workers.

How it works, according to the bill:

Each participant’s savings go into an individual retirement account (IRA) created under the program.

By default, it’s a Roth IRA, though participants can later choose a traditional IRA instead.

Contributions are deposited directly from payroll into the employee’s IRA.

The money is professionally managed through private-sector investment managers selected by the North Carolina Small Business Retirement Savings Program Board.

The funds are held in a trust, separate from the state’s general fund. The state, employers and the Board have no ownership of participant contributions or earnings — those belong entirely to the individual account holder.

The bill received a favorable response when presented by bill-sponsor and then-Rep. Jarrod Lowery (R-Lumberton) to a committee at the General Assembly in Raleigh in late June. But it has a long way to go before becoming law.

Lowery announced his resignation from the North Carolina General Assembly on the House floor on Sept. 23. The former member has taken a role with the U.S. Department of Interior, and his brother, John Lowery, has been recommended to serve the remainder of the term.

Down the path of other ‘Work and Saves’

During the hearing of the House Committee on Pensions and Retirement, few questions were raised, but one of them was about other states doing this sort of program.

It turns out 17 have enacted an auto-IRA program, and 11 of those are up and running. The first, Oregon Saves, launched in 2017. The application of the program is working differently in some states, according to AARP.

Oregon Saves enrolled nearly 118,000 people from more than 21,000 businesses, who saved collectively $200 million through the program in 2023, according to a news release by the state.

Across multiple state programs, the total assets in auto-IRA or state-automated savings plans have passed $2 billion as of mid-2025, according to the Center for Retirement Initiatives.

The center found that automatic enrollment tends to increase saving behavior among those who would otherwise not opt in, and that opt-outs are relatively low when the process is automatic.

North Carolina’s program would be opt-in, making it different from the 17 states that have programs in place. Therefore, it’s hard to compare what program participation and savings could be in North Carolina.

“I think this is just tremendously good public policy,” said Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Raleigh) during the committee hearing. He then asked whether it could be up and running before the proposed date of July 1, 2027.

Lowery answered that the date had been chosen to give enough time for a public awareness campaign, to get a board in place to oversee it and for creating the actual system to begin taking contributions.

The bill was passed on to the House Committee on Insurance on June 25, but there’s been no movement on the bill since.

Budget ties and savings

While HB79 is on hold, the conversation around it intersects with larger fiscal debates at the General Assembly. Lawmakers haven’t yet come to an agreement on a state budget proposal this year, so they passed a so-called mini-budget in June that funds only critical programs. That limited spending plan left the state’s Medicaid program with a shortfall that’s unresolved, spurring the state Department of Health and Human Services to cut rates to providers to keep the program solvent.

Even as those Medicaid rate cuts take effect, lawmakers are weighing how to balance immediate spending needs with long-term sustainability.

“This proposal, over 10 years, would save Medicaid a half a billion dollars,” said Steven Hahn, North Carolina AARP communications lead. “That's why it's timely now in this current federal debate as states are going to have to pay more. Where are we gonna get the money? Well, let's try to get people to have enough money that they're not collecting Medicaid.”

While helping more North Carolinians save for retirement could, over time, lessen reliance on public assistance programs — it also helps those retirees actually access those “golden years.”

“If you're just betting on Social Security — it's not enough to cover housing, medications and travel right now. And that means that something's gonna have to go lacking,” Lowery said. “If you're not able to cover the cost of housing, the cost of medication, the cost of travel, you're definitely not gonna be able to enjoy life, the fruits of your labor.

“This is the way to get North Carolinians more prepared for retirement, but also help the state's long term fiscal outlook.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a5bfda/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe2%2Fa2%2F03a7648d4089b6415f41adb1c9a9%2Fretire.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 20:01:29.832463

Green industrial policy refers to deliberate government strategy designed to reshape economic structures and steer industries toward low-carbon, environmentally sustainable paths. It is not simply about building more factories or generating growth, but about aligning growth with climate goals, social inclusion, and long-term resilience.

Indonesia has recently announced an ambitious plan: to install 100 gigawatts of solar capacity, including 80 gigawatts of distributed solar arrays paired with battery storage in nearly 80,000 villages, managed by village cooperatives (Merah Putih Cooperatives) and 20 gigawatts in centralized solar plants. These village-scale solar plus storage systems are projected to produce electricity at around US$0.12 to $0.15 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years, much cheaper than the $0.20 to $0.40 cost typical of diesel-powered generation in remote areas.

The Rp 200 trillion liquidity injection aims to push state-owned banks to lend more to productive sectors. But unless some of this capital is explicitly directed toward clean energy and industrial transformation, it may miss the chance to support green industrial policy in a substantive way. For example, funds could be used to ease the upfront costs of village solar plants, subsidize battery storage procurement, support domestic manufacturing of solar panels and related components, or offer concessional finance to cooperatives that might otherwise lack credit history or collateral.

Green industrial policy typically addresses market failures: private investors are often cautious about sponsoring high upfront cost technologies whose returns are uncertain. Governments can reduce risk through regulation, incentives, public procurement, or direct investment. By doing this, they can spark innovation, build up local supply chains, foster jobs, and reduce reliance on imported technology. Instruments can include tax incentives, standards or requirements for local content, public-private partnerships, grants or loan guarantees, workforce training, and skills development.

In the context of Indonesia’s rural solar plan, green industrial policy would mean ensuring that the cooperatives have not only finance but also technical training and maintenance capacity; scaling up local production or assembly of solar panels, batteries, inverters, wiring, and mounting systems; enabling policies that lower import or regulatory hold-ups; ensuring regulatory stability so that investors feel confident; and making sure that communities share in the benefits, not just through access to electricity but through economic opportunities. Experts have already flagged gaps: cooperatives may lack technical expertise, governance capacity, and access to commercial funding; there is limited domestic manufacturing capacity; regulatory uncertainty remains an issue; and demand-side stimulus is needed so that banks will find lending attractive rather than remain cautious.

Without anchoring the liquidity injection in green industrial policy, there is a risk that funds will flow into traditional sectors or be used in ways that respond to short-term demand rather than structural transformation. The government must signal clearly that some fraction of the Rp 200 trillion is reserved for green infrastructure and energy transition, including rural solar deployment. Finance ministries, energy ministries, and industry ministries must coordinate so that regulations, incentives, and public procurement align to support solar panels, battery storage, clean energy installers, and cooperative energy governance.

It is also critical to guard against policy flip-flops, because inconsistency discourages investment. Indonesia has experienced regulatory uncertainty around rooftop solar and net metering, which reduced investor confidence. Demonstrating long-term commitment through stable rules, transparent tendering, predictable tariffs or purchase agreements, and mechanisms that require or reward local content will help.

The global audience should take notice. If Indonesia can transform a macroeconomic stimulus into a driver of green industrial policy, it will provide a powerful case study for other emerging economies grappling with climate change and development. The story could become one in which a large liquidity injection does not merely boost demand or consumption but actually retools value chains, empowers rural communities, and reduces carbon emissions in a way that is socially inclusive.

What remains to be decided is whether this liquidity moment will be treated merely as economic relief or as an inflection point. If Purbaya’s injection is steered toward solar villages, clean-energy manufacturing, skills training, and stable regulation, the result could be durable change. Indonesia may then be able to say it used its financial levers not simply to revive credit flows but to invest in its future --both clean and equitable, both industrial and green.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — International automakers are playing a major role in powering Indiana’s economy, according to a new report from Autos Drive America.

The Washington-based advocacy group found that Honda, Subaru, and Toyota have invested a combined $11.8 billion in the Hoosier State, creating 17,339 direct jobs. Together, the companies account for nearly 20% of all vehicles produced by international automakers nationwide.

Subaru’s Lafayette facility, its only plant outside Japan, employs more than 6,500 workers and is expected to produce its 8 millionth vehicle in November. Honda’s Greensburg plant supports about 2,700 jobs and has the capacity to produce 250,000 vehicles annually, while Toyota’s Princeton operation employs roughly 7,600 workers and built more than 328,000 vehicles last year.

Conexus Indiana, which studies the state’s advanced manufacturing and logistics industries, said the automotive sector represents about 20% of Indiana’s total manufacturing GDP. The state is home to 628 automotive companies and ranks second only to Michigan in automotive production. Conexus leaders said Indiana’s diverse workforce and strong supplier network make it attractive for both domestic and foreign manufacturers.

However, the organization warned of workforce shortages, projecting up to 85,000 unfilled manufacturing and logistics positions by 2033.

As automakers shift toward electric and alternative-energy vehicles, Conexus is partnering with Purdue University, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Center for Automotive Research to help Indiana suppliers adapt to new propulsion technologies.

The Soviet Union built a power line in Central Asia that was designed to operate at 1,150 kilovolts.
The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis.
Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases.
They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.","The power line starts in a remote desert in northwest China, where vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines generate electricity on a monumental scale. It snakes southeast, following an ancient river between mountain ranges before reaching Anhui Province near Shanghai, home to 61 million people and some of China’s most successful electric car and robot manufacturers.

That’s a single power line. China has 41 others. Each is capable of carrying more electricity than any utility transmission line in the United States. That’s partly because China is using technology that makes its lines far more efficient than almost anywhere else in the world. The feat is owed to China’s ambitious national energy policies and the fact that few residents along the path of these lines dare object — even though the lines emit static electricity that local people said they could feel when holding a metal fishing pole.

“As long as you don’t fish directly underneath the wires and keep the fishing line from getting tangled in the wires, it’s basically fine,” Shu Jie, an air-conditioning repairman, said matter-of-factly, showing off a six-inch fish he had just caught.

China’s aggressive embrace of clean energy technologies, at a faster pace than even its own government expected or planned, has left it with an unquenchable thirst for electricity. Half the country’s new cars are battery-powered, and the 30,000 miles of high-speed rail lines run on electricity. Wind and solar energy provided over a quarter of China’s power in April, a milestone that few other countries can brag about.

But much of that clean energy is produced in the country’s sunny, windy western and northern regions, far from most of its people and factories. More than 90 percent of China’s 1.4 billion people live in the east, where cloudy days, windless nights and sluggish rivers limit the potential for clean energy. So to move the electricity to where it is needed most, China is urgently upgrading its power grid.

Beijing’s expansion of its power grid contrasts sharply with President Trump’s “Drill, baby, drill” approach of doubling down on fossil fuels and rolling back federal programs to spur greater use of clean energy.

In July, the Energy Department terminated its commitment to provide a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for construction of the Grain Belt Express power line to take wind power from Kansas to cities in Illinois and Indiana. That 800-mile ultrahigh-voltage line, which would have covered a shorter distance than dozens of lines already built in China, ran into criticism from rural landowners and Republican lawmakers.

Even before Mr. Trump took office, other renewable energy projects in the United States had to wait as long as 17 years for permits to be approved for transmission lines running a few hundred miles.

Many of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines use direct current technology, which allows them to carry electricity for long distances with barely any of the transmission losses that affect most high-power lines in other countries.

The more advanced power grid is starting to address a central problem facing China’s energy planners. In its western regions, where the weather is favorable for solar, wind and hydroelectric power, China produces more renewable energy than it can use.

Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, set a goal in 2020 of tripling the country’s capacity to generate wind and solar energy by 2030. The country reached that mark last year — six years ahead of schedule.

The country’s government-owned electricity transmission giant, State Grid, was caught unprepared.

“State Grid is good at building things, but not six years ahead,” said David Fishman, an electricity consultant in Shanghai.

In some recent months, a tenth of China’s wind and solar capacity has gone unused partly because the grid was unable to move all the power generated.

“To improve the power system’s ability to absorb new energy, we must accelerate the construction of power grid projects supporting new energy,” Du Zhongming, electricity director of the National Energy Administration in China, said at a news conference last year.

China already consumes twice as much electricity as the United States. By 2050, China plans to triple its count of ultrahigh-voltage routes.

The most recent public Chinese data, from the end of 2024, showed 19 lines transmitting power at 800 kilovolts. Another 22 lines operated at 1,000 kilovolts. One of them, the behemoth terminating in Guquan, transmits enough electricity at 1,100 kilovolts to power more than seven million American households or 40 million to 50 million Chinese households.

The Soviet Union built a power line in Central Asia that was designed to operate at 1,150 kilovolts. But it used less powerful equipment and has not run at full tilt for decades.

The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis. The central government approved enormous investments in their construction to create jobs and head off an economic slowdown. China’s leaders staked ambitious plans for electric vehicles and high-speed rail lines around the same time.

In March 2011, the construction of ultrahigh-voltage lines gained further momentum from the partial meltdown of three nuclear reactors after an earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, Japan. Beijing delayed many prospective nuclear reactors, which had been planned near cities, and doubled down on transmission lines from remote areas.

Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases. A University of Chicago analysis of satellite data, released in August, found that air pollution in China had plunged 41 percent since 2014. That added almost two years to the country’s average life expectancy.

Beijing, once notorious for smog, mostly stopped burning coal for electricity in 2020 and now relies partly on wind power delivered from hundreds of miles away.

For decades, countries have talked about building power lines similar to China’s. They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.

China can build faster because of its top-down industrial planning, government control of information and intolerance for public dissent.

Some villagers in Anhui Province living near China’s longest ultrahigh-voltage line said they had reservations about the line, although they did not try to stop its construction.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/2025-05-27-china-powerlines-map-index/2025-05-27-china-powerlines-map-index-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:02:34.857112

The CIM Northern Luncheon in North Bay is an event hosted by the CIM Northern Gateway Branch, a local chapter of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. These luncheons bring together professionals from the mining industry to discuss new technologies, network, and hear from expert guest speakers.

Al Guenette, Director of New Technology and R&D NOAM at Sandvik was the key presenter as he discussed integrated bolting solutions at the event held on Wednesday at the Davedi Club in North Bay.

""So basically, it's the integration of ground support, so that's bolts that support tunnels with equipment,"" explained Guenette.

""So it's moving forward technology and helping to have a safer environment for the miners. We've been acquired by Sandvik over four years ago now, so a lot of R&D development has been done to bring both divisions together, to have a better, safer system.""

Tariff impact

It's been a turbulent time, with many industries like mining facing the challenges of dealing with U.S. tariff threats.

Guenette says the mining industry is feeling it.

""With the tariffs, I think that's definitely a big impact on business,"" he admitted.

""So you have to be versatile and flexible. So for us, we have manufacturing in Canada, but we also have manufacturing in multiple regions across the globe. So we get to have the opportunity to bring products from different regions, as well as from here in Canada.

""So the purpose of that is security of supply to ensure there isn't an outage for any of the mines. So we've been working quite hard on that for the last five years.""

Ring of Fire opportunities

But there is optimism with future projects like the Ring of Fire.

""I think everybody's interested in any type of new development and what that would look like, so we're definitely interested as far as the Sandvik equipment side, that they would go first with these types of new projects and we come in after that, so definitely exciting,"" he said.

The fact is that the fundamental principle of global warming is considered “settled science.” This means it is unlikely to be disproved as it is supported by abundant evidence and credible peer review.

Shetterly refers to his paintings as “Americans Who Tell The Truth” (AWTT). The individuals are easily recognizable as he is a masterful artist. He also includes interesting biographical information about the individuals portrayed.

Until January 2002, Shetterly had never painted a realistic portrait when he painted the first of the Americans Who Tell The Truth portraits. Now numbering over 280, the portraits travel around the country as models of courageous citizenship. In addition to the loan of his portraits to schools, organizations and other interested groups, Shetterly has published several books which include photos of his portraits, the biographical info and additional essays by well known individuals.

The various volumes focus on Americans, both historic and living, who have struggled for racial, social, economic and other aspects of life in America. To help fund this exhibit, MOVCA received Direct Support Funds, a project of the Mountain Watershed Association. These funds are made possible by Cloud Mountain Foundation, The Plastic Solution Fund, The Heinz Endowments and The 11th Hour Project.

MOVCA’s truth tellers exhibit focuses on Shetterly’s book, Portraits Of Earth Justice and Americans who “…risk everything to live their truth in pursuit of environmental justice for all.” Besides 50 inspiring portraits and biographical information, the book includes essays by Bill McKibben, Robin Wall Kimmerer, Leah Penniman, Bill Bigelow and Diane Wilson.

The 10 portraits chosen for display by MOVCA include a diverse mix of persons; both young and old, female and male. Some are West Virginians.

Information about the exhibit can be viewed online under “Upcoming Events” on AWTT’s website: americanswhotellthetruth.org. The paintings will be hung for exhibition at Wood County’s South Parkersburg Library at 1807 Blizzard Drive. Starting after the library’s regular hours, an opening reception will be held on Oct. 17 from 5-8 p.m. The reception is open to the general public and will include refreshments and a Zoom with the artist from 6-7 p.m.

After the opening, the portraits will be on display for four weeks through Nov. 17. They can be viewed anytime during the South Parkersburg Library’s operating hours which are; Monday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. This would be an interesting field trip appropriate for several grade levels of science or art classes.

AWTT’s website also offers free lesson plans, curriculum and other educational programs to ensure “… that future generations of Americans understand the value and tools of engaged citizenship.”

During the four week time frame, MOVCA is planning a few additional public events that will supplement the exhibit. MOVCA greatly appreciates South Parkersburg Library staff for accommodating the request to use their space for the exhibit, and also for pulling together additional materials that will help enrich it.

These are rough times for the environment and our planet but, now more than ever, these are the most important times to continue to speak truth to power in order to help “Save the Grandchildren.”

Renewable-fuelled plant factories ensure large-scale food supply but require low-carbon transition for environmental gains.","Renewable-fuelled plant factories (RFPFs) represent a revolutionary approach to agriculture, leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance food production while addressing significant environmental concerns. Recent studies emphasize the urgent need for innovative solutions to meet the ever-increasing global demand for food, particularly in densely populated regions. In China, a country facing immense pressure to provide sufficient vegetables for its vast population, RFPFs emerge as a promising solution. These facilities, powered by renewable energy, not only aim to fulfill dietary demands but also seek to do so in an environmentally responsible manner.

Geospatial analysis plays a pivotal role in the deployment of RFPFs across China’s 369 city-level regions. The multidimensional approach facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the geographic and demographic factors that influence vegetable demand. It assesses not just the potential supply of vegetables but also the infrastructural needs required to create a functioning network of plant factories. This analysis provides a vital roadmap for policymakers and stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding the establishment and location of these sustainable food production systems.

The implementation of RFPFs can yield significant advantages, particularly in a cross-city framework. This approach promotes collaboration between different cities, enhancing the overall efficiency of the food supply chain. By leveraging shared resources and optimizing production capabilities, RFPFs can achieve a remarkable reduction in the land required for traditional agriculture, saving an astounding 51,390 square kilometers of cropland. This not only alleviates pressure on arable land but also contributes to preserving biodiversity and reducing habitat destruction.

However, while RFPFs offer numerous benefits in terms of land use and efficient vegetable production, they are not without challenges. A critical concern is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions associated with their establishment. Studies indicate that RFPFs can emit greenhouse gases at rates 1.99 to 2.55 times higher than conventional agriculture, primarily due to the energy-intensive processes involved in manufacturing power modules and constructing facilities. This dilemma highlights the need for a balanced approach that prioritizes both food production efficiency and environmental sustainability.

Mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions associated with RFPFs is essential for their long-term viability. Transitioning to low-carbon pathways emerges as a critical strategy to address this challenge. By adopting renewable energy sources and incorporating energy-efficient technologies, RFPFs can drastically reduce their carbon footprints. Research demonstrates that implementing low-carbon strategies can lead to a reduction of up to 70% in emissions, paving the way for RFPFs to operate within environmentally sustainable parameters. This transition is crucial not just for compliance with environmental standards but for the overall acceptance and success of RFPFs in the broader agricultural landscape.

As the world grapples with the pressing issue of climate change, the urgency of implementing sustainable agricultural practices becomes increasingly evident. RFPFs stand at the forefront of this agricultural revolution, where innovation and sustainability intersect. They provide an opportunity to rethink traditional food production systems through advanced technologies that can be integrated into urban environments, ultimately reshaping how societies think about agriculture and food supply.

Moreover, the overall cost structure of RFPFs is competitive, standing at an affordable 5.88 Chinese Yuan per kilogram. This aspect underscores the economic viability of renewable-fuelled plant factories. Lower costs combined with sustainable practices can incentivize broader adoption among consumers and investors alike. As urban populations continue to grow, the integration of RFPFs into these areas could transform food distribution networks, making them more efficient and resilient against external shocks, such as pandemics or climate-induced disasters.

The urgency of adopting RFPFs is particularly pressing given the backdrop of increasing food insecurity. With global populations expected to rise significantly in the coming decades, ensuring sufficient food supply chains is paramount. RFPFs can serve as a critical buffer against food shortages, especially in urban settings where space is limited and traditional agricultural methods are impractical. They offer a scalable solution that can be tailored to meet local needs while minimizing the ecological footprint of food production.

In addition to their practical benefits, RFPFs also present an opportunity for community engagement and education. By positioning these facilities within urban areas, they can serve as educational hubs, promoting awareness about food production, sustainability, and the importance of reducing individual carbon footprints. Engaging local communities in the operations of RFPFs can foster a culture of sustainability and encourage collective efforts toward environmental stewardship.

Despite the promise that RFPFs hold for the future of food production, their successful implementation will hinge upon collaborative efforts among various stakeholders. Governments, academic institutions, and private enterprises must work together to develop the necessary regulatory frameworks, financial incentives, and technological support to create an ecosystem conducive to the growth of these facilities. Research institutions can play a crucial role in advancing the technology behind RFPFs and providing critical insights into their ecological impacts and operational efficiencies.

In summary, renewable-fuelled plant factories represent a vital innovation in the quest for sustainable food production. They offer numerous benefits, including significant land savings and competitive pricing, but also pose challenges related to greenhouse gas emissions. The path forward involves a commitment to low-carbon transitions and collaborative efforts across multiple sectors. Moving ahead, it is clear that RFPFs could transform agriculture as we know it, enabling societies to produce food more sustainably while also addressing the pressing challenges posed by climate change and urbanization.

Therefore, embracing this approach not only aligns with the objectives of sustainable development but also ensures that future generations can enjoy food security in a rapidly changing world. With the right strategies in place, renewable-fuelled plant factories may well signify the future of efficient, resilient food production systems, paving the way for a new chapter in how we cultivate and consume food globally.

Energy prices are intertwined with inflation, which further clouds our stagflationary picture Trump is painting right now.","One tiny problem, outside the fact that the four biggest wind power producing states all voted for Trump by an average of 19 percent in 2024, is that Trump’s own government data doesn’t back up that assertion. “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data,” reported Politico. Energy prices across the country right now are surging, up 30 percent on average since 2020 and double the rate of inflation over the last year. There is no one singular cause to this trend that precedes Trump 2.0, but his war on renewable energy certainly isn’t helping to create the supply that increasing demand from things like AI data centers are placing on the grid.

Trump’s tariffs are raising energy costs too, as his desire to make things in America requires parts made elsewhere. “Long-term costs for utility-scale energy storage projects would increase anywhere from 12 percent to more than 50 percent, depending on the [tariff] scenario,” said data and analytics company Wood Mackenzie to Utility Dive earlier this year.

This war waged on clean energy is hitting red states, as an analysis by Energy Innovation of the GOP bill found that energy bills in Republican-leaning states could rise by more than $600 every year, and energy prices across the country could see their energy bill rise by as much as 18 percent by 2035. This study found that “Bills in Missouri will spike the most, by $640 a year, with the next largest increases – in Kentucky, South Carolina, Oklahoma, North Carolina and Texas,” as The Guardian noted in their writeup of it earlier this year. All states that voted for Trump in part because their energy bills were too high. He’s only raised them since coming into office.

Politico’s analysis of EIA data found that “U.S. power prices rose an average of 23.4 percent from June 2021 to June of this year,” and just yesterday the Trump administration decided to further immiserate their own voters by abruptly canceling a massive solar project in Nevada, another state that voted for Trump in November. Heatmap reported that the Esmeralda 7 solar project, delivering a massive 6.2 gigawatts of power to the state, was canceled seemingly out of nowhere last night. To put that figure in perspective, the Hoover Dam has a power capacity of 2 gigawatts. They canceled three Hoover Dam’s worth of energy just like that. This will raise energy bills in Nevada.

This is basic economics Trump never learned in the economics 101 class I strongly believe he never showed up to. The economy and the people who live in it demand energy to run our lives, and if there is not enough supply of energy, it will cost more. Energy prices are intertwined with inflation, which further clouds our stagflationary picture Trump is painting right now. He is depressing growth by raising energy prices and adding a surcharge on to every import while threatening to raise tariffs on China again today, all while destroying the labor market with his racist immigration policy which all combine to have the net result of potentially lowering the baseline growth we can expect from a damaged American economy.",https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/suploads/2025/10/Harvest_the_Wind_IA_7-13_13901366435-windmill.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:02:39.525987

Tom Solomon is the head facilitator of the New Mexico Geothermal Working Group, a slew of volunteers who explore geothermal and ways that it can be brought to the state.
It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power.
Regardless of the type of geothermal energy, the fast pace of the industry is creating some red-hot buzz in the Land of Enchantment.
“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).","A recent report estimates that New Mexico has the potential to produce substantial power from its geothermal resources.

But what will it take to tap into this substantial energy source underneath our feet that could reduce emissions and curb climate change?

Geothermal energy comes from deep within the Earth’s crust, where heat is produced by both the decay of radioactive minerals and molten rock.

This heat is key for generating electricity – usually from tapping into a hot water aquifer – which can directly heat buildings or spin a turbine’s rotor. This process emits no pollutants and, unlike solar or wind, can be available around the clock.

This type of electricity production has actually been around for a long time – getting its start over 100 years ago in areas experiencing significant subsurface geologic activity.

Tom Solomon is the head facilitator of the New Mexico Geothermal Working Group, a slew of volunteers who explore geothermal and ways that it can be brought to the state.

“New Mexico is number six in the nation in terms of its resource potential for geothermal,” Solomon said.

He’s referencing a report by Project InnerSpace, the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, which singled out Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Taos counties as the best candidates for geothermal exploration.

It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power. Just one gigawatt can power roughly 750,000 homes on average.

That power could then be sold to other states or attract private investment opportunities, such as data centers.

Solomon says New Mexico is just starting to explore this massive source of energy.

Right now, there’s only one utility-scale geothermal power plant, located in Lordsburg, and state officials in June announced a deal between Meta and XGS Energy to significantly boost the state’s geothermal output.

“The really exciting possibility is what's called ‘advanced geothermal,’ or ‘hot dry rock geothermal,’ which New Mexico has in abundance, primarily because of the Rio Grande rift,” Solomon said.

Bisecting the state, the Rio Grande rift is a place where the earth’s crust and mantle have been stretched, thinned, and fractured by tectonic forces – pushing heat closer to the surface.

“Meaning you don't have to drill as deep to access that really hot rock, which is the source of potential geothermal,” Solomon said.

Similar to oil and gas fracking, this method works by drilling wells into the Earth’s surface and using high-pressure water to fracture hot basement rock, creating a piping-hot reservoir.

Then, engineers can inject cold water into a well, which circulates and heats up through the hot, fractured rock, and then is brought up to the surface for use.

Wells must also be drilled very deep into the earth’s surface – sometimes 15,000 feet down. For context, the highest natural point in New Mexico is Wheeler Peak, at just over 13,000 feet.

Despite the promise of geothermal energy production, it’s been a difficult pitch to policymakers and utilities because it’s both expensive up front and the technology is rapidly evolving.

In fact, advancements in hot, dry rock geothermal are so new, experts are closely following the construction of a first-of-its-kind utility-scale project by Fervo Energy in Utah.

There, engineers are hoping to put out 100 megawatts of electricity next year, adding 400 more by the end of 2028.

The excitement surrounding advanced geothermal system research lies in the potential to drill both vertically and horizontally, allowing wells to have more contact with a geothermal source.

By doing so, power plants can be placed pretty much everywhere, and can access more heat from the same depth. Another plus: it can utilize readily available expertise from the oil and gas industry – who use a similar technique to tap fossil fuel reservoirs.

Regardless of the type of geothermal energy, the fast pace of the industry is creating some red-hot buzz in the Land of Enchantment.

“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).

Stair estimates that around 40% of the state’s electricity is sourced from renewables, putting it well ahead of its self-imposed clean energy goals. To her, geothermal could fill in the remaining 60%.

“There is a possibility that we could switch our entire electric grid over to clean power fueled by solar, wind and geothermal, and the math is penciling for that,” Stair said. “And, at the same time, still be pumping oil and gas out of the Permian [Basin] for use elsewhere in other states.”

New Mexico heavily relies on the revenue generated from the oil and gas industry to prop up its economy, and is slowly diversifying its portfolio by shoring up permanent funds and investing in other industries.

In 2024, Stair and her team were tasked by the legislature to develop rules and regulations for geothermal permitting and a separate grant and loan program to help fund projects.

Her department is still drafting those rules, but Stair said these initiatives are a huge investment, because geothermal will only be possible with private-public partnerships to construct those expensive geothermal power plants.

“I think the ball is in our court right now, and we're hopefully carrying it hard and fast,” Stair added.

Still, she hopes the state will fund mapping options to pinpoint the ideal places for geothermal, who owns that land, and nearest transmission lines to evaluate infrastructure needs.

At the Roundhouse, lawmakers continue to be enthusiastic about geothermal and say they’re open to funding more research.

“It’s a pretty win-win deal,” said State Sen. Pat Woods (R-Grady). “We've got the oil and gas industry that is very efficient at digging these deep wells.”

A longtime supporter of the oil and gas industry, Woods thinks that together, fossil fuels and geothermal could bring new rural jobs, but he’s not totally convinced it’s a silver bullet.

“I think it's a hell of an idea, but it's a ways out,” Woods said.

Woods is clear: he doesn’t want to replace oil and gas anytime soon. For now it keeps crucial dollars flowing to his constituents in the far northeastern stretch of the state.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/881715d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5152x2705+0+580/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F24%2F13%2F79988cd041a3951a0240d6da4b88%2F29206586324-7341aeaffb-o.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:24.446412

It says something when you make a commitment to do something, but the commitment Kohler has made goes beyond that.
“Brownwood has continually improved itself, developing quality products, cultivating a safe and engage workforce, and serving as a cornerstone for Kohler manufacturing globally.”","Kohler marked the 50th anniversary of its Brownwood plant with a ceremony Friday afternoon, during which the company announced a new venture locally – an 80-acre solar energy project.

Brian Benson, Senior Director of Global Vitreous Operations based out of the Brownwood plant, told those in attendance, “This year, in a partnership with the Brownwood Industrial Foundation, Kohler Company has signed a letter of intent to acquire 80 acres of land adjacent to the Kohler manufacturing facility, of which 20 acres will be used for a large scale solar energy project. The initiative aims to transform the vacant land into a productive, environmentally sustainable asset, creating jobs and stimulating the local economy. The project will enhance grid efficiency and generate sizable tax revenue that will support the local schools and public services. This investment will be Kohler’s largest solar installation in the United States to date as we continue to focus on building both business and community resilience. Renewable energy will alleviate grid pressure in the Brownwood community and promote resilience for Kohler’s operations.”

The project – which will be located between Milam Drive and FM 45 – will be executed in phases, Benson continued, with the first 20 acres producing 9 million kilowatts of clean energy annually. Future phases will expand the system to cover additional load and battery storage.

Kohler will secure the land through an in-kind donation totaling $50,000 to three local companies – the United Way, the VFW Post 3278, and the Ark Domestic Shelter, which will help fund a new roof for its facility, according to Benson.

The Kohler plant in Brownwood opened its doors in 1975 and has provided three generations of local residents with job opportunities, Brownwood Mayor Stephen Haynes said among his comments.

“The people who work at this plant are the heart and soul of our community,” Haynes said. “There isn’t anyone in Brownwood who doesn’t have a friend, family member or knows a valued member of the community that works here at this plant. These folks are an invaluable part of our community and they do a great job.”

Haynes continued, “We also want to give praise to the corporate executives that have made the decision to be here in Brownwood and made the decision to remain here. That is not lost on me. It says something when you make a commitment to do something, but the commitment Kohler has made goes beyond that. We see and hear and know that they’re investing and re-investing continually into this community and plant, which says they have a future here and plan to remain here, and we’re so thankful for that commitment.”

Haynes read a proclamation to mark Kohler’s anniversary, which including the following details:

The Brownwood division currently produces more than 560,000 pieces a year with plans to grow that number to over 2 million

Kohler’s plastic division produces 280,000 units annually, encompassing over 200 unique products

Kohler’s Brownwood plant plays a key role in the global supply chain, shipping over 100,000 units monthly across the United States into international destinations such as Saudi Arabia, China and England

The Brownwood facility is the exclusive global producer of pressure vessel tanks for Kohler Company

Kohler Brownwood was recently honored as the top-ranked American distribution site for achieving 100 percent on-time delivery

Adriana Stowers, on behalf of the office of Gov. Greg Abbott, said, “For half a century this facility has been more than just a workplace. It has been a cornerstone of the local economy, a partner in community growth, and a place where generations of hard-working Texans have built not only world-class products, but also lasting careers and friendships. Kohler’s commitment to innovation and sustainability, as well as to the people of Brownwood and the surrounding region, speaks to the very best of Texas values, hard work, resilience, and pride in craftsmanship.”

Heath Holtz, Chief Operations & Supply Chain Officer for Kohler, shared some of the history of the Brownwood plant, including:

In 1975, Kohler launched a pilot program for vitreous china production beginning with just 14 local associates and a handful of transfers from other sites

By 1979, Kohler expanded by 200,000 square feet to support fiberglass, reinforced plastic bathing modules

In 1982, another 604,000 square feet were added to meet growing demand

This past year, Kohler invested millions in automation, advanced equipment and cutting-edge manufacturing, ensuring that Brownwood remains at the forefront of the industry and a key producer in leading-edge bathing products for the next 50 years

Holtz also recognized 407 Brownwood members in Kohler’s quarter-century club, with two employees – Fernando Barrera and Richard Salinas – having worked at the plant for 47 years apiece.

“Above all the products that we ship and what we’ve invested in the plant, today is about the people – the associates who have built their careers here, many with decades of service and dedication,” Holtz said. “Brownwood has continually improved itself, developing quality products, cultivating a safe and engage workforce, and serving as a cornerstone for Kohler manufacturing globally.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/1378/2025/10/10153948/img_3449-1024x577.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:30.371292

“This modification will avoid potential short-term disruptions to the LNG sector while promoting investments in U.S. shipbuilding capacity and production of LNG vessels,” the Office of the US Trade Representative said in a notice on Friday.

The provision, which is effective immediately, would have allowed the US to suspend LNG export licenses for companies that failed to meet requirements for shipping fuel on US-built LNG tankers starting in the second half of the decade. American LNG companies warned that existing shipbuilding capacity in the US is not equipped to churn out specialized LNG tankers, which are mainly built in South Korea and Japan.

The policy aimed at Beijing’s dominance of the maritime sector was finalized in April. It includes fees on ships calling at US ports that are either made in China or that are Chinese-operated, set to take effect on Oct. 14. The plan looks to revive the US shipbuilding industry as a way to combat China’s strength in the shipping and shipbuilding sectors.

The USTR also said Friday it would impose tariffs of 100% on ship-to-shore cranes and intermodal chassis and parts, a move that targets Chinese-made port equipment. Those duties will be effective as of Nov. 9.

Included in the notice on Friday is a proposal to levy additional tariffs of up to 150% on certain Chinese-origin cargo handling equipment, like the gantry cranes, straddle carriers and container-stacking tractors widely used at American seaport terminals. The USTR said it would accept comments on that and other related proposals until Nov. 10.

Earlier: Trump Announces Additional 100% China Tariff, Tech Controls

The notice came as Trump on Friday announced that he would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese exports as well as controls on “any and all critical software” beginning Nov. 1, and threatened to cancel an upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, dramatically raising the stakes for talks between the world’s two largest economies on trade.

MEG shareholders are to vote on the amended Cenovus offer on Oct. 22.","Strathcona Resources Ltd. has ended its hostile takeover pursuit of MEG Energy Corp., clearing the way for a rival friendly bid from Cenovus Energy Inc.

The move comes two days after Cenovus sweetened its offer for MEG, its neighbour in Alberta's oilsands. Strathcona also has operations in the region.

""As a result of the revised arrangement agreement between the MEG board of directors and Cenovus Energy Inc., Strathcona believes the conditions to its offer, or any reasonably improved offer, are no longer capable of being satisfied,"" Strathcona said in a release Friday.

Strathcona owns 14.2 per cent of MEG and had been offering 0.80 of one of its shares for each MEG share it did not already own.

The latest Cenovus offer announced Wednesday values MEG at $8.6 billion, including assumed debt and is made up of half equity and half stock. Its earlier offer had been three-quarters cash, and some MEG shareholders had pushed to get a bigger slice of the post-takeover company.

""While Strathcona is disappointed with this outcome, it is pleased that its actions, along with those of its fellow MEG shareholders, delivered something which the MEG board could not, namely a more equitable transaction with Cenovus which allows MEG shareholders to participate more meaningfully in future upside,"" Strathcona said.

""Strathcona would like to thank its shareholders for their support throughout the MEG process, as well as the many MEG shareholders it received support from and tendered their shares.""

Cenovus and MEG amend terms

Earlier this week, MEG and Cenovus announced they had amended the terms of their existing standstill agreement, allowing Cenovus to buy about 10 per cent of MEG's shares.

Strathcona called that move ""without precedent in the Canadian public markets and the latest in a series of anticompetitive actions taken by the MEG board.""

""Strathcona has concluded that the MEG Board's ability to continuously extend the Cenovus meeting date, and continuously allow Cenovus to purchase and vote additional shares, makes an improved offer for MEG impractical and not in the best interests of Strathcona shareholders.""

Strathcona plans to pay a special distribution of $10 per share to all of its shareholders, as it had promised if its MEG takeover didn't pan out. It requires two-thirds shareholder approval at a meeting scheduled for Nov. 27.

The company said that following the sale of MEG, it will be the only pure-play oil company in North America producing more than 50,000 barrels per day without a mine or refineries. It, MEG and Cenovus all extract oilsands bitumen using steam-assisted gravity drainage.

The new plant, situated at the anaerobic digestion site of Srinivas Waste Management Services (SWMS) in Chetpet, Chennai, transforms organic municipal waste into high-purity renewable gas.

The project’s completion aligns with the current UK-India trade mission, highlighting three decades of Clarke Energy’s presence in the region. With nearly 2 GW of installed low-carbon and renewable power systems across India and Bangladesh, the company continues to be a key player in UK-India commercial and energy collaboration.

At the SWMS facility, biodegradable food waste from surrounding communities is processed into biogas and nutrient-rich compost, contributing to both local sustainability and national environmental goals.

This installation supports India’s SATAT program, which aims to establish 5,000 compressed biogas (CBG) plants across the country. Clarke Energy’s system uses membrane separation to upgrade 600 Nm³/hr of raw biogas into clean biomethane—demonstrating a scalable, efficient, and locally sourced solution for meeting the nation’s renewable fuel ambitions.

Replacing older pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology, the new membrane system includes a biogas dryer, scrubber, compressor, dual-stage membrane unit, and all necessary controls and piping. Most of the equipment was sourced from Indian manufacturers, helping ensure faster deployment and reducing environmental impact.

Early operational results show strong performance, with methane purity levels surpassing 97.4% even under partial load, while also minimizing methane loss during processing.

“This is the first biogas upgrading solution we’ve fully designed, built, and commissioned in India,” said Kyle Quinn, President of Clarke Energy. “It’s a major achievement that shows how we’re blending global know-how with local delivery to support India’s energy transition with reliable, high-efficiency systems.”

Unlike traditional PSA systems, the membrane-based design achieves greater methane recovery, lower maintenance demands, and modular scalability—well-suited for cities converting waste to fuel.

The project also reflects Rehlko’s strategy of building regionally focused, sustainable infrastructure. Through Clarke Energy and other portfolio companies, Rehlko continues to back clean technology and circular economy innovations that are tailored to local needs.

Clarke Energy, a Rehlko company, specializes in the design, engineering, installation, and long-term maintenance of distributed energy systems.

The reality? GM isn’t scaling back its hydrogen efforts. It’s thinking bigger.

The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.

MARK TWAIN (sort of)

Like the great Sam Clemens, there seems to be plenty of confidence in the greater automotive press that GM’s decision to cancel a $55 millions fuel cell plant on the former Michigan State Fairgrounds site in Detroit. That plant, a JV with Southeast Michigan’s Piston Automotive, would have created ~140 jobs and built compact hydrogen fuel cells for light- and medium-duty vehicles under the Hydrotec brand.

That plan, frankly, was never going to work. It was always a cynical incentive grab and the first fruits of GM’s Hydrotec efforts were so laughably far behind the state of the electric art that the facts themselves blurred the line between satire and reality. Which, of course, didn’t matter – as long as the incentive money (Biden’s Department of Energy awarded GM $30 million in grants for the State Fairgrounds plant) kept flowing.

The new Trump Administration put an end to that flow last week, however, terminating 321 financial awards for clean energy worth $7.56 billion.

“Certainly the decisions of the DOE are an element of that overall climate but not the only driver,” explained GM spokesperson, Stuart Fowle, in a statement. “We want to prioritize the engineering talent and resources and everything we have to continuing to advance EVs given hydrogen is in a different spot.”

That spot is heavy-duty, off-highway, maritime, and data centers.

Bigger trucks, bigger fuel cells

Instead of dying, GM is continuing on the hydrogen fuel cell it’s been on for literal decades – with no plans (publicly, at least) to shutter its Fuel Cell System Manufacturing joint-venture with Honda in Brownstown Township, MI.

That company is not just developing HFCs, they’re out there selling fuel cells today, to extreme-duty, disaster response, and off-highway equipment customers operating far enough off the grid that access to electricity is questionable and to data center developers for whom access to a continuous flow of energy is mission-critical.

Electrek’s Take

Fuel cells like the ones from GM and Honda will continue to seem like a good idea … for about as long as it takes the heavy equipment guys to watch a ZQUIP video.

Spruce is the owner and operator of distributed solar energy assets across the country, according to a news release.
For customers, the result is a way to participate in so-called ""solar plus"" storage without the upfront costs needed to buy the cleaner technology.

As part of the deal, Colorado's Spruce Power is working with Carolina's EnerWealth Solutions, a solar development business, to offer panel and battery storage leasing in the state. Spruce is the owner and operator of distributed solar energy assets across the country, according to a news release.

For customers, the result is a way to participate in so-called ""solar plus"" storage without the upfront costs needed to buy the cleaner technology. There's also typically no maintenance or end-of-lease panel removal concerns with the contracts, according to Palmetto, another North Carolina company that offers leases.

""We believe solar energy should be accessible and affordable to all and are committed to bringing clean energy opportunities to homeowners through our offering of the first solar plus storage lease in North Carolina. We appreciate that Spruce Power customized a servicing solution to meet our needs,"" EnerWealth CEO Ajulo Othow said in the statement.

Batteries provide stored electricity for later use, and even to charge electric vehicles. Customers can even sell it back to the grid, depending on plans and programs available in the area, and the lease agreement.

Leasing is also a great way to limit the electricity needed from dirty fuels that cause planet-warming air pollution. NASA has linked the gases to greater risks for extreme heat that could soon leave some places uninhabitable.

It's all good news for energy-savvy Tar Heel homeowners, as well as for the industry as a whole. Federal solar tax incentives expire at the end of the year, but Investing.com reported that Spruce was enjoying solid stock market performance earlier this month when the partnership with EnerWealth was announced.

It's also important for customers to understand the benefits of both leasing and buying. EnergySage said that an array can cost around $30,000 on average, before credits. EnergySage is a free online resource that can help customers compare quotes, find the right installer, and secure all the rebates before they are gone. Fast action can save up to $10,000 when buying a system.

Palmetto — in the business for more than 16 years — has a great guide that lists pros and cons for leasing and buying. It offers leases through LightReach and has more than 500,000 accounts. It's important to know your options to make the best decision. If you plan on selling your home soon, leasing likely isn't the best option, for example.

Cyrill Gutsch, Rebecca Hu-Thrams, and Lisa Dyson are The Solutionaries, making bold moves to tackle the world’s most urgent challenges and expanding their impact through project management.

United by a shared mission to drive cultural and social impact through storytelling, each innovator’s work is featured in an episode, the first of which premiered on Wednesday, October 8th, on time.com. Further episodes go live on Tuesday, October 28th, and Monday, November 10th.

“The Solutionaries demonstrate that the answers to our greatest challenges often come from individuals with the courage to build the world they imagine,” said Menaka Gopinath, Chief Marketing Officer at PMI. “To deliver real-world impact and address the urgent climate crisis, these innovations need to be unleashed – the world can’t afford to keep them in experimental labs. That’s where the power of project management to scale innovation makes all the difference, and The Solutionaries are doing just that.”

Episode one introduces viewers to Cyrill Gutsch, a German-born designer and founder of Parley for the Oceans, a global environmental organization that brings together creators, thinkers, and leaders to raise awareness about the fragility of our oceans and collaborate to end their destruction. Through Parley Future Material they are introducing natural materials.

The second episode spotlights Rebecca Hu-Thrams, co-founder of Glacier, a next-generation robotics company reinventing recycling to reduce landfilling and unlock a circular economy at scale. Today, Glacier’s robots process recycling streams for 1 in 10 Americans, a sign of how quickly material recovery facilities in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Phoenix, and San Francisco are adopting the technology.

Episode three features Dr. Lisa Dyson, a physicist turned entrepreneur whose work was inspired by witnessing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina.

Innovation, Dr Al Dahak noted, is a necessity in a desert nation.","The UAE's Minister of Climate Change and Environment has hailed the country's hosting of a major global conservation conference this week as a “significant milestone” in its quest to help safeguard the planet.

Dr Amna Al Dahak said the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress – being held in Abu Dhabi until October 15 – served as an opportunity for the Emirates to demonstrate its rich biodiversity and environmental history and show that environmental strategies and economic development can go hand-in-hand.

The event has brought together about 10,000 delegates from more than 140 countries, including government officials, scientists, campaigners and indigenous leaders to set the global conservation agenda.

The congress was established in 1948 and has been held in all parts of the world, from Barcelona and Buenos Aires to Nairobi and New Delhi.

This year marks the first time it has been hosted in the Gulf. It was staged in the Middle East, in Jordan, in 2000.

Historic moment

For Dr Al Dahak, the event reflects the UAE’s ambition to position itself as a “global convening power” on environmental issues.

“It’s not just about hosting,” she told The National. “It’s about translating collective ambition into action on the ground. The UAE is always about action.”

“From our founding father Sheikh Zayed, we’ve had a philosophy where man and environment are integrated – where prosperity and preservation are inseparable,” said Dr Al Dahak.

The congress, follows a string of high-profile environmental milestones for the UAE, including hosting Cop28 in Dubai in 2023.

The IUCN gathering offers a chance to highlight the country’s natural heritage, often overlooked in global conversations about the Middle East.

Hidden riches in an arid land

“The international community doesn’t realise how rich the UAE is in biodiversity,” Dr Al Dahak said. “Yes, it’s an arid environment, but within our seas, mountains, and mangroves, there is extraordinary life.”

A recent project, conducted with IUCN support, identified nine Key Biodiversity Areas across the Emirates, from coral reefs and desert ecosystems to mountain habitats. About 98 per cent of those areas are already protected under national legislation.

Among them is the Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve in Abu Dhabi, home to the world’s largest population of dugongs after Australia. The UAE is home to 80 per cent of Gulf's seagrass meadows. “That’s what sustains our dugong population,” said Dr Al Dahak.

Such statistics challenge common perceptions of the Emirates as a land of sand dunes and skyscrapers. They also underscore what Dr Al Dahak sees as the UAE’s dual commitment, economic growth that is “pro-climate” rather than extractive.

Growth without sacrifice

The minister rejects the idea that conservation and development are incompatible. “From the beginning, the UAE set the priority that the economy must grow with the environment, not at its expense,” she said. “You don’t have to make a trade-off.”

Policies like the Circular Economy Strategy reflect that approach, aiming to align economic diversification with sustainability.

The country’s renewable energy portfolio, including the vast Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, have become a regional model. “We are blessed with a rapidly growing economy,” Dr Al Dahak said, “but that growth is also creating more opportunities for conservation”.

Restoring and innovating for the future

At the UAE pavilion, the story of the nation’s conservation journey is told through three themes – conservation, restoration, and innovation.

Restoration has long been central to the UAE’s environmental policy. The country leads global efforts to reintroduce endangered species, such as the Arabian oryx, once extinct in the wild, and collaborates with nations as far afield as Chad to restore other at-risk animals.

Meanwhile, the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund has supported projects in more than 170 countries, funding conservationists working to protect threatened flora and fauna.

Innovation, Dr Al Dahak noted, is a necessity in a desert nation. “We’ve faced challenges of heat, salinity, and water scarcity,” she said.

“We couldn’t achieve what we have without innovation.” From satellite monitoring of coral reefs to drone-assisted mangrove planting, the UAE is investing in technologies to accelerate conservation impact.

Educating the next generation

Perhaps Dr Al Dahak’s most passionate focus is education. A former educator herself, she says that every environmentalist must also be an educator. “If we want to sustain the outcomes of IUCN or any international platform, we must equip the next generation to carry that torch,” she said. “Conservation isn’t a one time effort, it’s a continuous learning process.”

Initiatives such as Plant the Emirates, a nationwide campaign combining community action with reforestation and eco-tourism programmes that introduce residents to lesser known natural sites have helped raise public awareness.

A shared responsibility

As the congress continues, Dr Al Dahak hopes delegates leave Abu Dhabi with a deeper understanding of both the UAE’s biodiversity and its belief that environmental stewardship is a shared duty. “It’s not the responsibility of governments alone,” she said. “It’s everyone’s, every individual, every parent. This is how we ensure the planet’s story continues.”",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/O5TYA6MMSRD7NO4BHVZEZQJYRU.jpg?smart=true&auth=7630895a5da1606df9422d04e27b6307491eb32b3c241dc008002ca8b2bfdf52&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-11 15:01:07.749856

Critical minerals investment company TechMet Ltd. is setting up a new trading unit to focus on specialty metals after getting additional financing from partner Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.

The unit, TechMet SCM, aims to build a trading platform to serve the rapidly growing demand for critical minerals, according to a statement on Wednesday. It will manage production from the parent company’s critical minerals assets and third-party producers. TechMet’s shareholders include the US International Development Finance Corp.

The move comes as Western nations are racing to challenge China’s dominance in critical minerals. As part of a broader effort to boost US production of the materials, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March invoking emergency presidential powers to fast-track the development of new metals and mining projects.

“There’s so much interest in specialty metals which are needed for economic growth, whether that’s batteries, defense or data centers and AI,” Quentin Lamarche, chief executive officer of TechMet SCM, said in an interview. “We need to have those metals sourced in a legitimate and transparent manner and that’s why we’re aiming to create a structure that can walk the talk on this.”

TechMet and Mercuria have co-invested in several projects and ran a joint venture trading business for several years. In the past year, Mercuria has made a big push into metals — trading copper, aluminum and zinc. While the two firms will continue to look at investments together, it made sense for TechMet to operate a specialty metals and minerals business itself, Lamarche said.

The trading arm plans to expand its global footprint with teams in South Korea, Western Europe and Washington DC, according to the statement. The company is hiring a trader in Washington, Lamarche said.

“We’re operating in a business where geopolitics is heavily intertwined with business and that makes us fairly unique,” Lamarche said. “We’re very close to the policymakers having this office in DC — we believe it’s a strategic differentiator.”

While the amount of the additional investment from Mercuria wasn’t disclosed, the statement said it would bring the energy trading house’s total investment in the firm this year to $68 million, solidifying its position as one of TechMet’s biggest investors.

Three years ago I wrote about a member of the Jean Charles Choctaw Nation named Theresa “Betty” Billiot. She reminisced about how the area around her Louisiana home was once filled with cattle grazing in pastures, cotton fields, and wild prairie dotted with duck ponds. That strong memory is fleeting, as today a rising sea is all that comes into view out that same door. Flood relocation became necessary.

Isle de Jean Charles was the first US location where the federal government funded a climate-driven relocation project. Future homes were envisioned as energy efficient; able to withstand 150 mile-per-hour winds; well-insulated in the walls, ceiling, and under floors; supplied with certified energy-efficient appliances; and, compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Yet former island residents like Billiot aren’t happy. They describe their new homes as substandard. Rain seeps through doorways. Malfunctioning appliances and flooded yards force costly repairs.

These 37 flood refugees are not alone. Did you know that there are an estimated 2.5 million US residents who could be forced to relocate away from the coast over the next 25 years? A whole lotta planning needs to take place between now and then. Breaking up tightly-knit communities, land-use decisions about geographic flood relocation sites, property pricing equations, and ensuring the constitutionality of property rights all will need to be addressed.

And where in these discussions of climate victims is the fossil fuel industry, which has caused the catastrophe?

Hold the Fossil Fuel Industry Accountable for Sea Level Rise

Sea level rise is the most profound long-term impact of the climate crisis.

Rising sea levels driven by the climate crisis are overwhelming many of the world’s coastlines and waterways. Fossil fuel burning, which causes global heating, is to blame. Recent scientific studies show 1 meter (3.28′) of sea level rise is now inevitable within a century or so — and it could come as early as 2070 if ice sheets collapse and emissions are not curbed. An even more catastrophic rise of 3 meters is probably inevitable in the next millennium or two, scientists say, and could arrive as soon as the early 2100s.

With each additional degree of warming, we will witness more deadly, irreparable, and ruinous impacts from climate change. Democratic lawmakers in a dozen states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. A new study published in Nature offers a framework to potentially strengthen such legal arguments by enabling plaintiffs to calculate contributions made by individual companies to rising temperatures, tying their emissions directly to extreme heat disasters.

Yet the White House is looking the other way. FEMA is under attack by the self-serving Trump administration. As NWF notes, it is often state agencies and programs that are primarily responsible for identifying impacted communities, initiating conversations with those communities, and, ultimately, collaborating with those communities to advance relocation efforts.

The Case Study of the Isle de Jean Charles

Coastal wetlands in southern Louisiana provide essential ecosystem services including reducing inland flooding, controlling erosion, and serving as natural habitat. A particular case can be made that Louisiana’s malpractices in the petrochemical sector, high cancer concentrations in these “Cancer Corridors,” and wetland demise are interconnected.

Economic prioritization (read: fossil fuel industry profitability) has led to wetland demise and destruction of livelihoods.

The Isle de Jean Charles is a narrow ridge situated in the southeastern Louisiana wetlands. Longtime inhabitants are indigenous peoples — the homeland for the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians since the 1830s. Reliant on the natural surroundings for sustenance — think crabbing, shrimping, fishing, hunting, and agriculture — the inhabitants of the Isle hold a strong sense of place as identity markers.

The island used to encompass more than 22,000 acres. Now it has just 320 acres due primarily to sea level rise caused by the fossil fuel-industry and their secondary effects of erosion, land loss caused by severe storms, and human-made canals.

In 2016, Louisiana received $48.3 million in federal Community Development Block Grant money to relocate 37 residents or families of Isle de Jean Charles as climate-charged hurricanes and sea-level rise made the once thriving community uninhabitable. The plan was the first relocation of an entire community that was fully funded by the federal government. The move carried with it unsettling reminders of the forced displacement of this community’s ancestors during the Indian Removal Act of 1830.

Louisiana is the state projected to have the most land impacted by coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe storms in the US. The state also has a greater likelihood to experience severe coastal flooding — approximately 9,200 square miles — over the next 25 years, as revealed by the nonprofit Climate Central.

Although Louisiana officials have no specific relocation plans for coastal residents, they have developed strategies, titled, Louisiana’s Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE), for moving away from the shifting shoreline.

Unless there is a “clear and present risk to life,” all relocation initiatives must be community-driven and voluntary.

If possible, resettled communities should retain access to abandoned lands for cultural, social or economic reasons.

All relocation efforts must lead to a demonstrable reduction in risk.

All resettlements should entail total residential abandonment of the original community.

Flaccid Flood Relocation Blueprints

Changing precipitation patterns, droughts, land degradation, flood events, and sea-level rise already affect many coastal socio-ecological systems. US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) says the rising seas present coastal homeowners with “a continually degrading situation.”

New settlements, at first glance, seem to offer more stable habitats, enhanced protection from food insecurity, expanded access to public resources, and improved healthcare. Yet the framing of resettlements as strictly an adaptive measure fails to take into account place-based attachments, such as deep connections to the land and historical memories. Moreover, the process all-too-often characterizes climate refugees as resilient and willing participants — when their buy-in to the flood relocation may not have been sought nor personally desired.

“It made us angry,” Chief Deme Naquin, the leader of Jean Charles Choctaw Nation, told Floodlight News. “We thought we were going to have a community, and we were going to be able to own and run it as a tribe. Once that (money) was awarded, then we were pretty much pushed away.”

Climate-induced, community-scale resettlements during the 21st century had been largely determined to be unsuccessful by those who moved. Scholars interpret flood relocation to be a result of unequal power dynamics; planning gaps need to address careful and inclusive engagement of those who would be moved.

The US Government Accountability Office has confirmed that the US has no national strategy for relocating coastal communities from harm’s way. Federal programs generally are not designed to address the scale and complexity of community relocation and generally fund acquisition of properties at high risk of damage from disasters in response to a specific event such as a hurricane, according to a 2020 report to Congressional requesters.

Isle de Jean Charles today is largely abandoned. Because the owners demanded continued access to their property after resettlement, however, an occasional former full-time resident visits their Isle de Jean Charles property for a night or two. Maintaining such land access allows continuity of place. It also prevents marginalization, colonization, and exploitation from powerful developers, Tharakan and Neef outline in the (2024) De Gruyter Handbook of Climate Migration and Climate Mobility Justice.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/flood-relocation.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 09:59:20.589893

Governor Maura Healey and Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll teamed up with UMass Lowell to blueprint the state’s takeover of advanced nuclear and fusion power, promising a jolt of clean energy for grids and industries alike, jobs, and economic rocket fuel.

These “Advanced Nuclear and Fusion Energy Roadmaps” aren’t dusty reports; they’re a four-month sprint to map out small modular reactors (think a truck-sized nuclear power plant) and sun-mimicking fusion beasts—not just for electricity, but non-power perks like industrial heat and medical isotopes too.

Massachusetts’ fresh push for nuclear power hits at a pivotal moment: The offshore wind sector—long a darling of state Democrats—now grapples with mounting delays, including a postponed Round 5 solicitation pushed back to at least 2026 amid federal permitting chaos.

The Trump administration has piled on the pressure, starting with a January moratorium on all new offshore wind leases, followed by rule overhauls favoring fossil fuels, revoked project approvals, and the cancellation of $679 million in manufacturing and port funding.

By early 2026, the roadmaps will deliver a comprehensive framework addressing regulatory barriers, research gaps, deployment strategies, workforce development, community engagement, and coordination with other New England states via the National Governors Association.

Why now? Skyrocketing power needs from EVs, AI, and heat pumps are slamming the grid, while the state’s two nuclear sites already pump 20-25% of New England’s energy. Enter the upgrades: As Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper put it, “Nuclear power looks a lot different in 2025 – it uses a smaller footprint, produces less waste, and can be factory-assembled.”

A wave of uncertainty is sweeping through America’s Battery Belt. Major electric vehicle factory projects are facing delays and potential downsizing. This shift follows changing federal policies and slower-than-expected consumer adoption of EVs.

Communities that bet their economic futures on these massive investments are now grappling with the consequences. The situation highlights the complex interplay between government policy, market forces, and regional economic development.

Planned Capacity Vastly Outpaces Projected EV Demand

A Reuters review of industry plans reveals a significant looming overcapacity. By 2030, planned battery plants could support production for 13 to 15 million electric vehicles annually. This figure comes from research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

However, market analysts at S&P Global Mobility predict a much different reality. They forecast U.S. production of only around 3 million EVs that year. This creates a potential gulf of roughly 10 million vehicles worth of unused battery factory capacity.

Policy Changes and Market Realities Hit Heartland Communities

The recent expiration of a key $7,500 federal EV tax credit has intensified these challenges. Automakers like Ford have publicly predicted a significant drop in electric car sales. This has led to repeated delays at sites like its Stanton, Tennessee complex.

The fallout is deeply felt in small towns. Local leaders who championed these projects now face resident concerns about whether promised jobs will ever materialize. Some hope companies will repurpose the massive sites if EV demand does not rebound.

The future of the Battery Belt now hinges on market adaptation. Automakers may pivot to hybrid production or other technologies. The region’s economic trajectory remains a critical story to follow.

What is the Battery Belt?

The Battery Belt refers to a swath of new EV and battery factories across the U.S. heartland. It stretches from Georgia to Indiana and includes over two dozen major projects.

Why are these battery plants being delayed?

Delays are primarily due to slower-than-expected consumer demand for electric vehicles. Recent changes in federal incentive policies have also contributed to the slowdown.

Which major automakers have delayed projects?

Ford has repeatedly delayed its EV truck plant in Stanton, Tennessee. Hyundai’s massive Georgia project also faced a recent setback due to a federal raid, causing additional delays.

How are local communities affected by these delays?

Small towns that anticipated thousands of new jobs and economic revitalization are now facing uncertainty. Local development and construction tied to these projects have also slowed.

Could these plants be used for other purposes?

Industry experts suggest some facilities could be repurposed for hybrid vehicle production or energy storage systems if the pure EV market does not recover as projected.

House Bill 1260, sponsored by Rep. Joshua Seigel, D-Allentown, was debated in the House Energy Committee on Monday. The bill would require new warehouses to be built solar-ready and create tax incentives for retrofitting existing ones. A similar proposal is being drafted in the Senate.

Advocates argued that commercial rooftop solar offers a rapidly deployed, cost-effective way to expand energy generation while creating revenue streams for developers.

While not completely opposed to the idea, some committee members voiced concerns about mandates amounting to government overreach and suggested incentives would be a better approach.

Pennsylvania ranks eighth in the nation for the number of warehouses, and development continues to grow thanks to its proximity to major East Coast cities and robust transportation networks.

Seigel, in his cosponsorship memo, noted that 44 million square feet of industrial and warehouse space has been approved in Lehigh and Northampton counties alone in the past nine years.

Rob Bair, president of the PA Building and Construction Trades Council, testified that nearly half of all warehouse space in the state, 45.4%, lies along the Route 81 and 78 corridors.

“When you add York and Lancaster counties, that number goes to 54.4%,” he said. “We’re building warehouses along those corridors and employing a lot of people in those jobs. But we have a lot of roof space just sitting there doing nothing – we can put it to use.”

Bair said rooftop solar is low-impact, quick to deploy, and offers an added revenue stream by allowing developers to lease roof space for panels.

“And so, we’re killing a lot of birds with one stone here,” he said.

He also acknowledged concerns about large solar projects taking up farmland and forested areas, but noted that property owners have the right to lease their land as they see fit.

Rep. Jamie Barton, R-Tamaqua, questioned the difference between farmers’ rights to use their land freely while requiring warehouse developers to build solar-ready structures – a concern echoed by Reps. Martin Causer, R-Coudersport and Mike Armanini, R-DuBois, who also raised concerns about the potential cost burden on business owners.

Committee Chair Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, D-Philadelphia, stated that a commercial construction firm with decades-long experience provided her with an estimate indicating that making a 50,000-square-foot warehouse solar-ready would increase costs by less than 1%.

Rep. Paul Friel, D-Pottstown, noted that building codes are mandates designed for public benefit and believed the proposal would not be out of line. Still, he agreed with others that builders need a clear return on investment.

Large companies are already adopting solar-ready designs because they see that return, said Victoria Moroney, director of market development at ForeFront Power. She explained that solar developers can help warehouse owners monetize rooftops through power purchase agreements or leasing arrangements.

Commercial rooftop solar, she added, makes efficient use of land and generates power close to where it’s needed – reducing the need for costly transmission and distribution system upgrades and benefitting Pennsylvania ratepayers. It creates good family-sustaining jobs and comes online quickly, “which is something we urgently need right now with the PJM capacity crisis.”

The lack of solar energy in the commonwealth has contributed to higher electricity costs, said Penn Future’s Pat McDonnell. He noted that 60% of the state’s electricity is generated by gas and less than 5% from renewables.

He also said that recent hikes in Pennsylvanians’ utility bills – averaging about 15% – were partly due to gas plant failures during winter storm Elliot in 2022, and PJM’s capacity auction prices.

McDonnell pointed to Texas, now leading the nation in solar, wind, and battery development, where consumers are seeing lower energy bills.

“The time to use renewable energy is now,” he said. “It’s the cheapest form of electricity we can put on the grid, and we want to put policies in place that make full use of impervious surfaces to take advantage of an obvious opportunity to deal with energy and the climate.”

A 2023 PennEnvironment report said Pennsylvania’s 16,000-plus warehouses offer more than 516 million square feet of potential solar space – enough to generate power for more than 820,000 homes while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

There was broad agreement among participants that a balanced energy portfolio is essential in meeting the state’s needs – one that includes solar, natural gas, nuclear, wind and other sources.

“There is no magic bullet,” said Bair. And, although he expects some amendments to the bill, he welcomes the conversations about bringing new power to the grid quickly to help ease shortages.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.sungazette.com/images/2025/10/10130200/11SolarWarehouse-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:02:50.825099

This milestone helps to showcase their commitment to sustainable innovation, while showing how dedicated they are to eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. It’s their aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.

A Greener Shift is Happening

Even though Polestar have shown that they are embracing the green movement, this is just really reflective of a broader economic shift. If you look at the entertainment sector, for example, you will notice that streaming platforms like Netflix have much lower overheads when compared to traditional cinemas. While data centers powering them do consume energy, studies have shown that the carbon footprint of streaming is substantially lower, showing how entire infrastructures are moving to greener alternatives without compromising service offerings.

In other verticals, like iGaming, online casinos have also shown that there are sustainable alternatives that can be explored. Unlike traditional casinos that require HVAC systems, power, and lighting, online platforms offer thousands of games with a lower carbon footprint. Casino offers and promotions like free spins or deposit matches have also helped to boost player engagement without the cost of large-scale events and travel as well. Not only does this help casinos to access a bigger user demographic, but it also allows them to do so without increasing their carbon footprint. Interestingly, trends like this are converging as well.

Modern electric vehicles are not only becoming greener to make, but they are also integrating streaming services and gaming platforms within their infotainment systems. This shows how green trends can have a knock-on effect on other sectors, and for companies like Polestar, it’s helped them to create greener models that still harness the latest technology. Polestar, in particular for example, offers Android Automotive OS, which includes Prime Video, YouTube, and more through the Vivaldi Web Browser.

Polestar’s Strong Environmental Focus

Since the company began measuring its environmental focus in 2020, they have reduced their carbon footprint per sold car by nearly 25%. Significant contributors here include using low-carbon aluminium in all of their models, as well as making improvements to battery manufacturing. Renewable energy is also being used in the manufacturing process of all models, with increased biofuels on certain ocean routes. Polestar, like other companies that operate in different sectors, have shown that it is possible to detach growth from environmental impact. They also aim to do this in the future. Even though Polestar have the aim of creating a climate-neutral car, they also want to become completely climate-neutral by 2040. They also have the aim of producing a Polestar 2, which is 10 tonnes lower in carbon when compared to when the project as a whole started.

Not only is this helping to set the standard for other electronic car manufacturers, but it also helps to show how much potential there is in the market to offer more, without increasing environmental footprint. As time goes on, we can expect to see the company double down or create even more efficient cars that do not miss out on the latest tech features or advances.",https://evpowered.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Polestar-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:15.017486

Now the story of an unlikely partnership between a utility company and climate activists and how they worked together to help one community switch its heating and cooling to a cleaner source.

Science correspondent Miles O'Brien has the story, part of our Tipping Point coverage on energy and climate.

Miles O’Brien:

Retired schoolteacher Carol Canova has lived in this tiny little house in Framingham, Massachusetts for 30 years. From this humble perch, she has experienced firsthand a historic energy transition. She started with an oil-burning furnace, then switched to gas, and now heats and cools with an electric heat pump attached to a geothermal well.

Carol Canova, Framingham, Massachusetts, Resident:

I was told it would be even heat. I was told it would be efficient and so forth. But seeing is believing. I'd never been in a house that every place in the house was the same temperature.

Miles O’Brien:

Canova is part of a first-in-the-nation pilot by utility giant Eversource. It's a one-mile network of underground pipes connecting three dozen homes and municipal buildings to a shared geothermal well.

It's called networked geothermal, and if it works here, it could be a blueprint for utilities nationwide.

Carol Canova:

So I thought, oh, electricity is expensive. So I'm expecting it's going to be more expensive. What I find out is, it's overall cheaper.

Miles O’Brien:

Heat pumps live up to their name. They move heat. In the summer, they pump heat out of your home. In the winter, they bring it in. How hard they have to work and how much electricity they use depends on the temperature difference between inside and outside. The greater the gap, the more energy they need.

Shallow geothermal wells tap into the earth's steady underground temperature, about 55 degrees year-round. Water with antifreeze circulates through buried pipes, absorbing or releasing heat at that consistent temperature. A heat pump paired with a geothermal well has less work to do and is far more efficient no matter the weather above.

The catch? Drilling a geothermal well is very expensive, but none of the volunteers in this project paid a dime for either the well or the heat pump.

Carol Canova:

When Eversource offered it, I thought, you know what, this is like winning the lottery.

Nikki Bruno, Vice President, Eversource:

Everything else is buried in underground, except for the heat pumps.

Miles O’Brien:

Nikki Bruno is an Eversource V.P.

Nikki Bruno:

So, right outside this building is what we call the main bore field.

Miles O’Brien:

She showed me the pump house, which controls the entire system. It's the only visible sign of the geothermal network.

Nikki Bruno:

Those bores are 600 to 700 pipes that allow the water-based fluid to circulate and exchange energy with the underground.

Miles O’Brien:

Besides many homes like Carol's, heat pumps attached to the geothermal network are in use at a school administration building, a fire station, and a public housing development.

It's an $18.6 million project that comes amid significant changes in regulations. Massachusetts and the other states in the Eversource territory have aggressive climate goals and mandates.

Nikki Bruno:

How do we start offering something different? How can we produce a decarbonized product for our customers, while keeping safe, reliable and I will say as affordable as possible service to customers?

Miles O’Brien:

The idea was born of an unlikely partnership between utility executives and climate activists, among them, Zeybeb Magavi, the executive director of the nonprofit HEET, the Home Energy Efficiency Team. It's a grassroots group that started out by banding together to insulate their homes. They were looking for a way to make a bigger dent.

Zeybeb Magavi, Executive Director, HEET:

We really became aware of kind of a rock-and-a-hard place problem, where we have a gas system that actually we have pipes in the ground from President Lincoln's time.

Miles O’Brien:

Their focus on creaky, leaky gas pipes led them to a moment of insight and inspiration.

Zeybeb Magavi:

The ground, the bedrock, the water all around us is thermal energy, which we can tap. And that's kind of an exciting awakening thing to realize. We could potentially build a utility street by street that was pipes filled with water, maintained and managed by the gas utility, who — becomes a thermal utility.

This infrastructure would be in a way like the roots of our new energy system, right?

Miles O’Brien:

Even federal researchers are bullish. A study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that mass adoption of geothermal heat pumps could reduce the demand for electricity by 13 percent in the next 25 years. But the idea isn't new.

Let's go down in the boiler room. Here we go. You got people down here shoveling coal, right?

Jeff Tester, Engineering Professor, Cornell University:

This is our living laboratory.

Miles O’Brien:

Cornell University engineering professor Jeff Tester built his home in Ithaca, New York, as a living lab of efficiency, solar thermal, photovoltaics, and a heat pump that taps into a geothermal well buried in his backyard.

He's been advocating for ways to tap the heat beneath our feet since the 1970s, when he helped pioneer a novel geothermal energy concept at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Jeff Tester:

One method of extracting heat or mining heat from under the surface of the earth is to create a reservoir.

Miles O’Brien:

He looks back on those days with nostalgia.

Jeff Tester:

They were very supportive of trying new things in those days. We weren't afraid to try something.

Miles O’Brien:

For about 25 years, Cornell has harnessed a natural thermal engine to keep its campus cool. A district-chilling system taps 39-degree water from the depths of Cayuga Lake to cool more than 100 buildings.

Now the university is looking to go deeper and warmer. Jeff Tester is the principal investigator on a groundbreaking project to introduce geothermal heating to the campus. In 2022, his team drilled a nearly two-mile-deep test borehole to assess the available heat resources here.

Jeff Tester:

I feel like I have been training all my life for the day when we actually would see this happen on a campus like Cornell.

Miles O’Brien:

But he's still waiting, looking for money to build a geothermal network of pipes filled with hot water to heat the campus. He says society places great value on fossil fuels and electricity.

Jeff Tester:

But heat is not viewed that way in the same way, and I think we need a fairer system of what I refer to as an equivalent way to actually look at the benefits from clean heating versus clean electricity versus clean fuels. And we're not doing that right now. So we need a new value system for energy.

Miles O’Brien:

The Trump administration apparently does value geothermal. Energy Secretary Chris Wright consistently emphasizes it as a priority, making it the only renewable energy source currently in favor.

Zeybeb Magavi:

It's something we can agree on. It's the ground beneath our feet. Turns out we have common ground.

Miles O’Brien:

And it appears to be growing. Plans are now in place to double the size of the Framingham geothermal network starting next year. Common ground may be hard to find these days, but perhaps it's not far beneath the surface.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar.","Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” \Wiatros-Motyka said. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane.

This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”",https://www.vindy.com/wp-content/themes/coreV3_lazy_vindycustom/images/vindicatorfb.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:03:26.699699

This growth is driven by accelerating electric vehicle adoption and expanding energy storage deployments. Major automotive manufacturers have announced ambitious electrification targets, with many planning to be fully electric within the next decade. Each electric vehicle requires substantial quantities of battery-grade graphite for anode production.

Additionally, grid-scale energy storage installations are growing exponentially as renewable energy penetration increases, creating further demand for high-performance battery materials. NextSource's strategic positioning in this market provides exposure to both these high-growth sectors.

How Will the Abu Dhabi Facility Transform Global Anode Production?

The establishment of NextSource's Abu Dhabi facility represents a significant shift in global anode production dynamics. This project introduces substantial non-Chinese production capacity in a market that has long been dominated by Asian suppliers.

Strategic Location Benefits in UAE's Industrial Ecosystem

The selection of Abu Dhabi as the project location provides NextSource with several distinct advantages. According to the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development, the emirate offers industrial electricity rates approximately 30-40% lower than European averages, significantly reducing operational costs for energy-intensive processing activities.

The regulatory environment also provides benefits, with favorable tax treatment in designated industrial zones. This creates a competitive cost structure compared to alternative locations in Western countries with higher tax burdens and regulatory compliance costs.

Access to Khalifa Port, ranked among the top 50 global container ports, provides efficient logistics connections to both source materials and end markets. This strategic positioning enables NextSource to serve international customers through established shipping lanes with minimized transit times.

The existing industrial infrastructure also accelerates the development timeline. As NextSource CEO Hanré Rossouw explained: ""We found an existing building suitable for a plug-and-play setup, which will help us start production by 2026."" This approach eliminates significant construction time that would be required for a greenfield development.

Production Capacity and Market Impact Analysis

The Abu Dhabi facility represents a substantial addition to global anode material production capacity outside China. While specific production targets in tonnes per annum haven't been publicly disclosed, the scale of investment indicates a significant operation.

The project's total capital expenditure of US$291 million, with US$150 million allocated to phase one, suggests a major production facility by global standards. Industry analysts note that this investment level typically corresponds to tens of thousands of tonnes of annual production capacity.

This additional capacity could meaningfully impact global supply dynamics, particularly for battery manufacturers seeking sources outside China. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provides tax credits for electric vehicles only if battery components, including anode materials, meet increasing domestic content requirements, creating strong incentives for supply chain diversification.

Technological Advantages of NextSource's Processing Methods

Converting natural graphite to battery-grade anode material involves a sophisticated multi-step process. According to the International Energy Agency, this typically includes crushing and milling, spheroidization, purification to achieve >99.95% carbon content, and surface coating.

While NextSource hasn't publicly disclosed specific proprietary elements of its processing methodology, the battery anode industry recognizes that achieving consistent quality specifications is critical. As Rossouw noted, ""Graphite is a complex material — not a simple commodity — and the qualification process is essential.""

Battery-grade graphite requires precise particle size distribution, with D50 typically measuring 15-20 microns for spherical graphite according to Fastmarkets analysis. The specific surface area must also meet stringent specifications, typically 1.5-3.0 m²/g. Meeting these requirements consistently is essential for serving demanding automotive customers.

What Financial Metrics Support the Project's Viability?

The economics of NextSource's Abu Dhabi anode project demonstrate compelling financial metrics that make it attractive to investors and strategic partners. These figures provide insight into the potential return profile and commercial viability of the venture.

Breaking Down the $291M Investment Structure

The total capital expenditure for the project is US$291 million, structured in a phased approach to manage risk and capital deployment. Phase one requires US$150 million, allowing for initial production capacity while establishing the facility's operational capabilities.

This phased development approach is significant for several reasons. First, it reduces initial capital requirements, making financing more manageable. Second, it allows for technological optimization and market validation before committing to full-scale expansion. Finally, it provides flexibility to adjust subsequent phases based on evolving market conditions and customer requirements.

According to NextSource, approximately half of the required equipment for the project has already been ordered and is currently stored in Mauritius and China. This early procurement demonstrates commitment to the project timeline and may provide some insulation against potential equipment price increases or supply chain delays.

Analyzing the 24% IRR and 4.6-Year Payback Period

The project's expected Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 24% represents an attractive return profile, particularly in the current global investment environment. This figure exceeds typical hurdle rates for industrial projects and compares favorably with returns from other resource development ventures.

A 4.6-year payback period indicates relatively rapid capital recovery, allowing investors to recoup their initial investment in under five years. This metric is particularly important for risk assessment, as shorter payback periods reduce exposure to long-term market uncertainties and technological disruption risks.

The Net Present Value (NPV) of over US$400 million represents significant value creation potential. This figure suggests that even after accounting for the time value of money, the project is expected to generate substantial returns above the initial capital investment.

Comparing Economics to Other Global Battery Material Projects

According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, typical IRRs for battery materials projects range from 15-25%, with payback periods of 5-7 years for greenfield developments. NextSource's projected metrics compare favorably with these industry benchmarks, particularly considering the accelerated timeline enabled by the existing facility.

The project's economics benefit from several structural advantages. Lower energy costs in Abu Dhabi provide ongoing operational savings compared to facilities in higher-cost jurisdictions. The ""plug-and-play"" approach with an existing building reduces upfront capital expenditure and accelerates time to market.

Additionally, the security provided by the Mitsubishi offtake agreement reduces market risk, potentially allowing for more favorable financing terms. This combination of structural advantages and strategic partnerships contributes to the project's strong economic profile.

Electric vehicle demand forecasting carries inherent uncertainty, with adoption rates influenced by government policies, consumer preferences, and competing technologies. While long-term growth trends appear robust, short-term fluctuations could impact project economics, particularly during the critical early production years.

The competitive landscape continues to evolve, with multiple projects globally targeting similar market opportunities. This competitive dynamic could influence customer qualification priorities and pricing power, requiring adaptive commercial strategies.

Technical Challenges in Meeting Evolving Battery Specifications

Battery technology continues to advance rapidly, with manufacturers constantly seeking performance improvements and cost reductions. These evolving requirements create a moving target for material suppliers, necessitating ongoing product development and qualification efforts.

The qualification timeline with automotive OEMs typically spans 18-24 months according to industry standards, representing a significant commitment before achieving full commercial adoption. This extended process creates cash flow challenges during the transition from initial production to full capacity utilization.

Maintaining consistent quality at scale represents another technical challenge, particularly given the demanding specifications for battery-grade materials. Particle size distribution, purity levels, and electrochemical performance must all meet stringent requirements with minimal variation across production batches.

FAQ: NextSource Materials Abu Dhabi Anode Project

When is production expected to begin at the Abu Dhabi facility?

Based on NextSource's current development timeline, production is targeted to commence by 2026. This schedule reflects the advantages gained through securing an existing facility that can be rapidly converted for production use, eliminating much of the construction time typically associated with greenfield projects. The specific quarter for initial production hasn't been publicly disclosed.

What specific battery materials will the facility produce?

The Abu Dhabi facility will produce active anode material for lithium-ion batteries, primarily for electric vehicle and grid-scale energy storage applications. In battery industry terminology, this refers to coated spherical graphite (battery-grade anode material) rather than raw graphite concentrate according to U.S. Geological Survey classifications. This high-value processed material serves as the negative electrode component in lithium-ion batteries, storing and releasing lithium ions during charging and discharging cycles.

How does this project compare to other international anode material facilities?

NextSource's Abu Dhabi facility represents one of the largest non-Chinese anode material production operations globally. While several alternative projects are in development, particularly in North America and Europe, the Abu Dhabi facility benefits from several competitive advantages, including lower energy costs, established industrial infrastructure, and feedstock security through vertical integration with the Molo mine. The capital efficiency of utilizing an existing building structure also provides advantages compared to greenfield alternatives.

What environmental considerations are incorporated into the project design?

While specific environmental metrics haven't been publicly detailed, industrial projects in Abu Dhabi operate under the UAE's environmental regulatory framework, which requires Environmental Impact Assessments under Federal Law No. 24 of 1999 for Environmental Protection. Modern anode material production typically incorporates water recycling systems, emissions controls for purification processes, and energy efficiency measures. The facility's location within Abu Dhabi's Industrial City suggests alignment with the emirate's established industrial sustainability frameworks and infrastructure.

How might changing EV demand affect the project's long-term prospects?

Electric vehicle adoption continues to accelerate globally, with major automotive manufacturers announcing ambitious electrification targets. While short-term demand fluctuations may occur due to economic cycles or policy changes, the fundamental transition toward electric mobility appears robust. The project's long-term prospects benefit from this structural growth trend, as each electric vehicle requires substantial quantities of anode material. Additionally, the growing grid-scale energy storage market provides diversification beyond automotive applications, potentially buffering against EV market fluctuations.

What battery performance advantages can be achieved with NextSource's materials?

High-quality anode materials enable several critical battery performance characteristics, including greater energy density, faster charging capabilities, and longer cycle life. While NextSource hasn't publicly disclosed specific performance metrics for its materials, the vertical integration from mine to processing facility typically enables tighter quality control and consistency. The qualification process with Mitsubishi suggests the materials meet demanding specifications for commercial battery applications, though specific electrochemical performance details haven't been released.

How does the Abu Dhabi project fit within NextSource's broader corporate strategy?

The Abu Dhabi anode facility represents a key element of NextSource's vertical integration strategy, connecting downstream processing with the company's existing Molo graphite mine in Madagascar. This integrated approach allows NextSource to capture value across multiple stages of the battery material supply chain while maintaining quality control throughout the process. The project aligns with the company's positioning as a Western-aligned supplier of critical battery materials, targeting growing demand for non-Chinese supply sources in the electric vehicle and energy storage sectors.

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by two to 547 in the week to October 10.

Baker Hughes said this week’s decline puts the total rig count down 39 rigs, or 7% below this time last year.

Baker Hughes said oil rigs fell by four to 418 this week, while gas rigs rose by two to 120, their highest since August.

In the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the biggest U.S. oil-producing shale formation, the rig count fell by one this week to 250, the lowest since September 2021.

In Texas, meanwhile, the rig count dropped by six this week to 238, also the lowest since September 2021.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output. The independent exploration and production, or E&P, companies tracked by U.S. financial services firm TD Cowen said they planned to cut capital expenditures by around 4% in 2025 from levels seen in 2024.

That compares with roughly flat year-over-year spending in 2024, increases of 27% in 2023, 40% in 2022, and 4% in 2021. Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third straight year in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to around 13.5 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, EIA projected a 56% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020. EIA projected gas output would rise to 107.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

WATCH: Eaton Rapids solar proposal faces local opposition

2,000-acre renewable energy project proposed for Eaton Rapids

The Fiddlehead Solar Project, backed by Chicago-based Hecate Energy, would cover farmland in Hamlin Township, Brookfield Township, and Springport Township Project developer Mark Zwieg said the development promises clean energy, new jobs, tax revenue and economic activity for the area.

""We're committed to do the project the right way, we're committed to work with communities,"" Zwieg said. ""Solar and agriculture can co-exist.""

But neighbors Ali Griffith and Jasmine Emerick, who moved to the area for its agricultural character, are concerned about the project's impact on their community.

""We really wanted to raise our son around agriculture,"" Griffith said.

""So growing up here it was just so peaceful in a place that was different from living in the city."" Emerick said.

The project faces a regulatory hurdle at the local level. Hamlin Township says projects like this on agriculturally zoned land are prohibited under local ordinances. Instead, Hecate Energy plans to use a state process to work around local zoning rules.

""It provides a path to permitting,"" Zwieg said.

Public Act 233, allows companies like Hecate can work through local ordinances through the Michigan Public Service Commission state approval process. The state regulations include requirements such as a 300-foot buffer zone between houses and solar project fencing.

""It's quite upsetting and outrageous and upsetting to us that our zoning rights have been taken away from us,"" Griffith said.

Hecate's next step is submitting their Public Act 233 application, which will trigger another round of community input. Griffith and Emrick said they plan to challenge the project during that process.

""We really want to let the MPSC know our feelings about the project whether it be environmental, property value, disrupting farm land, or wildlife movement patterns,"" Griffith said. ""I think we should hammer that home to our MPSC commissioners.""

Two bills currently waiting in the state Senate - House Bills 4027 and 4028 - would restore local control for large renewable energy projects like the Fiddlehead Solar Project.

Next Steps Achieving permitting reform in this Congress is possible but will require compromise and significant stakeholder pressure.","Permitting reform for energy projects and related infrastructure has been the bipartisan, bicameral white whale of policy for a very long time. Despite broad support for the idea, agreeing on how to actually reform the permitting process has stumped lawmakers. The 119th Congress has continued along this path, with committee leadership from both parties and chambers calling attention to permitting reform and articulating the need for additional actions to speed up timelines and reduce costs for projects. In the span of 10 months, lawmakers have introduced multiple legislative proposals aimed at shortening permitting timelines and reducing the frequency of litigation. Concurrently, the courts and the Trump administration have taken their own actions to redefine the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This alert outlines the current state-of-play in permitting reform efforts across the three branches of the federal government.

First, A Look Back

Permitting reform was on the “to-do” list for Congress when, on Dec. 21, 2024, during the lame duck session of Congress and the Biden administration, Congress passed a stopgap measure to fund the government for three months to avoid a shutdown. Yet, permitting reform provisions did not make it into the legislation passed into law.

For many lawmakers, the failure to reach a compromise deal to accelerate infrastructure development was a missed opportunity—especially as the Democratic Caucus had seemingly grown more receptive to permitting reform after hearing of delays of projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). No one possibly felt this disappointment more than outgoing Sen. Joe Manchin (I-WV), who introduced the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024 and spent nearly two years pushing it through the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. In a pointed statement following the stopgap vote, Sen. Manchin emphasized the continued importance of permitting reform, and suggested these efforts would resume in 2025. “Meaningful permitting reform will continue … next year and cannot be done by executive action alone,” he wrote.

Before the near-finish-line failure of the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024, there were two major efforts to update the federal permitting system; the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act in 2015, which created the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council among other things; and, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which extended the FAST Act and introduced statutory deadlines for environmental reviews among other things.

Most recently, on July 4, President Donald Trump signed H.R.1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, into law. The bill added Section 112 to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), allowing a project sponsor to pay 125% of the costs associated with developing an environmental review document. If the project sponsor elects to pay this fee, the action agency must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) in one year and an environmental assessment (EA) in 180 days. In an earlier version of the bill, the provision would have exempt the expedited EA and EIS from judicial review. The Senate parliamentarian removed this exemption from the final reconciliation bill after determining it did not comply with the Byrd Rule. In addition, like Sen. Manchin’s Energy Permitting Reform Act, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act mandates new oil and gas lease sales across federal lands and waters.

Recent Legislative Actions

Various permitting measures have been introduced in this Congress, and more proposals may be forthcoming.

House

The House Energy and Commerce Committee and House Natural Resources Committee have both been actively moving legislation aimed at permitting reform. Below are a few of the major initiatives pending before these committees.

SPEED Act: On July 25, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) introduced H.R.4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act. Among its most significant changes, the SPEED Act would codify NEPA as a “purely procedural statute” and the Supreme Court’s ruling in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado (Seven County), by requiring federal agencies to only consider effects that are “proximately caused by” the immediate project or action. The bill would add grants to the list of actions that do not automatically trigger National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and prohibit a federal agency from withdrawing any environmental document completed under NEPA unless a court so orders, thereby stopping future administrations from rescinding environmental documents promulgated under prior ones. Regarding judicial review, the SPEED Act would restrict courts from determining a final agency action violates NEPA unless the agency clearly “abused its substantial discretion in complying with” the law and would have reached a different result absent of this abuse of “substantial discretion.”

Further, the bill would prohibit a court from substituting its judgment “for that of the agency regarding the environmental effects of a proposed agency action” and amend the steps courts must take to remand such action. Specifically, the SPEED Act would mandate that a court may only remand a final agency action if it provides specific instruction and a reasonable deadline—no longer than 180 days—to correct deficiencies. Remanded actions may remain in effect during this period.

Additionally, the bill would require parties to file legal challenges within 150 days of the final agency action’s publication and would prohibit parties from contesting the establishment of a categorical exclusion. Lastly, Chairman Westerman’s bill would require parties appealing a court ruling to do so within 60 days, with courts required to rule on appeal within 180 days. On Sept. 10, the House Natural Resources Committee held a legislative hearing to receive testimony on the bill. The committee intends to mark up the bill as soon as this month.

SPEED and Reliability Act: On Sept. 26, Reps. Andy Barr (R-KY) and Scott Peters (D-CA) reintroduced H.R.5600, the Streamlining Powerlines Essential to Electric Demand (SPEED) and Reliability Act. The bill aims to expedite the siting and permitting of electric transmission lines by amending the Federal Power Act, the primary statute governing the wholesale transmission and sale of electric power.

Currently, both the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) are required to conduct National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews for the same proposed transmission line under the National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC) designation process. The SPEED and Reliability Act would remove this duplicative process, requiring that only FERC conduct an environmental review.

Further, the bill would allow FERC to issue a construction permit for individual transmission lines that are designated to be in the national interest, reduce grid congestion and improve reliability without having to undergo NEPA review. The bill was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee for further consideration.

Cheap Energy Act: On Sept. 24, Reps. Sean Casten (D-IL) and Mike Levin (D-CA), cochairs of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, released draft text for a bill titled the Cheap Energy Act. The lawmakers describe the draft as a “consumer-focused approach” to U.S. energy policy that ensures “cheap, reliable, and clean energy.” It includes language that would repeal the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s provisions eliminating or phasing out energy tax credits, while establishing a new investment tax credit to cover 30% of the cost of new transmission lines, modified existing lines and related property.

The bill would also codify processes for offshore wind leasing and prohibit the Department of the Interior from instating additional levels of review for solar and wind projects. The discussion draft aims to strengthen and build out additional transmission lines as it would authorize more than $2 billion to address the shortage of electricity transformers and complementary grid security technologies, and provide the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with exclusive siting authority for national interest transmission lines. The bill also intends to expedite the hiring of agency permitting staff and would direct the Council on Environmental Quality to create an online portal for permits that require review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Reps. Levin and Casten hope to introduce formal legislation reflecting this language in early 2026.

House Problem Solvers Caucus Framework: On Sept. 18, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of Democratic and Republican lawmakers seeking bipartisan consensus on key political issues, unveiled its new Permitting Reform Framework.

Like the SPEED and Reliability Act, the Cheap Energy Act and the Energy Permitting Reform Act, this framework would expedite the NIETC designation process as it allows for simultaneous state and federal environmental reviews. It would create categorical exclusions for simple updates to existing transmission infrastructure and pipelines, remove the need for a presidential permit when permitting cross-border linear infrastructure, and eliminate the duplicative need for a line-specific National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review pursuant to Section 368 corridors. It would also ensure that judicial standing for litigating projects is limited to parties who submitted detailed comments during public review and establish a one-year statute of limitations for litigation against most projects.

Lastly, it would direct federal agencies to replace their current paper system with a centralized cloud-based platform for all permitting processes. Reps. Gabe Evans (R-CO) and Scott Peters (D-CA), who lead the caucus’ Permitting, Energy and Environment Working Group, along with Cochairs Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Tom Suozzi (D-NY), hope to translate the framework into legislation later this Congress.

ePermit Act: On July 17, Reps. Scott Peters (D-CA) and Dusty Johnson (R-SD) introduced H.R.4503, the ePermit Act, legislation to complement the Trump administration’s efforts to streamline National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review. The bill would establish a framework for federal agencies to implement a digital permitting system for energy projects undergoing environmental reviews. It would also create federal data and taxonomy standards, and a governmentwide permitting database to enable better coordination across the federal permitting landscape. Like the SPEED Act, this bill also received testimony during a recent House Natural Resources Committee hearing and awaits further consideration.

Senate

Both Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Mike Lee (R-UT) have recently made statements demonstrating continued interest in working on permitting reform. Most recently, Chairman Lee stated “It’s time for NEPA reform” in a social media post. Below are a few of the pending proposals before their committees.

CLEAR Waters Act: On July 23, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced S.2421, the Clarifying Legal Exclusions Around Regulated (CLEAR) Waters Act. This bill, which is cosponsored by six other Senate Republicans, would amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide exclusions for the term “navigable waters.” This bill attempts to clarify that certain water systems shall not be included under the definition of navigable waters under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, including components of waste treatment systems, groundwater and ephemeral features that flow only in direct response to precipitation. The bill would also allow for additional considerations depending on the determination of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and chief of engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Small Projects Expedited Execution and Delivery (SPEED) Act: On May 22, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) introduced S.1894, the Small Projects Expedited Execution and Delivery (SPEED) Act. This bill would amend the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) to double the threshold of federal funding under which a project may still qualify for a categorical exclusion due to limited federal involvement. Specifically, the bill would allow projects receiving up to $12 million in federal funds—or have a total estimated cost of up to $70 million—to remain eligible for categorical exclusions. Sen. Lummis’ bill remains in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee for further consideration.

Efficient Nuclear Licensing Hearing Act: On May 14, Sens. Tim Scott (R-SC) and Chris Coons (D-DE) introduced S.1757, the Efficient Nuclear Licensing Hearings Act. This bipartisan bill would amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to provide for more efficient hearings on nuclear facility construction applications. Specifically, the bill would remove the requirement for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to hold a public hearing during the nuclear licensing process if an affected party does not contest the approval. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Interactive Federal Review Act: On April 10, Sens. Lummis and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) introduced S.1430, the Interactive Federal Review Act. This bipartisan bill would improve the environmental review process for highway projects through the use of interactive, digital, cloud-based platforms and digital twins. It would mandate the Department of Transportation (DOT) to select 10 federal-aid highway projects to demonstrate the use of these platforms and models in conducting the environmental impact analysis and community engagement processes that NEPA requires. The bill remains in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee where it awaits further review.

Primacy Certainty Act of 2025: On July 29, Sens. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) and Pete Ricketts (R-NE) introduced S.2505, the Primacy Certainty Act of 2025. This bill would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to clarify the timelines and provide certainty and transparency for making a decision on the approval or disapproval of a state underground injection control program. It would mandate the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rule on state applications to regulate Class VI injection wells within 180 days. If not, the application automatically takes effect after 210 days if the state already enforces a similar regulatory program. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

MAPWaters Act of 2025: On July 31, Sens. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Angus King (I-VT) introduced S.2637, the Modernizing Access to our Public (MAP) Waters Act of 2025. The bill would provide for the standardization, consolidation and publication of data related to public outdoor recreation use of federal waterways among federal land and water management agencies. Specifically, it would direct the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to adopt interagency standards for data collection and dissemination of geospatial data relating to public outdoor recreational access of federal waterways and federal fishing restrictions. The bill was referred to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

Unlocking Housing Supply Through Streamlined and Modernized Reviews Act: On July 23, Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) and Andy Kim (D-NJ) introduced S.2390, the Unlocking Housing Supply Through Streamlined and Modernized Reviews Act. This bill would reclassify certain activities by the Department of Housing and Urban Development as it relates to housing as necessary administrative actions to allow for certain activities to be streamlined. It would also call for additional categorical exclusions if a proposed housing-related activity does not materially alter environmental conditions and does not materially exceed the original scope of the project. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Necessary Environmental Exemptions for Defense Act: On July 9, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) introduced S.2226, the Necessary Environmental Exemptions for Defense Act. This bill would allow for certain activities from the Defense Department to be exempt from requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Endangered Species Act, Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, if the secretary of defense certifies they are directly related to countering the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Court Actions

These legislative efforts come as court rulings have reshaped the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and the White House Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) authorities. The section below provides an overview of the relevant court actions changing or shaping the permitting review process.

As summarized in our July 18, 2025, Client Alert, on Nov. 12, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit) in Marin Audubon Society v. Federal Aviation Administration, held that CEQ lacks the authority to issue binding regulations governing federal agencies’ implementation of NEPA. Specifically, the D.C. Circuit found that there is no statutory language suggesting that Congress empowered CEQ to issue binding rules and act as a regulatory agency. It contended that CEQ’s legal authority is, for all practical purposes, identical to the duties Congress assigned to the Council of Economic Advisors, another consultative agency within the Executive Office of the President. Historically, CEQ stated its rulemaking authority originated not from legislation, but from Executive Order 11991, issued by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Executive Order 11991 replaced more than 70 different sets of agency regulations across the executive branch and helped create CEQ’s framework, recognizing its authority to advise the president on environmental issues and NEPA implementation. To this, the D.C. Circuit held that executive orders cannot give an agency rulemaking authority, only statutes can.

Months later, on May 29, the Supreme Court, in Seven County, unanimously held that NEPA reviews do not require federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts beyond the immediate effects of the action over which the agency has regulatory authority. This case concerned the U.S. Surface Transportation Board’s (STB) decision to approve an application to construct an 88-mile railroad line after performing a NEPA review. The D.C. Circuit held that STB violated NEPA by failing to sufficiently consider the reasonably foreseeable effects increased upstream crude oil production and downstream refining operations could have on the environment, given the railway would facilitate this activity. The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit in a strongly worded opinion emphasizing that agencies, when conducting NEPA review, are not considering other “future or geographically separate projects that may be built as a result.”

Agency Actions

Concurrently, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions to facilitate permitting reform. The section below provides an overview of the recent executive actions on permitting reform.

Following the ruling in Marin Audubon Society, which held that CEQ’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations were ultra vires, President Donald Trump’s Day One Executive Order 14154 directed CEQ to eliminate its NEPA regulations. The order also revoked President Jimmy Carter’s Executive Order 11991. On Feb. 25, CEQ issued an Interim Final Rule rescinding its NEPA regulations. The final rule went into effect on April 11.

Consistent with Executive Order 14154, federal agencies must revise or establish NEPA implementing procedures that expedite permitting approvals. Executive Order 14154 also directed CEQ to provide guidance on implementing NEPA to expedite these processes. On Feb. 19, CEQ issued interim guidance calling on agencies to revise their NEPA procedures to align with Executive Order 14154 and the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA).

As explained in our June 2, 2024, client alert, the FRA made the following changes to NEPA:

Included new definitions for “major federal action”; 2) Limited NEPA analysis to the “reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of the proposed agency action”; 3) Allowed agencies to rely on a final programmatic environmental document for five years without additional review so long as there are no new circumstances or information that impact the analysis; 4) Set into statute a 75-page limit for EAs and 150-page limit for most EISs. However, the FRA allows EISs to reach 300 pages if the project is extraordinarily complex; 5) Required agencies to complete EAs within one year and EISs within two years; and 6) Permitted agencies to adopt categorical exclusions listed in another agency’s NEPA procedures after meeting certain conditions.

On Sept. 29, CEQ updated its guidance to federal agencies concerning their implementation of NEPA. The new guidance asks that agencies continue to update NEPA implementing procedures to reflect Executive Order 14154 and the FRA, as well as the statutory changes that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act made and the Supreme Court’s opinion in Seven County, both of which came after CEQ issued its initial guidance.

In this updated guidance, CEQ is also providing agencies with an agency procedures template to assist them in preparing or revising their NEPA procedures. CEQ says the template is not mandatory or binding but is instead meant to provide clarity and technical assistance to agencies as they develop or update their respective guidelines. The template is organized as a Federal Register notice and offers agencies the ability to promulgate their NEPA implementing procedures for publication in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In July, departments of Energy, Agriculture, Interior, Defense and Transportation, among others, issued updated procedures to reflect recent changes to NEPA outside of the CFR in the form of guidance or a handbook. According to CEQ’s new guidance, while agencies are free to choose their own unique approaches when they are promulgating their updated NEPA procedures, they must still consult with CEQ and submit to them required documentation for review.

Next Steps

Achieving permitting reform in this Congress is possible but will require compromise and significant stakeholder pressure. The bills outlined above are an indication that lawmakers are interested in working across the aisle on reforming the permitting process for energy and related infrastructure projects. Additionally, several large trade organizations have already called upon congressional leadership to pass permitting reform, including the Edison Electric Institute, the American Petroleum Institute and the Chamber of Commerce. The pathways to moving any or all of these ideas are not limited to energy projects as Congress may look to reforming the process for permitting broader projects, including roads and bridges through the required reauthorization of the Surface Transportation bill currently moving through the legislative process.

The most significant changes are likely to come from regulatory agencies, at least in the short term. It remains uncertain exactly how much permitting timelines will accelerate under the new procedures already put in place by the Trump administration, but it is generally expected that these changes will significantly expedite the process. More executive actions like the one that established the National Energy Dominance Council aimed at coordinating agency action on permitting can be expected.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14565_3925.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:40.149688

The violations, primarily at TBC’s Bastrop and Austin sites, involve improper wastewater discharge, air pollution, and construction non-compliance, leading to $2.2 million in proposed fines from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and other agencies. This controversy adds to Musk’s regulatory challenges amid his high-profile ventures. In this article, we examine the violations, regulatory actions, and their impact on TBC’s operations and Musk’s broader enterprises. The Wall Street Journal

Details of the 800+ Environmental Violations

The violations span multiple environmental regulations at TBC’s Texas sites, particularly its 1,500-acre Bastrop campus and Austin-area tunneling projects:

Violation Count: Over 800 infractions since 2021, with 400+ related to wastewater discharges and 200+ tied to air quality breaches.

Wastewater Issues: TBC allegedly discharged untreated wastewater into local waterways, violating Clean Water Act permits. This includes 150+ instances of releasing industrial runoff without proper treatment.

Air Pollution: Over 200 violations involve unpermitted emissions from construction and boring equipment, exceeding volatile organic compound (VOC) limits.

Construction Non-Compliance: 100+ cases of unauthorized land disturbance and failure to implement stormwater controls at Bastrop.

Fines Proposed: TCEQ and local authorities have issued $2.2 million in penalties, with $1.5 million for wastewater and $700,000 for air quality violations.

TBC’s Bastrop site, home to tunnel testing and manufacturing, has drawn scrutiny for its proximity to the Colorado River, amplifying environmental concerns.

Reasons Behind the Violations

Several factors contributed to TBC’s regulatory lapses:

Rapid Expansion: TBC’s aggressive push to scale tunneling projects, including a proposed Austin hyperloop, outpaced environmental compliance efforts.

Regulatory Oversight Gaps: Texas’s business-friendly environment initially allowed lax monitoring, but increased scrutiny followed community complaints.

Operational Oversights: Inadequate wastewater treatment systems and failure to secure air permits reflect internal mismanagement.

Musk’s Approach: Critics argue Musk’s focus on speed and innovation, seen in ventures like SpaceX, prioritizes progress over regulatory adherence.

Regulatory and Community Response

The TCEQ and local authorities have intensified enforcement:

Fines and Orders: TBC faces $2.2 million in fines, with mandates to install wastewater treatment systems and obtain air permits by Q1 2026.

Community Pushback: Bastrop residents and environmental groups have raised alarms over water contamination risks, prompting public hearings.

TBC’s Response: The company has pledged to address violations, investing $10 million in compliance upgrades, but disputes some penalty amounts.

Federal Oversight: The EPA is reviewing TBC’s Clean Water Act breaches, potentially escalating penalties.

Implications for The Boring Company and Musk’s Ventures

The violations pose significant challenges:

Operational Delays: Compliance costs and regulatory delays could slow TBC’s Austin and Bastrop projects, impacting timelines for tunneling contracts.

Reputation Risk: The controversy tarnishes Musk’s image, already strained by debates like his H-1B visa defense, potentially affecting investor confidence.

Financial Strain: $2.2 million in fines and $10 million in upgrades add pressure to TBC, which has raised $800 million but remains unprofitable.

Industry Scrutiny: Increased focus on Musk’s ventures, like SpaceX’s regulatory battles, could tighten oversight across his portfolio.

The Bigger Picture: Musk’s Regulatory Challenges

TBC’s 800 violations reflect broader tensions between Musk’s innovation-driven ventures and regulatory frameworks, paralleling issues like xAI’s $10B raise amid AI ethics debates or SpaceFields’ ₹42 crore funding for defense tech. In India, where environmental compliance is critical (e.g., Bira 91’s crisis), TBC’s case underscores the need for sustainable practices in high-growth sectors.

What’s Next for The Boring Company?

Key developments to watch:

TCEQ’s final penalty ruling and TBC’s compliance progress by Q1 2026.

Potential EPA sanctions escalating federal oversight.

Community lawsuits or settlements impacting Bastrop operations.

TBC’s ability to secure new contracts amid reputational damage.

Conclusion

The Boring Company’s 800+ environmental violations in Texas, with $2.2 million in fines, highlight the challenges of balancing rapid innovation with regulatory compliance. As TBC addresses wastewater and air quality issues, its response will shape its future and Musk’s broader ventures. The controversy underscores the importance of environmental stewardship in transformative industries.",https://lapaasvoice.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Elon-Org_boring-1024x683.webp,N,,2025-10-11 13:03:49.154854

Utility-scale solar applications have popped up throughout the state as developers sought to tie in to the massive transmission line and its substations.
Another blow to utility-scale solar in Nevada The cancellation is the latest in a series of blows to the buildout of utility-scale solar in Nevada.
Now, utility-scale projects must be under construction within the next year and completed by the end of 2027 to receive the credits.","A massive solar project proposed to be built in rural Esmeralda County with a footprint roughly the size of Las Vegas appears to have been scrapped by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

Applicants were seeking to construct seven geographically contiguous utility-scale solar projects known as the Esmeralda 7, west of Tonopah and north of Dyer. The projects would have covered roughly 62,000 acres, but to accommodate rights-of-way and other necessary land, roughly 119,000 acres (185 square miles) were earmarked for the project.

First reported by Heatmap, the BLM’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Register on Friday listed the environmental review status for the Esmeralda 7 project as “cancelled.” The law requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making decisions.

“The BLM wouldn’t cancel it unless the proponents wanted it cancelled,” said Shaaron Netherton, executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, an environmental nonprofit that has opposed the project. “I just can’t think of any other reason why it would be cancelled.”

Combined, Esmeralda 7’s individual projects would have easily become Nevada’s largest solar project to date with a 6,200-megawatt nameplate capacity — the maximum amount of power they could have produced under ideal conditions — which would be enough to power millions of homes. Actual output was expected to be less.

In 2023, the bureau started the process of reviewing applications for the seven solar projects. It immediately garnered pushback from conservationists and many of Esmeralda County’s roughly 720 residents who opposed the scope of the project.

“If this is built, it’s gonna be really noticeable,” Nancy Boland, a former Esmeralda County commissioner, previously told The Nevada Independent. “Your whole sense of freedom is going to be affected.”

In a follow-up call Friday, Boland said she’s “very happy” about the news, saying Esmeralda 7 would have had outsized effects on the region’s desert bighorn sheep population.

“We were really opposed to it,” she said. “With all of these things, they should slow down. We aren’t the only ones having problems with these vast decisions with these solar things.”

The sprawling Esmeralda 7 was going to be located along NV Energy’s Greenlink project, a pair of large-scale transmission corridors set to span from Las Vegas to Reno and then east to Ely. Utility-scale solar applications have popped up throughout the state as developers sought to tie in to the massive transmission line and its substations. The Greenlink project is also facing delays, as well as ongoing rising costs.

The final environmental impact statement for Esmeralda 7 — the last step before a record of decision is issued — was set to be released at the end of April but was delayed under the Trump administration.

“While we await further clarity from BLM on its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process, we remain deeply concerned that this administration continues to flout the law to the detriment of consumers, the grid, and America’s economic competitiveness,” Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in an email. “We need more power on the grid, fast, and the solar and storage industry is ready to provide it, but we need the administration to get serious about truly achieving American energy dominance.""

The federal government remains shut down, and multiple spokespeople for the BLM did not return Friday phone calls to The Nevada Independent.

Another blow to utility-scale solar in Nevada

The cancellation is the latest in a series of blows to the buildout of utility-scale solar in Nevada.

Under President Donald Trump’s controversial budget enacted earlier this year, utility-scale solar tax credits previously set to expire at the end of 2032 are being rolled back much sooner. Now, utility-scale projects must be under construction within the next year and completed by the end of 2027 to receive the credits.

“I believe a lot of these projects are politically not favored by Trump,” said Kevin Emmerich, co-founder of Basin and Range Watch, a conservation focused nonprofit that also opposed the Esmeralda 7 project.

The Department of the Interior, which oversees the BLM, now must specifically approve any decision relating to utility-scale solar projects, adding another layer of red tape for advancing projects.

“It doesn’t make sense monetarily for them to do this right now, with everything going on with Trump, with the lack of subsidies and the push for other types of power,” Netherton said.",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2024/08/1682bdf6-esmeralda-7.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:58:17.811714

The Interior Department said in a statement that developers now have the option to “submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.” The decision comes as the department institutes permitting reviews and other requirements for wind and solar farms on public lands that critics say effectively prevents development of clean-energy projects on federal property.

With over 150 hydroelectric projects producing affordable, reliable, and clean energy, at times we are left with excess hydropower that can be readily available to supply hydrogen projects, which in turn, can fuel heavy transportation and manufacturing projects.

In April of this year, I wrote about the importance of the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and how it will help boost energy and economic development in our region. Now, due to the shutdown of the federal government caused by Senate Democrats refusing to pass a clean a continuing resolution, funding for the Hub has been eliminated. On October 2, the Department of Energy (DOE) cancelled a grant award totaling $1 billion, effectively halting the project indefinitely. Following the announcement, I reached out to DOE Secretary Chris Wright asking this decision to be reversed. I remain fully committed to the success of the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and the hundreds of jobs it will bring to Central Washington.

Apart from the dramatic increase in energy production, the Hub would bring thousands of new jobs in engineering, construction, and manufacturing that will boost economic development and investments in local communities in the PNW. Washington’s ports, both coastal and inland, would become global centers for hydrogen exports and supply international markets with clean American fuel.

Make no mistake, the elimination of funding for the Hub is a direct consequence of the federal government shutdown. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has broader funding authority during a shutdown, and because Senate Democrats – including Washington’s Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell – did not support the House’s clean continuing resolution, the Hub’s funding was cut.

To support the Hub and all it will do for our region, I sent a letter to Secretary Wright requesting the reinstatement of funding for the Clean Hydrogen Hub Program and to work with Congress to ensure the program is managed responsibly for the sake of American energy security.

The decision marks a sharp retreat from strategies intended to buffer EV demand after the subsidy’s formal expiration on Sept. 30.

In late September, Ford and GM had quietly rolled out programs to preserve the lease-embedded credit benefit. Their financial arms would make down payments on EVs in dealer inventory before the Sept. 30 cutoff, allowing those vehicles to qualify for the $7,500 credit. Dealers would then lease those same cars to customers with the credit “baked in” to the payments.

Behind the scenes, the automakers coordinated with IRS officials to ensure the structure met eligibility rules—i.e., demonstrating acquisition by the deadline via a binding contract and payment. GM at one point planned to apply this to about 20,000 vehicles.

GM pulled back first on Oct. 8, stating it would not claim the credit and instead would fund lease incentives internally through October. A day later, Ford confirmed it would not pursue the scheme either, though it pledged to continue competitive lease pricing via Ford Credit and existing incentives.

This retrenchment follows criticism of the workarounds from lawmakers, notably Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno, a former dealer, who called them a circumvention of policy.

Impact on EV Supply, Demand & Sales Mix

The federal subsidy for new EVs had been a linchpin of U.S. EV demand. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 expanded it and allowed consumers to transfer it to dealers at point of sale.

Its expiration is expected to erode demand sharply. Some forecasts project EV registrations could fall 20–30% without the subsidy.

Already in 2025, automakers were pushing pre-buy demand before the cutoff. Ford, for example, extended a free home charger offer to stimulate sales earlier in the year.

Beyond sales declines, GM has taken steps to scale back EV production in anticipation of reduced demand. The company plans to pause or slow output at plants producing models like the Cadillac LYRIQ and Chevy Bolt, and to delay starting a second shift on other lines.",https://www.autobodynews.com/images/June_2025/F-150_Lightning_Flash_1_full.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:01:33.892751

Gas stoves have been linked to harmful indoor air pollution, whereas induction stoves are a safer, faster, and more cost-effective alternative.
Thanks to federal incentives, Americans can still claim up to $840 off the cost of an induction range.
Ultimately, while some federal tax credits are set to expire, appliance rebates will continue through 2031 or until funds are exhausted.","If you've been thinking about upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, now's the time to act.

While many federal tax credits for home upgrades are set to expire at the end of 2025, several major state rebates created by the Inflation Reduction Act are still in effect — and for many households, these incentives can cover nearly the entire cost of improvements.

Existing state-level rebates are designed to help Americans save money on projects such as insulation, air sealing, and replacing outdated appliances like gas stoves with induction models.

Incentives like these don't just reduce monthly utility bills; they also encourage the widespread adoption of clean energy and green technology, which helps cool the planet. Many households qualify for coverage of up to 100% of project costs, making these upgrades even more affordable for low- and moderate-income families.

In the Southeast, rebate programs are already up and running in Georgia and North Carolina, with Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee preparing to launch similar energy programs imminently, according to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

Georgia's program, for example, offers households thousands of dollars in potential savings, while North Carolina's Energy Saver initiative has already begun helping disadvantaged communities lower their energy burden.

Moreover, some programs offer retroactive coverage for projects initiated after August 2022, meaning residents may be eligible to claim savings on upgrades they've already made.

One of the most attractive opportunities to upgrade and save is in the kitchen.

Gas stoves have been linked to harmful indoor air pollution, whereas induction stoves are a safer, faster, and more cost-effective alternative. Thanks to federal incentives, Americans can still claim up to $840 off the cost of an induction range.

Renters or homeowners who are not ready to replace their stoves can start with smaller options, such as plug-in induction burners, which cost as little as $50.

Ultimately, while some federal tax credits are set to expire, appliance rebates will continue through 2031 or until funds are exhausted.

Acting sooner rather than later could translate to thousands of dollars in savings — and a more comfortable, efficient, climate-friendly home.

Whether it's an induction stove or a simple plug-in burner, small changes in the kitchen can make a big difference for your health, your wallet, and the planet.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/kitchen-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:01:39.396824

The projects will be spread across Kutch, Banaskantha, and Surendranagar districts—regions well-suited for renewable energy generation due to their vast land availability and favorable climatic conditions. Planned for commissioning between 2027 and 2030, these initiatives will significantly contribute to Gujarat’s sustainable growth, energy independence, and long-term carbon reduction goals.

Strengthening Gujarat’s Green Energy Footprint

Avaada already has a strong presence in Gujarat’s renewable energy landscape. The company is currently operating a 280 MW solar power project in Surendranagar and a 100 MW solar plant in Vadodara. With the new investments, Avaada aims to expand its footprint while reinforcing its role as a key partner in India’s renewable energy mission. The integration of battery energy storage systems will enhance grid stability. It will also improve the management of intermittent renewable generation, ensuring a reliable and efficient power supply.

Driving Jobs, Growth, and Sustainability

Beyond clean energy generation, Avaada’s projects will bring significant socio-economic benefits to Gujarat. The renewable energy expansion is expected to create over 1,000 direct and 2,000 indirect jobs, alongside 5,000 employment opportunities during the construction phase. The large-scale investment supports the state’s push for green industrial development. It also aims to attract private capital and promote sustainable livelihoods.

Reinforcing India’s Clean Energy Goals

The partnership between Avaada and the Gujarat government reflects India’s push toward renewable energy. It aligns with the National Green Hydrogen Mission and the 2070 net-zero target. By integrating solar, wind, and storage, Avaada’s initiative exemplifies the next generation of hybrid renewable projects capable of delivering both energy security and environmental resilience. As reported by projectstoday.com, India continues to scale up its renewable capacity. Collaborations like this show how public-private partnerships can drive transformative change, delivering cleaner energy, greener jobs, and a more sustainable future.",https://chemindigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Avaada-to-Invest-₹36000-Crore-in-Renewable-Energy-Projects-Across-Gujarat.png,N,,2025-10-11 03:59:02.141558

Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases.
They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.
Xu said he accepted the power line because it was an important national project, but he worried it might scare off visitors.","GUQUAN, China — In China, the longest ultrahigh-voltage power line stretches more than 2,000 miles from the far northwest to the populous southeast — the equivalent of transmitting electricity from Idaho to New York City.

The power line starts in a remote desert in northwest China, where vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines generate electricity on a monumental scale. It snakes southeast, following an ancient river between mountain ranges before reaching Anhui province near Shanghai, home to 61 million people and some of China’s most successful electric car and robot manufacturers.

That’s a single power line. China has 41 others. Each is capable of carrying more electricity than any utility transmission line in the United States. That’s partly because China is using technology that makes its lines far more efficient than almost anywhere else in the world. The feat is owed to China’s ambitious national energy policies and the fact that few residents along the path of these lines dare object — even though the lines emit static electricity that local people said they could feel when holding a metal fishing pole.

“As long as you don’t fish directly underneath the wires and keep the fishing line from getting tangled in the wires, it’s basically fine,” Shu Jie, an air conditioning repairman, said matter-of-factly, showing off a 6-inch fish he had just caught.

China’s aggressive embrace of clean energy technologies, at a faster pace than even its own government expected or planned, has left it with an unquenchable thirst for electricity. Half the country’s new cars are battery-powered, and the 30,000 miles of high-speed rail lines run on electricity. Wind and solar energy provided over a quarter of China’s power in April, a milestone that few other countries can brag about.

But much of that clean energy is produced in the country’s sunny, windy western and northern regions, far from most of its people and factories. More than 90% of China’s 1.4 billion people live in the east, where cloudy days, windless nights and sluggish rivers limit the potential for clean energy. So to move the electricity to where it is needed most, China is urgently upgrading its power grid.

Beijing’s central planners, having underestimated the country’s swift adoption of solar and wind energy, are building the world’s first nationwide grid of ultrahigh-voltage power transmission lines.

Beijing’s expansion of its power grid contrasts sharply with President Donald Trump’s “Drill, baby, drill” approach of doubling down on fossil fuels and rolling back federal programs to spur greater use of clean energy.

In July, the Energy Department terminated its commitment to provide a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for construction of the Grain Belt Express power line to take wind power from Kansas to cities in Illinois and Indiana. That 800-mile ultrahigh-voltage line, which would have covered a shorter distance than dozens of lines already built in China, ran into criticism from rural landowners and Republican lawmakers.

Even before Trump took office, other renewable energy projects in the United States had to wait as long as 17 years for permits to be approved for transmission lines running a few hundred miles.

Many of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines use direct current technology, which allows them to carry electricity for long distances with barely any of the transmission losses that affect most high-power lines in other countries.

China’s more efficient power lines have broad consequences for the global race against climate change. They will help determine how quickly China can reduce its world-leading use of coal, a stain on the country’s clean energy track record. China uses as much coal as the entire rest of the world, and emits more greenhouse gases than the United States and the European Union combined.

The more advanced power grid is starting to address a central problem facing China’s energy planners. In its western regions, where the weather is favorable for solar, wind and hydroelectric power, China produces more renewable energy than it can use.

Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, set a goal in 2020 of tripling the country’s capacity to generate wind and solar energy by 2030. The country reached that mark last year — six years ahead of schedule.

The country’s government-owned electricity transmission giant, State Grid, was caught unprepared.

“State Grid is good at building things, but not six years ahead,” said David Fishman, an electricity consultant in Shanghai.

In some recent months, a tenth of China’s wind and solar capacity has gone unused partly because the grid was unable to move all the power generated.

“To improve the power system’s ability to absorb new energy, we must accelerate the construction of power grid projects supporting new energy,” Du Zhongming, electricity director of the National Energy Administration in China, said at a news conference last year.

China already consumes twice as much electricity as the United States. By 2050, China plans to triple its count of ultrahigh-voltage routes.

The most recent public Chinese data, from the end of 2024, showed 19 lines transmitting power at 800 kilovolts. Another 22 lines operated at 1,000 kilovolts. One of them, the behemoth terminating in Guquan, transmits enough electricity at 1,100 kilovolts to power more than 7 million American households or 40 million to 50 million Chinese households.

To put the scale of China’s power grid build-out in perspective, consider that the United States has a handful of 765-kilovolt lines and a few running at 500 kilovolts or less, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit research group. The 765-kilovolt lines together total about 2,000 miles — the length of a single line across China.

The Soviet Union built a power line in Central Asia that was designed to operate at 1,150 kilovolts. But it used less powerful equipment and has not run at full tilt for decades.

The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis. The central government approved enormous investments in their construction to create jobs and head off an economic slowdown. China’s leaders staked ambitious plans for electric vehicles and high-speed rail lines around the same time.

In March 2011, the construction of ultrahigh-voltage lines gained further momentum from the partial meltdown of three nuclear reactors after an earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, Japan. Beijing delayed many prospective nuclear reactors, which had been planned near cities, and doubled down on transmission lines from remote areas.

Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases. A University of Chicago analysis of satellite data, released in August, found that air pollution in China had plunged 41% since 2014. That added almost two years to the country’s average life expectancy.

Beijing, once notorious for smog, mostly stopped burning coal for electricity in 2020 and now relies partly on wind power delivered from hundreds of miles away.

China’s ultrahigh-voltage network has helped the country limit its dependence on imported oil and natural gas, but it has also created new vulnerabilities. Much of northwestern China, where many of the lines are being built, is mountainous. As a result, lines had to be closely bunched as they hug a single, flood-prone tributary of the Yellow River that passes between earthquake-prone mountain ranges from Dunhuang to Lanzhou in Gansu province.

For decades, countries have talked about building power lines similar to China’s. They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.

China can build faster because of its top-down industrial planning, government control of information, and intolerance for public dissent.

Some villagers in Anhui province living near China’s longest ultrahigh-voltage line said they had reservations about the line, although they did not try to stop its construction.

The line carries mostly solar and wind energy, as well as some coal-fired power, from the Gurbantünggüt Desert in Xinjiang. It helps supply electricity to big eastern Chinese cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing.

Xu Shicai, a farm manager in Xuchong, a village next to lines that pass within 30 yards of homes, expressed concern.

“When you hold an umbrella in the rain, sparks will fly from it, and you’ll feel numb,” he said. “When fishing, it’s hard to hold the pole under the wires, as your hands feel very numb.”

The village’s small fish pond lies directly under the power lines. A “no fishing” sign has a cartoon of a skeleton being electrocuted and a graphic photo of a badly burned man who was apparently electrocuted. But Xu and other residents said that did not stop many villagers from fishing because the pond was so close by.

Xu said he accepted the power line because it was an important national project, but he worried it might scare off visitors. “I’m used to it now,” he said. “But honestly, we don’t want more lines built here.”

Starting in November 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, the stock market took off and now sits at record highs, following three years of double-digit gains. Solomon warned that some of the current AI frenzy was similar to the dot-com mania of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Most investors recall the incredible sell-off that followed almost five years of seemingly endless new highs for the stock market, before the bubble burst on March 10, 2000, and bottomed out in October of 2002. The Goldman Sachs leader warns that a “drawdown” (another term for a sell-off) could occur in the next 12 to 24 months. With a vast window like that, there is an excellent chance he will be proven right.

Founded in 1869, Goldman Sachs is the world’s second-largest investment bank by revenue and is ranked 55th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue. The Wall Street white-glove giant offers financing, advisory services, risk distribution, and hedging for the firm’s institutional and corporate clients. We review the firm’s Conviction List of top stock ideas every month, seeking companies that offer the highest dividends and have the safest investment profile. Four current picks are ideal for investors concerned about the potential for a “drawdown” over the next one to two years, which seems likely given the current lofty levels at which the stock market is trading.

Why we recommend Goldman Sachs stocks

Goldman Sachs is the acknowledged leader in the investment landscape on Wall Street and worldwide. The firm’s top-notch research department continues to provide institutional and high-net-worth clients with the best ideas across the investment spectrum. It is likely to continue doing so for years. While the firm states it is not yet time to worry about a tech bubble, it is likely high time to prepare for one. They said this recently:

There are elements of investor behavior and market pricing currently that resemble previous bubbles, including the rise in absolute valuations, high market concentration, increased capital intensity among leading companies, and the emergence of vendor financing. However, we see key differences: First, the appreciation of the technology sector has been driven by fundamental growth rather than irrational speculation about future growth. Second, the leading companies that have seen the strongest returns have robust balance sheets. Third, the AI space has, so far, been dominated by a few incumbents; most bubbles form during a period of intense competition as both investors and new entrants flood into the space.

Ken Paxton walked onto the stage with a pyrotechnic introduction.

Hundreds of young faces at the Texas Youth Summit, held outside of Houston last month, stared at Paxton as he boasted about the more than 120 combined lawsuits he filed against former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He recounted the obstacles he has overcome since becoming Texas attorney general a decade ago, including a historic impeachment that concluded with his acquittal. The crowd cheered.

He then made his pitch to unseat U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who Paxton said has been in office since the 62-year-old was in college.

“I just decided, you know what? It's time that we have representation in Washington that will fight for us,” Paxton said to a roar of approval. “We deserve somebody that will fight for our constitutional rights.”

Paxton’s speech was among a series of recent stops the attorney general has made in front of young Republicans, a group that’s riding a surge in political momentum in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Paxton and other Republican candidates vying for one of Texas’ two U.S. Senate seats are trying to tap into that energy to gain an edge in the wide-open contest, betting that Kirk's killing will galvanize turnout among a voting bloc that usually stays home during primaries.

In the last few weeks, Paxton said he would “look into” Texas Christian University for allegedly canceling an event with an anti-trans influencer, even though the school has said the event was never booked in the first place. This week, he spoke at a packed rally held by the Texas Tech University chapter of Turning Point USA, the group Kirk founded when he was 18

He’s also the only Texan scheduled to speak at America Fest, Turning Point’s annual marquee event in December. He will share the stage with other grassroots GOP powerhouses like Donald Trump Jr., Steve Bannon and Kirk’s widow, Ericka.

Paxton “is special like President Trump in that he is the exception and not the rule,” said Christian Collins, a former congressional candidate and aide who founded the Texas Youth Summit in 2019.

Collins described Paxton as an accessible elected official who gave Collins his cellphone number the first time they met, and whom Collins often greets at events all over the state, where Paxton often speaks with activists and parents. “Ken Paxton is just a darling of the MAGA movement,” Collins said.

Still, Paxton is campaigning with a lot of baggage in tow. Despite emerging victorious in the political and legal battles he often brings up in front of audiences, some Republican strategists believe he could cost the party the Senate seat in a general election against a Democrat.

The accusations Paxton has weathered include committing securities fraud, abusing his office and having an extramarital affair.

The primary race also grew more crowded this week when U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Houston, announced his bid for Cornyn’s seat. Hunt is a former Army combat veteran, a rising Republican star and an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump. He is also courting young voters: He was among the speakers at the Texas Youth Summit, and his campaign pointed to events where he has spoken at schools in his district.

“Young people are the future of this country, and as the youngest candidate in the race for U.S. Senate in Texas, I will bring a fresh perspective to the Senate,” Hunt, 43, said in a statement.

Cornyn’s campaign noted the senator headlined the Texas Young Republicans Federation convention the same weekend that Paxton and Hunt spoke at the conference in The Woodlands.

“Sen. Cornyn spends considerable time with young conservative professionals around Texas,” campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiak said. “We will actively compete to win the votes of as many young Texas GOP primary voters as possible in this race.”

It remains to be seen whether the energy radiating through young conservatives in Texas and beyond will continue into the March primary and election day next year.

Texas’ young voters have historically made up a sliver of overall turnout in elections, including primaries, which are arguably the most important elections in Texas. While some years have seen voters under 30 sign up to vote in droves, they don’t always make it to the polls.

But Paxton and the other candidates may have good reason to believe that could change following Kirk’s killing on a Utah campus in early September.

Texas already has hundreds of Turning Point USA chapters, which help spur conservative activism, register voters and host events with GOP influencers and elected officials who fire up students and encourage them to continue their organizing.

The organization has received more than 120,000 inquiries since Kirk’s death to start new chapters across the nation, with a spokesperson recently saying, ""We are on the cusp of having a TPUSA or Club America chapter in every HS and college campus in America.""

“There is no question that Charlie Kirk's assassination tragically, yet poignantly, has been a turning point for America and especially for conservatives,” Mackowiak said.

The United States has announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, effective November 1, 2025, which will raise the overall tariff rate on Chinese imports to approximately 130%.

The announcement, made by President Donald Trump on October 10, through a Truth Social post, marks the sharpest escalation in US-China trade tensions since the original tariff war began in 2018.

GTRI stated ""The impact will be felt quickly. Prices of EVs, wind turbines, and semiconductor parts are expected to rise, while the U.S. will try to ""friend-shore"" its mineral supply chains to Australia, Vietnam, and Canada. China, meanwhile, is likely to redirect supplies toward its non-Western partners to strengthen alternative industrial networks"".

U.S. President Donald Trump has announced an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports, effective November 1, 2025. This is in addition to existing tariffs and comes in response to new export controls on rare earth minerals imposed by China, indispensable for US defence, electric vehicles, and clean-energy industries.

The GTRI report also noted that, given the strategic importance of rare earths to US industries, Washington may soon have little choice but to reach a new deal with Beijing. Unlike the US, which often acts before weighing economic consequences, China appears more deliberate and better prepared.

The report highlighted that America still depends heavily on China for electronics, textiles, footwear, white goods, and solar panels, leaving it exposed to retaliation.

As prices surge once the new tariffs take effect, President Trump could struggle to contain inflation and production costs. His tough-on-China strategy risks backfiring--hurting US consumers and undermining his broader economic agenda.

It stated, ""As prices surge once the new tariffs take effect, President Trump could struggle to contain inflation and production costs.""

For India, the report stated that no deal with the US is ever final.

ADVERTISEMENT

The much-publicised US-China ""Phase One"" trade deal of 2025, which capped US tariffs at 30 per cent and China's at 10 per cent, has already been overtaken by the new 100 per cent duty order.

GTRI suggested that India must negotiate carefully and on equal terms, ensuring reciprocity and preserving strategic autonomy.

It added that rather than relying on shifting U.S. promises, New Delhi should focus on building self-reliance in critical technologies and minerals.

GTRI noted that this will help insulate the economy from future trade shocks while allowing India to leverage its neutral position to strengthen ties with both Western and BRICS economies.

But unlike some domestic policies where this “swing” can be healthy, we cannot treat climate action as a partisan issue when there are global consequences.

The evidence is there–melting glaciers, rising sea levels, intensifying extreme weather. Climate change is accelerating, but instead of taking action, we have attached party identities to the issues and are now facing the consequences of political polarization.

Party issues create swings between administrations–these frequent reversals are what make our system of government unique. But unlike some domestic policies where this “swing” can be healthy, we cannot treat climate action as a partisan issue when there are global consequences.

I graduated from high school this spring, and while I just began studying political science, I am no expert yet. Already in my lifetime, I have noticed environmental changes in Iowa: frequent flooding, record temperatures, and extreme storms. That’s why I joined Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), a volunteer organization seeking bipartisan climate solutions through grassroots advocacy.

CCL’s neutral approach bridges many perceptions and concerns about climate policies, and one opportunity to exercise this is through lobbying. Thanks to fundraising led by Northeast Iowa’s CCL Chapter Leader Leslie Sand and a generous grant from the Northeast Iowa Peace and Justice Center, I have had the opportunity twice now to lobby Iowa’s members of Congress for bipartisan climate action.

During meetings with Reps. Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra and Sen. Chuck Grassley, our focus was on the role of clean energy and the global “clean energy race.” But policy compromise still felt out of reach because of a major national barrier: political parties.

Political polarization has national leaders trapped in rigid agendas. One reason for this could be because political identities have become a defining factor in political decisions and voting patterns through political polarization, both at an individual and party level, which encourage party-line votes. But another reason could be political pressure from party leaders or administrations to vote and act certain ways. This is a big problem, especially for climate policies.

Climate policies are urgent, but as work continues to find bipartisan solutions, our leaders seem to be drifting farther apart. Climate change does not care how you vote. It is our responsibility to remind our leaders to work together and prioritize bipartisan climate action.

Despite divisiveness within our current political environment, I remain optimistic. My conversations locally and in D.C. have changed how I approach climate change, and I believe that by working together, we can protect our future.

,Louisiana Environment,2025-10-11 05:17:50+00:00,New Orleans CityBusiness,Louisiana cancels another major coastal restoration project - New Orleans CityBusiness,"Wesley Muller, The Louisiana Illuminator, Wesley Muller, The Louisiana Illuminator",,,,,https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/blog/2025/10/10/louisiana-mid-breton-sediment-diversion-canceled/,"Louisiana officials have canceled another major coastal restoration project — the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion on the east bank of Plaquemines Parish.
It is the second major coastal restoration project Gov.
The state has over $8 billion set aside for coastal restoration projects.
Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of coast since 1932, according to the 2023 Coastal Master Plan.
“ … Canceling this project puts integral large-scale, sustainable coastal restoration years, or even decades, further out of reach.”","Louisiana officials have canceled another major coastal restoration project — the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion on the east bank of Plaquemines Parish.

Gordon Dove, chairman of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, confirmed to WVUE-TV Fox 8 Wednesday that the state will not continue the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion. The project would have channeled fresh water and sediment from the Mississippi River near Wills Point to the dying coastal marshes of Breton Sound.

It is the second major coastal restoration project Gov. Jeff Landry has shut down. He scrapped the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project in May even though $3 billion from the Deepwater Horizon settlement was available to complete the project and $560 million had already been spent. Construction hadn’t yet begun on the Mid-Breton project.

Both projects served as key initiatives in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan, which has been in place for nearly two decades. Although the state is currently operating other river diversions, they are smaller in scope and designed only to prevent saltwater intrusion — not restore land.

Landry’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon. He previously criticized the Mid-Barataria project for its rising costs and potential harm to oyster fisheries in that area.

Dove told WVUE the cost of Mid-Breton had ballooned from several hundred million dollars to an estimated $1.8 billion. The state has over $8 billion set aside for coastal restoration projects. The money came from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement.

Coastal marshland serves as a natural storm barrier against hurricanes and soaks up rain and flood waters. It also creates habitat for fish and wildlife and absorbs air pollution.

Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of coast since 1932, according to the 2023 Coastal Master Plan. Scientists say the marsh is dying because it stopped receiving the nutrient-rich fresh water and sediment once levees were built to control flooding along the Mississippi River. Rising sea levels brought about by climate change have made the situation worse, the plan stated.

Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, criticized the state’s decision in a news release Thursday, saying it goes against accepted science and the interests of Louisiana residents.

Cancelling the project could also place other coastal restoration efforts in jeopardy. Restore spokesman Charles Sutcliffe pointed out that other initiatives in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan, such as marsh building projects, rely on the sediment diversions for their long-term sustainability.

Dredging and marsh creation projects left in the plan are going to sink and erode without a consistent source of fresh water and sediment, Sutcliffe added. He questioned the point of having a Coastal Master Plan that many stakeholders agreed on if one person can decide “behind closed doors” to cancel its biggest projects at any time.

The state’s Coastal Master Plan represents years of bipartisan work and investments from government officials, scientists, business owners, residents and engineers. The Mid-Breton project was added to the plan in 2007.

“This cancellation disregards the decades of transparency and significant effort that went into research, permitting, community engagement and modeling for the project,” Restore said in a news release. “ … Canceling this project puts integral large-scale, sustainable coastal restoration years, or even decades, further out of reach.”",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/10/6.-Mid-Breton-WVUE.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 09:59:24.651717

The two current inflection points are military pay and the fact that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is unlikely to acquiesce, given the “No Kings” events scheduled for October 18.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) is no longer allowing Minority Leader Schumer to file cloture on the Democrat CR (S.2882), meaning it will no longer be regularly voted on. This leaves the Republican House-backed CR (H.R. 5371) as the only option forward. The Democrats have one more reconsideration left for their CR, which they may bring forward at any time.

Today, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) announced there will be more rescissions coming. Rescissions are the formal process of rolling back funding that Congress has already appropriated. There have been two rescissions so far this term, at the request of the White House. The first was a Congressionally approved rescission of $9 billion in funding, and the second was a “pocket rescission” of $4 billion, the nature of which allowed for the side-stepping of Congressional approval. The introduction of another rescission could push lawmakers even further away from an agreement on reopening the government.

Reductions in Force

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted on social media that reductions-in-force (RIFs) have begun. In response, Leader Thune said, “I think they held off as long as they could.” As promised, the layoffs are coming from not-yet-specified “Democrat programs” across nine agencies, including the Department of the Interior, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of the Treasury, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It appears that it is primarily currently furloughed employees who are receiving RIFs.

Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) has spoken out against Director Vought’s mass layoffs, saying she “strongly opposes [the] attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown caused by Senator Schumer.” Many details are still unfolding. Here is what has surfaced so far:

HHS employees received a memo stating that the RIFs are “a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown.”

The only specified number of layoffs at this time is 1,300 workers from the Department of the Treasury.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been specifically identified for layoffs within DHS, but it is unclear if that is the only program within the agency that will face personnel cuts.

The world is aiming to develop a more cooperative narrative in the energy sector as it deals with the substantial shift in the energy sector.

Gulf energy heavyweights are raking in billions by fostering international investment in their energy industries

The Gulf region has long been the envy of other high-energy usage countries around the world. They have vast amounts of natural resources that have enabled the countries in the region to become heavyweights in the boxing ring of the global economy.

The economic boom that is currently unfolding in the region can be attributed to the fact that the Gulf nations are selling off minority stakes in huge projects that deliver substantial financial returns.

Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, and other huge energy companies have raised astronomical sums of money by offloading minority stakes of their pipeline and infrastructure businesses to global investors.

The appetite for cash-generating, stable assets in the region is on the rise, evidenced by ADNOC’s $10.1 billion pipeline sale and Aramco’s $15.5 billion deal. Several buyers, including energy giant BlackRock, can rely on long-term financial returns that are sustainable and strengthen the Gulf nation’s energy companies’ financial footprint in the sector.

BlackRock is among several international companies aiming to expand their presence in the Gulf region, along with KKR and Brookfield, with BlackRock even setting up shop in Kuwait. The International Monetary Fund has noted that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is essential for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to shift away from over-reliance on hydrocarbon revenues and develop new, non-hydrocarbon sectors.

Gulf firms are turning their infrastructure into funding powerhouses in the current trend unfolding

The current trend of huge energy companies in the Gulf region selling off assets to bring in foreign investment is not limited to one nation, with the trend spreading from the UAE to Bahrain. The hope would be for the recent shift in the region to inspire other energy-rich regions in the world to follow the example set by the Gulf nations.

As the world is aiming to shift away from conventional energy generation towards the renewable energy sector, the cornerstone of the global energy industry is raking in billions of dollars, evidenced by the recent litany of deals taking place in the Gulf region.

Global industry insiders have praised the shift in the Gulf region regarding substantial foreign investments.

“To accelerate the region’s transformation and fulfill the GCC governments’ extensive economic goals, substantial private foreign investment is essential. The continued growth of the region’s economies could unlock considerable foreign direct investment (FDI) as international firms are keen to be a part of the region’s economic growth.” – Ernst & Young Global Limited

They’re also worsening tensions among administration officials responsible for all the chopping.

Last week, the Trump administration canceled about $8 billion in clean energy grants — mostly in Democratic states and districts — appearing to fulfill Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s promise to rein in Biden-era spending on wind, solar, battery and other energy technology he considers a “bridge to nowhere.”

But then a new, unconfirmed list of additional cuts surfaced, adding billions of dollars more to the potential total. Many of those newly targeted projects are in red states and districts, causing a week of confusion and heartburn on Capitol Hill. The fallout inside the White House and DOE could be even worse, Sophia Cai and Ben Lefebvre report.

“It’s toxic af over there,” one person who works with senior DOE staff told POLITICO via text. “The boys are fighting.”

The White House initially pushed back on Wright’s summer plan to cut grants, arguing that some of the funding could serve as leverage in negotiations with Congress and states, one administration official told Sophia and Ben. In other cases, an industry representative said, the White House wanted Wright to cancel projects he hoped to preserve.

Rival factions

The disagreement has heightened internal divisions at DOE, where rival factions are clashing over process and priorities, possibly delaying the release of a final list of projects on the chopping block.

Meanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill are still defending the administration amid the broader uncertainty of the government shutdown. “What’s happened is the White House has to make some very serious and difficult decisions,” Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the Republican whip, said at a Friday press conference when asked about the cuts.

It remains unclear how long the Trump administration and DOE can hold off a public revolt within their own ranks. Republicans are already under fire from Democrats over the government shutdown. And today the White House said it is making good on its promise to start firing more government workers, including at the Environmental Protection Agency and DOE (its so-called “reduction-in-force” plans).

Fresh backlash from constituents over canceled energy projects could add to their political headache.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), for example, told POLITICO’s Morning Energy this week that he’s pressing DOE to “stick with the things that they said they would do in North Dakota” after both a hydrogen and carbon capture project in the state showed up on the list of potential cuts.

Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a key backer of the $925 million ARCH2 hydrogen hub in her state — another project on that list — said Thursday she’s still seeking clarity.

“DOE told me that the list is just a broad list; there’s no real intent to cancel all those projects,” Capito said. “But some may get canceled, so it’s still just unclear.”

Clash in Illinois over how to lower electricity bills

Illinois lawmakers are negotiating a wide-ranging bill aimed at mitigating rising electricity costs and building more grid-scale energy storage.

Democratic leaders and clean energy advocates blame White House antipathy toward clean energy and the state’s grid operator for what they’re now calling an energy affordability crisis, Jeffrey Tomich writes. Lawmakers supporting the legislation say they want to insulate the state from swings in federal energy policy.

“Thanks to Trump’s chaotic leadership, our clean energy economy and climate are at great risk,” said state Rep. Ann Williams, who heads the Illinois Green Caucus. “We have to take action here in Illinois.”

Some Republicans and large energy users, however, say some parts of the bill will only increase electricity prices.

“This is a significant rate increase on every consumer in Illinois, whether it’s a homeowner, a school, a church, a retailer or manufacturer,” said Mark Denzler, CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers Association.

Coal pollution rose during last shutdown

Some types of air pollution from coal plants increased during the previous government shutdown as companies “strategically” sidestepped environmental rules, according to new research.

The findings from researchers note that the types of pollutants that increased during the shutdown of 2018 and 2019 were monitored by people who had to collect samples. Other types of pollutants are monitored by devices that automatically send data to EPA — and those types didn’t rise substantially, Ariel Wittenberg writes.

The fear among researchers and advocates is that the same could happen today. EPA sent its first furlough notices to staff on Thursday.

“I can’t believe we are in exactly the same situation again,” said Neha Khanna, a professor of economics and environmental studies at Binghamton University in New York who co-authored the research on emissions.

BLM cancels North America’s largest solar project

The Trump administration’s cancellation of the largest solar project in North America has some industry observers fretting over the future of renewable energy on public lands, Scott Streater writes.

The Esmeralda 7 project encompassed seven solar power projects developed by NextEra Energy Resources, Leeward Renewable Energy, Arevia Power and Invenergy. It would have produced enough electricity to power nearly 2 million homes.

It had been one of a number of Nevada desert solar projects steadily advancing through regulatory review. Around 35 commercial-scale solar power projects that were under review by the Bureau of Land Management when Trump took office still await action.

That includes final environmental reviews for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project.

About Toyota Toyota (NYSE:TM) has been a part of the cultural fabric in the U.S. for nearly 70 years, and is committed to advancing sustainable, next-generation mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands, plus our nearly 1,500 dealerships.
In 2025, Toyota’s plant in North Carolina began to assemble automotive batteries for electrified vehicles.","Clean energy milestones drive Toyota toward a carbon-neutral future

GEORGETOWN, Ky. (Oct. 10, 2025) – Toyota advanced its environmental sustainability efforts today with the launch of a new solar panel installation at its flagship manufacturing facility in Georgetown. The project was celebrated with a ribbon-cutting ceremony that brought together plant leadership, team members and community partners.

The nearly thirty-acre solar field marks a significant step forward in Toyota’s journey to reduce its carbon footprint and transition to renewable energy sources. The system is expected to generate approximately 15 million kilowatt hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power 1,400 average U.S. homes for a year.

“This project reflects our values and our commitment to being a good citizen,” said Chad Miller, vice president of manufacturing at Toyota Kentucky. “At Toyota, we believe in building more than just vehicles; we’re building a future. This solar installation is a powerful example of how we have aligned operations with our goals to reduce Toyota’s overall environmental footprint.”

The initiative supports Toyota’s broader environmental strategy, outlined in the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, including the goal of making all its manufacturing facilities carbon neutral by 2035.

Just as the automaker is known for the built-in quality of its vehicles, Ebonye Allen, environmental engineering manager at Toyota, emphasized the importance of working toward sustainability in every aspect of its operations. “This isn’t just about renewable energy, it’s about reaffirming our commitments. Namely, our commitment to being good neighbors in the communities where we have operations and creating a robust company culture of environmental sustainability.”

NextStar Energy: EV battery manufacturer

NextStar Energy was formed in 2022 as a joint venture between LG Energy Solution and Stellantis.

The company is advancing battery manufacturing with the goal of promoting sustainable mobility solutions.

NextStar aims to be Canada’s first large-scale lithium ion battery production plant with its site in Ontario.

Stellantis and LG Energy Solution invested more than CAD$5bn (US$4.1bn) to construct the facility, with support from the Canadian government.

Danies Lee, CEO of NextStar Energy, says: “This achievement is the direct result of a shared vision, effective partnership and incredible hard work of everyone involved.

“As we transition from construction to operations, I am deeply grateful for the collaboration between our partner companies LG Energy Solution and Stellantis, our construction partner Alberici-Barton Malow, the City of Windsor, the provincial and federal governments and all who have supported our project to be completed safely and on schedule.”

The NextStar Energy facility

Construction began on the site in November 2022 and it has meant that 9,000 Canadian trade workers have contributed more than 8.4 million work hours.

NextStar Energy has received its Occupancy Permit for the cell manufacturing plant.

The permit marks the completion of the facility’s construction and brings the company closer to starting its operations.

It plans to begin in-house production of cells by the end of 2025.

The facility’s core operations include electrode production, cell formation and assembly and module assembly.

It is planned to have an annual production capacity of more than 45 gigawatt hours and will produce a target of 2,500 new job opportunities in the surrounding areas.

The company is committed to using sustainable business practices, including protecting the environment, upholding human rights and using resources responsibly.

Its aim is to create shared value, promote social growth and build a sustainable future.

NextStar will support Stellantis’ Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan which aims to have more than 50% Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales in North America by the end of the decade.

About battery module production

NextStar Energy began battery module production in 2024 by using externally sourced cells.

As operations begin, in-house cells will be used to manufacture battery modules.

The modules are grouped together in a battery pack, which is then used to power electric vehicles.

The site features 11 buildings including two main manufacturing facilities and nine support buildings.

The manufacturing facilities are separated into Cell and Module production and the support buildings include a recycling centre and safety testing laboratory.

The Occupancy Permit means that the facility is fully approved for safe occupancy and it is ready for production to begin.

Drew Dilkens, the Mayor of Windsor, Ontario, says: “Completion of construction and the granting of the Occupancy Permit marks a major milestone for the game-changing NextStar Energy battery manufacturing facility in Windsor.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/c50d3e01bef6f6fde39c51ff7eb1cc08:13e5e6d6d25c49176f857b25a026a3d2/nextstar-energy.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:58:01.634760

The Texas Tribune is a member-supported, nonpartisan newsroom informing and engaging Texans on state politics and policy.","By Alejandro Serrano, The Texas Tribune

Ken Paxton walked onto the stage with a pyrotechnic introduction.

Hundreds of young faces at the Texas Youth Summit, held outside of Houston last month, stared at Paxton as he boasted about the more than 120 combined lawsuits he filed against former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He recounted the obstacles he has overcome since becoming Texas attorney general a decade ago, including a historic impeachment that concluded with his acquittal. The crowd cheered.

He then made his pitch to unseat U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who Paxton said has been in office since the 62-year-old was in college.

“I just decided, you know what? It’s time that we have representation in Washington that will fight for us,” Paxton said to a roar of approval. “We deserve somebody that will fight for our constitutional rights.”

Paxton’s speech was among a series of recent stops the attorney general has made in front of young Republicans, a group that’s riding a surge in political momentum in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Paxton and other Republican candidates vying for one of Texas’ two U.S. Senate seats are trying to tap into that energy to gain an edge in the wide-open contest, betting that Kirk’s killing will galvanize turnout among a voting bloc that usually stays home during primaries.

In the last few weeks, Paxton said he would “look into” Texas Christian University for allegedly canceling an event with an anti-trans influencer, even though the school has said the event was never booked in the first place. This week, he spoke at a packed rally held by the Texas Tech University chapter of Turning Point USA, the group Kirk founded when he was 18

He’s also the only Texan scheduled to speak at America Fest, Turning Point’s annual marquee event in December. He will share the stage with other grassroots GOP powerhouses like Donald Trump Jr., Steve Bannon and Kirk’s widow, Ericka.

Paxton “is special like President Trump in that he is the exception and not the rule,” said Christian Collins, a former congressional candidate and aide who founded the Texas Youth Summit in 2019.

Collins described Paxton as an accessible elected official who gave Collins his cellphone number the first time they met, and whom Collins often greets at events all over the state, where Paxton often speaks with activists and parents. “Ken Paxton is just a darling of the MAGA movement,” Collins said.

Still, Paxton is campaigning with a lot of baggage in tow. Despite emerging victorious in the political and legal battles he often brings up in front of audiences, some Republican strategists believe he could cost the party the Senate seat in a general election against a Democrat.

The accusations Paxton has weathered include committing securities fraud, abusing his office and having an extramarital affair.

The primary race also grew more crowded this week when U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Houston, announced his bid for Cornyn’s seat. Hunt is a former Army combat veteran, a rising Republican star and an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump. He is also courting young voters: He was among the speakers at the Texas Youth Summit, and his campaign pointed to events where he has spoken at schools in his district.

“Young people are the future of this country, and as the youngest candidate in the race for U.S. Senate in Texas, I will bring a fresh perspective to the Senate,” Hunt, 43, said in a statement.

Cornyn’s campaign noted the senator headlined the Texas Young Republicans Federation convention the same weekend that Paxton and Hunt spoke at the conference in The Woodlands.

“Sen. Cornyn spends considerable time with young conservative professionals around Texas,” campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiak said. “We will actively compete to win the votes of as many young Texas GOP primary voters as possible in this race.”

It remains to be seen whether the energy radiating through young conservatives in Texas and beyond will continue into the March primary and election day next year.

Texas’ young voters have historically made up a sliver of overall turnout in elections, including primaries, which are arguably the most important elections in Texas. While some years have seen voters under 30 sign up to vote in droves, they don’t always make it to the polls.

But Paxton and the other candidates may have good reason to believe that could change following Kirk’s killing on a Utah campus in early September.

Texas already has hundreds of Turning Point USA chapters, which help spur conservative activism, register voters and host events with GOP influencers and elected officials who fire up students and encourage them to continue their organizing.

The organization has received more than 120,000 inquiries since Kirk’s death to start new chapters across the nation, with a spokesperson recently saying, “We are on the cusp of having a TPUSA or Club America chapter in every HS and college campus in America.”

“There is no question that Charlie Kirk’s assassination tragically, yet poignantly, has been a turning point for America and especially for conservatives,” Mackowiak said.

Ming Yang said the £1.5bn project would create up to 1,500 jobs, with the first production taking place by late 2028.

The firm, which is the largest private wind turbine manufacturer in China, has shortlisted the green freeport site at Ardersier as its preferred location for the facility.

Ming Yang said it would invest up to £750m in the first phase of its investment before expanding to create an ""offshore wind industry ecosystem"" around the hub.

It has been in talks with the Scottish and UK governments over the past two years.

The firm's UK chief executive, Aman Wang said: ""We firmly believe that by moving forward with our plans to create jobs, skills and a supply chain in the UK, we can make this country the global hub for offshore wind technology.

""We fully support the government's mission to become a clean energy superpower, and I'm confident that once the plans are approved we can make a valued contribution to this goal.""

But a Conservative MP has previously questioned the wisdom of letting the company invest in the UK.

Last November, MP Nick Timothy asked UK energy minister Michael Shanks about Ming Yang's plans to invest in Scotland, saying the government should rule out investment from ""hostile states"".

Timothy said Ming Yang ""benefits from huge subsidies in China,"" adding any investment was subject to ""serious questions about energy and national security"".

The UK government's Energy Secretary, Michael Shanks, said he would ""encourage investment"".

In a statement released on Friday, a UK government spokesperson said: ""This is one of a number of companies that wants to invest in the UK.

""Any decisions made will be consistent with our national security.""

A Scottish government spokesperson welcomed the news that Ardersier had been chosen as Ming Yang's preferred location for investment.

""This port is strategically important to the growth and success of the offshore wind sector,"" they said.

913 provides a measure of “regulatory housekeeping,” removing certain obsolete or duplicative provisions and seeking to make the regulations more consistent with current FERC practice.","In short, not much.

On October 1, 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) issued Order No. 913 (the “Order”) as a Direct Final Rule implementing Executive Order 14270, “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy.”

The Order targets 53 outdated, “seldomly used,” or duplicative regulations, inserting conditional sunset provisions that will phase them out one year after the rule’s effective date—unless FERC extends the deadline by up to five years after soliciting and considering public comments on the costs and benefits of the regulations. The Order takes effect 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Two changes in particular apply to (1) certain transmission service applicants and (2) entities seeking to self-certify their exempt wholesale generator (“EWG”) or foreign utility company (“FUCO”) status. These changes will not impact any substantive requirements for these entities but will slightly relax the filing process by eliminating language regarding providing a form of notice of such filings.

18 C.F.R. § 36.1(b)(1) – Transmission Service Application Notices

Section 36.1(b)(1) of FERC’s regulations currently requires an applicant seeking transmission service under Section 211 of the Federal Power Act to include with its application a form of notice of the application suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the requirements of Section 385.203(d) of FERC’s regulations. That section, in turn, requires a “draft notice in accordance with the form of notice specifications prescribed by the Secretary and posted on the Commission’s website under Filing Procedures.”

Change:

This subsection will automatically sunset one year after the effective date of the Order unless extended. Once sunsetted, applicants for Section 211 transmission services will no longer be bound by this notice requirement.

Impact:

Applications under Section 211 require a notice containing information about the transmission service requested and the facilities involved be provided to the parties potentially affected by the request, such as the transmission facilities owner, the relevant ISO/RTO, the interconnecting utility, and the state’s public utility commission. These requirements are set forth in Section 36.1(b)(2) of FERC’s regulations and are not changing. However, eliminating the form of notice requirement under Section 36.1(b)(1) will streamline the application process and relieve the filers from the requirement to follow an older notice format.

18 C.F.R. § 366.7 – EWG and FUCO Filings

Section 366.7 of FERC’s regulations outlines procedures for obtaining EWG or FUCO status. Similarly to Section 36.1(b), Sections 366.7(a) and (b) require entities seeking to obtain EWG or FUCO status – either through a notice of self-certification or a petition for a declaratory order – to include a form of notice suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the specifications of Section 385.203(d) of FERC’s regulations.

Change:

These mandatory Federal Register form of notice provisions in Sections 366.7(a) and (b) will automatically sunset one year after the effective date of the rule unless extended.

Impact:

This change has limited practical significance. FERC previously provided guidance that, at least in connection with a notice of self-certification of EWG or FUCO status, a form of notice is no longer required, stating that “[a]lthough the Commission’s regulations specify that a notice of self-certification should include a form of notice of the filing suitable for publication in the Federal Register, 18 C.F.R. § 366.7(a), it is no longer necessary to submit this form of notice.” However, removing this requirement from the regulations will align them with FERC’s current practice and will reduce confusion among filers.

Bottom Line:

A response to a broader deregulatory push by the current administration to reduce unnecessary compliance burdens, Order No. 913 provides a measure of “regulatory housekeeping,” removing certain obsolete or duplicative provisions and seeking to make the regulations more consistent with current FERC practice. With respect to Section 211 transmission service requests and EWG and FUCO filings, the Order does not change any of the substantive requirements for such filings, but removes the form of notice requirement from FERC’s regulations, thus simplifying and modernizing the regulations and, perhaps in some cases, streamlining the filing process.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14205_3939.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 03:59:06.891531

Following years of hints and pricing teases, EV giant Tesla just showed off its lower-cost trims, designed to drive volume without disrupting the lineup.

The market reaction, though, was immediate and surprisingly mixed, reflecting the tension between list prices and perceived step-up in value.

A quick read on Tesla's lower-cost options:

Models/prices: Model 3 at $36,990; Model Y at $39,990.

Hardware/software: Familiar packages marked by incremental updates through Tesla’s over-the-air updates.

Target buyer: First-time EV shoppers backed by fleet and mass-market channels.

First read: Stock is down 4% on launch day.

Despite the drop, though, Tesla stock is in the green year-to-date, while its three-month performance is even more impressive at 47%.

Over the past few months, its tape has turned explosive, following a steady spring rally as shares ripped through Q3, capped by September’s 35% moonshot. Stacking the last six months, the incredible run clocks in at roughly 90% on compounded math.

That’s where longtime Tesla bull and veteran tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush drops in with a healthy new target, and a caveat. He didn’t mince words on the budget EV development, but did drop an explosive new price target. However, the upside pivots on a different engine of value entirely.

Dan Ives hikes Tesla target but slams “uninspired” budget EVs

Wedbush tech analyst Daniel Ives didn't hold back on Tesla’s new low-cost models, calling them “relatively disappointing,” stating that the features and pricing fall short of sparking fresh demand.

Tesla’s latest move was intended to offset the loss of U.S. EV tax credits and revitalize deliveries toward a 500,000-unit quarterly run rate. Instead, the market yawned, and investors are viewing the trims as a $5,000 markdown instead of a true product refresh.

Ives called it more of a “pricing tactic, not a catalyst,” arguing the models genuinely lack differentiation and come at a time when BYD, Nio, and XPeng are gobbling up Tesla’s lunch in global EV sales.

Surprisingly, however, he maintained his buy rating and reaffirmed his Street-high $600 price target, implying a massive 37% upside from current levels, based on Tesla’s AI and autonomy pipeline.

He points to the successful June launch of Tesla’s Robotaxi service in Austin, early traction for Full Self-Driving version 14, and AI-trained humanoid robots driving the company’s real valuation drivers.

In his view, Tesla’s next leg of expansion has less to do with it cutting stickier prices and more to do with proving its software is worth a premium that the rest of the market can’t match.

Quick takeaways:

Ives unimpressed: Wedbush’s Daniel Ives called Tesla’s new Model 3 and Model Y “relatively disappointing,” saying that pricing tweaks won’t drive new demand.

Market reaction: Shares fell 4% on launch day, with investors viewing the rollout as a simple markdown on the back of cutthroat competition from BYD, Nio, and XPeng.

AI remains the bet: Ives still backs Tesla’s AI future and keeps a buy rating with a $600 target (37% upside).

Chinese rivals are outrunning Tesla on 2025 deliveries

China’s EV heavyweights are setting a blistering tone as they continue widening their lead over Tesla.

For perspective, EV front-runner BYD sold 396,270 new-energy vehicles (NEVs) in September, up 6% sequentially, while capping Q3 at 1.11 million units as it shifted further toward pure EVs. Through September, the company’s year-to-date tally stands at an eye-catching 3.26 million, well ahead of every global rival.

XPeng is also surging from a smaller base, posting a record 41,581 September deliveries (+95% year over year, +10% sequentially) and 116,007 units in Q3 (a 149% jump from last year). As it stands, the EV upstart’s nine-month total of 313,196 already dwarfs 2024’s full-year output.

On top of that, Nio isn’t far behind, delivering 34,749 vehicles in September (up 64% year over year) and 87,071 in Q3 (up 41% year over year), both records that underscore the company’s turnaround in volumes and momentum.

Tesla hit a record 497,099 global deliveries in Q3, but its lead is shrinking quickly. In 2025 volumes, BYD’s roughly 1.6 million pure EVs outpaced Tesla’s near 1.2 million, a clear reversal of leadership in global all-electric sales.

Looking at the most recent stretch, the pattern is just as clear.

BYD delivered nearly 770,000 vehicles across August and September combined, while XPeng strung together three consecutive monthly records (36,000 in July, 37,709 in August, and 41,581 in September).

Similarly, Nio climbed steadily as its deliveries came in at 21,017 in July, 31,305 in August, and 34,749 in September.

Each company is marching forward with aplomb into the final quarter, posting superb gains that highlight how quickly China’s EV ecosystem is growing compared with Tesla’s steadier pace.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/t_share/MjEzNjIxNjQwMjU5NDQ2MjIz/elon-musk-not-happy.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 22:59:42.429879

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT TO PROTECT CLIMATE AND DEMOCRACY

STATE NEWS

STATES ADVANCE CLEAN ENERGY AMIDST FEDERAL ATTACKS: As Donald Trump and congressional Republicans attack clean energy, state leaders are enacting policies to advance clean energy, which will lower energy costs and pollution. Across the nation, state and local leaders are taking legislative and executive action to protect the environment, lower utility bills, and reduce pollution.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of State Policy and Advocacy Bill Holland said, “State and local leaders continue to provide a different path focused on deploying clean energy at scale, reducing pollution, and lowering utility bills. In recent weeks, we’ve seen actions like California governor Gavin Newsom’s executive order to speed up clean energy projects eligible for federal Inflation Reduction Act tax credits before they expire, and New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherril’s No Rate Hikes pledge that she made on the campaign trail last month. These actions follow months of significant steps taken at the state level to build renewables and protect ratepayers around the country.

“In partnership with groups across the country, the League of Conservation Voters’ state affiliates in the Conservation Voter Movement have rallied the public and won meaningful progress nationwide. Together, they understand that our collective response has never been more important. State action is critical to not only hold the line against federal attacks, but to keep the country moving forward on climate.”

STATES STAND UP FOR DEMOCRACY AGAINST AUTHORITARIANISM: As the Trump administration attempts to dismantle our democracy at the federal level, LCV partners in the Conservation Voters Movement (CVM) are working overtime to secure major democracy victories in the states. From legal protections for voters of color to fighting partisan gerrymandering, states continue to make progress to protect voting rights and fight authoritarianism.

OUR TAKE: LCV State Democracy Policy Senior Director Amanda Gnaedinger said, “States across the country are fighting to defend a free and fair democracy. Our best course of action for a stronger democracy is to not only protect fundamental freedoms, but expand democracy so it is a responsive and trusted institution for all people—no matter their race, income, ability, or zip code. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) along with over 30 state partners, collectively called the Conservation Voters Movement (CVM), has worked this year to successfully secure legal protections for voters, lessen the damage of Trump’s Project 2025 agenda, and slow the creep of authoritarianism into state legislatures in state houses around the country.

“The relentless attacks on our communities and freedoms coincide with environmental and energy policies that are leading to higher costs, more pollution, and more extreme weather. These challenges cannot be solved through advocacy if we are left with an unresponsive, unrepresentative democracy. Therefore, in order for everyone to enjoy clear air and water, public lands, and affordable clean energy, we must all rise to make sure our government can hear us, protect us, and reflect us all.”

INDIANA RALLIES AGAINST PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING: Vice President J.D. Vance visited Indiana to pressure lawmakers to redraw congressional maps and eliminate the two seats held by Democrats. In response, Indiana Conservation Voters (ICV) held a rally to tell Indiana lawmakers: No mid-decade map meddling. ICV has led the charge over the past month in opposition to map manipulation, including early rallies and delivering thousands of petition signatures to legislative leadership.

ICV TAKE: Indiana Conservation Voters said, “Hoosiers have been more than clear on this issue over the past two months: We don’t want Washington outsiders telling us how to run our state. Attempts to redraw Indiana’s legislative maps in the middle of the decade are unfair, unnecessary and out of step with hard-working Hoosiers’ priorities.

“What’s more, they want to come into our state and tell us what to do with our legislative process while the federal government is shut down. Maybe they should just stay in Washington and clean up their own mess instead of disrupting our lives and our state with their political shenanigans.

“Indiana leaders should continue to reject this distraction from D.C. and stay focused on the real issues that matter to Hoosiers: inflation, energy costs and taxes.”

OREGON MOVES TO FAST TRACK CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS: Oregon Governor Tina Kotek signed an executive order to accelerate renewable energy projects before federal tax credits expire. The executive order will focus Oregon’s agencies to speed up its permitting process to complete energy projects that create jobs, build energy capacity, and lower costs.

OLCV TAKE: Oregon League of Conservation Voters said, “Federal tax credits for renewable energy projects will expire next year, due to the elimination of these incentives by the Trump Administration. However, thanks to Governor Tina Kotek’s Executive Order, Oregon will speed up its otherwise lengthy permitting process to get these projects underway before the deadline. This Executive Order defends Oregon families, family-wage jobs, and our state’s energy resilience. We’re glad to see Oregon leading, joining a handful of states who have sped up their processes as well.”

ARIZONA RALLIES COMMUNITY TO DEMAND ENERGY JUSTICE FROM APS: Chispa AZ and community members burdened by $300–$500 monthly bills and record-breaking heat gathered outside the Arizona Public Service (APS) substation wall to protest the utility’s latest proposed rate hikes. Organizers called out the company for fueling the climate crisis and shifting costs onto communities already most impacted.

CHISPA NEVADA HONORED WITH GREEN IMPACT AWARD: Chispa Nevada was honored with the Green Impact Award at the Nevada Conservation League’s Home Means Nevada 2025 Awards Dinner. The award recognizes locally rooted organizations leading the way on environmental and climate justice. Chispa NV was celebrated for its community-driven advocacy to ensure cleaner air, renewable energy, and a more equitable future for Nevada’s families.

NATIONAL NEWS

KAINE, HEINRICH MOVE TO END TRUMP’S SHAM ENERGY EMERGENCY: Senators Tim Kaine (VA) and Martin Heinrich (NM) reintroduced a resolution to terminate the sham Trump Energy Emergency order, which was designed to line the pockets of Big Oil rather than lowering energy costs. The resolution failed after senators voted along party lines.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Federal Advocacy Campaigns Director Leah Donahey said, “Democrats are fighting back to address rising costs by voting unanimously to reject Trump’s energy emergency order. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans continue to do the bidding of Big Oil at the expense of hardworking families. At a time when energy demand is increasing and costs are skyrocketing, we should be focused on deploying the cheapest and fastest energy – clean wind, solar, and batteries. Yet Trump and Republicans continue to cancel cheaper, faster, and more reliable clean energy projects daily. The Trump administration is determined to prioritize the agenda of billionaire CEOs by forcing expensive coal-fired plants to stay open, selling off our public lands to drilling and mining, and canceling clean energy initiatives. We applaud Senators Kaine and Heinrich for continuing to push back against Trump’s sham, which is designed only to line the pockets of Big Oil CEOs and put the health, affordability, and safety of our communities at risk. We are all in to continue fighting for clean energy incentives and projects that keep costs low and work for everyone.”

HOUSE DEMOCRATS CONDEMN CANCELLATION OF $8 BILLION IN ENERGY PROJECTS: Last week, the Trump administration and the Department of Energy announced the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in clean energy projects in politically targeted states. Over 160 House Democrats wrote a letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright condemning the likely illegal action, which will eliminate jobs, weaken our electric grids, and raise electricity prices.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS’ TAKE: From the letter, “This decision is a reversal of properly awarded projects that will harm American jobs, drive private capital out of our country, weaken our power grid, and give China a strategic edge. This Administration’s decision to play political games will result in genuine harm at a time when millions of American families are already struggling to pay their electricity bills amidst the everrising cost of living. These blatantly partisan cancellations must immediately be reversed.

“The projects that the Department of Energy (DOE) has unilaterally decided to cancel were driving down costs for all our constituents—regardless of their political affiliation. Household electric bills have already increased 10% nationally since January 2025 and are poised to spike even further. This Administration’s reckless energy policy and award terminations, designed to stifle the development of cheap clean energy and prop up more expensive dirty energy, will only further increase the cost burden for families to keep the lights on.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

TRUMP ADMIN ROLLS BACK PROTECTIONS FOR ALASKA WILDERNESS: President Trump signed an executive order approving the Ambler Road Project in Alaska. This decision opens up Alaska’s treasured public lands for mining, threatening local communities and the environment.

OUR TAKE: LCV Conservation Program Director America Fitzpatrick said, “While the government is shut down for the people, Trump is making sure it stays open for billionaire polluters. Approving the Ambler Road Project ignores science, years of engagement with Alaska Native communities, and public input. This reckless decision will harm the health of Alaska Native communities and their way of life and Alaska’s wildlife and treasured public lands of the Brooks Range and Gates of the Arctic. This is just the latest example of Trump continuing to give away our public lands despite the fact that these sell offs are deeply unpopular amongst the majority of people across the country.”

167 MILLION ACRES OF FEDERAL LANDS AUCTIONED OFF FOR COAL: The Trump administration hosted a coal lease sale in Montana auctioning off 167 million tons of coal on federal lands. The auction drew only one bid for $186,000, just one-tenth of a penny per ton of recoverable coal. Even taking into consideration the new cut rates for coal set by the Trump administration, the bid was rejected by BLM. This flop of a lease sale exemplifies that, in addition to damaging surrounding environments and public health, coal is inefficient and unpopular.

It is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.

He singled out the endangerment finding, as “the holy grail of the climate change religion” and said he was thrilled to end it.

The EPA also called for rescinding limits on tailpipe emissions that were designed to encourage automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US.

Three former EPA leaders have criticized Zeldin, saying his March proposal would endanger the lives of millions of Americans and abandon the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.

“If there’s an endangerment finding to be found anywhere, it should be found on this administration because what they’re doing is so contrary to what the Environmental Protection Agency is about,” Christine Todd Whitman, who led EPA under the Republican president George W Bush, said after Zeldin’s plan was made public.

The decision follows a similar move from General Motors on Wednesday. While automakers including Hyundai and Stellantis have offered cash off incentives to bridge the gap for buyers, Ford and GM took a different approach.

The in-house lending arms at these two automakers planned to initiate the purchase of EVs in dealers’ inventory, and the companies would apply for the $7,500 SU credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

As a result, Texas is moving forward once again with its Texas Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan, originally approved in 2022. The plan faced an uncertain future after the suspension of $5 billion in federal funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, which aims to make EV ownership more accessible by supporting robust charging infrastructure across the country.

The Texas plan remains largely the same following the freeze, but the federal level requirements and guidelines for the NEVI program as a whole have shifted slightly: states are no longer required to place chargers no less than 50 miles apart, and can decide individually what a reasonable distance is (though Texas has opted to stay true to the original guidelines, according to its own EV Infrastructure Plan). This change actually could aid in the acceleration of EV infrastructure adaptation in many states, as the 50 mile rule led to complications and slow downs during the first three years of the NEVI program.

The Federal Highway Administration also no longer requires states to factor in extreme weather evacuations in site placement or make an effort to benefit disadvantaged communities in their plans.

Texas to invest nearly half a billion in EV charging

According to Texas’ plan, Texas will invest over $400 million from the federal government and $77 million from the private sector to strategically place EV charging stations every 50 miles along interstate highways (deemed “Alternative Fuel Corridors”) during phase 1, and every 50-70 miles in some rural areas during phase 2. There are 84 planned interstate highway stations, supplemented by 34 Volkswagen-funded stations. Each station will feature a minimum of four DC fast-charging ports, capable of charging most EVs from 10% to 80% in just 30 minutes. To ensure accessibility, all stations will be located within one mile of the highway.

Looking ahead, the plan outlines a broader statewide expansion, aiming to bring EV charging infrastructure to rural counties, small urban areas, and Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs). A key feature includes placing at least one station at or near every county seat not already served by an interstate station, ensuring comprehensive geographic coverage, and tallying up to an additional 190 stations. These are expected to be built following the completion of all phase 1 stations.

For context, most low to mid-range EVs can travel 120–200 miles on an 80% charge. With stations spaced no more than 70 miles apart, Texans will be able to confidently traverse the state with minimal risk of running out of charge — a major step forward in making electric transportation practical across Texas.

Ten NEVI charging stations now operational in Texas

The first three NEVI charging stations in Texas were unveiled in December of 2024, and there are now 10 operational stations as of September 2025! For 15 more stations, construction is already underway or will begin shortly; at least eight new stations are expected to be completed and operational by the end of 2025. In addition, there are 44 stations currently in the planning stage. See below for a full list of open and under construction stations.

Since the 2020 fiscal year, the number of electric vehicles registered in Texas have increased by more than 9 times, increasing by 805% from 36,418 to 329,642. By 2028, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) estimates that there will be 1 million EVs on Texas roads. With electric vehicle adoption rates rapidly rising, accommodating the increasing demand is imperative.

,American Energy,2025-10-11 00:18:31+00:00,Heatmap News,The Fiscal Contradictions of Trump's Energy Policy - Heatmap News,Emily Pontecorvo,,,,,https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-energy-contradictions,"The Department of Energy justified terminating hundreds of congressionally-mandated grants issued by the Biden administration for clean energy projects last week (including for a backup battery at a children’s hospital) by arguing that they were bad investments for the American people.
The cost of operating a coal plant in the U.S. has increased by nearly 30% since 2021 — faster than inflation — according to research by Energy Innovation.
Driving that increase is the cost of coal itself, as well as the fact that the nation’s coal plants are simply getting very old and more expensive to maintain.
The Trump administration has also based its support for coal plants on the idea that they are needed for reliability.
In a report last year, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned that outage rates for coal plants are increasing.","The Department of Energy justified terminating hundreds of congressionally-mandated grants issued by the Biden administration for clean energy projects last week (including for a backup battery at a children’s hospital) by arguing that they were bad investments for the American people.

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the agency’s press release said.

It’s puzzling, then, that the Trump administration is pouring vast government resources into saving aging coal plants and expediting advanced nuclear projects — two sources of energy that are famously financial black holes.

The Energy Department announced it would invest $625 million to “reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry” in late September. Earlier this year, the agency also made $900 million available to “unlock commercial deployment of American-made small modular reactors.”

It’s hard to imagine what economic yardsticks would warrant funding to keep coal plants open. The cost of operating a coal plant in the U.S. has increased by nearly 30% since 2021 — faster than inflation — according to research by Energy Innovation. Driving that increase is the cost of coal itself, as well as the fact that the nation’s coal plants are simply getting very old and more expensive to maintain. “You can put all the money you want into a clunker, but at the end of the day, it’s really old, and it’s just going to keep getting more expensive over time, even if you have a short term fix,” Michelle Solomon, a program manager at Energy Innovation who authored the research, told me.

Keeping these plants online — even if they only operate some of the time— inevitably raises electricity bills. That’s because in many of the country’s electricity markets, the cost of power on any given day is determined by the most expensive plant running. On a hot summer day when everyone’s air conditioners are working hard and the grid operator has to tell a coal plant to switch on to meet demand, every electron delivered in the region will suddenly cost the same as coal, even if it was generated essentially for free by the sun or wind.

The Trump administration has also based its support for coal plants on the idea that they are needed for reliability. In theory, coal generation should be available around the clock. But in reality, the plants aren’t necessarily up to the task — and not just because they’re old. Sandy Creek in Texas, which began operating in 2013 and is the newest coal plant in the country, experienced a major failure this past April and is now expected to stay offline until 2027, according to the region’s grid operator. In a report last year, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned that outage rates for coal plants are increasing. This is in part due to wear and tear from the way these plants cycle on and off to accommodate renewable energy sources, the report said, but it’s also due to reduced maintenance as plant operators plan to retire the facilities.

“You can do the deferred maintenance. It might keep the plant operating for a bit longer, but at the end of the day, it’s still not going to be the most efficient source of energy, or the cheapest source of energy,” Solomon said.

The contradictions snowball from there. On September 30, the DOE opened a $525 million funding opportunity for coal plants titled “Restoring Reliability: Coal Recommissioning and Modernization,” inviting coal-fired power plants that are scheduled for retirement before 2032 or in rural areas to apply for grants that will help keep them open. The grant paperwork states that grid capacity challenges “are especially acute in regions with constrained transmission and sustained load growth.” Two days later, however, as part of the agency’s mass termination of grants, it canceled more than $1.3 billion in awards from the Grid Deployment Office to upgrade and install new transmission lines to ease those constraints.

The new funding opportunity may ultimately just shuffle awards around from one coal plant to another, or put previously-awarded projects through the time-and-money-intensive process of reapplying for the same funding under a new name. Up to $350 million of the total will go to as many as five coal plants, with initial funding to restart closed plants or to modernize old ones, and later phases designated for carbon capture, utilization, and storage retrofits. The agency said it will use “unobligated” money from three programs that were part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act: the Carbon Capture Demonstration Projects Program, the Carbon Capture Large-Scale Pilot Projects, and the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas Program.

In a seeming act of cognitive dissonance, however, the agency has canceled awards for two coal-fired power plants that the Biden administration made under those same programs. One, a $6.5 million grant to Navajo Transitional Energy Company, a tribal-owned entity that owns a stake in New Mexico’s Four Corners Generating Station, would have funded a study to determine whether adding carbon capture and storage to the plant was economically viable. The other, a $50 million grant to TDA Research that would have helped the company validate its CCS technology at Dry Fork Station, a coal plant in Wyoming, was terminated in May.

Two more may be out the window. A new internal agency list of grants labeled “terminate” that circulated this week included an $8 million grant for the utility Duke Energy to evaluate the feasibility of capturing carbon from its Edwardsport plant in Indiana, and $350 million for Project Tundra, a carbon capture demonstration project at the Milton R. Young Station in North Dakota.

“It’s not internally consistent,” Jack Andreason Cavanaugh, a global fellow at the Columbia University’s Carbon Management Research Initiative, told me. “You’re canceling coal grants, but then you’re giving $630 million to keep them open. You’re also investing a ton of time and money into nuclear — which is great, to be clear — but these small modular reactors haven’t been deployed in the United States, and part of the reason is that they’re currently not economically viable.”

The closest any company has come thus far to deploying a small modular reactor in the U.S. is NuScale, a company that planned to build its first-of-a-kind reactors in Idaho and had secured agreements to sell the power to a group of public utilities in Utah. But between 2015, when it was first proposed, and late 2023, when it died, the project’s budget tripled from $3 billion to more than $9 billion, while its scale was reduced from 600 megawatts to 462 megawatts. Not all of that was inevitable — costs rose dramatically in the final few years due to inflation. The reason NuScale ultimately pulled out of the project is that the cost of electricity it generated was going to be too high for the market to bear.

It’s unclear how heavily the DOE will weigh project financials in the application process for the $900 million for nuclear reactors. In its funding announcement, it specified that the awards would be made “solely based on technical merit.” The agency’s official solicitation paperwork, however, names “financial viability” as one of the key review criteria. Regardless, the Trump administration appears to recognize the value in funding first-of-a-kind, risky technologies when it comes to nuclear, but is not applying the same standards to direct air capture or hydrogen plants.

I asked the Department of Energy to share the criteria it used in the project review process to determine economic viability. In response, spokesperson Ben Dietderich encouraged me to read Wright’s memorandum describing the review process from May. The memo outlines what types of documentation the agency will evaluate to reach a decision, but not the criteria for making that decision.

Solomon agreed that advanced nuclear might one day meet the grid’s growing power needs, but not anytime soon. “Hopefully in the long term, this technology does become a part of our electricity system. But certainly relying on it in the short term has real risks to electricity costs,” she said. “And also reliability, in the sense that the projects might not materialize.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTczMTAzNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NzU1MjA2OH0.MQk2floJC0HebPHKp-gujW4uQNvrZXpP7vLup0F3ms4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-10 23:00:06.172299

These sustainable units provide essential power for safety and communication during grid failures, addressing the need for dependable energy in emergencies and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

— Solar Emergency Charger notes the value of solar power stations as a dependable and sustainable option for emergency preparedness. These units provide essential power for safety and communication during grid failures or outages from natural events. A reliable power source is important for household safety when conventional electricity is out.

More information is available at https://solaremergencycharger.com/.

The need for a reliable backup power source is reflected in recent data. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average American experienced approximately 5.5 hours of power interruptions in 2022. This figure shows a potential vulnerability for households dependent on a stable grid.

A solar generator operates by using solar panels to convert sunlight into direct current (DC) electricity. The energy is stored in a high-capacity battery, with a charge controller managing the flow. An inverter then converts the stored DC power into alternating current (AC) for use with standard appliances.

This technology produces clean energy without emitting pollutants. It supports sustainable living practices and lessens reliance on the traditional power grid. For families aiming for more self-sufficiency, these systems offer energy independence and a reduced environmental footprint.

Unlike traditional generators that have ongoing fuel expenses, a solar generator can offer long-term savings. With fewer moving parts than conventional systems, they require less maintenance. This design results in lower operational costs and helps ensure the system is ready when needed.

The practical capability of these units is shown in their emergency performance. For instance, a 2,000Wh unit can theoretically power a 100W device for approximately 20 hours, depending on factors such as battery type and efficiency. This capacity can sustain appliances like refrigerators and communication tools during a grid interruption.

Solar Emergency Charger provides homeowners with reliable and user-friendly solar power stations. The company serves as a resource for families looking to add a modern, sustainable energy source to their preparedness plans.

The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada.
That includes final environmental reviews for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.
It included seven individual solar projects and would have covered about 63,000 acres of BLM rangelands.
Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.","The Trump administration’s cancellation of what would have been one of the world’s largest solar power projects has some industry observers fretting over the future of renewable energy on public lands.

They predicted the Esmeralda 7 project — by far the largest solar project that had moved through the permitting process under former President Joe Biden’s Interior Department — won’t be the last major project in the pipeline to be pulled. It was one of a number of Nevada desert solar projects that had been steadily advancing through regulatory review by the Biden administration.

Scott Sklar, sustainable energy director at George Washington University’s Environment & Energy Management Institute, said the Trump administration had set up a “multitude of regulatory barriers and delays.” These delays, he added, have placed financial strain on the renewable energy companies with projects waiting for review and could lead to others walking away from pending projects.

“The administration wants to stop these projects, period, so there is no chance for approval,” he said.

Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, agreed. “As the Trump administration continues to take actions hostile to renewable energy projects, that may not be the last solar project on federal land to cancel,” he said.

The Bureau of Land Management on Thursday updated its planning website for the Esmeralda 7 project to note that the environmental review of the project was “cancelled.”

The decision to cancel the programmatic environmental impact statement was described by a federal government official with knowledge of the situation, who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly, as a mutual decision by BLM and the handful of companies that had proposed the seven individual solar power projects that would have comprised Esmeralda 7.

The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”

Representatives with the energy companies involved in developing the seven individual solar power plants that collectively comprised the Esmeralda 7 project did not respond to requests for comment.

The Trump administration has made its skepticism of the solar build-out in Nevada clear in recent months, with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and other officials saying solar is an “intermittent” technology that doesn’t provide reliable energy. But some conservationists alarmed by the proposed rollout of large solar projects in Nevada and other Western states celebrated the demise of Esmeralda 7, saying as designed it took up up far too much land.

“Friends of Nevada Wilderness is thrilled that this poorly sited project is dead,” said Shaaron Netherton, the group’s executive director.

“In the push to get this particular project through, the BLM ignored the importance of this region’s cultural significance, biological significance and the fact that it is one of the most intact landscapes remaining in Nevada,” Netherton added.

BLM in July 2024 issued a draft programmatic environmental impact statement for the project and had originally planned to issue a final review document in April.

Around 35 commercial-scale solar power projects that were under at least preliminary review by BLM when President Donald Trump took office still await action.

That includes final environmental reviews for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.

What’s more, two major solar projects that were issued records of decision in the final weeks of the Biden administration have since sat in limbo — the Jove Solar Project in southwest Arizona and the Rough Hat Clark County Solar Project in southern Nevada, with a combined capacity to power 350,000 homes.

Burgum and his department have increasingly tightened the restrictions on solar and wind projects. Burgum signed a secretarial order that directed officials to eliminate policies granting “preferential treatment” for wind and solar development on federal lands and waters. The department also issued guidance to agency leaders that Burgum and Deputy Secretary Kate MacGregor would need to review a long list of procedural decisions for those projects.

Burgum in August also signed an order that requires Interior to consider “capacity density” when evaluating solar and wind projects, which could hinder them because they tend to take up more land than other kinds of energy development.

Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in an email Friday that the industry needs “further clarity from BLM on its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process,” but that they “remain deeply concerned” about the administration’s recent actions that appear aimed at slowing solar development on federal lands.

“We need more power on the grid, fast, and the solar and storage industry is ready to provide it,” Norris said, “but we need the administration to get serious about truly achieving American energy dominance.”

Concerns about project’s size

The Esmeralda 7 project was ambitious by most any measure.

It included seven individual solar projects and would have covered about 63,000 acres of BLM rangelands. If built as imagined, it could have produced about 5,350 MW of electricity — enough to power nearly 2 million homes.

Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.

On the surface, at least, the project appeared to be proposed in an ideal spot in Esmeralda County.

The federal government controls 98 percent of the county’s 2.2 million acres, and BLM accounts for the vast majority of that — managing 2.1 million acres there.

There’s not a single incorporated town, and only about 729 residents, ranking it among the 20 least populated counties in the nation, with the nation’s second-lowest population density of residents per square mile.

But the project had garnered concerns about its sheer size and the potential for it to disturb migratory patterns for wildlife.

Conservation advocates, local government leaders and nearby residents have expressed concerns about the cumulative environmental impacts of the proposed Esmeralda 7 project, which in addition to covering a huge swath of desert lands would have also included miles of roads and associated transmission lines.

They have argued for placing onshore utility-scale projects on previously disturbed sites and expanding the use of rooftop solar.

The Esmeralda 7 project “would have destroyed significant archaeology sites, rare plants, bighorn sheep habitat and wilderness quality lands,” said Kevin Emmerich, a co-founder of Nevada-based Basin and Range Watch.

The cancellation of the project “will give us a chance to protect the tremendous resources of the area, including beautiful and wild mountain ranges and valleys, rare plant populations, and bighorn sheep,” said Laura Cunningham, a biologist with Western Watersheds Project.

“Paleontological fossil beds [the Esmeralda Formation] here were formative to understanding the geological history of the Great Basin,” Cunningham added. “This is good news for recreationists and for conservation efforts of an amazing landscape.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/4a/db/0757e1e94a558b25616284763f8a/29730315801-859a5b0540-c-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 21:01:08.001022

The 11 states leading the effort announced October 10 are co-chairs New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Wyoming, and participating states Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.

“The new Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative is critical to moving new nuclear projects forward across the country,” said David Terry, NASEO President. “The initiative is among the most important actions taken collectively by states to date to catalyze investment in historic levels of firm, clean electric power development to serve consumers, businesses and the nation as a whole for decades to come.”

NASEO last month issued a Request for Information to provide states with information on a structure for an advanced nuclear project “order book” strategy, including the status and use cases for different nuclear technologies, and investment and coordination models.

The order book approach moves away from one-off projects to propel widespread market adoption of the most viable technologies that can be deployed across multiple states. This includes assessing the readiness of different advanced reactor designs to meet different power needs identified by states, which will speed project development and lower costs. NASEO, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the U.S. Department of Energy Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear coordinated with the states to advance the RFI.

A cornerstone of the overall First Mover initiative is forming public-private partnerships with interested utilities, nuclear technology developers, project developers, energy end-users (e.g., consumers, data centers, manufacturers), investors and others. NASEO and the First Mover states are working with the U.S. Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Congress to accelerate advanced nuclear projects.

About the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative

The First Mover initiative, directed by state energy offices, is led by state co-chairs New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Wyoming, and participating states Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia. The governors of these states are committed to delivering advanced nuclear power rapidly, safely, and cost-effectively to ensure consumers and businesses have reliable, affordable, sustainable electricity for years to come.

These states seek to accelerate advanced nuclear projects by reducing financial and technology risks, devising supportive market adoption policies, defining supply chain needs, streamlining federal permitting, developing coordinated procurement options, exploring state-federal-private financing structures, and creating public-private partnerships.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced New York’s participation in the initiative during her “State of the State Address” in January. “New York is proud to co-lead the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative, which demonstrates our commitment to the exploration of innovative technologies to achieve a reliable and affordable electric system for New York families,” Hochul said. “New York looks forward to partnering with other states that want to find ways to meet growing energy demand, pursue economic development opportunities, and who share the same vision for a sustainable energy future.”

“The state of Indiana is committed to identifying the strongest pathways for advancing new nuclear projects,” said Indiana Gov. Mike Braun. “By co-leading the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative, Indiana will be able to facilitate innovative new partnerships across states and industry, identify supportive policy mechanisms, and develop new tools for decreasing project risk.”

While the bill enhances oversight and safety, it is also expected to increase the cost of battery storage development in the state.
The legislation, co-sponsored by the California Professional Firefighters and the California State Association of Electrical Workers, is aimed at strengthening coordination with fire authorities and preventing safety incidents.
It is introduced in the aftermath of a major fire at the Moss Landing battery storage facility in Monterey County.
“California must prioritize safety at every step when expanding battery storage to meet its clean energy goals,” said Senator Laird.","Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 283, authored by Senator John Laird, introducing new safety requirements for the development of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in California. While the bill enhances oversight and safety, it is also expected to increase the cost of battery storage development in the state.

The legislation, co-sponsored by the California Professional Firefighters and the California State Association of Electrical Workers, is aimed at strengthening coordination with fire authorities and preventing safety incidents. It is introduced in the aftermath of a major fire at the Moss Landing battery storage facility in Monterey County.

The site, part of the Vistra Power Plant, is the largest operational battery project in the United States.. The fire at a 300 MW lithium-ion storage system triggered the evacuation of more than 1,200 residents and led to the temporary closure of surrounding roads. While all on-site personnel were safely evacuated and no injuries were reported, the event raised significant concerns about the safety of large-scale energy storage facilities.

“California must prioritize safety at every step when expanding battery storage to meet its clean energy goals,” said Senator Laird. “SB 283 ensures that future battery storage facilities are developed with safety and the community in mind, and that our fire officials are involved in every step along the way. I thank Governor Newsom for signing this bill to protect first responders, local communities, and the integrity of our renewable energy transition.”

Under SB 283, battery storage developers will be required to meet with the local fire authority at least 30 days prior to submitting an application for a new project. This consultation must cover key safety aspects, including facility design, risk assessments, and emergency response planning, in alignment with requirements under SB 38. In addition, developers will be required to arrange and pay for a post-installation inspection of the facility by the local fire authority before the system is allowed to begin operation.

The bill also directs the state to review building standards related to battery storage. As part of the next update to the California Building Standards Code after July 1, 2026, the Office of the State Fire Marshal will be required to evaluate and potentially propose siting restrictions. This may include limiting installations to dedicated-use, noncombustible buildings or outdoor locations to reduce fire risk.

Initially, SB 283 included a provision requiring battery storage projects to comply with the National Fire Protection Association’s NFPA 855 standards. However, this requirement was removed from the final bill after the Office of the State Fire Marshal independently adopted the latest NFPA 855 standards in March 2025. These standards are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026, making further legislation on the matter unnecessary.

According to a release from Prometheus, the project is expected to include a minimum of $500 million in initial investment and to deliver up to 1.5 gigawatts of IT-ready capacity over multiple phases.

First IT-ready power is targeted for 2026.

Project Overview

The Casper project and strategic partnership are designed to meet accelerating demand for AI compute capacity while embedding carbon removal into the project’s core. It unifies three pillars:

Data Infrastructure: Prometheus Hyperscale will design and finance high-density compute halls using proprietary aquifer, non-consumptive water-cooling systems to maximize energy efficiency.

Energy Systems: Spiritus builds on its work in Wyoming with its new platform, Orchard Power, which will deliver 1.5 GW of on-site firm power fueled by natural gas, integrated point-source and direct air capture to drive fast, affordable, carbon-negative operations.

Carbon Sequestration: Casper Carbon Capture will provide land, rights-of-way and access to permitted CO2 sequestration wells in Natrona and Converse counties, ensuring permanent storage of captured emissions.

This new data center development builds on Prometheus’s initiatives in Wyoming and Texas. In Evanston is the company’s flagship project: scaling toward 1 GW+ IT capacity, with partnerships for low-carbon natural gas, nuclear SMR power and organic flow battery systems.

In Texas are partnerships with ENGIE North America and Conduit Power to co-locate AI data centers alongside renewable and hybrid power systems across the Interstate 35 corridor.

The project is expected to generate hundreds of construction jobs during the building phase and dozens of long-term technical positions upon completion. The project will also expand the tax base by generating new property, utility and infrastructure revenues for Natrona and Converse counties.

“We’re excited to develop another project in Wyoming,” Prometheus CEO Trenton Thornock said in the release. “The Casper project and this partnership with Spiritus and Casper Carbon Capture further enables Prometheus’ vision of developing the future of digital infrastructure sustainably.”

(WSAV) — State leaders are looking for new ways to keep electric vehicle (EV) interest charged up — after federal tax credits for EV buyers expired at the end of September.

The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, created under the ‘Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,’ had offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models. But a bill signed in July shortened its end date from 2032 to September 30, 2025, effectively ending the incentive early.

‘Range Anxiety’ No Longer a Major Issue

EV owners say Georgia’s expanding charging infrastructure is helping ease common concerns about long-distance travel.

“The charging network in Georgia is really being built out in a very robust and easy way,” said James Marlow, President of Southface and an EV owner. “When I drive to the Georgia coast, it’s no problem to stop, charge, and grab food or coffee. Charging is becoming much less of an issue.”

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Georgia now has over 90,000 registered EVs and about 2,200 charging stationsstatewide.

Local Incentives May Be the Next Step

With federal credits now gone, experts say car manufacturers and local governments may need to step in with new incentives to keep buyers interested.

“The withdrawal of incentives has definitely changed the market,” Marlow said. “But if you zoom out, electric vehicles now make up about 10% of the U.S. new car market — and that’s growing.”

He also pointed to falling battery costs, which are expected to make EVs more affordable in the coming years.

Cheaper to Operate, Easier to Charge

“I have a Tesla 3, and a full charge to 80% costs me about $12,” Marlow said. “That’s compared to nearly $60 for a full tank of gas in my Jeep — so it’s cheaper to operate.”

The Georgia Department of Transportation is currently reviewing roadways to identify potential “charging deserts” and plans to expand access across rural and suburban areas.

The ‘Battery Belt of the South’

Governor Brian Kemp has called Georgia the ‘Battery Belt of the South’— as major EV manufacturers like SK Battery, Rivian, Kia, and Hyundai continue to expand operations in the state.

With production booming and infrastructure growing, policymakers hope that even without federal incentives, Georgia can remain a leader in America’s electric vehicle future.

Trump hit the Environmental Protection Agency again.

With the government still shut down, the Trump administration announced more layoffs across the already decimated federal workforce. That includes EPA employees who worked on battery recycling and safety, plastics reduction, recycling and composting programs, and collecting solid waste data, according to the EPA union.

And for third-quarter 2025, BEV sales increased 24.1% year over year.
Expressed as a share of the average MSRP, overall incentive spending is expected to be 6.1%, while incentive spending for non-EVs should reach just 4.8%.

September was a solid sales month as many consumers headed to dealer lots before EV tax credits expired on Sept. 30. Battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales hit an all-time high in market share and accounted for 11.8% of all new vehicles sold. This market share was up nearly two percentage points from August 2025, which was also a strong month for BEV sales.

Year-to-date, BEV sales accounted for 8.4% of all new vehicles sold, an increase of 0.7 percentage points compared to the same period last year. And for third-quarter 2025, BEV sales increased 24.1% year over year. Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) vehicles, which were also eligible for the tax credits, didn’t perform nearly as well as BEVs. PHEV sales in September 2025 accounted for just 1.7% of all new vehicles sold, which is right in line with their year-to-date market share of 1.8%.

The average discount on a new vehicle increased slightly from August to September. According to J.D. Power, average incentive spending per unit should totaled $3,116, up just $24 compared to August 2025. J.D. Power notes that more incentive spending was targeted at EVs. Expressed as a share of the average MSRP, overall incentive spending is expected to be 6.1%, while incentive spending for non-EVs should reach just 4.8%.

New light-vehicle inventory on the ground and in-transit totaled 2.65 million units at the end of September 2025, up by 6.2% compared to August 2025 but down 5.9% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect inventory levels to end the year slightly below their levels at the end of Q3.

New light-vehicle sales have been solid so far through the third quarter, with a year-to-date SAAR of 16.4 million units—an increase of 4.7% year over year. NADA stated it believes there has been some significant pull-ahead volume, as consumers rushed to dealer lots earlier in the year before tariffs took effect and in recent months as consumers purchased EVs before the end of tax credits.

The big question now: Will volume hold in the final quarter of the year and into next year as 2026 models arrive on dealer lots? NADA has already seen several OEMs release price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range for 2026 models, and NADA is watching closely to see how much—and when—OEMs will pass along tariff-related price increases.

My Thoughts on President Trump's Phase 1 Gaza Peace Deal

President Trump and Secretary Rubio announced a historic peace deal in the Middle East this week, and I am in full support. Hamas' unprovoked and brutal attack on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 and kidnapping over 250 innocent people, was pure evil. Now we must ensure the beginnings of this historic Gaza peace deal are fully upheld and all hostages are safely returned home to their families.

Israel, under Prime Minister Netanyahu, has shown tremendous resilience in dismantling Hamas's terror network. This deal offers a path forward, but only if Hamas honors its commitments. We remain vigilant and eager to see this agreement implemented completely.

President Trump and Secretary Rubio's continued leadership is essential to ensuring lasting peace and the safe return of all the innocent people still held captive.

Midland Airpark Mineral Rights

This week, I joined City of Midland Mayor Lori Blong for a press conference to discuss an ongoing mineral rights issue negatively impacting the city of Midland and its taxpayers and outline a plan to address it.

For background, Midland stands to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in mineral revenues from oil and gas production beneath Midland Airpark, and it's only right that those dollars benefit the taxpayers who live here. However, under the current law, these dollars are tied up in a maze of federal rules and red tape.

This is not a fair deal for the Permian Basin. Midland taxpayers should be the ones who benefit from what's beneath their feet, not the federal government. I remain committed to standing up for American energy, and this is another chapter in ensuring the hard work of the Permian Basin, and especially Midland, stays here.

I also had an incredible time in Garden City this week at our community town hall. I'm grateful for the opportunity to meet with so many welcoming constituents and answer questions amid the Democrats' government shutdown.

Thank you to everyone who came out today to share your ideas, concerns, and feedback with me. Your input helps me better serve you in Congress, and I look forward to the next one!

FDA Quietly Approves Generic Abortion Drug

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the approval of a new generic version of the chemical abortion drug mifepristone. Not only is this deeply concerning, but this new version was approved under the same weakened standards the previous administration applied to mifepristone, which removed critical safeguards designed to protect women’s health and safety.

Mifepristone has a well-documented record of serious medical complications, with countless women suffering severe health consequences or even losing their lives. Compounding these risks, some abusers and human traffickers have taken advantage of these lowered standards and mail-order access to obtain the pills without medical oversight or verification, in some cases giving them to women without their knowledge or consent.

Approving this generic version under these same reckless standards only expands these dangers and puts more women and their unborn children at risk. I remain committed to protecting life, defending women’s health and safety, and ensuring HHS Secretary Kennedy remains committed to restoring safeguards on these dangerous abortion drugs.

Congress is now considering overturning management plans in other states, too.","Congress has voted to overturn part of the federal management plans for millions of acres of BLM lands in eastern Montana.

The Bureau of Land Management’s Miles City Field Office manages almost 3 million acres of public lands. That’s just on the surface. The office is also responsible for more than 12 million acres below ground in mineral rights.

In 2024, the Miles City Field Office decided to stop selling new coal leases. The agency at that time cited declining demands for coal, and the goal of reducing planet-warming emissions

But Wednesday, the U.S. Senate concurred with a previous House vote to overturn that policy, as part of President Donald Trump’s push to revive fossil fuel power. Montana’s Republican Congressional delegation all voted in favor of the change. U.S. Sen. Steve Daines was critical of the field office’s 2024 decision.

""This means that the BLM prohibited all new coal leasing in the Powder River Basin. By the way, that is the home of the largest coal reserves in the United States,"" Daines said.

Active mines in the region with existing coal leases would not have been impacted.

Resource Management Plans guide how BLM lands are used and managed. They are drafted using feedback from all the people that use these lands. The development of the Miles City plan involved mineral owners, natural resource industry groups, landowners, ranchers, farmers, hunters and 17 tribal nations.

Jeanie Alderson was directly involved with developing the 2024 plan. She’s a sixth-generation rancher in southeastern Montana, and the BLM owns mineral rights under her land. Alderson says this change overrides local voices.

""To have all those years of all of us working on this – it's the best of our, sort of, democratic process, and with people who have to live with the results and the actions. But to have it done from Washington, D.C., just foisted on us, is really unfortunate.""

The BLM’s statement: “During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”

The “Cancelled – Cancelled” notice on BLM’s NEPA website applies only to the environmental review stage. The entire project has not been canceled. The original story appears below. The headline has been updated.

LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — A cluster of seven solar projects that would have produced enough electricity to power roughly 1.6 million average homes was canceled without explanation on Friday.

The Esmeralda Seven Solar Project, located west of Tonopah in sparsely populated Esmeralda County, now carries the note “Cancelled – Cancelled” next to its status on the Bureau of Land Management’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) register.

The collective output of Esmeralda Seven would have been 6.2 gigawatts of electric power. Three of the seven projects made a list of the five largest proposed solar farms in June 2024. That list of proposed projects was based on data from Global Energy Monitor, which tracks power projects of all kinds worldwide.

The seven individual projects: Gold Dust Solar, Smoky Valley Solar, Esmeralda Energy Center, Lone Mountain Solar, Nivloc Solar, Red Ridge 1 and Red Ridge 2.

The area is about 270 miles northwest of Las Vegas on U.S. 95.

As approval for renewable energy was fast-tracked under President Joe Biden, environmental reviews for the seven projects were combined and the cluster became known as Esmeralda Seven.

President Donald Trump has directed federal agencies to end policies that favored solar and wind projects, making oil, gas and even coal his priorities for American energy development. BLM is one of the agencies under the Interior Department, led by Doug Burgum.

A post by the Nevada Republican Party on X Friday afternoon said: “Esmeralda County voters turned out for Trump, and now he has listened to them and cancelled the Esmeralda7 solar scam. Another phenomenal win by @realDonaldTrump and @SecretaryBurgum“

8 News Now has reached out to BLM for comment.

Environmental groups including Friends of Nevada Wilderness, Conservation Lands Foundation, Center for Biological Diversity, the Coalition for Nevada’s Wildlife, the Walker River Paiute Tribe and the Yerington Paiute Tribe, and the Coalition for Nevada’s Wildlife had argued against the Esmeralda Seven project.

Another conservation group, Basin and Range Watch, sent a statement when the project’s status changed to canceled.

“The E7 projects would have destroyed significant archeology sites, rare plants, bighorn sheep habitat and wilderness quality lands. This news is a welcome relief and gives hope that the area could be protected for the long term in the future,” Kevin Emmerick, the group’s co-founder, said in an email.

Shaaron Netherton, executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, spoke to 8 News Now last year about serious concerns about the proposal. Among those concerns: nationally significant cultural resources and impacts and impacts on the state’s most genetically pure population of native desert bighorn sheep.

“There are over 400 Paleoindian sites in this area. They are 10-14,000 years old,” Netherton said.

Still, clean energy advocates warned that the administration’s latest moves would have widespread economic and environmental costs.
“So let’s be clear, this is a big step back for American competitiveness and clean energy, no matter which way you slice it,” Hoover said.
The DOE’s move to terminate funds that had already been obligated is also likely to face challenges from recipients and clean energy advocates.","Just days after announcing sweeping cuts to clean energy programs across the country, the Trump administration appears to be upping the ante—potentially clawing back billions more in federal funding.

The U.S. Department of Energy initially announced the termination of 321 financial awards on Oct. 2, which the agency said totaled $7.56 billion in taxpayer savings. An additional 327 awards appear on a new, leaked list of projects targeted by the DOE for termination, widely circulated this week among lobbyists, members of Congress and news outlets including Inside Climate News.

The cancellation of all these projects would gut the big federal push in clean energy made under the Biden administration, and experts warned of wide-ranging impacts to jobs, electricity grids stressed by rising demand and the environment. But the tides of economics—in particular the plummeting cost of wind and solar power—mean that renewable energy will likely continue to gain ground. Indeed, some recipients of the targeted projects have vowed to continue with their work, though scale and speed may suffer.

What’s more, an ICN analysis of federal spending data, based on a spreadsheet derived from the leaked document created by the Clean Air Task Force, indicates that the DOE’s estimate of taxpayer savings is overstated. The original 321 canceled awards include many that had already passed their stated end date—two dozen of them before Trump’s inauguration.

Considering only those awards that were still current at the time the government shutdown on Oct. 1, and subtracting funds already sent to the recipients, ICN calculated a potential cut of around $4.87 billion from the terminations announced on Oct. 2.

DOE did not respond to ICN’s questions on where its additional $2.7 billion in savings came from, and said that it could not verify the lists of targeted projects.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” said agency spokesperson Ben Dietderich. “As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

The cancellations announced on Oct. 2 largely targeted projects in blue states, prompting fierce criticism from Democrats and accusations that the administration was wielding the cuts as a political weapon amid the federal government shutdown.

“This is a shameless and vindictive attack by [Office of Management and Budget] Director Vought, which will eliminate jobs and raise energy costs for Americans across the country,” said House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) in a statement.

But as the government shutdown stretched into its second week, news that the Trump administration was considering even more drastic cuts began to spread on Capitol Hill.

The leaked list of targeted awards contains all of those covered by the DOE’s initial announcement. Across the additional 327 awards, annotations in the document indicate total award amounts of $15.83 billion.

But again, the potential for immediate taxpayer savings if all these projects are abruptly terminated is markedly smaller.

After excluding grants past their end dates and subtracting money already sent to the recipients, ICN calculated potential cuts of $7.84 billion based on awards that had been obligated to receive funding.

In some cases, the award amounts given in the leaked document assume planned future federal funding, spending that had not yet been obligated. For instance, the document notes an amount of $1.2 billion to establish a series of hydrogen production facilities along the Gulf Coast of Texas.

However, only around $22 million in funding had been awarded so far for planning, analysis and design activities. Some $1.2 million of this has already been sent to HyVelocity, the consortium behind the effort.

This project is one of seven hydrogen hubs appropriated $8 billion through the 2026 fiscal year under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed in 2021.

Some of the projects covered by the Oct. 2 announcement and among the additional list of targeted projects in the leaked document had already been terminated in May. They include a grant of more than $86 million to Sublime Systems of Somerville, Massachusetts, to create a low-carbon cement factory and a project to replace the use of natural gas with hydrogen at an ExxonMobil plant in Texas that had been awarded more than $330 million, most of which had not yet been sent.

Still, clean energy advocates warned that the administration’s latest moves would have widespread economic and environmental costs.

“There will be job losses in local communities. There will be less reliable electricity grids,” said Zealan Hoover, former senior advisor to the EPA administrator during the Biden administration.

“Federal dollars are designed to solve investment gaps where private capital does not flow,” Hoover said. “So my expectation is that if these grants are terminated, then that work will either not progress, it will progress significantly slower or other sources of public investment at the state and local level or social investment will need to be redirected—but then that comes at the cost of investment that’s not happening elsewhere.”

Because many of the grants aim to catalyze new technologies, cutting them also harms the country’s ability to keep pace with China and other nations, he added.

“So let’s be clear, this is a big step back for American competitiveness and clean energy, no matter which way you slice it,” Hoover said.

Conrad Schneider, U.S. senior director for the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit that promotes climate solutions and reducing air pollution, said he was most concerned about cuts to projects intended to develop new technologies and demonstrate their commercial viability. “With respect to some of these emerging technologies that require the demonstrations, that’s what we would say would be the hammer blow,” he said.

These projects include initial work for the hydrogen hubs championed by the Biden administration as “critical energy infrastructure” that would create jobs and spur investment in technology to power hard-to-decarbonize sectors like heavy industry and long-haul trucking. Two of those hubs, MACH2 and ARCH2, would be located in part in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania.

The hubs have bipartisan support in the state. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro hailed them as a “win for the Commonwealth,” while Republican state Sen. Gene Yaw announced he was “delighted” by the investment when it was first announced and looked forward to “working cooperatively” with the federal government and businesses to realize the projects’ full potential. Just last week, MACH2’s chief operating officer, Manny Citron, told WHYY that Republican Sen. Dave McCormick’s staff had been “incredibly supportive” of the hub.

Andrew Cottone, founder of one of MACH2’s anchor partners, Aternium, said he had not been notified of any changes in the funding status of the hub. Either way, Aternium will move forward with its plans for building hydrogen production facilities in the mid-Atlantic region, he said.

“It’s full steam ahead for us,” he said. “We would love a strong ecosystem, but we’ve launched this company with a responsible business model. We are viable with or without tax credits. We are viable with or without the Department of Energy hub system.”

Others involved in the leadership of the MACH2 and ARCH2 hubs did not respond to requests for comment. It is unclear whether the projects can survive without federal government support.

Part of the problem is that potential agreements with steel and iron companies to use the fuel produced by the hubs did not end up moving forward, said Hilary Lewis, steel director at the nonprofit Industrious Labs, which works to decarbonize industry. The steel and iron industries contribute about 11 percent of global carbon emissions.

“We would have liked to see companies like U.S. Steel really invested in the hydrogen hub process,” she said.

The federal government has long played a key role in technological advances. Lewis said Biden-era tax credits, the hydrogen hubs and other federal investments in making green steel were all “great examples” of supporting clean energy solutions for industry.

“But when the government backtracks on its promises and cancels this type of funding, it puts American competitiveness at risk,” she said. “We are ceding leadership to other countries that are going to make these investments.”

Inside Climate News obtained a copy of the termination letter sent by the DOE to one of the grant recipients targeted in its initial announcement.

In the letter, dated Oct. 1, the agency said the recipient’s award was reviewed in a Portfolio Review Process (PRP) to ensure that the funding was “financially sound and economically viable, aligned with national and economic security interests, and consistent with Federal law and this Administration’s policies and priorities and program goals and priorities.”

“DOE regrets to inform you that the subject [grant] did not pass Standards of the PRP Committee review and will not proceed,” the letter reads.

Not all of the recipients have received notice that funding is being cut off. A spokesperson for the California Energy Commission on Thursday said that it still hadn’t received any communication from DOE that a $630 million grant for improvements to the state’s electric grid had been canceled, despite appearing in the Oct. 2 list of terminated awards.

Other recipients, including Mercedes-Benz—awarded some $285 million for next generation all-electric van production—and the University of North Dakota, which had four awards in the leaked list of wider potential cuts, declined or did not respond to requests for comment. Neither Mercedes-Benz nor UND’s awards were included in the DOE’s initial terminations.

“The Trump administration and its allies are actively restricting the supply of affordable clean power when demand is skyrocketing from data centers, industry and homes.”

— Joanna Slaney at the Environmental Defense Fund

To some groups impacted by the DOE’s moves, the decision to terminate funding capped off a long period of uncertainty stretching to President Donald Trump’s first day back in office.

“[For] a lot of members of our team, there was a certain amount of relief when this finally happened, because the fact that this has been going on since January has been a challenge,” said Zora Chung, cofounder of ReJoule.

Chung’s company had been slated to receive $10 million in federal funding to support its efforts to repurpose electric vehicle batteries for energy storage in commercial buildings. The project also sought to advance opportunities for historically underrepresented workers and businesses, and contribute to widespread adoption of long-duration energy storage in the U.S. by 2030, according to the award description.

To Chung, the DOE’s decision to terminate ReJoule’s award doesn’t reflect the project’s potential to advance the agency’s core mission. “We still believe that the project is aligned with the DOE goals of energy independence and resilience, as well as competing directly with China on battery technology,” Chung said.

Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, agreed.

“Canceling projects that would lower electric bills and make the grid more reliable is not about achieving ‘energy dominance,’” Slaney said, referring to one of Trump’s key priorities. “The Trump administration and its allies are actively restricting the supply of affordable clean power when demand is skyrocketing from data centers, industry and homes.”

Despite the loss of federal funding, Chung said that ReJoule’s battery project would move forward—slowed and scaled back, but undeterred.

“While the cancellation is certainly a setback for this specific deployment timeline—and a missed opportunity for accelerating American job creation and domestic energy security—it does not change our mission,” Chung said in a LinkedIn post confirming the award’s cancellation.

The DOE’s move to terminate funds that had already been obligated is also likely to face challenges from recipients and clean energy advocates. Chung, in her LinkedIn post, said that ReJoule would be formally reviewing its options, including appeal—while the California Energy Commission said that it “will evaluate options to appeal or reverse federal actions to cut previously allocated funds to these important programs.”

In its Oct. 2 announcement, the DOE claimed that the terminated projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

But the administration’s moves come as solar and wind power, in particular, are establishing themselves as the most economically competitive options for energy investment. On Tuesday, a report from the energy think tank Ember announced that renewables had for the first time surpassed coal in the global electricity mix. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s effort to lease rights to extract 167 million tons of coal on federal lands in Montana attracted just one bid, of $186,000.

According to the International Energy Agency, renewable energy capacity is poised to more than double globally in the next five years, even as projections for the United States are revised down based on the Trump administration’s policies. Renewables are growing in countries like China, India, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia; Germany recently announced a $7 billion investment in industrial decarbonization.

Michael Noble, a Minnesota-based consultant to clean energy companies and a longtime advocate for the energy transition, said that wind, solar, batteries and related technologies are “all kick-ass technologies that are falling in price. Those fundamentals cannot be undone by politicians.”

The administration’s favoring of fossil fuels “is putting all of our money on a horse that’s already lost,” said Sachu Constantine, executive director of Vote Solar, a nonprofit based in San Francisco.

More than four million new vehicles were sold in July, August and September, according to estimates from Cox Automotive and Edmunds.
But that sales pace might be difficult to maintain as the industry faces growing headwinds from changing federal policies on electric vehicles and international trade.
The third quarter coincided with the Sept. 30 expiration of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, causing a surge in EV sales that’s likely to be temporary.
But now that the credit’s gone, “we're absolutely going to see a massive drop in electric vehicle sales for the next few months,” predicted Brauer.","The U.S. automotive industry just had a strong quarter.

More than four million new vehicles were sold in July, August and September, according to estimates from Cox Automotive and Edmunds. That’s well above the same period last year, and puts the industry on track to sell over 16 million new vehicles this year, per Cox.

But that sales pace might be difficult to maintain as the industry faces growing headwinds from changing federal policies on electric vehicles and international trade. The third quarter coincided with the Sept. 30 expiration of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, causing a surge in EV sales that’s likely to be temporary.

That surge was apparent at Audi Oakland, where Daniel Kossut is general manager.

“We started August with over 75 EV units in stock, and we wrapped up September with only three left in stock,” Kossut said.

Kossut said his dealership marketed the end of the tax credit pretty heavily. But he also saw a lot of buyers who already knew they had a hard deadline to get that discount.

“They know what they're looking for. They're pretty savvy, and people knew this was it,” he said.

This EV sales rush ahead of the tax credit expiration is a classic example of a pull forward effect, said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at automotive information site iSeeCars.com.

“Anyone who was on the fence or seriously considering an electric vehicle purchase in the next three, six, nine months ran out and did it before the end of September,” he said.

So, those sales that might have otherwise occurred next January or April, happened in September instead. That pull forward made for the strongest quarterly EV sales in the U.S. on record: over 438,000 according to Cox Automotive.

But now that the credit’s gone, “we're absolutely going to see a massive drop in electric vehicle sales for the next few months,” predicted Brauer.

That drop could have an impact on overall car sales in the months ahead. Because, if you look beyond EVs, sales in the third quarter, especially September, were on the soft side, Brauer said.

“An increasing number of people can't afford new cars, or they're taking out loans they probably shouldn't be taking out,” he said.

Eighty-four-month loans (that’s seven years) are getting more popular. The average monthly payment on a new vehicle is nearly $750.

Pair those figures with low consumer sentiment, and it’s not hard to see why Brauer and other analysts don’t expect a huge rush to dealerships around the holidays this year.

At the same time, automakers are facing rising costs of their own from the Trump administration’s tariffs, which are steadily eating into their profits, according to Tyson Jominy, senior vice president of data and analytics at JD Power.

“We estimate it's about $40 billion of tariff costs that automakers are absorbing, and that is equivalent to nearly 40% of global profits in the auto industry last year,” Jominy said.

So far, carmakers are mostly choosing not to pass those costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Jominy said that’s partly because they’re in a competitive industry. Every automotive company has a different supply chain, and therefore a different level of exposure to tariffs.

“Just because you have that cost as an automaker for producing overseas doesn't mean your competitors do,” Jominy said. “That is leading to very competitive price dynamics here in the U.S.”

However, car companies probably can’t eat those costs forever, assuming the import taxes stay in place.

“We would suspect that once we get into the new calendar year, 2026, you'll see some increases in those stickers of the vehicles that are being delivered to dealer lots in time for the spring,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

And the most affordable vehicles on the market, those under $30,000, are the most exposed to tariffs, Smoke said. That’s because they’re more likely to be assembled or include more parts from outside the U.S.

But hiking the cost of those cars, SUVs, and crossovers, “clearly challenges things for the consumer who's already stretching just to be able to afford a vehicle in that price point,” Smoke said.

The auto industry does have one bright spot to look forward to in the new year: Tax refunds. After the GOP tax bill passed over the summer, tax refunds for many Americans could be substantial, Smoke said.

“It's amazing what cash-in-pocket does to vehicle demand and activity.”

That was the takeaway from a keynote presentation by Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois and Entergy Louisiana CEO Phillip May at the Tulane Business Forum on Friday. The LED chief argued that a series of major investments portend a new era of economic swagger for the state.

Before a crowd of about 500 at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, Bourgeois pointed to the last 21 months of outside investment in Louisiana, led by the $10 billion Meta data center in north Louisiana and the nearly $6 billion Hyundai steel plant near Baton Rouge, and said it’s time for Louisianans to believe in the state’s prospects again.

“We've been working hard to change the narrative,” Bourgeois said. “There’s been this feeling that we’re not good enough. We want to change that.”

Bourgeois said 58 announced projects could lead to 70,000 new jobs and lend credibility to the state in the eyes of future investors.

Other big investments announced or expanded since Bourgeois took on the role of the state's biggest business booster in 2024 include LNG projects from Woodside Energy and Venture Global, plus the CF Industries “blue ammonia” plant in Ascension Parish. This week, Louisiana-based electrical contractor MMR announced a $55 million expansion of its manufacturing capabilities in Lafayette Parish.

“We’re leveraging the state’s existing strengths in energy with new twists,” Bourgeois said.

Bourgeois said the Meta data center is creating opportunities for existing businesses, like Monroe-based wholesaler Robertson Produce, which just landed a large contract to help feed hundreds of construction workers.

Experts talk coffee, AI and music business

The comments from Bourgeois and May were part of a half-day business forum organized by the Tulane Association of Business Alumni that's been an annual tradition for most of the last half century.

Panels jumped from subject to subject as the lawyers, engineers and accountants in attendance earned continuing education credits in between networking opportunities and a lunch.

Earlier in the day, three coffee industry insiders talked about how the Trump Administration's tariffs are making it more difficult and expensive but businesses are adapting.

Ryan McKinnon of Westfeldt Brothers, the New Orleans-based coffee importer, said that one side effect of the import taxes is buyers are sourcing coffee beans from countries with lower tariffs — like Mexico and Honduras — and moving away from places like Brazil, which has a higher tax.

""There will be some differences in taste profile, but you can get some that are very close,"" McKinnon said.

Tulane University President Michael Fitts used a portion of his time to promote his school's vision to expand its downtown campus, centered around the hoped-for redevelopment of the former Charity Hospital building, which has moldered since Hurricane Katrina.

Fitts envisions a thriving downtown neighborhood, propelled by Tulane biomedical research and the companies it spawns, as the catalyst for a revival of New Orleans' struggling economy.

The Biden administration had permitted the developers’ joint proposals, and the Trump administration had advanced the project’s draft environmental impact statement.
That’s part of a broader shift within the Trump administration away from utility-scale renewable energy development on federal land — even as global clean energy buildout accelerates.
“The Trump administration’s reported cancellation of Nevada’s largest solar and storage project will restrict America’s ability to produce homegrown clean energy,” the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) said in a statement.
The US still spends billions each year importing oil, even as solar power remains the cheapest source of new electricity in history.","The Trump administration has canceled the Esmeralda 7 solar project in Nevada — a sweeping, multi-developer clean energy plan that would have been the largest solar installation in North America.

The Esmeralda 7 project, composed of seven connected solar farms proposed by NextEra Energy Resources, Leeward Renewable Energy, Arevia Power, and Invenergy, was designed to sit across around 185 square miles of public land, an area nearly the size of Las Vegas. The plan promised to deliver about 5,350 MW of electricity, enough to power nearly 2 million homes – that’s three times the Hoover Dam’s generating capacity.

The Biden administration had permitted the developers’ joint proposals, and the Trump administration had advanced the project’s draft environmental impact statement. However, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) hadn’t issued a final environmental impact statement or record of decision.

Yesterday, the BLM’s website marked the project as canceled. That’s part of a broader shift within the Trump administration away from utility-scale renewable energy development on federal land — even as global clean energy buildout accelerates.

According to Politico, “The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had ‘agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.'”

The BLM had spent years reviewing Esmeralda 7’s potential impacts on wildlife and public lands, so clean energy advocates say the decision to scrap the project is more political than procedural. “The Trump administration’s reported cancellation of Nevada’s largest solar and storage project will restrict America’s ability to produce homegrown clean energy,” the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) said in a statement. “This action hurts America’s economy, its energy security, and the jobs of thousands of hardworking Americans.”

Electrek’s Take

Anyone shocked by this move hasn’t been paying attention, but that doesn’t make it any less destructive. Killing the Esmeralda 7 project isn’t just a setback for Nevada — it’s a blow to US energy independence, and making the developers jump through the same hoops all over again is a stall tactic. Utility-scale solar, like Esmeralda 7, is the backbone of the transition away from fossil fuels and toward true domestic energy dominance.

The US still spends billions each year importing oil, even as solar power remains the cheapest source of new electricity in history. Every canceled project like this one delays when the US can power itself with affordable clean energy, which means higher prices, higher emissions, and fewer jobs in the long run. And don’t expect this one to be a one-off cancellation of renewables on federal lands, seeing how Trump is encouraging the buildout of fossil fuel projects on those same lands.

Affordable technologies are available to completely eliminate toxic pollution from coal plants’ wastewater — there is no excuse for not requiring coal plants to begin using this technology.
During drinking water treatment, the presence of bromide can create carcinogenic byproducts that utilities need expensive treatment equipment to avoid.
EPA will also give more loopholes to coal plants, including giving retiring coal plants more time to operate without adequate pollution controls.
The Trump administration is now giving the green light for power plants to keep dumping toxic chemicals into drinking water supplies.","Coal-fired power plants discharge wastewater containing toxic chemicals and heavy metals directly into waterways that serve as sources of drinking water for more than 30 million Americans. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized improved wastewater treatment standards for coal-fired power plants. But now, Trump’s EPA is trying to gut these safeguards at the behest of the coal power industry. As part of a recent Trump administration announcement to bail out the failing coal industry, the EPA proposed to delay the compliance deadlines for five years and may use that time to gut the standards altogether.

Power plants have historically been by far one of the largest sources of toxic pollutants in America’s rivers, lakes, and streams. Last year the EPA updated safeguards to require coal power plants to upgrade their technology to meet zero-discharge requirements for their three largest waste streams: wastewater generated by power plant air pollution scrubbers, water used to flush out coal ash that accumulates at the bottom of the coal boiler (known as bottom ash), and leachate from coal ash surface impoundments and landfills. EPA had updated the standards, known as Effluent Limitation Guidelines or ELGs, to require substantial reductions in the amount of arsenic, mercury, and other pollutants that power plants are permitted to dump into U.S. waterways.

Affordable technologies are available to completely eliminate toxic pollution from coal plants’ wastewater — there is no excuse for not requiring coal plants to begin using this technology. The standards will significantly reduce toxic metals and other harmful pollutants such as bromide that are difficult and costly to remove from our drinking water. During drinking water treatment, the presence of bromide can create carcinogenic byproducts that utilities need expensive treatment equipment to avoid. Some drinking water utilities have been forced to install expensive new treatment systems to remove toxic contaminants from upstream coal-fired power plants. Municipal drinking water utilities across the country have pressed EPA to ensure strong guidelines to control discharges of toxic chemicals from coal-fired power plants.

The benefits of requiring power plants to meet the new wastewater zero-discharge standards were estimated to be at least three to six times greater than the costs to industry, including reduced incidences of cancer and cardiovascular disease, reduced lead exposures in children, and reduced drinking water treatment costs.

Under the safeguards that EPA adopted in 2024, power plants are required to notify EPA by the end of the year if they intend to retire rather than meet the new zero-discharge requirements, and to meet the requirements by the end of 2029. EPA’s new proposed rule would postpone those deadlines for five years until the end of 2031 and the end of 2034. EPA will also give more loopholes to coal plants, including giving retiring coal plants more time to operate without adequate pollution controls.

The Trump Administration is trying to bail out the coal industry with direct subsidies and by gutting basic pollution controls, but the fact is that these plants are aging, costly, and polluting and cannot compete with clean energy, which is cheaper and more reliable. Coal now generates just 15% of American electricity because it’s the most polluting, dangerous, and expensive way to produce power. When they prop up corporate polluters, we all pay the price through higher electricity bills and toxic pollution.

Even though the Clean Water Act requires polluters to use the most modern and effective pollution control technology available to treat wastewater, prior to 2015 most coal plants had no limits on toxic pollutants in their wastewater discharges. In response to an Earthjustice suit filed in 2010, EPA revised the wastewater standards for the first time in decades. Coal-fired power plants were required to install state-of-the-art wastewater treatment technology and monitor local water quality. But then-EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler finalized a weaker rule in 2020. Earthjustice filed a lawsuit challenging that weakening of the rules, which resulted in new standards finalized in 2023. For the first time, those standards included new treatment standards for leachate from power plant coal ash disposal sites, a result of a court victory won by Earthjustice and partner groups in 2019, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down a prior attempt by EPA to exempt these waste streams from more stringent discharge limits.

The EPA plans to hold a public hearing on October 14, you can participate. The Trump administration is now giving the green light for power plants to keep dumping toxic chemicals into drinking water supplies. But we will see them in court.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-10-10 17:03:35.521433

The IRA’s tax credit for clean hydrogen production, known as 45V, was meant to help spur supply of the fuel.
The hydrogen hubs, meanwhile, were meant to coordinate producers and offtakers to create regional ecosystems that could someday be interconnected with pipelines and other infrastructure.
California’s regional hub, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES, plans to continue without the financing and could turn to state funds to make up the difference.
The state Clean Truck and Bus Vouchers program, known as HVIP, and the California Energy Commission’s Clean Transportation Program Investment Plans could bolster offtakers.","In July, China launched the world’s largest green hydrogen plant. One month later, India’s government backed 19 projects designed to make the country a leader in producing green hydrogen, which could help decarbonize everything from steel to shipping. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are pumping billions of dollars into infrastructure to produce and export the fuel over the next few years.

The United States, meanwhile, is yanking funding for some of its most ambitious clean-hydrogen projects.

Last week, as part of a list of 321 grants revoked in the name of saving $7.5 billion in spending, the Department of Energy rescinded $2.2 billion in awards to two of the seven hydrogen regional hubs established under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Unlike the five other hubs, the law designed the terminated projects, in California and the Pacific Northwest, to focus exclusively on hydrogen made with renewable electricity, making them an easy target as the Trump administration slashes Biden-era clean energy projects.

Now this week a second Energy Department list shared with Canary Media indicates the agency is considering whether to pull funding from all seven hydrogen hubs, including those in Texas, Appalachia, and the mid-Atlantic and two in the Midwest.

It’s not certain whether the entire $24 billion worth of awards on the new list will be eliminated. Companies whose projects appeared only on the second list, including utilities and carbon removal firms, have yet to receive notice of cancellation. While federal officials gave companies involved in the West Coast hubs a warning before announcing the cuts last week, three separate producers involved in the other five hubs had not heard from the administration as of Thursday, according to California Hydrogen Business Council CEO Katrina Fritz, who checked in with the sources.

But already, the potential cuts are sowing doubt within the emerging sector — and in the clean energy space more broadly.

“Any amount of uncertainty in funding is really detrimental to private-sector investment, and that’s just not a good way to spur innovation domestically and compete on a global stage,” said Rachel Starr, the senior U.S. policy manager for the hydrogen program at the Clean Air Task Force. ​“Plenty of other countries are investing in this. We’re going to lose our competitive edge if we stop.”

“Yeah, I’m worried”

It remains unclear whether the document outlining a fuller list of cuts, which a lobbyist told E&E News was weeks old, represents an expansion of the previous cuts or a maximalist proposal from which the earlier terminations were whittled down.

In a statement, the Energy Department said it was ​“unable to verify” the list but that the agency ​“continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

A former Energy Department official with direct knowledge confirmed that the list is legitimate and said that it represents the grants DOE officials have recommended for cancellation to the White House. The official suggested that the agency is obfuscating its plans to pull the grants to regional hubs in red states until after a federal budget is passed, an effort to prevent congressional Republicans from adding an amendment that preserves the funding into the budget.

“They can’t do that in the middle of a government shutdown,” the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Canary Media. ​“I do expect them to cancel these funds … [but] not until there’s a full-year appropriations [bill].”

Already, key Republican lawmakers have expressed concern.

“Yeah, I’m worried,” Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Shelley Moore Capito told E&E News when asked about the possibility of losing funding for West Virginia’s hydrogen hub. ​“It’s a big deal for us.”

The uncertainty only adds to the challenges facing the hydrogen industry.

The Biden administration created a two-pronged hydrogen strategy via the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA’s tax credit for clean hydrogen production, known as 45V, was meant to help spur supply of the fuel. The policy survived the rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed in July, but Republicans shortened the timeline for the write-offs from 10 years to two.

The hydrogen hubs, meanwhile, were meant to coordinate producers and offtakers to create regional ecosystems that could someday be interconnected with pipelines and other infrastructure. Even before the cuts, however, the hubs were struggling to generate enough demand.

“Low demand explains why the West Coast hydrogen ambitions have never amounted to much,” Martin Tengler, the analyst who heads the hydrogen research team at the consultancy BloombergNEF, wrote in a memo to investors Monday. ​“Low demand stems from a lack of incentives such as the quotas or carbon prices that are present in Europe, combined with a focus on sectors where hydrogen use is highly uneconomical.”

As a result, he argued, the decision to slash funding for those two hubs ​“has little direct impact on the pipeline of projects BloombergNEF has expected to come online by 2030.”

Of the six commercial green hydrogen projects larger than 1 megawatt that the consultancy tracked in its latest outlook report, four have reached a final investment decision and just one is operational. ​“All five are very small,” the investor note stated.

In an email to Canary Media, Tengler said the impact of eliminating funding for all the hubs ​“would be negative, but the most important things are the tax credits.”

Back to the States

The hubs won’t necessarily fall apart without the federal grants.

California’s regional hub, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES, plans to continue without the financing and could turn to state funds to make up the difference. The Golden State’s newly overhauled cap-and-invest program is one potential source. The state Clean Truck and Bus Vouchers program, known as HVIP, and the California Energy Commission’s Clean Transportation Program Investment Plans could bolster offtakers.

“California has been a hydrogen hub for many years, and it’s getting bigger and bigger,” Fritz said. ​“It’s already in application. There are people riding on hydrogen fuel-cell buses every day in California.”

Roxana Bekemohammadi, executive director of the U.S. Hydrogen Alliance, said it’s possible that Congress could extend the 45V tax credit before it expires at the end of 2027. But in the meantime, she said, ​“state-level hydrogen incentives are the most stable path forward.”

“The cuts to these hubs seem shortsighted and ultimately will result in the loss of jobs in our country,” said Carrie Schoeneberger, an industrial analyst who covers hydrogen for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ​“This will put the U.S. a step back and threaten U.S. leadership, which is against the stated aims of the current administration for American energy dominance.

AUSTIN, TX, UNITED STATES, October 10, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As American homeowners face an unprecedented surge in energy costs, with electricity prices rising 6.5% nationally and utilities requesting $29 billion in rate increases for 2025, Metal America is helping families build energy-efficient barndominiums that significantly reduce heating and cooling costs through advanced insulation systems and innovative steel construction methods.

Industry experts describe the current situation as an ""unprecedented utility affordability crisis,"" with high temperatures putting additional strain on the electric grid and driving electricity system costs higher. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports residential electricity prices increased 6.5% year-over-year as of May 2025, reaching an average of 17.47 cents per kilowatt-hour nationally—the fastest price growth since the beginning of the century.

""The dramatic rise in utility costs makes energy efficiency more critical than ever for families building their dream homes,"" said Colin Knutson, founder of Metal America. ""Our comprehensive insulation approach, combined with precision steel construction, creates homes that stay comfortable year-round while protecting homeowners from these escalating energy bills for decades to come.""

RECORD UTILITY INCREASES DRIVE DEMAND FOR EFFICIENT CONSTRUCTION

The impact on households has been severe. Winter heating costs have risen 10% compared to the previous winter, according to EIA's revised February 2025 forecast. The average summer electric bill reached $719 for June-September 2024, representing an 8% year-over-year increase and the highest summer costs in a decade.

Consumer advocacy experts report that more than one-third of households have reduced or skipped paying basic expenses like medicine or food to pay energy bills in the past year. Energy assistance directors warn that families are increasingly afraid to turn on air conditioning because of bill concerns.

COMPREHENSIVE INSULATION STRATEGY ADDRESSES ENERGY CHALLENGES

Metal America's energy efficiency advantage begins with their standard double-bubble insulation included on every build, which acts as both a thermal barrier and moisture control system. The company's comprehensive approach incorporates multiple insulation strategies that often exceed local building code requirements.

The recommended insulation strategy utilizes a proven closed-cell and open-cell foam combination. The process begins with 1-2 inches of closed-cell foam applied directly to metal panels, providing R-6 to R-7 per inch while creating a complete vapor barrier that prevents condensation issues. This is followed by 3-5 inches of open-cell foam providing additional R-value at approximately R-3.5 per inch.

Traditional construction often struggles with thermal bridging and air leakage that can reduce actual energy performance by 20-30%. Metal America's systematic approach creates homes that perform closer to their designed efficiency ratings in real-world conditions.

STEEL CONSTRUCTION ADVANTAGES FOR ENERGY PERFORMANCE

Metal America's 12-gauge steel framing with 4-foot on-center spacing provides unique advantages for energy efficiency beyond structural strength. The steel framework allows for consistent insulation installation without thermal bridging issues common with traditional wood framing, while precision manufacturing ensures better air sealing than site-built construction.

The 26-gauge metal paneling, when properly insulated, creates an extremely durable thermal envelope that maintains performance characteristics for decades without settling, shifting, or degrading like traditional insulation materials.

Understanding that energy efficiency requirements vary significantly across the United States, Metal America works with local building codes and climate zones to optimize insulation strategies for each region. The company's flash-and-batt alternative system combines closed-cell foam with high-performance fiberglass batts for cost-effective code compliance while maintaining excellent moisture control.

ECONOMIC BENEFITS AMID RISING UTILITY COSTS

With utility industry experts warning that bills will continue rising, the durability of steel construction and properly installed insulation systems means energy performance remains consistent over the building's life, unlike traditional construction methods, where efficiency can degrade over time.

""We've taken the durability and cost advantages of metal construction and solved the energy efficiency equation through proper engineering and insulation design,"" said Knutson. ""The result is homes that outperform traditional construction in both comfort and efficiency, providing families with protection against these unprecedented utility cost increases.""

TURNKEY SOLUTION FOR ENERGY-CONSCIOUS BUILDERS

Metal America's complete turnkey service includes working with customers to select the optimal insulation strategy for their climate zone, budget, and performance goals. The company's 9-12 month construction timeline ensures proper installation and quality control throughout the insulation process.

The company's partnership with experienced general contractors ensures that insulation installation meets manufacturer specifications and building codes, while their comprehensive approach addresses all aspects of the thermal envelope from foundation to roof.

States nationwide are struggling to fully understand how much power data centers will actually need in the coming years.
The GMU report suggests requiring more details of a project to be locked in before the energy demand begins to be calculated.
Some of the leaders believe this is leading, in part, to higher utility bills because energy projects are waiting to be put on the grid.
There have been efforts to create a framework for statewide assistance for local regulations around energy projects.","A George Mason University report released Friday looks at how Virginia can meet its mandatory goal of decarbonizing the state’s utility providers while also getting more localities on board for certain energy projects. It comes as Virginia faces critical energy demands as ratepayers and lawmakers consider how to meet those needs and make utility bills more affordable.

The report projects that Virginia will see an 8%increase in energy demand by 2030 and a 20% increase by 2035, driven largely by the growth of data centers and manufacturing. In 2023, the commonwealth was the top energy importer from other states. Nuclear power is providing the heaviest lift of energy production in the state, with natural gas and solar increasing the most in bringing power online.

Adjunct Professor Paul Bubbosh of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason said the report is meant to be practical in light of the state’s energy needs. He said with challenges like the loss of federal incentives for renewable energy projects and supply chain holdups, the state will have to rely on natural gas in part during the interim.

“The complicating factor is that solar and wind are on a levelized cost of energy basis cheaper than natural gas and coal and nuclear power,” Bubbosh said. “However, with the added cost of supply chain issues, it further complicates the picture.”

Natural gas is also facing supply chain challenges for proposed gas plants and with fossil fuels continuing to be a scarce commodity, it will add to the steadily increasing fuel costs, Bubbosh said.

Bubbosh encourages utilities to ramp up their efficiency efforts and consider data center advancement that will allow them to pull less power off of the grid. Under the VCEA, Appalachian Power was expected to make a 2% reduction in energy consumption by 2025, while Dominion was told to reduce by 5%. Dominion has not met those goals and additional reductions will be determined by the State Corporation Commission every three years.

“Virginia has not met its targets in energy efficiency, so it needs to do a lot more in terms of getting consumers to reduce consumption during peak periods,” Bubbosh said.

States nationwide are struggling to fully understand how much power data centers will actually need in the coming years. Many projects are often thrown into the queue before financing or other permits are secured; some data centers may not actually materialize. The GMU report suggests requiring more details of a project to be locked in before the energy demand begins to be calculated.

“One of the key difficulties with a lot of these large load centers is the financing. So they now need to demonstrate that they have the financing in place and that they’re ready to go and that should improve things,” Bubbosh said.

The regional grid operator PJM has taken heat from most of the governors in the coverage area for slow walking the approval of connection permits, largely for solar and wind projects. Some of the leaders believe this is leading, in part, to higher utility bills because energy projects are waiting to be put on the grid.

PJM has pointed to supply chain issues slowing down certain projects already in the queue and delaying their actions. They have also made some reforms to ramp up their permitting process.

But Bubbosh said the real focus should be put on rural Virginia communities, to educate them on renewable energy projects, their own energy needs, and how they can meet their own demand while respecting the local culture.

“The pathway to energy security in Virginia runs through rural Virginia. It’s imperative that the Commonwealth’s government understands that to achieve lasting results, we need to bring those in Virginia, whom we’re asking so much of, such as their land, to be part of the conversation,” Bubbosh said.

There have been efforts to create a framework for statewide assistance for local regulations around energy projects. Currently, it is up to local boards of supervisors to vote if a solar, wind, gas, or nuclear project can move forward and what the related ordinances will entail. In some counties, the boards have approved a power-hungry data center project application and denied a solar farm proposal the same night.

The GMU report urges local grassroots movements to aid in creating community energy-need assessments to help rural communities understand which projects need to be built out to keep their own lights on, rather than sending power up north to Data Center Alley.

“The problem with Virginia is legislators are trying to ram through siting requirements at the state level. That will backfire, and you will get greater resistance to large scale solar deployment,” Bubbosh said. “So what we’re trying to do is to say, if you really want to achieve lasting results and energy security, you’ve got to bring on rural Virginians.”

The report suggests expanding solar projects in Northern Virginia where the power need is the greatest. Then the energy will be right at the source of the need. Once the northern parts of the state’s infrastructure has been sufficiently expanded, it would be easier to ask other communities to build out their energy infrastructure.

“Then I believe it would be appropriate for Virginia legislators to turn around and say, ‘Look, we all want to keep the lights on. We have exhausted the full potential in Northern Virginia and now we want to turn our attention to, let’s say, the Southside, or Tidewater’,” Bubbosh said.

Their goal with the report and recommendations is to aid state and local governments in moving forward with solid plans on how to meet the growing energy demands, no matter which party is dominant in the legislature or who occupies the Governor’s Mansion. That will help move the needle on siting issues, researchers hope.

“One administration is gonna come in and they’re gonna want to favor these technologies, A, B, and C. Four years later, another one’s gonna come in, and you’re gonna go back and forth,” Bubbosh said.

Bills spelling out how the state may aid communities in their energy plans are expected to be filed in the next regular legislative session, beginning in January.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_121846-1-1024x7681760120726.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=tK6hqFPG,N,,2025-10-10 16:03:29.309418

The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada.
That includes final EISs for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.
The Solar Energy Industries Association did not respond to requests for comment.
Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.","“The administration wants to stop these projects, period, so there is no chance for approval,” he said.

Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, agreed. “As the Trump administration continues to take actions hostile to renewable energy projects, that may not be the last solar project on federal land to cancel,” he said.

The Bureau of Land Management on Thursday updated its planning website for the Esmeralda 7 project to note that the environmental review of the project was “cancelled.”

The decision to cancel the programmatic environmental impact statement was described by a federal government official with knowledge of the situation, who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly, as a mutual decision by BLM and the handful of companies that had proposed the seven individual solar power projects that would have comprised Esmeralda 7.

The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”

Representatives with the energy companies involved in developing the seven individual solar power plants that collectively comprised the Esmeralda 7 project did not respond to requests for comment.

The Trump administration has made its skepticism of the solar build-out in Nevada clear in recent months, with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and other officials saying solar is an “intermittent” technology that doesn’t provide reliable energy. But some conservationists alarmed by the proposed rollout of large solar projects in Nevada and other Western states celebrated the demise of Esmeralda 7, saying as designed it took up up far too much land.

“Friends of Nevada Wilderness is thrilled that this poorly sited project is dead,” said Shaaron Netherton, the group’s executive director.

“In the push to get this particular project through, the BLM ignored the importance of this region’s cultural significance, biological significance and the fact that it is one of the most intact landscapes remaining in Nevada,” Netherton added.

BLM in July 2024 issued a draft programmatic environmental impact statement for the project and had originally planned to issue a final review document in April.

At least 35 commercial-scale solar power projects that were under at least preliminary review by BLM when President Donald Trump took office still await action.

That includes final EISs for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.

What’s more, two major solar projects that were issued records of decision in the final weeks of the Biden administration have since sat in limbo — the Jove Solar Project in southwest Arizona and the Rough Hat Clark County Solar Project in southern Nevada, with a combined capacity to power 350,000 homes.

Burgum and his department have increasingly tightened the restrictions on solar and wind projects. Burgum signed a secretarial order that directed the agency, among other things, to eliminate policies granting “preferential treatment” for wind and solar development on federal lands and waters. The department also issued guidance to agency leaders that Burgum and Deputy Secretary Kate MacGregor would need to review a long list of procedural decisions for those projects.

Burgum in August also signed an order that requires Interior to consider “capacity density” when evaluating solar and wind projects, which could hinder them because they tend to take up more land than other kinds of energy development.

The Solar Energy Industries Association did not respond to requests for comment.

But Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA’s president and CEO, sent a letter to Burgum in August asking to meet with him to discuss his agency’s moves to restrict permit approvals for renewable energy.

Interior informally declined the meeting request, according to an industry official granted anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Concerns about project’s size

The Esmeralda 7 project was ambitious by most any measure.

It included seven individual solar projects and would have covered about 63,000 acres of BLM rangelands. If built as imagined, it could have produced about 5,350 MW of electricity — enough to power nearly 2 million homes.

Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.

On the surface, at least, the project appeared to be proposed in an ideal spot in Esmeralda County.

The federal government controls 98 percent of the county’s 2.2 million acres, and BLM accounts for the vast majority of that — managing 2.1 million acres there.

There’s not a single incorporated town, and only about 729 residents, ranking it among the 20 least populated counties in the nation, with the nation’s second-lowest population density of residents per square mile.

But the project had garnered concerns about its sheer size and the potential for it to disturb migratory patterns for wildlife.

Conservation advocates, local government leaders and nearby residents have expressed concerns about the cumulative environmental impacts of the proposed Esmeralda 7 project, which in addition to covering a huge swath of desert lands would have also included miles of roads and associated transmission lines.

They have argued for placing onshore utility-scale projects on previously disturbed sites and expanding the use of rooftop solar.

The Esmeralda 7 project “would have destroyed significant archaeology sites, rare plants, bighorn sheep habitat and wilderness quality lands,” said Kevin Emmerich, a co-founder of Nevada-based Basin and Range Watch.

The cancellation of the project “will give us a chance to protect the tremendous resources of the area, including beautiful and wild mountain ranges and valleys, rare plant populations, and bighorn sheep,” said Laura Cunningham, a biologist with Western Watersheds Project.

“Paleontological fossil beds [the Esmeralda Formation] here were formative to understanding the geological history of the Great Basin,” Cunningham added. “This is good news for recreationists and for conservation efforts of an amazing landscape.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F4a%2Fdb%2F0757e1e94a558b25616284763f8a%2F29730315801-859a5b0540-c-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 18:03:05.906238

A new study confirms that commonsense workplace protections from extreme heat — water, shade, breaks — help save workers from being injured on the job.

The finding — something labor and climate advocates have long known and pushed for in public policy — comes just as the federal government shutdown may have suspended the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s lengthy rulemaking process to create the U.S.’s first-ever nationwide heat standard for workers.

Some experts now fear that the agency, which ordinarily takes about seven years on average to establish new rules, will face further delays.

In order to calculate the risk of injury on hot days, researchers from the public health schools at Harvard University and George Washington University utilized OSHA’s database for workplace injuries, pulling nearly 900,000 cases from 2023.

They found that 28,000 injuries were attributable to heat, and that workers in all industry sectors, including those who mostly work indoors, were impacted. The study, published this week, also found that the risk for injury starts to increase when the heat index, a measure of how temperatures really feel to the human body, reaches 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and then becomes even more likely once the heat index passes 90.

“This study elegantly confirms what all of us have experienced,” said Charlotte Brody, vice president of health initiatives at the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor and environmental groups. “When it gets really hot, it’s hard to do hard work safely. And the hotter it gets, the more clumsy and fuzzy thinking we get.”

‘First big picture look’ at state heat standards

Much of the prior research on the impact of heat on workers has focused on illnesses caused by exposure to high temperatures — such at heat stroke, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. By examining the likelihood of workplace injuries on hot days, researchers are revealing other hidden costs of extreme heat — for both laborers and employers.

“It’s very clear that heat causes more than simply heat illness and unfortunately heat fatalities,” said David Michaels, one of the authors of the study and a professor at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.

“But it also causes thousands of injuries every year. When you’re working in heat, you can much more easily make mistakes.” Michaels also served as the head of OSHA from 2009 to 2017.

“The numbers on this one are a little bit eye-opening,” said Juanita Constible, a senior advocate for environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who described this study as the first national look at the impact of heat on workplace injury. (Barrak Alahmad, lead author of the study and senior research scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said his team was not aware of any other nationwide study that covered the contiguous United States.)

Constible added that worker injuries hurt employers’ pocketbooks in the form of workers’ compensation claims. Recently, the insurance company Liberty Mutual found that worker injuries cost employers more than $58 billion in 2021.

Crucially, the study also found that states that have enacted their own heat standards to protect workers had a lower risk of injury on hot days compared to states that lack such rules. Constible considered this “the most critical piece of the paper.” She added, “It’s the first big picture look that we have at how well standards are working to reduce these kinds of traumatic health problems.”

The idea that working on hot days may not just be uncomfortable, but also potentially dangerous, is likely not surprising to labor and climate advocates. It’s also probably unsurprising to anyone who has had to work on hot days.

“People know it intuitively when they’re out mowing their lawn for a few hours and they get really hot and miserable, right?” said Constible. “It impairs our judgment, makes our hands slippy, affects our posture.”

With time, the human body can become acclimated to hotter temperatures. But employers often use this to justify not providing basic necessities like water, rest breaks, and shade to workers, said Brody. “This study shows that hot weather creates more workplace injuries and that a commonsense heat rule matters,” she said.

Shutdown complicates OSHA rulemaking on heat

OSHA is currently in the process of receiving final comments from parties that testified on a Biden-era proposal for a national heat rule earlier this year. But the federal government shutdown could potentially drag on or complicate this phase. “I think we can expect that this will lead to delays in promulgating an OSHA rule,” said Brody.

Constible, who testified at an OSHA hearing on the proposed heat rule in June, said that what the ultimate impact of the shutdown will be is unclear. For now, the online portal through which she and others can submit final comments to the agency remains active. Since the shutdown began last Wednesday, OSHA has not extended its deadline for comments, which is currently Oct. 30.

But could a prolonged federal funding shortage change that? The online portal is, after all, just a website, that “like all the others, requires maintenance,” said Constible. Without that, “the question is: Will it continue to work?” She noted that there is an option to email comments to the agency. “If the deadline does not get extended and the website’s not working, then we’ll just start emailing. Or I’ll walk down to OSHA’s office.”

Grist’s emailed request to OSHA for comment returned an automatic message citing the government shutdown as a reason why the account is not being monitored.

Even if the current heat standard proposal continues to move through OSHA without a shutdown-related delay, Constible and Brody expressed concern it may ultimately be watered down — due to industry groups who say following standards is expensive and burdensome and President Donald Trump’s deregulatory agenda.

Michaels, however, argued that, “if the Trump administration recognizes the importance of protecting workers, they will issue a strong standard.”

The average permitting process takes four to five years to complete, which delays an estimated total of $1.5 trillion in investment.

Permit delays impact telecommunications, transit, and dozens of other industries. For example, more than 3,000 homes and businesses in Bedford County, Virginia, were supposed to be connected to the internet via fiber cables by October 2025, but the project was postponed to June 2026, in part due to the problems with obtaining a railroad-crossing permit. An August 4, 2025, Los Angeles Times article noted that third-party permitting requirements were among the reasons for the excessive costs and delays in California’s High-Speed Rail project.

Congress and the Trump administration are working to modernize the permitting process. On July 25, 2025, House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) introduced H.R. 4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, which would shorten permitting timelines and limit the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act. On September 9, 2025, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced new guidance on preconstruction permitting requirements for power generation and reshoring manufacturing projects. At the state level, the National Governors Association has urged Congress to be more proactive about permitting change, while governors are taking legislative action in their states.

‘Pueblo is being robbed‘ Elected officials and community leaders in Pueblo County are not happy with the plan.","As Colorado darts toward a future powered by “clean” energy, a battle is brewing in Pueblo, where coal closures, union jobs and lost tax revenue collide with a community demanding a solution as its power plants are a primary target for a shutdown.

Between 2025 and 2031, six more coal-fired power plants in Colorado are scheduled to be shut down or converted to another energy source, such as natural gas.

With more than 800 jobs to be affected, another three plants are on the list for future closures.

The closures are raising alarm bells, notably for the unions that count the power plant workers as members. A group has put forward an action plan called the Colorado Energy Compact, calling for a “balanced and sustainable energy policy” and a transition that is “clear, stable, and grounded in the realities of our grid, our workforce, and our economy.”

Besides unions and jobs, taxes paid to local communities are also a major worry, with revenue ranging from 12% of the total collected in Pueblo County to as high as 33.7% in Moffat County.

The compact is drawing together more than two dozen organizations and individual experts in energy, labor and public policy, according to Action Colorado’s Sara Blackhurst.

The plan is designed as both a tool and an accountability check for lawmakers and regulators, focusing on a state standard that, the compact maintains, should be technology-neutral and which supports a balanced mix of current and emerging technologies. The goal, the compact said, is to ensure a transition that benefits Colorado’s environmental and economic future, protects families, and sustains local economies.

The fight over Comanche plants

In Pueblo, residents are fighting back to keep the Comanche power plants open. They oppose wind or solar energy, which they claim is unreliable.

The Comanche station just south of Pueblo is a 695-acre site with a rail system, water contracts, transmission capacity and injection, according to a report from the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee. It includes three coal-generating units “that have provided highly-paid, family supporting jobs and tax payments of tens of millions of dollars for decades,” the report said.

Comanche 1 closed in 2022. Comanche 2 will close in 2025. Comanche 3, which opened in 2010, will close no later than Jan. 1, 2031, about 10 years ahead of schedule.

The controversy surrounding the Comanche power plants comes at a time when the Trump administration has withdrawn support for “clean” energy, cutting over $500 million in grants to Colorado companies and universities. Additionally, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a Colorado native, said he wants to “unleash American energy at home and abroad.” Wright said America should focus on ensuring a wide array of cheap, abundant and sustainable energy sources that include geothermal, nuclear, oil and gas.

The campaign to save the Comanche plants suggests a major battle is brewing over the two Xcel units in Pueblo.

The Colorado Fiscal Institute, in a Sept. 2024 report, said the closure of Comanche 3 alone will cost about 77 jobs and about $31 million annually in tax revenue to the Pueblo community.

The same report said the Environmental Protection Agency’s CO-Benefits Risk Assessment tool estimated that closing Comanche 3 would result in avoided health costs benefiting Colorado between $52 million and $67 million annually, with Pueblo County specifically benefiting between $4.6 million and $5.6 million.

The report downplayed the benefits of nuclear energy as a replacement energy source and instead recommended wind and solar.

On the opposite side, the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, a group initiated by Xcel Energy and made up of community leaders, has looked at potential replacements for the energy sources at Comanche 3.

The PIESAC group is led by attorney Frances Koncilja and investor Corinne Koehler; members Jerry Bellah, vice president of IBEW local 8; Sara Blackhurst of Action Colorado; Russell De Salvo, who heads the Pueblo Depot Authority; Patty Erjavec, former president of Pueblo Community College; former judge Dennis Maes; Timothy Mottet, a former president of CSU-Pueblo; Duane Nava, head of the Greater Pueblo Chamber; Jeff Shaw, president of Pueblo Economic Development; and former Pueblo County Commissioner Chris Wiseman.

The group’s report, which came out in January 2024, looked at all the impacts, noting “the Pueblo community has supported these early closures and done more to reduce emissions in the state than any other community.”

The report said the economic hit from closing Comanche 3 would total $196 million to Pueblo and result in the loss of hundreds of high-wage, career-level jobs. Pueblo would lose more than $845 million in tax revenues by 2070, the report added.

Its proposed solution: “Of all the technologies we studied, only advanced nuclear generation will make Pueblo whole and also provide a path to prosperity.”

The group believes that nuclear power would support 200 to 300 permanent high-paying jobs and generate $95 million in local property taxes.

The backup plan is combined cycle natural gas plant with carbon capture for 20 to 25 long-term jobs and about $16.5 million in annual tax revenue.

Wind and solar would generate “a handful of non-union jobs” and about $2 million annually in tax revenue, PIESAC said.

‘Just transition’

In August, the Public Utilities Commission deliberated on the first phase of a $15 billion “just transition” energy resource plan submitted by Xcel, Colorado’s largest utility company and operator of the Pueblo plants, that includes the future of the Comanche operations.

The plan is tied to a settlement agreement reached in 2022 between Xcel and partners that include state agencies, environmental groups, local governments, including the city of Pueblo and Pueblo County, and large customers, such as Walmart, and labor unions.

The “just transition” plan would add more than 6,000 megawatts of new generation and storage. Over the next five years, Xcel would add 10,000 megawatts of new generation and storage capacity. Final approval of both phases of the plan, according to Xcel, is expected sometime next year.

The settlement agreement aims to keep Pueblo “whole” regarding tax revenue by compensating the county for property tax revenue due to the acceleration of the retirement date of Comanche 3.

During the meeting, PUC Chair Eric Blank called the “just transition” plan the “single largest resource acquisition in the history of Colorado and an over $15 billion commitment from customers.”

The plan’s cost raised worries among the commission about its potential for “exorbitant” hikes in utility rates to ratepayers.

The PUC said it would issue a final decision on the first phase in the coming weeks.

In a statement issued by the Colorado Energy Office after the meeting, Gov. Jared Polis said he is “enthusiastic about the plan to save people money and achieve faster pollution reductions while bringing new jobs to communities and investing in rural Colorado.”

Polis added that “the free market is driving the transition to clean energy in a way that will help people hold on to more of their hard-earned money, clean our air, achieve energy independence, and continue our state’s economic growth.”

For its part, Xcel said it is committed to supporting its workforce both in Pueblo and Hayden with “reskilling and retraining programs, and efforts to retain employees in both the short and long term.” The company also said it is committed to addressing the tax revenue issue and listening to the voices of local leaders.

‘Pueblo is being robbed‘

Elected officials and community leaders in Pueblo County are not happy with the plan.

At the end of August, Pueblo County commissioners fought back, telling the PUC through a filing that they had invested limited financial resources and time to participate in the PUC’s proceeding, “as well as the promised follow-on ‘Pueblo Just Transition Solicitation’ to ensure that the residents of Pueblo County would receive a meaningful ‘Just Transition’ from a coal community to a high tech clean energy hub.”

The county also spent $2 million on the PIESAC study to develop clean energy generation options for Pueblo, and if implemented, those options, they said, would render Pueblo “whole.”

The commissioners claimed other partners in a settlement agreement, including the Colorado Energy Office, ignored Pueblo’s “bargained-for solutions.” They accused the Colorado Energy Office, the Office of Just Transitions and the Utility Consumer Advocate, which is part of PUC, of failing to act in good faith, including failing to consider the option of small modular nuclear reactors as a replacement energy source.

The commissioners asked that Comanche 2 and Comanche 3 continue to operate, saying they would approach the Trump administration and Wright, the energy secretary, “until replacement generation is constructed in Pueblo.”

“The (PUC) has made it clear that it is a futile exercise to participate in these proceedings,” the county commissioners wrote.

The local electrical worker union in Pueblo also weighed in through a letter submitted to U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Grand Junction, whose district includes Pueblo.

In a Sept. 10 letter, Jerry Bellah, international vice president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, told Hurd his group supports green energy “but that the green jobs being offered to Pueblo do not come close to replacing the jobs that are currently at Comanche.”

Bellah said the handful of solar farm jobs are low-paying positions.

“For too long, the hardworking men and women of the IBEW have been ignored with false promises of middle-class, family-supporting jobs in exchange for our support in closing coal plants,” Bellah wrote. “We are smart enough, however, to know when we are getting the shaft, which is what is being done to the Pueblo community and the workers at Comanche. We all deserve better than this.”

Bellah noted Hurd had reached out to Trump to keep Comanche open and said his group would “support any elected leader, regardless of party, who supports jobs, and we will oppose any elected leader who votes to end our jobs.”

Pueblo County voters have now twice voted for Trump over his Democratic opponents.

Blackhurst of Action Colorado added that the union jobs issue is the primary reason for the energy compact.

“Pueblo is being robbed,” she told Colorado Politics. “They (state government) have made labor workers acceptable collateral,” as well as the communities in which they live and work.

The Colorado Energy Compact

Led by Action Colorado, the compact’s authors intend for it to provide a roadmap for building an energy future that is “ambitious, achievable, and rooted in Colorado’s best interests.”

It focuses on five areas — affordability and economic competitiveness; labor, community and “just transition;” energy system reliability and feasibility; legal and regulatory integrity; and transparency and accountability.

The first focus area, on affordability, would look at the cost to consumers, protecting the tax revenue base and long-term economic resilience.

The second focus — on labor and community — said any legislation or regulation should ensure comparable wages and benefits, as well as “enforceable” retraining, union participation and local hiring. It also calls for policies that allow workers to stay in their current communities.

A survey conducted by Colorado Mountain College and the state Office of Just Transition, and as reported by the Steamboat Pilot in March, said 61% of workers at the Craig Xcel plant and the Colowyo and Trapper mines want to stay in their local communities if they transition to new jobs.

The third focus — on energy system reliability — calls for a “realistic” phasing of timelines tied to permitting, workforce readiness and infrastructure — “not political deadlines.” It also recognizes the role of natural gas and emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, geothermal and nuclear power, which was added to the state’s list of “clean” energy technologies by the legislature in the 2025 session.

In the focus on legal and regulatory integrity, the compact said terms like “clean energy” and “eligible technologies” must be defined in law, not by regulators.

Additionally, transparency and accountability must include an open stakeholder process, with full notice and “without surprises” and models made public and independently validated, the compact said. It should also include a regular public review.

“Without accountability,” the compact said, “even well-intentioned rules look like closed-door deals and public trust collapses.”

Blackhurst told Colorado Politics that the groups behind the compact are sharing it with lawmakers, hoping it would provide a tool for reviewing legislation in the future.

That’s critical, Blackhurst said, as the PUC is going through a sunset review in the 2026 session.

A fact sheet provided to the Town of Gilchrist earlier this year stated that the compact, unlike the governor’s “top-down” Clean Energy Planning process, is more inclusive and offers a framework rooted in local control.

It is not a lobbying effort, the fact sheet insisted. But “without stakeholder-driven guardrails, the direction will be set by others — without you in the room,” it said.

Gilchrist town councilmembers unanimously approved joining the compact in August, along with providing some financial support.

Office of Just Transition

Approved by legislation in 2019, the Office of Just Transition focuses on economic development for communities affected by the closure of coal mines.

For the past several years, the office, with 3.5 full-time employees, has spent about $15 million annually on community development, worker education, and training for those areas.

What’s missing, many said, is wage parity — what workers earn when they transition from high-paying jobs to whatever comes next.

The BlueGreen Alliance, in a 2023 report, pointed to the wage parity issue.

When coal mines close, workers are vulnerable to job loss, and many will struggle to find comparable employment that aligns with their existing skills, experience, and compensation levels, according to the report.

The office has made progress in economic development by supporting small businesses and entrepreneurship, the report added. But the opportunities to find local “high-road” jobs for former coal workers have been missed.

“The quality of the job — such as the benefits offered like health insurance, a retirement plan, and workers’ compensation benefits, or wage parity to previous employment — is not being considered in program development or implementation” for OJT, the alliance said.

‘Extreme claims‘

In a response to Pueblo commissioners on Sept. 12, several environmental groups said any decision by PUC to change votes would lead to further controversy and litigation over procedural improprieties.

That’s a reference to comments by Blank, the PUC chairman, in a Sept. 4 hearing that he is considering taking “another look at some of the labor issues raised in the county’s response,” as well as revisiting a prior vote tied to Xcel’s plans for “credits for resource located in communities with retiring coal plants,” a main concern raised by Pueblo County.

The credits are part of a Near Term Procurement request by Xcel — a solicitation for the development of energy generation that would draw federal and state tax credits.

The coalition of environmental groups includes GreenLatinos, the Sierra Club, Vote Solar, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Physicians for Social Responsibility Colorado.

“Moreover, promising to revisit votes in response to baseless accusations of political bias and extreme claims (including a threat to invite federal interference) sets problematic precedent and may incentivize parties to make similarly baseless and extreme claims in the future to get the Commission’s attention when they are displeased with the Commissioner’s oral deliberations and decisions,” the coalition said.

The coalition, in particular, took issue with Blank’s statements and the Sept. 4 hearing, which the group said hinted at “unfairness,” since the PUC had already deliberated on the Xcel plan in August and failed to provide opportunities to other parties to address the issues raised by Pueblo County.

By revisiting votes on the Xcel plan, the PUC would reward Pueblo County for “flouting the Commission’s well-established hearing and deliberations process” without allowing other parties the same opportunity, the coalition said.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/default-social-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 19:02:45.328168

Esmeralda 7 was supposed to produce a gargantuan 6.2 gigawatts of power – equal to nearly all the power supplied to southern Nevada by the state’s primary public utility. It would do so with a sprawling web of solar panels and batteries across the western Nevada desert. Backed by NextEra Energy, Invenergy, ConnectGen and other renewables developers, the project was moving forward at a relatively smooth pace under the Biden administration, albeit with significant concerns raised by environmentalists about its impacts on wildlife and fauna. And Esmeralda 7 even received a rare procedural win in the early days of the Trump administration when the Bureau of Land Management released the draft environmental impact statement for the project.

When Esmeralda 7’s environmental review was released, BLM said the record of decision would arrive in July. But that never happened. Instead, Donald Trump issued an executive order as part of a deal with conservative hardliners in Congress to pass his tax megabill, which also effectively repealed the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable electricity tax credits. This led to subsequent actions by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to freeze all federal permitting decisions for solar energy.

Carmaker walks back program that would have allowed dealers to offer $7,500 US tax credit

Ford Motor is walking back a program that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 US tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired Sept. 30, the company said on Thursday.

""Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today,"" a spokesperson said.

The decision follows a similar move from General Motors on Wednesday. While automakers including Hyundai and Stellantis have offered cash off incentives to bridge the gap for buyers, Ford and GM took a different approach.

The in-house lending arms at these two automakers planned to initiate the purchase of EVs in dealers’ inventory, and the companies would apply for the $7,500 SU credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0 percent financing for 72 months and other incentives, a spokesperson said.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. It is unclear why Ford canceled its program.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: A Rhode Island labor union earlier this week filed a lawsuit to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency’s effort to cancel $7 billion in funding for the Solar for All program. The initiative established by the Biden Inflation Reduction Act helped low-income communities install solar energy, while creating jobs in the field.

Amy Romero, chief legal counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island said, “Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy.”

“EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy insecurity in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this program,” Romero said.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PULLS THE PLUG ON NEVADA SOLAR PROJECT: The Bureau of Land Management canceled Nevada’s massive solar project yesterday evening.

The department updated its planning website for the Esmeralda 7 solar project, stating that the environmental review has been “canceled.” The agency did not provide a reason for the cancellation. The project cancellation was first reported by Heatmap.

The Esmeralda 7 project would have built seven solar power plants with battery energy storage on nearly 118,000 acres of federal land near Tonopah, Nevada. The project would have produced nearly 6.2 gigawatts of power.

The cancellation of the project is part of a series of moves by the Trump administration to stymie clean energy projects. BLM’s move furthers the administration’s efforts to hinder renewable energy sources like offshore wind projects.

TRUMP RESPONDS TO CHINA ON RARE EARTHS: President Donald Trump responded this morning to China’s move to curb rare earth element exports by threatening a “massive” increase in tariffs.

“There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘Magnets’ and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least,” the president wrote in a post to Truth Social.

He also threatened unspecified other “countermeasures,” and suggested that he would be canceling the planned meeting with Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Korea later this month.

KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE REVIVAL: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said today that a proposal to revive the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta to the U.S. could help economies of both countries.

“We are looking for areas where the integration of our economies will be better for us both. We have opportunities in the energy sector – there are many possible projects, including Keystone XL, but there are others,” Carney said at a press conference, Reuters reports.

Carney floated the idea during a meeting with Trump earlier this week to discuss easing tariffs. The approvals for the pipeline permits have fluctuated depending on the administration in power.

Former President Barack Obama denied the pipeline’s permit. It was later revived during Trump’s first term, and then it was revoked by former President Joe Biden.

CURTIS TO LEAD COP30 DELEGATION: Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah will lead a bipartisan delegation to the COP30 global climate conference next month in Brazil, alongside Sen. Chris Coons.

Curtis told E&E News that at least three other Republicans expressed interest in the trip.

There won’t be an executive branch delegation, as the relevant State Department offices have been limited by the shutdown.

“We have an agenda that is really coming together nicely. We’re super happy with it,” Curtis told the outlet.

For years now, Curtis has been one of the Republicans most engaged on the issue of climate change. As a member of the House, he formed a GOP group dedicated to climate change.

OIL DROPS BELOW $60 AS RISKS DECLINE: Oil prices hit the lowest levels in months as traders digested the implementation of the peace deal between Israel and Hamas.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell below the $60 a barrel mark this morning, a drop of nearly 4%. Brent crude dipped below $63.

“Finally having some kind of peace process in the Middle East is lowering the shoulders a little bit,” Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, told Reuters. He said that the deal could ease fears about oil tankers passing through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea.

‘DRILL, BABY, DRILL’ UPDATE: The U.S. oil and gas rig count fell this week by two to 547, Baker Hughes said today.

The rig count is now down 7% on the year.

The lower prices this week will likely not help with the pessimism in the industry.

STORM TO HIT THE EAST COAST THIS WEEKEND: A nor’easter storm is set to hit the East Coast this weekend, bringing flooding, heavy winds, and beach erosion.

The storm is forecast to develop off the Florida coast and then move northward this weekend into next week. There is potential for major flooding in places like North Carolina, New Jersey, and Cape Cod.

What is a nor’easter? It is a storm that occurs along the East Coast, bringing coastal winds inland. The wind direction is what defines a nor’easter. The storm carries winds from the northeast at around 58 mph or more. It could cause beach erosion and coastal flooding.

“This will be a damaging storm for some along the Atlantic coast,” AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.

TEN LARGE NUCLEAR REACTORS UNDERWAY IN NEXT FIVE YEARS? BECHTEL SAYS YES: Bechtel CEO Craig Albert said that it is possible to have 10 new large nuclear plants under construction in the next five years, if the risks of projects are shared properly among stakeholders. That aligns with the goal laid out in Trump’s nuclear power executive order.

“Everyone at the table realizes they’re going to have to take on more risk than they have in the past,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg.

Bechtel has built 80% of the U.S. nuclear fleet, including the most recently built one, the Vogtle plant in Georgia. That project was subject to huge cost overruns.

Albert said that the company would be willing to take on more risks for future projects. In the past, it has been paid based on its time and effort.

U.S. WEIGHS FUNDING FOR GREENLAND’S POLAR BEARS: State Department officials are working on proposals to spend $50 million protecting polar bears in Greenland and $25 million for snow leopards in Nepal, the Washington Post reports.

That would equate to around $100,000 per polar bear.

The funding is especially noteworthy because the Trump administration has tried to slash funding not aligned with its America First agenda.

The publication notes that some observers have flagged that the two countries in question are particularly sensitive with respect to the Trump administration’s aims. Trump, of course, has repeatedly discussed taking control of Greenland. And Nepal is of geopolitical importance because of its location between China and India.

Trump’s nomination of Douglas Troutman to be the Environmental Protection Agency’s assistant administrator for toxic substances fell along partisan lines at a confirmation hearing Oct. 8: Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee praised his experience, while Democrats voiced concerns about his industry ties. Both sides asked him about efforts to speed up chemical reviews under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), but from different perspectives.

Ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) called Troutman an “industry operative” who “has spent his entire career as a lobbyist for oil, gas, and chemical interests . . . aping the fossil fuel disinformation campaign to undermine science and obstruct efforts aimed at protecting people from pollution.”

Whitehouse said in his opening remarks that he has “zero confidence that Mr. Troutman cares either about chemical safety or pollution prevention.”

But Republicans, including EPW chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said Troutman’s tenure at the American Cleaning Institute—a cleaning products industry association, where he led legal and government affairs for more than a decade—has prepared him well for the role.

Troutman couldn’t respond directly to Whitehouse’s opening remarks but said in his testimony that, if confirmed, he is committed to working to “provide a clean, safe environment, with an eye toward strong economic growth.”

Questions on PFAS, new chemical reviews

Capito kicked off questioning by asking Troutman about the speed and efficiency of chemical safety reviews under TSCA, which Troutman would oversee. “American innovators need certainty,” she told Troutman, before asking, “What specific reforms would you pursue to achieve both faster reviews and predictable, commercially viable outcomes?”

Troutman did not cite any specific reforms, but he said he would follow statutory requirements while welcoming new staff and information technology resources that will help deliver his promise to press for more “timely” and “certain” reviews of chemicals.

The EPA has taken a number of steps this year to streamline its process for reviewing new chemicals. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced a program last month to begin “expeditious reviews” of chemicals relevant to the buildout of data center infrastructure for the artificial intelligence sector.

Troutman said that his intent is for “nothing to change with regard to [EPA’s] robust reviews of new and existing chemicals based on the risk-based process under TSCA.” But Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) pushed back. “Zeldin said that the Trump EPA is going to ‘get out of the way,’ so that these [data centers] can be built without protections against toxic chemicals,” he told Troutman. “I'm not hearing you say that you’re going to stand up to him.”

Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) pressed Troutman on the health risks of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), microplastics, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals highlighted in the White House’s recent Make America Healthy Again report and stressed the need for clear action to minimize harm that can come from the use of plastics. Troutman acknowledged the concerns and alluded to ongoing EPA programs and interagency strategies but offered few specifics.

“I’m expecting a strategy of doing nothing,” Merkley said. “I’d love for you to surprise us.”

Pesticides use was also discussed at length. “Crop protection tools such as glyphosate and dicamba are critical to modern agricultural practices,” Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-NB) said. He urged Troutman to propose some kind of reform to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the nation’s primary federal pesticide law. FIFRA regulates pesticides in a way that “doesn’t reflect what’s really happening on farmers’ fields,” Ricketts said. Troutman said that, if confirmed, he’s committed to following FIFRA’s risk-based statutory requirements.

Several lawmakers, including Merkley and Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA), grilled Troutman on the EPA’s recently proposed changes to implementing TSCA that would, among other things, limit the agency’s consideration of fence-line or “overburdened” communities when assessing the risks of chemicals.

“We see in study after study that cancer rates are higher around certain facilities,” Merkley said. But, “when asked if you believe certain communities have higher risk to harmful chemicals, you chose not to answer with a simple yes or no,” Padilla told Troutman. Instead, Troutman made “a big circular, bureaucratic journey around the question,” Merkley said.

The committee will accept written questions from senators, along with the nominee’s responses, by Oct. 17 and 27, respectively, and will then deliberate and vote on whether to advance Troutman's nomination to the full Senate.

New factory in Austin to anchor U.S. energy resilience and grid modernisation efforts.

Participation in Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource program enables homeowners to feed power directly into the grid.

Austin startup aims to decentralize the grid

Base Power, a fast-growing energy technology company based in Austin, has raised $1 billion in Series C funding to accelerate the rollout of home battery systems across the United States. The round was led by venture firm Addition, with participation from Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, and Elad Gil, as well as new investors including Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

The funding positions Base Power among the most well-capitalized startups in the U.S. energy transition, reflecting investor confidence in distributed energy solutions as the grid faces mounting strain from extreme weather, ageing infrastructure, and rising electrification demand.

CEO and co-founder Zach Dell said the company is driven by a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvent how power is generated, stored, and shared. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality,” he said.

Distributed storage meets domestic manufacturing

Base Power’s business model revolves around leasing batteries directly to homeowners, offering reliable backup power while allowing participants to sell excess energy back to the grid. This decentralised system strengthens grid resilience and helps integrate renewable energy, addressing one of the core challenges of the U.S. clean energy transition: balancing supply and demand in real time.

As part of its expansion strategy, Base Power is developing its first energy storage and power electronics manufacturing facility at the former Austin American-Statesman printing press site in downtown Austin. The company plans to establish additional facilities to meet surging demand for distributed battery systems.

“The only way to add capacity to the grid is by physically deploying hardware,” said co-founder and COO Andrew Lopas. “We need to make that hardware here in the U.S., ourselves. This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning our second.”

By investing in domestic production, Base Power is aligning with national efforts to reindustrialize the energy sector, reduce dependence on imported components, and strengthen supply chain resilience — a priority under the Biden administration’s clean energy and manufacturing policies.

Powering the grid from the ground up

Base Power recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, allowing it to aggregate thousands of home batteries and sell electricity directly into the state’s power market. The initiative could prove pivotal for grid operators struggling with growing demand volatility and the integration of intermittent renewables.

The company’s distributed model also complements recent federal initiatives encouraging grid-edge technologies, such as the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program. With utilities and regulators seeking cost-effective ways to improve reliability, distributed batteries — collectively acting as “virtual power plants” — are emerging as a scalable alternative to large, centralized infrastructure.

For investors, the model offers exposure to one of the fastest-growing segments of the energy transition: behind-the-meter storage. BloombergNEF projects U.S. residential battery capacity could increase fivefold by 2030, driven by falling costs, rising solar adoption, and regional incentive programs.

Rebuilding American energy capacity

Beyond its immediate commercial ambitions, Base Power’s approach speaks to a broader transformation in the U.S. energy economy — one that blends software, manufacturing, and local ownership to rebuild resilience from the household level up.

The company’s long-term vision extends beyond residential markets. Executives have indicated interest in expanding to small businesses, microgrids, and community-scale deployments, leveraging the same distributed platform to support energy equity and grid flexibility.

As Lopas put it, “We’re building the infrastructure, systems, tools, processes, supporting software, and team that’s reindustrialising America and reinventing the grid.”

If successful, Base Power’s model could help redefine how power is produced and consumed in the world’s largest economy — turning homes into active participants in the clean energy transition while strengthening the backbone of U.S. grid infrastructure.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Base-Power-Secures-1B-to-scale-U.S.-Home-Battery-Network.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 20:02:45.603667

The state’s efforts to install infrastructure for electric vehicles have fallen short of its goals.

That’s according to a recent audit report from State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. It's a follow-up for an initial audit in 2022.

It determined that NYPA had not placed chargers in optimal locations and failed to review and analyze usage data for better charger placement.

It also found that the New York Power Authority’s installation of high speed EV chargers was as much as two years behind schedule.

For example, of the 200 chargers that were scheduled to be installed by the end of 2019, only 29 had actually been placed by March of 2021.

Amazon prioritized bio-based materials for the facility’s construction, with wood studs instead of metal ones at interior partitions, wood fiber insulation instead of fiberglass, and an ultra-light, lower-carbon alternative to standard drywall.

The retailer also used lower-carbon, bio-based finishes for the acoustic ceilings and flooring and salvaged wood for 43 desks used by the site operations team.

Heat pumps reduce carbon emissions and don’t require burning fossil fuels on-site, while “air curtains,” which prevent outdoor air from entering the building, are intended to reduce air-conditioning usage and boost employee comfort.

In addition, Amazon says the clerestory windows in the warehouse and the glazed glass in the office block bring in enough daylight to allow for less electrical lighting and the interior LED lighting is designed to reduce power usage.

Other sustainable features include a water reclamation system and more than 170 electric-vehicle charging stalls located outside. In total, Amazon says the facility features more than 40 technologies designed to reduce resource usage and shrink its carbon footprint.

""We have experimented with and implemented a lot of sustainability initiatives over the years,"" said Daniel Mallory, VP of global realty, Amazon, in a corporate blog post. ""DII5 continues that effort by taking a culmination of a lot of big ideas not just in how we operate our facilities, but in how we build them. And it’s going to help us as we steadily climb toward our sustainability goals.""

According to Amazon, its ultimate goal in opening the facility is to identify the approaches that are most effective and best suited to be implemented across its building network. The retailer is currently scaling up some of these strategies in other buildings.

(NYSE: TE) (“T1,” “T1 Energy,” or the “Company”) has made a strategic investment in Talon PV LLC (“Talon”), acquiring a minority equity stake in the developer of a solar cell fab.

T1 is advancing its own solar cell fab, the 5 GW G2_Austin project in Rockdale, Texas. The first phase is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2026. Talon is developing a 4.8 GW solar cell plant in Baytown, Texas. Both Texas-based companies plan to utilize advanced manufacturing to produce the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S.

The T1 and Talon projects are examples of American companies investing in American energy, supported by President Trump’s OBBBA and 45x tax credits. The Texas projects are expected to reshore jobs and deliver power to meet rising electrical demand driven by AI, industrialization and residential load growth.

Both projects are expected to meaningfully add domestic manufacturing capacity and produce TOPCon solar cells, the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S. TOPCon cells utilize the quantum tunneling technology awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics earlier this week.

Under terms of the deal, T1 has entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (“SAFE”) to acquire an equity stake in Talon. T1 and Talon remain in discussions to potentially deepen the strategic relationship in the future.

“We are excited by the opportunity to invest in another American solar energy project that complements our G2_Austin development,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “Expanding the output of American solar cells is necessary to support energy security, achieve regulatory compliance and build an American solar industry based on advanced manufacturing and cutting-edge solar technology.”

T1 Energy owns the 5 GW G1_Dallas solar module facility in Wilmer, Texas, and this summer signed a long-term deal with Corning Inc to obtain polysilicon and solar wafers manufactured in Michigan.

“Our partnership with T1 Energy strengthens the foundation of U.S. solar manufacturing. Together, we’re building scalable, non-FEOC supply chains that deliver true domestic content and reinforce America’s energy independence and national security,” said Adam Tesanovich, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Talon.

Talon PV LLC is a privately held U.S. company developing an advanced 4.8 GW TOPCon solar cell manufacturing fab with anticipated commercial availability starting in Q1 2027. The company is majority owned by Eagle Group, a diversified industrial firm with a long-standing commitment to investing in and advancing American energy production.

(WSAV) — State leaders are looking for new ways to keep electric vehicle (EV) interest charged up — after federal tax credits for EV buyers expired at the end of September.

The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, created under the ‘Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,’ had offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models. But a bill signed in July shortened its end date from 2032 to September 30, 2025, effectively ending the incentive early.

‘Range Anxiety’ No Longer a Major Issue

EV owners say Georgia’s expanding charging infrastructure is helping ease common concerns about long-distance travel.

“The charging network in Georgia is really being built out in a very robust and easy way,” said James Marlow, President of Southface and an EV owner. “When I drive to the Georgia coast, it’s no problem to stop, charge, and grab food or coffee. Charging is becoming much less of an issue.”

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Georgia now has over 90,000 registered EVs and about 2,200 charging stationsstatewide.

Local Incentives May Be the Next Step

With federal credits now gone, experts say car manufacturers and local governments may need to step in with new incentives to keep buyers interested.

“The withdrawal of incentives has definitely changed the market,” Marlow said. “But if you zoom out, electric vehicles now make up about 10% of the U.S. new car market — and that’s growing.”

He also pointed to falling battery costs, which are expected to make EVs more affordable in the coming years.

Cheaper to Operate, Easier to Charge

“I have a Tesla 3, and a full charge to 80% costs me about $12,” Marlow said. “That’s compared to nearly $60 for a full tank of gas in my Jeep — so it’s cheaper to operate.”

The Georgia Department of Transportation is currently reviewing roadways to identify potential “charging deserts” and plans to expand access across rural and suburban areas.

The ‘Battery Belt of the South’

Governor Brian Kemp has called Georgia the ‘Battery Belt of the South’— as major EV manufacturers like SK Battery, Rivian, Kia, and Hyundai continue to expand operations in the state.

We cannot, of course, discuss fuel cell technology without the name Stanley Meyer popping up.
Hydrogen may not grab headlines like electric cars, but it may yet power a good share of the future.","This week we received a release from Nebraska Public Power District marking the 11th annual National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Observation, which takes place each Oct. 8 in a nod to hydrogen’s atomic weight of 1.008. The release was straightforward and refreshingly free of political rhetoric. Hydrogen, it noted, is already at work providing fuel, feedstock and power to sectors across the United States, with promising applications in everything from transportation to national defense.

Roman Estrada, NPPD’s Generation Research Senior Program Manager, described hydrogen as a “technological solution available today that is flexible, domestically sourced and capable of being deployed across multiple sectors critical to our economy and national defense.” In an era when our energy debates often resemble shouting matches between wind farms and tailpipes, that’s a quietly radical statement.

Hydrogen is not a distant, pie-in-the-sky idea. It’s abundant, energy-dense, and can be produced domestically, creating the kind of economic resilience policymakers say they want but rarely seem to act on. Properly deployed, it can stabilize the grid, reduce emissions, and support industries that can’t be electrified easily — such as freight transportation, heavy manufacturing and aviation. It also has the potential to work alongside, rather than against, other energy sources.

Of course, hydrogen technology isn’t a magic wand. Storage, distribution, and infrastructure challenges remain real and expensive–but so were the early hurdles for natural gas, nuclear power, and yes, electric cars. The difference is that hydrogen never received the kind of marketing blitz or regulatory favoritism that battery electric vehicles did. Billions in subsidies and incentives have been shoveled toward lithium batteries, often with modest gains in performance, persistent supply chain vulnerabilities and as discussed in yesterday’s Gazette, a substantial fire hazard.

The federal government has invested tens of billions of dollars in subsidizing electric vehicles through a combination of tax credits, grants, and infrastructure spending. Much of that commitment stems from provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, which expanded and extended tax incentives for EV purchases. Estimates suggest that the cost of these incentives to the government over the coming decade could reach well into the tens of billions of dollars, with each new EV purchase effectively costing taxpayers between $23,000 and $32,000, even though the consumer may receive only a $7,500 credit.

Meanwhile, hydrogen remained the quiet workhorse of laboratories and niche industries — less flashy, more practical, and perhaps, more promising.

We cannot, of course, discuss fuel cell technology without the name Stanley Meyer popping up. Readers may recall Meyer as the man who, in the 1980s, claimed to run a car on water.

Meyer’s work has lived on more in legend than in mainstream engineering journals, but it’s a reminder that the allure of hydrogen isn’t new. The difference now is that the science has matured and technology is catching up.

If NPPD makes it a point to formally recognize the potential, it’s worth asking a simple question: what if we’d spent a fraction of the effort pushing hydrogen that we spent subsidizing a single drivetrain technology? We might be a lot closer to energy independence — and a lot less dependent on what’s happening in someone else’s rare earth mine.

Hydrogen may not grab headlines like electric cars, but it may yet power a good share of the future.",,N,,2025-10-10 16:03:11.700672

The annual report is mandated in statute by the legislature.

“With the expansion of regional hubs, a growing portfolio of grant-funded projects, and hands-on commercialization support, NCInnovation is delivering on its mission to accelerate the commercialization of UNC system applied research,” NCI President and CEO Bennet Waters said in a press release.

“The university-to-industry pipeline has long underpinned American innovation, and North Carolina remains well positioned to create regional economic development from its world-class research successes,” said Waters.

NCInnovation (NCI) is the nonprofit university research accelerator that was given a $500 million endowment by the General Assembly in the state’s 2022-23 budget. Under that endowment, NCI was allowed to use $50 million as investment income in the 2023-24 fiscal year and $90 million in the 2024-25 fiscal year.

Of the $500 million, $140 million was authorized for direct spending, but NCI instead invested the principal amount, accumulating around $20 million in interest that was put toward the group’s first set of grants. NCI also raised $25 million in outside funding from companies and businesses, which was used for items like salaries and operating expenses.

The NCI 2025 Annual Report includes $18.8 million in research funding awarded to 14 UNC System schools for 25 active projects since NCI launched.

“Our role is to ensure that university researchers in North Carolina are not just commercializing breakthrough ideas, but that those ideas have the resources, partnerships, and strategic support needed to get to the next stage here where they are started,” said NCI’s Executive Vice President and CIO Michelle Bolas. “This Annual Report shows our commitment to incorporating those best practices for the ultimate success of our innovators and other partners.”

Also noted was the expansion of NCI’s Regional Innovation Network from four hubs to seven, the launch of the entrepreneur-in-residence program, and more than 250 partnerships statewide across various industries with a focus on biohealth, agtech, defense, advanced manufacturing and energy transition.

NCI’s 2025 annual report is 72 pages long and includes detailed descriptions of the projects approved for grant funding.

Pilot grants totaled more than $2.3 million for eight grants across seven schools, and statewide RFP grants totaled nearly $7.6 million, according to the report.

Total expenses were stated at just under $12.3 million, including grants, more than $1.5 million in salaries and benefits, and regional hub expenses just below $850,000.

The pilot grants in the report include:

• $974,000 for East Carolina (biohealth) melanoma treatment

• $1,082,696 for UNC Wilmington (biohealth) multiyear vaccine development

• $999,963 for Western Carolina (biohealth) mosquito-borne infectious disease identification and risk assessment

• $641,951 for Appalachian State (AgTech) beehive improvement and monitoring system

• $369,024 for North Carolina A&T (biohealth) neuro drug delivery system

• $404,999 for UNC Greensboro (energy transition and electrification) lithium purification

• $400,971 for NC Central (biohealth) drinking water purification

• $354,607 for NC Central (energy transition and electrification) power-grid efficiency

There were 17 statewide RFP grants approved in mid-May totaling $13.6 million across 12 UNC System schools. The projects are described as having “achieved proof of concept” and showing commercial promise.

The largest of the 17 grants, more than $1.1 million, went to UNC Pembroke in the area of biohealth. The project is titled “Alzheimer’s/Traumatic Brain Injury therapeutic.”

Hydrogen is not a distant, pie-in-the-sky idea. It’s abundant, energy-dense, and can be produced domestically, creating the kind of economic resilience policymakers say they want but rarely seem to act on. Properly deployed, it can stabilize the grid, reduce emissions, and support industries that can’t be electrified easily — such as freight transportation, heavy manufacturing and aviation. It also has the potential to work alongside, rather than against, other energy sources.

Of course, hydrogen technology isn’t a magic wand. Storage, distribution, and infrastructure challenges remain real and expensive–but so were the early hurdles for natural gas, nuclear power, and yes, electric cars. The difference is that hydrogen never received the kind of marketing blitz or regulatory favoritism that battery electric vehicles did. Billions in subsidies and incentives have been shoveled toward lithium batteries, often with modest gains in performance, persistent supply chain vulnerabilities and as discussed in yesterday’s Gazette, a substantial fire hazard.

The federal government has invested tens of billions of dollars in subsidizing electric vehicles through a combination of tax credits, grants, and infrastructure spending. Much of that commitment stems from provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, which expanded and extended tax incentives for EV purchases. Estimates suggest that the cost of these incentives to the government over the coming decade could reach well into the tens of billions of dollars, with each new EV purchase effectively costing taxpayers between $23,000 and $32,000, even though the consumer may receive only a $7,500 credit.

Meanwhile, hydrogen remained the quiet workhorse of laboratories and niche industries — less flashy, more practical, and perhaps, more promising.

We cannot, of course, discuss fuel cell technology without the name Stanley Meyer popping up. Readers may recall Meyer as the man who, in the 1980s, claimed to run a car on water.

Meyer’s work has lived on more in legend than in mainstream engineering journals, but it’s a reminder that the allure of hydrogen isn’t new. The difference now is that the science has matured and technology is catching up.

If NPPD makes it a point to formally recognize the potential, it’s worth asking a simple question: what if we’d spent a fraction of the effort pushing hydrogen that we spent subsidizing a single drivetrain technology? We might be a lot closer to energy independence — and a lot less dependent on what’s happening in someone else’s rare earth mine.

Hydrogen may not grab headlines like electric cars, but it may yet power a good share of the future.",,N,,2025-10-10 15:03:02.569002

The specter of additional, deeper federal funding cuts is haunting the clean-energy sector. A Department of Energy list shared this week with Canary Media suggests the agency is thinking about canceling a whopping $23 billion worth of energy projects.

Well, maybe.

Here’s what we know for sure: Last week, the DOE terminated $7.56 billion in federal funding for grid upgrades and energy projects, which were largely set to benefit Democratic-voting states. Right after, Energy Secretary Chris Wright called the announcement a ​“partial list” and promised that more cuts were coming — in both blue states and red ones.

From there, it gets fuzzier.

On Tuesday, sources shared a leaked spreadsheet with Canary Media that looks a lot like a follow-up to last week’s hit list. It lists the word ​“terminate” next to not only the 321 grant cancellations from last week, but hundreds of other projects too.

But despite headlines declaring this a new wave of grant cancellations, the exact nature of the list remains murky. A former DOE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John that the list is legitimate and that it represents the grants DOE officials have recommended for cancellation to the White House.

DOE, meanwhile, hasn’t confirmed the list’s authenticity and denies that it has yet decided to cancel any of the projects that appear only on the second list. In a statement, the DOE said it is still conducting an ​“individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” and that ​“no determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced.”

Recipients who appeared only on the second list also say they haven’t heard that their grants will be canceled.

Vikrum Aiyer, global policy head at carbon-capture startup Heirloom, whose major hydrogen-hub project was included on the second list, told Canary Media’s Maria Gallucci that the company wasn’t ​“aware of a decision from DOE” to cancel its federal award.

Alliant Energy, a utility holding company whose Wisconsin Power and Light subsidiary was listed on the new spreadsheet, said in a statement that it has not been made aware of changes to its DOE grants.

And aside from the two blue-state hydrogen hubs whose funding was cut last week, several of the firms working on the other five hubs have yet to receive cancellation notices, Alexander C. Kaufman reports.

At best, the latest leaked list is just another layer of chaos and uncertainty for federal funding recipients, who are stuck trying to get answers about the status of their projects from a department that has been depleted by layoffs. At worst, though, it’s a harbinger of billions more in cuts to come for innovative American energy projects.

State and federal hurdles pile up for community solar

Community solar is in trouble, and it’s not just because of federal shakeups, Canary Media’s Alison F. Takemura reports. These shared arrays help make solar power accessible to those who can’t put panels on their own roofs, whether that’s because they rent, can’t afford them, or face other barriers. That power can in turn help households reduce their bills.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July set an early sunset for tax credits that can cover as much as half of a community solar array’s cost. And states are also contributing to the decline. Developers in New York, a major community solar market, are facing higher costs for land and permitting, while in Maine, developers have to reckon with changes to its solar net-metering program, as well as lowered compensation and new fees for community solar projects.

Those state challenges, combined with the looming threat of more federal funding cuts, have all led Wood Mackenzie to reduce its forecast of new community solar installations by 8% through 2030.

Global clean energy keeps growing

Two new reports contain some good news for clean energy around the globe. For starters, solar and wind installations outpaced global power demand growth in the first half of this year, according to an analysis out this week from think tank Ember.

Americans bought over 438,000 electric vehicles (EVs) in the third quarter of 2025 – a record number. EVs accounted for 10.5% of all new cars sold, according to Kelley Blue Book parent company Cox Automotive.

The figure, however, was inflated by a rush to claim the federal government’s $7,500 EV tax credit before it expired at the end of September.

Fourth-quarter numbers will likely be much lower, as many who would otherwise have bought in Q4 rushed to shop in Q3 while they could still claim the discount.

Some automakers have extended their own $7,500 discounts to keep the vehicles as affordable as possible for the rest of this year.

But scratch the surface and you’ll see that most “options” are just variations of the same puzzle. Insurers continue to toggle the same three levers — premiums, deductibles, and networks — and present them as innovation.

The result? A marketplace that feels more like a shell game than a menu of possibilities. Narrow networks often mean consumers can’t actually see the doctors they want. In rural areas, the choices shrink even further. And this year, there’s a looming complication: the enhanced ACA subsidies that kept coverage affordable for millions are set to expire at the end of 2025.

That financial cushion — first introduced under the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act — has masked how expensive healthcare truly is. When it disappears, many families will feel the full cost of care for the first time. But while the system may seem rigged, consumers aren’t powerless. A few disciplined strategies can turn open enrollment from a confusing annual chore into a financially savvy exercise in protection and planning.

The Smart Buyer’s Checklist for Open Enrollment

As a healthcare advisor, I see families pay thousands more each year — not because they’re sicker, but because they’re on the wrong plan or using the right one the wrong way. That’s why a disciplined review during open enrollment can make all the difference.

1. Start with your health, not the brochure.

Good coverage begins with a realistic medical assessment. Match your expected needs like chronic conditions, medications, upcoming procedures to the details of each plan. Without that, you’re comparing numbers in a vacuum.

2. Read the fine print. Always.

Premiums are just the cover price. Deductibles, coinsurance, prescription tiers, and exclusions are where the real costs hide. A low premium with a high deductible can easily become a false economy if you end up using care.

3. Verify your doctors and hospitals every year.

Networks shift constantly. Just because your doctor accepted your plan last year doesn’t mean they still do. Check directly with your provider and confirm in writing.

4. Never leave a gap in coverage.

Even a single uninsured day can expose you to catastrophic financial risk. Think of coverage as a seatbelt: you don’t take it off just because the road looks smooth.

5. Question your broker’s incentives.

Some brokers are paid more for selling certain plans — or represent only a limited roster of insurers. Ask how they’re compensated. You deserve transparency when your health and money are on the line.

6. Focus on hospital coverage above all else.

The biggest exposure isn’t your annual checkup — it’s hospitalization. Confirm that your preferred hospitals, especially for emergencies or chronic care, are covered in-network. That’s where the biggest bills — and biggest risks — hide.

7. Be wary of “off-market” or non-ACA plans.

So-called “alternative” health plans may look attractive but often skip essential benefits like maternity, mental health, or preventive care. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

The ACA Subsidy Cliff Ahead

The enhanced subsidies that have kept ACA premiums within reach for millions are set to disappear at the end of 2025. Originally introduced under the American Rescue Plan as part of COVID-19 relief and later extended through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act, these expanded tax credits reduced the share of income people had to devote to benchmark plans and extended financial help to households above 400% of the federal poverty level. Analysts at Health System Tracker, among others, note that these subsidies reshaped affordability across the market, making coverage more accessible for both low-income and middle-income households.

Now, if Congress fails to extend the subsidies, the financial shock will be significant. Premiums after subsidies could climb by 50% to 75% or more depending on income, geography, and plan type. Out-of-pocket burdens would rise sharply as the government covers less of the cost, and millions are projected to drop coverage altogether.

The Bottom Line: Treat Open Enrollment as a Financial Strategy

Healthcare costs have become one of the largest and most unpredictable line items in the modern family budget — rivaling housing and education. Treating open enrollment as part of your broader financial plan isn’t optional anymore; it’s essential risk management.

Two-thirds of bankruptcies in America involve medical debt — a reminder that the right health plan isn’t a luxury; it’s protection. Choosing wisely during Open Enrollment 2025 is one of the most important financial decisions a family can make.

There are at least 3 things wrong with the way we do it now:

1. Too many Michiganders cannot afford the rates DTE and Consumers charge. Too many Michiganders are forced to decide between paying their electric bill and buying groceries. Inflation was the big issue in the 2024 election. It still is and DTE’s and Consumers’ rates are going up at 2 and 3 times faster than other costs.

2. Residential rates are exploding because of unjustified speculative frenzy around AI and data centers. DTE and Consumers want residents to pay for new methane-burning plants to power these data centers without any financial commitments from the big tech companies. Runaway speculation on data centers also strains our ground water and the Great Lakes.

3. Michigan has the worst electric outages in the nation. It takes our utilities an average of 12 hours to recover from outages. Even with a guaranteed 10% return for shareholders, they have failed to make the necessary investments in our grid infrastructure. They just keep blaming the trees.

At the Sierra Club, our mission is to ENJOY and PROTECT the wild places on Earth. We can’t enjoy them if we can’t afford to visit them because we had to pay our utility bill or because we had to throw out a refrigerator of food after an outage. We can’t enjoy them if the new data center has dried up the wetlands next door.

We’re not protecting them if we allow utilities to blow past our commitments to 100% clean energy by 2040. Burning coal and methane is warming up the Great Lakes, making our fisheries even more susceptible to invasive species. Rising temperatures are driving wildfires, flooding, an increase in tornadoes and ice storms that are wreaking havoc on our parks and forests.

The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC), the regulatory agency that approves our utilities’ plans, is holding public hearings about what rules should be used in approving these plans.

The money would be used to hire a firm to create a report on the subject.

A working group of Oklahoma researchers and utilities has been assembled to gather information ahead of the study. The OCC partnered with the Hamm Institute for American Energy and identified nuclear energy experts from the University of Oklahoma.

The participants are working as volunteers, said Mark Argenbright, director of the OCC’s public utility division. He said Enercon Services, which completed Michigan’s nuclear feasibility study, is among the potential companies eyed for the task.

The request comes as the agency reports funding challenges and staffing shortages.

“ We're unable to fill them because we cannot pay the salaries commensurate to draw people to these jobs,” Commissioner Todd Hiett said. “And so, we're already cutting and operating very thinly already, and maybe to the legislature, a couple hundred thousand dollars doesn't sound like much, but in our world, that's quite a bit.”

The agency could continue its information gathering without hiring a firm, though Argenbright said the product wouldn’t be as comprehensive.

“ We'll create a report regardless of how we deal with the consultant issue,” he said. “But it will be at a different level than it would be with a consultant, where we would have a much deeper dive and a broader range of information that would be able to bring to bear on the report.”

The agency could also use money pulled from its assessment fees of utility companies. Chairman Kim David said that the option would result in higher costs for Oklahoma utility customers.

“ I'd like to make a motion that we requested supplemental appropriation for the $125,000 for the report and put it back in their lap,” David said of the state legislature. “We have a lot of different people that have given a lot of time and effort and energy into this.”

In response to Hiett voicing support for completing a study that the state can one day use, Commissioner Brian Bingman said the OCC should continue its report without hiring a third-party firm.

“ I kind of disagree because I just don't think the legislature is serious about this,” he said.

These high-stakes dialogues, unfolding against a backdrop of escalating global demand and geopolitical tensions, aim to secure a stable and diversified supply of minerals essential for defense, advanced technology, and the burgeoning clean energy transition. The urgency of these conversations underscores a collective recognition that securing these foundational resources is paramount to national economic security and technological sovereignty.

The discussions center on establishing robust frameworks, including potential direct supply agreements and financial mechanisms like guaranteed minimum prices and production-linked tax credits, to enhance domestic stockpiling and production capabilities. As of October 10, 2025, the focus is sharpened by the ongoing regulatory review of a proposed merger between Teck Resources and Anglo American (LSE: AAL), a deal poised to create a global powerhouse in critical minerals, particularly copper. This strategic alignment could profoundly reshape the global critical minerals landscape, offering North America a stronger hand in a market increasingly dominated by a few key players.

Strategic Dialogues and a Shifting Global Landscape

Teck Resources' active participation in these strategic discussions highlights a concerted effort by Western nations to de-risk their critical mineral supply chains, particularly in light of increasing export restrictions from countries like China, which has historically held significant sway over the supply of several key minerals. The company has specifically put forth recommendations for a Canadian Strategic Metals Reserve, advocating for a comprehensive framework that includes floor-price agreements, production-linked tax credits, and federal procurement backing to support the domestic stockpiling of strategic materials such as germanium, antimony, and gallium. These minerals are vital for semiconductors, advanced defense applications, and 5G technology, making their secure supply a matter of national security.

A pivotal element influencing these ongoing discussions is the proposed ""merger of equals"" between Teck Resources and Anglo American. This ambitious plan seeks to forge a new ""global critical minerals champion,"" primarily focused on copper—a metal indispensable for the energy transition—along with other essential metals. The combined entity, tentatively named Anglo Teck Group, would be headquartered in Vancouver. This proposed consolidation is currently undergoing rigorous regulatory review by the Canadian government, which is meticulously assessing its alignment with Canada's critical minerals strategy, national security concerns, including economic security, and its potential to generate significant job creation and economic benefits within Canada. As part of their commitment, the companies have pledged approximately $4.5 billion in Canadian spending over five years, encompassing investments in critical minerals exploration, technological advancements, and upgrades to key facilities like Teck’s Trail smelter.

Teck's CEO, Jonathan Price, has been vocal about the company's potential to meet the germanium needs of North America, and even the entire G7 nations, signaling a clear strategic intent by Western countries to diversify and stabilize their critical mineral supply chains away from over-reliance on dominant suppliers. However, Price has also expressed concerns that Canada's allocated C$4 billion over eight years for critical mineral development falls short when compared to the annual investments made by countries like China. He argues for more ambitious, targeted government incentives and investments to bolster North American critical minerals capacity and streamline cumbersome regulatory processes, which he believes currently lag behind investments in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing plants.

The urgency driving these strategic discussions is further underscored by the unprecedented and rapidly escalating global demand for critical minerals. This surge is predominantly fueled by the expansion of the technology sector and, more significantly, the accelerating global transition to renewable energy sources and a low-carbon economy. Minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite are indispensable for electric vehicle (EV) batteries, with lithium demand alone projected to increase over 40 times its current levels by 2050 to meet net-zero emissions targets. Rare earth elements are crucial for wind turbines and EV motors, while copper remains the backbone of all electricity-related technologies. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported robust growth in critical mineral demand in 2023, with projections indicating a nearly quadrupling of overall mineral demand for clean energy technologies by 2040. This escalating demand, coupled with the concentrated refining and processing in a few countries, elevates critical minerals to a paramount national economic and security interest, driving urgent efforts to secure and diversify supply chains.

Potential Winners and Losers in the Critical Minerals Race

The intensified focus on North American critical mineral supply chains, coupled with the proposed Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) and Anglo American (LSE: AAL) merger, is poised to create a significant ripple effect across various industries, establishing clear winners and losers in the evolving global resource landscape. The primary beneficiaries are expected to be domestic mining companies, technology firms, and defense contractors who can secure reliable access to these essential materials.

Among the mining companies, MP Materials (NYSE: MP), North America's largest rare earths producer, stands to gain substantially. Operating the Mountain Pass mine in California, MP Materials is strategically integrating vertically to produce rare earth magnets domestically, a move bolstered by significant government funding and a supply agreement with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Similarly, USA Rare Earth (USAR), developing a vertically integrated domestic rare earth magnet supply chain, and Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (NYSE American: IDR), with its significant rare earth element exploration properties, are well-positioned. Companies like United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE American: UAMY), the sole antimony smelter in the U.S. and Mexico, and Trilogy Metals Inc. (NYSEAmerican: TMQ), which has received direct U.S. government investment for its Alaskan copper and zinc projects, will also benefit from the drive for domestic supply. In Canada, Green Technology Metals (ASX: GT1), focusing on lithium projects in Ontario, is pursuing an integrated mine-to-chemical strategy for battery-grade lithium hydroxide, securing an offtake agreement with LG Energy Solution (KRX: 373220).

The proposed $50-53 billion merger between Teck Resources and Anglo American, which is now reported as agreed, is set to create a new mining giant, ""Anglo Teck,"" headquartered in Vancouver. This combined entity, poised to be among the top five global copper producers, will benefit from enhanced portfolio diversification, operational synergies estimated at $800 million in pre-tax annual savings, and increased scale, particularly in copper production. Their strategic focus on copper and other critical minerals positions ""Anglo Teck"" favorably to meet demand from renewable energy, EVs, and green technologies, further strengthening Teck's ongoing discussions with the U.S. and Canada for critical mineral supply. This mega-merger could also trigger further consolidation in the mining industry, making smaller players with valuable deposits attractive acquisition targets.

Conversely, companies heavily reliant on uninterrupted, low-cost critical mineral imports from China, without diversified supply chains, could face increased costs and supply disruptions due to tariffs, export restrictions, and geopolitical tensions. Major mining competitors in copper and zinc, such as BHP (ASX: BHP, NYSE: BHP), Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO, NYSE: RIO), and Glencore (LSE: GLEN), could face heightened competition from the newly formed ""Anglo Teck"" powerhouse. These companies, some of whom previously made bids for Teck, have missed a significant strategic opportunity, potentially forcing them to seek other growth avenues. Furthermore, smaller mining companies, while some may become acquisition targets, could struggle to compete with the sheer scale and financial prowess of the merged entity, particularly in securing capital or developing new large-scale projects.

Wider Significance and Geopolitical Chessboard

The strategic maneuvers by Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) and the governments of the U.S. and Canada transcend mere corporate dealings; they represent a critical inflection point in global resource geopolitics. This event fits squarely into broader industry trends defined by the accelerating global energy transition, which demands unprecedented quantities of critical minerals for electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, and advanced technologies. The projected 400-600% increase in demand for rare earth elements and up to 4,000% for lithium and graphite in EV batteries over the coming decades underscores the profound shift occurring in industrial supply chains.

The ripple effects of securing critical mineral supply chains are vast, impacting competitors, partners, and the overall balance of global power. The geographic concentration of mineral extraction and, more critically, processing—with China holding near-total dominance in rare earth processing and significant shares in strategic battery minerals—has created market fragility and geopolitical leverage. This has spurred Western nations to pursue ""derisking"" strategies, reducing reliance on single dominant suppliers, and ""friendshoring,"" collaborating with trusted allies like Canada and Australia. For competitor nations lacking domestic reserves or processing, disruptions can lead to significant economic impacts, driving them to diversify or face substantial economic output reductions. Conversely, resource-rich developing nations gain increased strategic leverage, becoming key partners in building diversified supply chains.

In response to these trends, governments worldwide are actively developing sophisticated legal frameworks and policy instruments. The European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act and the U.S. Critical Minerals Strategy, alongside initiatives like the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), aim to encourage domestic production, processing, research, and recycling, while fostering international cooperation. These policies often include investment incentives, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, and a growing emphasis on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards to ensure responsible and sustainable mining practices. The imposition of export controls by some mineral-rich nations, as seen with graphite, gallium, and germanium, further highlights the urgency of these policy shifts.

Historically, the current drive for critical mineral security echoes past instances of resource nationalism and strategic competition. The U.S. Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act of 1939, enacted at the onset of World War II, and the Defense Production Act of 1950 during the Korean War, both recognized that low commercial reserves posed a direct threat to national security, underscoring a long-standing understanding of material importance for military readiness. The present geopolitical competition over critical minerals is often compared to the 20th-century struggles over oil and gas, now seen as foundational to the 21st-century economy. This era marks a return to state intervention in mineral markets, reversing decades of global economic integration and signifying a fundamental shift in international relations driven by wider geopolitical tensions.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Future of Critical Minerals

The strategic discussions involving Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) and the proposed Anglo American (LSE: AAL) merger signify a pivotal moment for the future of critical mineral supply chains in North America. In the short term, the focus will remain on solidifying government initiatives and funding, such as the U.S. Defense Production Act and Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, to accelerate domestic mining, processing, and recycling. Efforts to streamline the notoriously lengthy permitting processes for new mines will be crucial, alongside the establishment of strategic mineral reserves to buffer against immediate supply shocks. The ""friendshoring"" approach, strengthening alliances with trusted partners like Australia, will continue to be a key strategy to diversify supply.

Looking long-term, the vision is to cultivate a robust, sustainable, and self-reliant critical mineral ecosystem across North America. This necessitates building an integrated value chain, from upstream exploration and extraction to midstream processing and refining, which currently remains a significant weak point. A comprehensive circular economy model, encompassing responsible mining, advanced recycling, and urban mining, will be essential for long-term sustainability and reduced environmental impact. Investment in technological innovation, such as deep-sea mineral exploration and alternative materials research, coupled with critical workforce development, will underpin this strategic pivot. The ultimate goal is a fundamental geopolitical rebalancing, reducing reliance on dominant suppliers and establishing new processing hubs within allied nations, a process that will require sustained collaboration over decades.

The market opportunities emerging from this shift are immense, driven by the projected six-fold increase in the energy sector's mineral needs by 2040 and the booming electric vehicle market. This creates significant economic growth and job creation potential across North America, attracting a surge in investment, particularly for projects that qualify for government support. However, formidable challenges persist, including North America's continued heavy reliance on external suppliers for processing, the long lead times and high costs associated with developing new mines, and persistent regulatory and environmental hurdles. Workforce shortages in mining engineering also present a critical bottleneck. The agreed-upon merger between Teck Resources and Anglo American, set to create the ""Anglo Teck"" entity headquartered in Vancouver, is a significant scenario that could accelerate project development and enhance supply chain security, particularly for copper and other critical minerals, aligning with governmental security objectives. However, it will undoubtedly face rigorous regulatory scrutiny to ensure it provides a net benefit to Canada and does not raise undue market concentration concerns.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: Securing the Future

The strategic discussions led by Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) with the U.S. and Canadian governments, culminating in the proposed Anglo American (LSE: AAL) merger, mark a defining moment in North America's quest for critical mineral security. Key takeaways from these developments underscore a clear and urgent shift towards diversifying supply chains away from concentrated foreign sources, particularly China, to safeguard national economic and defense interests. The escalating global demand for critical minerals, driven by the clean energy transition and advanced technologies, has elevated these resources to a geopolitical imperative, reminiscent of historical struggles for vital raw materials.

Moving forward, the market for critical minerals is set to experience unprecedented growth and transformation. The formation of ""Anglo Teck"" promises a new global powerhouse, particularly in copper, which will significantly bolster North American supply capabilities. However, the path to self-sufficiency is fraught with challenges, including the need for substantial investment in domestic processing infrastructure, streamlined regulatory processes, and a skilled workforce. The emphasis on sustainable and ESG-compliant mining practices will also differentiate North American producers and shape future investment decisions.

The lasting impact of these events will be a more resilient, albeit potentially more expensive, critical mineral supply chain for North America and its allies. This strategic realignment aims to reduce vulnerability to geopolitical disruptions and ensure consistent access to materials vital for future economic growth and technological innovation. Investors should closely monitor regulatory approvals for the Anglo Teck merger, progress on government funding initiatives for critical mineral projects, and the development of new extraction and processing technologies. The long-term success of this strategic pivot will hinge on sustained collaboration between governments and industry, fostering a robust and integrated North American critical minerals ecosystem that can withstand future global shocks.

These pensions are some of the biggest investors in the country, so where they invest matters. Right now, they're using our money to fund Big Oil, other polluters, and greenwashed “climate solutions” that don’t actually cut pollution. That means workers’ hard-earned savings are being used to prop up the industries driving the climate crisis, instead of protecting their future.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. Pensions could be part of the solution, investing in ways that secure workers’ retirements and support a safe, livable planet.

That's why the Sierra Club is calling on public pensions to adopt our Climate Solutions Investment Principles — commonsense guidelines that direct money into real climate solutions like clean energy, good union jobs, and resilient communities.

Take action: Add your name now to demand that public pensions invest in a livable future. (If you are a public pension member, please include that in your personal message!)

We are already facing (and paying for) the impacts of climate change. Not only do we face threats to our homes from storms and flooding, but rising temperatures are raising the cost of food, utility bills, and more.

There’s a growing body of research that shows climate change isn’t just an environmental threat, it’s a financial one. The projected financial impacts of the climate crisis means upending the economy and devaluing investments, directly threatening workers' retirement savings. The long-term security of our retirement savings depends on the stability of the economy, which in turn depends on the health of the environmental and social systems that underpin it. To safeguard our ability to retire, we need to decarbonize our economy, and that requires making investments in clean energy and other climate solutions.

Investing in clean, renewable energy isn't just the right thing to do for our planet. It also makes financial sense.

Pensions have a fiduciary duty not only to avoid losses from climate risks, but also to seek out investment opportunities. Credible climate solutions can deliver stable, long-term returns that protect workers’ retirement savings in the long run.

Without redirecting capital toward things like clean energy technologies, green manufacturing, and zero-emissions transportation, pensions risk underinvesting in the energy transition and missing out on the growth that the clean energy economy will generate for decades to come.

Right now, we're seeing the Trump administration roll back 50 years worth of environmental protections. We can and must fight back in every way possible, and that includes investing our tax dollars and our retirement savings in ways that protect the planet and our retirement portfolios

Vessels, trains, and trucks traverse the port’s industrial landscape, signaling more than just cargo in motion. This is the economic engine driving the Rio Grande Valley’s economy.

As the only deepwater seaport located on the U.S.-Mexico border, the Port of Brownsville has become a gateway for trade, a magnet for investment, and a catalyst for opportunity across South Texas. Currently, more than $20 billion in projects are in the pipeline, promising to further transform the economic landscape of South Texas.

The port’s long-term vision is guided by the Brownsville Navigation District Board of Commissioners. This five-member elected body oversees policy, planning, and major investment decisions. The current board includes Chairman Esteban Guerra, Vice Chairman Sergio Tito Lopez, Secretary John Reed, and Assistant Secretaries John Wood and Ernesto Gutierrez. Together, their leadership reflects a strong commitment to economic growth, public trust, and regional impact.

The Port of Brownsville continues to play a central role in the success of the region. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the port climbed to No. 41 among the nation’s 150 maritime ports for waterborne cargo, its highest ranking to date. In 2023, the port moved 11.2 million tons of waterborne cargo, up from 9.1 million tons in 2022.

That momentum carried throughout 2024, with total cargo reaching 28 million tons marking a 57 percent increase from 2023. Operating revenue at the port in 2024 surpassed $30 million for the fourth consecutive year, reaching $43.3 million.

This growth represents more than statistics. It means jobs for families, new business, and broader momentum across South Texas. Every ton of cargo supports a ripple effect that fuels the local economy.

Contributing to the port’s success are consistent investments in infrastructure. A centerpiece of that effort is the Brazos Island Harbor Channel Improvement Project, which will deepen the 17-mile-long ship channel from 42 feet to 52 feet. The increased depth will allow larger vessels to enter more safely, reduce wait times, and improve overall efficiency.

The project is divided into two phases. It’s backed by a Public-Private Partnership involving the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Port of Brownsville, and energy company NextDecade. In 2019, NextDecade committed to funding Phase 1, a $400 million investment, which includes deepening the channel near its Rio Grande LNG site and building two ship berths and a turning basin. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company received the contract from NextDecade for work on Phase 1. Phase 2, led by the port and the Corps, is supported by $68 million in federal funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In 2024, a $104 million contract was awarded to Callan Marine Ltd. The estimated completion date of the project is late 2026.

Infrastructure improvements on the port’s land are moving just as quickly. The port has expanded laydown yards, modernized roadways, and improved berths to handle high-volume cargo, including wind energy components. These updates are essential for maintaining the port’s competitiveness in a changing global market.

The Port of Brownsville continues to attract some of the largest private investments in the energy sector. Projects like Rio Grande LNG and Texas LNG are shaping the future of U.S. energy exports. Together, they are expected to create thousands of jobs and generate significant long-term economic benefits for the Rio Grande Valley.

Rio Grande LNG, built by Bechtel Energy Inc., is a natural gas liquefaction and export facility with up to 48 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of potential capacity, making it one of the world’s largest LNG projects in development. Trains 1 through 4, representing about 24 MTPA and $25 billion in investment, are under construction and scheduled to begin operations between 2027 and 2030, supported by customers such as ADNOC, Aramco, Shell, ExxonMobil, and TotalEnergies. Train 5, with commercial agreements secured from Jera, EQT, and ConocoPhillips, is advancing toward a positive Final Investment Decision, while Trains 6 through 8 are in early development and permitting.

Texas LNG, a project of Glenfarne Energy Transition, is a planned 4 MTPA export terminal at the Port of Brownsville designed to be one of the lowest-emission LNG facilities in the world. It has secured offtake agreements with companies including EQT Corporation, Gunvor Group, Macquarie, and a major European utility. Texas LNG recently cleared a key regulatory milestone with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and is targeting a Final Investment Decision by the end of 2025. Kiewit Corporation has been selected as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor, with the project expected to be completed by 2029.

The port is also prioritizing sustainability. From habitat restoration projects to native species conservation, it is working to ensure that economic development goes hand-in-hand with environmental responsibility. These efforts help maintain a balance between progress and preservation.

The port’s location and multimodal access position as a unique link between global trade and emerging industries. It plays a growing role in renewable energy logistics, particularly in the transport of oversized equipment like wind turbines. It’s also supporting the commercial space industry. Just a short distance from SpaceX’s Starbase launch site, the port offers specialized logistics that support space innovation and advanced manufacturing.

With competitive costs, unmatched logistics, available land, and a growing labor force, the Port Brownsville is one of the most attractive locations in the country for nearshoring and industrial investment.

This threshold determines when a new or modified major stationary source must obtain an NSR permit before starting construction—a distinction with major implications for project sequencing, financing, and regulatory risk.

The EPA’s announcement comes at a critical time for U.S. energy and industrial policy. National electricity demand is projected to rise sharply over the next five years, driven by growth in AI data centers and widespread electrification. The International Energy Agency estimates that data centers alone will account for nearly half of the nation’s total increase in electricity demand through 2030—and, within five years, consume more power than all U.S. production of aluminum, steel, cement, and chemicals combined. In this context, the EPA’s reinterpretation of when “construction” truly begins could have favorable implications for energy and industrial developments nationwide.

How the EPA Has Interpreted “Begin Actual Construction”

Under the CAA, a new or modified major stationary source may not “begin actual construction” without first obtaining an NSR permit.[1] The EPA regulations define this term as “the initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature,” including activities such as installing building supports and foundations, laying underground piping, or constructing permanent storage structures.[2]

Historically, the EPA interpreted this provision broadly. In a March 28, 1986, memorandum from Edward Reich (the “Reich Memo”), the agency concluded that construction of structures intended to accommodate emissions units could itself constitute “actual construction,” even if no emissions equipment had yet been installed.[3] For decades, the regulated community treated this as effectively prohibiting most preparatory construction until an NSR permit was issued, a view reinforced in subsequent memoranda and guidance letters.[4]

In March 2020, however, the EPA under the first Trump administration issued draft guidance that adopted a less restrictive approach.[5] The March 2020 Draft Guidance clarified that:

Source owners or operators may undertake physical on-site activities prior to obtaining an NSR permit—including activities that may be costly, significantly alter the site, or are permanent in nature—provided those activities do not constitute physical construction on an emissions unit, as defined in 40 CFR § 52.21(b)(7).

In contrast to the 1986 Reich Memorandum, an “installation necessary to accommodate” the emissions unit is not considered part of that emissions unit, meaning construction activities involving such accommodations may occur before an NSR permit is obtained.

In short, NSR obligations are triggered only by direct work on emissions units, not by general building or site preparation. The EPA emphasized that any on-site construction undertaken prior to obtaining an NSR permit remains “at risk”—meaning that if a permit is later denied or additional controls are required, developers may face costly redesigns or delays.

The EPA’s 2025 Maricopa County Semiconductor Decision

In September 2025, the EPA reaffirmed this narrower interpretation in response to a request from the Maricopa County Air Quality Department regarding a proposed semiconductor manufacturing complex.[6] The developer sought to construct the building’s “core and shell”—including the foundation, steel frame, and exterior walls—before obtaining an NSR permit, while deferring installation of emissions units, related foundations, and piping until after permit approval.

The EPA concluded that these actions do not constitute “beginning actual construction,” provided that no emissions units or related components are installed. The agency clarified that the term applies specifically to on-site construction of emissions units, not other parts of a facility. The EPA also noted that the 1986 Reich Memo reflected an “overly broad” interpretation by treating structures accommodating emissions units as part of the units themselves.

Although the Maricopa County decision responds to project-specific facts, it aligns with the March 2020 Draft Guidance. The EPA confirmed that it does not plan to finalize the 2020 guidance; instead, the agency intends to initiate a formal rulemaking to revise the NSR program’s definition of “begin actual construction” consistent with this narrower approach. This rulemaking is included in the EPA’s 2025 Spring Agenda, with a proposed rule expected by January 2026 and a final rule targeted for September 2026.

Implications for Project Planning and Risk

The EPA’s evolving interpretation of “begin actual construction” may provide meaningful flexibility for project developers navigating lengthy NSR reviews. A clarified, narrower definition could allow certain preparatory site and building activities to proceed without triggering NSR requirements. However, the EPA has stressed that any such activities remain “at risk.”

Developers in Texas should also consider recent state-level changes. In 2019, the Texas Legislature amended the Texas Clean Air Act through House Bill 2726 (codified at Tex. Health & Safety Code § 382.004), authorizing limited “construction at risk.” Under this law, applicants for a permit amendment may begin construction once the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issues a draft permit, rather than waiting for final issuance. The statute requires compliance with federal law and specifies that all work proceeds at the applicant’s own risk. If the EPA finalizes its narrower definition of “begin actual construction,” TCEQ’s permitting approach may adjust accordingly, potentially broadening the range of activities it may approve before final permit issuance.

Looking ahead, the EPA’s forthcoming rule is expected to clarify when NSR preconstruction obligations attach and align federal policy with practical construction sequencing. The outcome will be closely watched by developers, permitting authorities, and environmental advocates. Even modest adjustments to the NSR “begin construction” threshold could materially affect project timing, costs, and compliance strategies in an era of accelerating energy demand and capital-intensive infrastructure development.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases have ended, but state-level programs still offer relief to some buyers. Depending on where you live, you might still qualify for thousands in state tax breaks. However, you could also pay higher registration fees than your gasoline-driving neighbors.

The change highlights a major transition in U.S. transportation policy. States are trying to balance environmental goals with the need to fund roads and bridges.

Federal Credits End as Congress Pulls Plug

Congress ended the Biden-era EV tax credits on Sept. 30. Those credits offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models. The end of the federal program caused a surge in last-minute EV purchases as consumers rushed to beat the deadline. Analysts now predict a temporary dip in nationwide EV sales.

Still, several states — including Colorado, California, and New Jersey — continue offering rebates or tax incentives to maintain sales momentum.

Balancing Incentives with New Fees

The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, notes that state EV policies often conflict. While incentives encourage electric adoption, other laws impose higher registration or “road use” fees. States justify these costs because EV owners do not pay gasoline taxes, which fund most transportation infrastructure.

Oklahoma drivers, for example, pay an annual EV fee of $110 on top of registration costs. Lawmakers say that keeps road funding balanced while encouraging responsible electric growth.

The Bigger Picture — Infrastructure and Fairness

As EV adoption grows, states face pressure to replace lost fuel-tax revenue. The transition requires creative policy solutions that reward clean energy without draining highway funds. Many transportation experts predict more states will adopt mileage-based user fees within the next decade.

Both Ford and General Motors had ideas about how to offer a slight extension to folks, but both companies have officially nixed those plans; GM called it off on Wednesday this week, and Reuters reports that Ford just eliminated its offer on Friday, October 10.

GM told Reuters that, ""after further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit.” A Ford spokesperson said, “Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today.”

The two companies originally came up with a creative idea to work around the demise of the tax credit, at least for those vehicles still on the lot today: both the Ford and GM in-house lending arms were planning to initiate the purchase of EVs in inventory while the credit was still applicable, and then pass those savings onto the customers who would ultimately lease the vehicles.

Pushback came from the Republican U.S. senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio. Moreno and fellow senator John Barrasso (R-MD) wrote a public letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent concerning the matter.

“It has come to our attention that certain car companies are gaming this guidance by instructing their captive financial entities to enter into written binding agreements with dealers for electric vehicles, paying a nominal down payment, to secure the credits on vehicles that may not be leased to the end user for months,” the senators wrote. “Given this concerning information, we write to request your assistance to close this loophole and address the total violation of Congressional intent by these nefarious actors.”

After GM pulled back from the program, Moreno expressed his happiness in an interview with Reuters. ""The EV subsidies ended September 30 and I'm happy that every car company is going to abide by that,” Moreno said. ""I look forward to working with GM. We're putting a lot of policies in place to protect our domestic auto industry.""

It doesn’t matter if it’s a more consensus-minded society like Sweden, or top-down authoritarianism like China. Governments pick winners and losers. In America, those losers are anyone in the EV supply chain.

There’s a new article out that talks about the ‘Battery Belt,’ which is a useful neologism for the mostly rural and historically Republican areas that were supposed to be the source of batteries for future electric cars. That’s not happening at the speed most predicted, so what happens to those communities?

The Morning Dump is a news roundup, and all the news today is built around batteries. We know what’s happening, but who is to blame?

Is it the automakers who had too lofty ambitions? Is it the politicians who halted an industrial policy before it could be started? And where does this go?

‘That’s On Everybody’s Mind, Quite Frankly’

Back in 2022, Ford announced it would spend billions building a battery and EV truck-making facility in Stanton, Tennessee. This small town of 450 people would suddenly get thousands of new workers.

This facility was to be a part of the Battery Belt and, maybe, still will be. Ford keeps delaying the project, just like nearly every major automaker with EV ambitions in the United States.

What if it never happens? From the Reuters piece on the dashed dreams of the Battery Belt, that’s the question:

The uncertain fate of these massive, high-tech factories and their employment has rattled the small rural communities that spent years hitching their economic futures to these projects.

“That’s on everybody’s mind, quite frankly,” said Allan Sterbinsky, who retired as mayor of Stanton in December and advocated for the site for years before Ford came to town. Some residents worry that Ford will never follow through on the plant, the former mayor says. Others hope the company will repurpose the 3,600-acre site if demand doesn’t increase for EVs.

A Ford spokesperson pointed to the automaker’s community work in Stanton, including grants to public safety organizations as part of a broader $9 million commitment to the area.

Essentially, the industry was preparing to build enough battery capacity to cover roughly 80% of the current car market, or around 13 million cars. Now? Maybe a quarter of that will be necessary.

What happens to these communities? How did we end up here?

‘Electric Vehicle Subsidies Were… Distorting The Market’

I have already written at length here about how electric vehicle subsidies were, ultimately, bad politics, even if you think they were good governance.

Ford and General Motors thought they’d be clever and use a loophole in the IRS guidance around the ending of the IRA tax credit to extend it for a few months. Both GM and Ford have bailed on those plans after two Republican Senators cried foul.

Here’s the letter from the Senators that explains some of their reasoning:

We write to alert you to a serious violation of Congressional intent that threatens great harm to U.S. taxpayer dollars and ask for your immediate assistance in rectifying this problem.

As you know, Congress recently enacted Public Law 119-21, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, giving working class families massive tax relief, ending the Green New Scam, and fully funding our border security and national security needs. As part of this law, Congress amended Sections 25E, 30D, and 45W of the tax code, which collectively provide tax credits for the purchase of certain “clean vehicles.” These electric vehicle subsidies were costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year and distorting the market for automakers and dealers across the country, and we are extremely pleased that Congress acted decisively to cut these credits off.

Senator Moreno is a car dealer, so you might expect he’d have some sort of sympathy for dealers or automakers who are now trying to move these vehicles (that the previous government pushed).

I think the bit about how these subsidies were “distorting the market for automakers” kind of gives the game away. A 2023 report from Climate Power showed that there were 24 planned battery projects and 11 electric vehicle projects in rural areas, representing more than $20 billion in investments. Because it’s hard to build plants in urban areas, it’s not surprising that most of these plans were in Republican districts. They are in a mix of historically swing and not-so swing Republican states, however.

The political ramifications of potentially killing many of these projects seem, from the Republican side at least, not to be as big of a deal as continuing the tax credit.

‘It’s Going To Be Smaller, Way Smaller Than We Thought’

Credit to Ford CEO Jim Farley for having a quote for every topic. While recently expanding on his belief that we need more skilled tradespeople (we do), he also made a point of being honest about how expectations for EV adoption were not matched to the reality of consumer demand.

Per CNBC:

Farley on Tuesday said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if sales of EVs fell from a market share of around 10% to 12% this month — which is expected to be a record — to 5% after the incentive program ends.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” he said during a Ford event about promoting skilled trades and workers in Detroit. “We’re going to find out in a month. I wouldn’t be surprised that the EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5%.”

Farley said the industry learned that “partial electrification,” such as hybrids, are easier for customers to accept for the time being.

Even if the Democrats won every seat in every election and the White House, it’s not like all that battery capacity we were building would have exactly been necessary (some plans were being paused before the election). We’d have ended up somewhere in between, or at least closer to in between than where we are now.

Either way, the post-Tesla overheated projections definitely contributed to this mess.

‘It’s Not Something (We), In Any Way, Shape, Or Form, Expect To Give Up’

Could General Motors do the one thing it doesn’t normally do? Could GM be right on the technology and ahead of the market, and not suddenly retreat at the first sign of an obstacle?

Here’s a quote from a Detroit Free Press interview with GM President of North America Duncan Alred:

Still, GM invested significant money and planning to offer the range of EVs it has today. Though the industry is bracing for an EV sales slump, GM’s leaders insist that investing deeply and early in a broad range of electric offerings was not a mistake.

“We believe EVs will remain a strong part of the GM portfolio. Quite honestly, it’s one of the reasons why our market share has grown so much this year,” Aldred said. “It’s not something (we), in any way, shape or form, expect to give up.”

Year to date, GM estimates that its 17.2% market share across vehicle propulsion systems is the highest it’s been in 10 years. So far this year, EV total sales more than doubled to 144,668 vehicles.

Cool? Cool! GM is already deeply invested in its EV project and has approximately a dozen models out there, compared to just three for Ford. It also has affordable vehicles like the reborn Bolt coming to the market.

EVs are the right car for a lot of people, including consumers who haven’t been able to afford one yet.

If everyone else (other than Tesla) is retreating to some degree, it’s maybe not the worst position for GM to be in to soak up all that excess market share.

GM never received the federal funding and will work with the DOE and Piston to determine next steps on closing out the programs, Fowle said.
GM's retrenchment follows Stellantis' cancellation of hydrogen fuel cell development efforts, announced this summer.
Automakers including GM, Stellantis and Toyota invested substantially in hydrogen as a viable propulsion technology, especially for heavy-duty vehicles.
""High costs and limited hydrogen infrastructure in the U.S. has limited consumer adoption of fuel cell-powered vehicles.""","Crain’s confirmed with GM that its project with Southfield-based Piston Automotive, which was to create more than 140 jobs at the former Michigan State Fairgrounds site in Detroit, would be scrapped. Crain's first reported in May that the project was paused due to regulatory uncertainty.

GM spokesman Stuart Fowle said policy changes and the automaker's reassessment of its portfolio triggered the decision. The lack of hydrogen infrastructure and longer-than-expected transition to electric vehicles are key reasons for the shift.

""Certainly the decisions of the DOE are an element of that overall climate but not the only driver,"" Fowle said. ""We want to prioritize the engineering talent and resources and everything we have to continuing to advance EVs given hydrogen is in a different spot.""

The U.S. Department of Energy awarded GM $30 million in grants for its hydrogen fuel cell programs in March 2024 as part of $750 million in total funding for 52 projects around the country. The DOE announced last week it would terminate 321 financial awards worth $7.56 billion, but did not specify the projects.

GM never received the federal funding and will work with the DOE and Piston to determine next steps on closing out the programs, Fowle said. ""Today we shared the news with employees. Next step is discussions with external stakeholders,"" he said.

GM's retrenchment follows Stellantis' cancellation of hydrogen fuel cell development efforts, announced this summer. Automakers including GM, Stellantis and Toyota invested substantially in hydrogen as a viable propulsion technology, especially for heavy-duty vehicles. But the timeline for market traction and return on investment has repeatedly been pushed out.

""While hydrogen holds promise for specific high-demand industrial applications like backup power, mining, and heavy trucking, the path to reaching a sustainable business in fuel cells is long and uncertain,"" GM said in a statement posted on its website. ""High costs and limited hydrogen infrastructure in the U.S. has limited consumer adoption of fuel cell-powered vehicles.""

Crain's first reported a year ago about the GM-Piston project in Detroit. The 292,550-square-foot building along Eight Mile Road was expected to serve as the automaker's first standalone hydrogen plant.

GM said it will ""work with Piston to determine another use for the facility.""

National parks have warmed at double the rate of the rest of the country, according to research from Patrick Gonzalez, formerly the principal climate change scientist at the National Park Service.","This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

This summer, national park employees and visitors were asked to do something highly unusual: report any signs that failed to make America look great. The effort, stemming from an executive order from President Donald Trump, has already resulted in the removal of signs about the horrors of slavery, massacres of Indigenous peoples, and the threat of climate change, even on lands directly in harm’s way.

Consider Acadia National Park in Maine. More intense storms and rising seas are accelerating erosion and killing native plants along its iconic coastline. Warmer temperatures are assisting the spread of an invasive insect that totally wiped out the park’s red pines. And yet last month, park employees removed multiple signs explaining how climate change was contributing to these changes.

“Getting access to that information when you’re right there is a way to see with your own eyes what is going on,” said Chellie Pingree, a Democratic representative from Maine. The removed signs didn’t just educate visitors about environmental problems — they also outlined steps visitors could take to reduce their carbon emissions, such as taking a shuttle bus instead of a personal vehicle to visit popular park sites.

Trump’s executive order in March directed the Interior Department to remove descriptions that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living” and focus instead on “the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.” The directive also demanded an emphasis on “the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.” Even items at national park gift shops were subject to review.

This isn’t the first obstacle the Park Service has endured under Trump’s second term. Due to federal cuts, the National Park Service has lost a quarter of its permanent staff, many of whom worked to preserve species and natural features in the parks over the long term. Employees at Acadia are stretched very thin, with more than 60 vacant year-round staff positions, according to Todd Martin, senior program manager for the Northeast for the National Parks Conservation Association. The administration has also proposed cutting the Park Service’s budget for 2026 by $1.2 billion.

Gutting those resources, particularly at a time when climate change is altering national parks, means that the very beauty Trump wants to highlight is at risk of disappearing.

National parks have warmed at double the rate of the rest of the country, according to research from Patrick Gonzalez, formerly the principal climate change scientist at the National Park Service. “More severe heating occurs in national parks because extensive areas of the national park system are located in extreme environments — in the Arctic, at high elevations, and in the arid Southwest,” he said.

Some of the parks’ namesake features could be lost: the glaciers of Montana’s Glacier National Park could vanish within decades, the Joshua trees could eventually disappear at California’s Joshua Tree National Park, and more severe wildfires have already taken out a fifth of California’s famous sequoias. Warming temperatures could hurt Yellowstone National Park’s bison population, and sea level rise is reducing habitat for the Florida panther in the Everglades.

“We as a country worry about losing these spectacular resources, and people want to know what the Park Service is doing to keep them alive and to make sure they survive past this generation,” said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association. “Hiding this information from the public is just not what the Park Service is about.”

Some signs explaining environmental threats came out of the Park Service’s climate change response strategy created under President Barack Obama in 2010, which placed a focus on communicating the risks of global warming — and what could be done about it — to the public. The interpretive signs were carefully vetted by scientists and other experts to ensure they were accurate before they went up, according to Gonzalez.

It’s unclear how many of these signs will be removed as a result of Trump’s executive order, but many have been brought to the administration’s attention. Park officials at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, flagged a plaque explaining how fossil fuels cause air pollution that harms plants and animals. At Everglades National Park, an employee noted that signs about farming and urban development damaging the land “could be conceived as being disparaging to the development of industrial America.” Meanwhile, at Cape Hatteras National Seashore on North Carolina’s Outer Banks, an employee wondered if a sign about sea level rise threatening the Ocracoke ponies’ habitat “reduces the focus on grandeur, beauty, and abundance.”

Other environmental information has already disappeared from park signs. In July, Muir Woods National Monument in Northern California removed its “history under construction” exhibit that had added historical and cultural context to its existing signage. The new information had included explanations of how the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo peoples maintained the land for centuries through cultural burns, as well as informing visitors that the conservationist Gifford Pinchot, who worked to preserve Muir Woods, also promoted eugenics.

Park Service staff have told Brengel that being asked to report and censor their own signs has been a morale killer. “They’re devastated,” she said. She’s heard that some parks have been told not to remove any more signs because of “bad publicity,” but also that many parks west of the Mississippi have been told to keep flagging signs to comply with the directive.

“This is not over,” Brengel said. “They’re planning to censor more parks. It’s just a matter of time at this point.”

None of the national parks Grist contacted commented on the environment-related signs that were removed or flagged for review, deferring to the Department of Interior or the National Park Service. (National parks employees have been told not to talk to journalists, sources told Grist.)

“Thanks to President Donald Trump, Interior is ensuring that the American people are no longer being fed the lies of the delusional Green New Scam,” said Aubrie Spady, the Interior’s deputy press secretary, in a statement. “The content was taken down because this administration believes in only administering facts based on real science to the American public, not brainless fear-mongering rhetoric used to steal taxpayer dollars.”

Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the National Park Service, put it a more neutral way: “The president has directed federal agencies to review interpretive materials to ensure accuracy, honesty, and alignment with shared national values.”

The sign removals are part of a larger pattern to hide information about climate change from public view. In his second term, Trump has launched an assault on climate science, deleting landmark climate reports, slashing funding for climate research, and ending a program that tracked the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Language about the changing climate has vanished from federal websites, including entire pages about it on the Park Service website.

In response, scientists, academics, and other volunteers have worked to save the data that’s being lost and try to make it available for the public to find again.

The erasure of “negative” stories at national parks has spurred another such initiative, called “Save Our Signs.” The goal is to crowdsource photos of signs from National Park Service sites all around the country to create a publicly accessible collection. So far, Save Our Signs has received more than 10,000 photos from hundreds of sites, said Jenny McBurney, a government publications librarian who helped start the project.

Politicians are also pushing back. Last week, Pingree and dozens of representatives signed a letter to National Park Service director Jessica Bowron condemning the removal of historical signs and asking for detailed information on all the signs that had been flagged for violations, altered, or removed.

McBurney said that the Save Our Signs project is still accepting photos, even though it’s already seen an outpouring of support. “You can just tell that people really care about our parks, and they want to make sure that this important information is preserved.”",https://dxu6k2kio89d8.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/07133340/Acadia-climate-change-sign-NPS-Jay-Elhard-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-10 12:09:22.455382

“We have experimented with and implemented a lot of sustainability initiatives over the years,” said Daniel Mallory, Amazon’s vice president of global realty.
Local fabricators supplied and finished the timber components, and lower‑carbon concrete technologies were used where concrete remained necessary.
Amazon will judge DII5 against measurable outcomes: construction impacts, lifecycle carbon, cost, fire performance, durability and constructability.
If mass timber and low‑carbon concrete deliver reliable emissions reductions without meaningful cost or schedule penalties, Amazon’s procurement scale could create immediate market demand for engineered wood and low‑carbon concrete alternatives, accelerating broader adoption.","Amazon has opened its first mass‑timber delivery station at Elkhart, Indiana (DII5), a 39‑acre facility designed to operate as a working laboratory for low‑carbon building systems. The site features more than half a million board feet of southern yellow pine in walls and ceilings, lower‑carbon concrete, generous daylighting and over 170 EV charging stalls, all intended to test which sustainability measures can scale across Amazon’s global portfolio.

“We have experimented with and implemented a lot of sustainability initiatives over the years,” said Daniel Mallory, Amazon’s vice president of global realty. “DII5 continues that effort by taking a culmination of a lot of big ideas, not just in how we operate our facilities, but in how we build them,” Mallory said. Amazon will treat the site as an operational testbed, gathering the complex data needed to decide which materials and systems merit wider rollout.

Wood Central understands that timber is DII5’s defining feature. Mass timber — engineered by laminating standard softwood into large panels and beams — delivers structural performance comparable to concrete and steel while dramatically reducing embodied carbon and storing atmospheric CO₂ in long‑lived building elements.

Kristen Dotson, Amazon’s principal for sustainable buildings, said locking carbon into timber for 50 to 100 years creates a tangible carbon “bank,” preventing that CO₂ from returning to the atmosphere and materially lowering a building’s lifecycle emissions. “The game‑changing part around mass timber is that it’s taking a ready commodity and turning it into this structural element that can replace much of the concrete and steel that goes into a building,” Dotson said.

DII5 pairs its timber structure with proven performance systems: heat pumps, clerestory daylighting and LED controls to cut operational energy; a 15,000‑gallon rainwater capture and filtration system for toilet reuse; and more than 170 EV chargers supporting roughly 125 electric delivery vehicles already on site. Local fabricators supplied and finished the timber components, and lower‑carbon concrete technologies were used where concrete remained necessary.

Marty Brennan, design architect and sustainability lead at ZGF, described DII5 as both a design and supply‑chain experiment. “The scheme brings together numerous partners from across the building industry to create a welcoming experience of light, wood, and native prairies,” he said, reflecting an intent to pair environmental performance with material and spatial quality.

Amazon will judge DII5 against measurable outcomes: construction impacts, lifecycle carbon, cost, fire performance, durability and constructability.

The new report comes to us from H2-diplo and is called the “Green Hydrogen and Regional Cooperation in Central Asia” study.
It aims to develop green hydrogen possibilities for nations in Central Asia.
Green hydrogen has come exceedingly far in a very short time frame as certain European nations aim to boost aid for green hydrogen and ammonia-powered ships.
Central Asia is key to unlocking the potential that the green hydrogen and ammonia sector has stored away","A recent report has eyed the overwhelming potential for green hydrogen cooperation in Central Asia. The region has lagged behind the rest of the world in the adoption of the renewable energy sector, and this new development fosters international cooperation that could catapult green hydrogen into the global energy conversation. The new report comes to us from H2-diplo and is called the “Green Hydrogen and Regional Cooperation in Central Asia” study. It aims to develop green hydrogen possibilities for nations in Central Asia.

The report highlights the role that green hydrogen could play in transforming the energy sector in Central Asia

The world has embraced the potential that the green hydrogen sector has in troves and has implemented measures to develop the technology enabling us to finally make use of green hydrogen in the energy sector.

Despite Central Asia’s untapped wind and solar potential, renewable energy accounts for 2% of energy generation in the region as of 2022. Green hydrogen could alter that percentage significantly, as the report states.

Despite the overwhelming global narrative that has emerged recently, calling for a more practical approach to the hydrogen sector, most nations in Central Asia have not been able to take advantage of the new approach to the energy sector. The report calls for significant investments from international bodies that could foster growth for the hydrogen sector in the region.

Kazakhstan recently hosted the second Central Asian Regional Forum on Decarbonization Diplomacy

Kazakhstan is the Central Asian nation leading the push to integrate the hydrogen sector into its plans for the future of the energy sector. The event in Astana saw more than 150 participants from the government, international organizations, business, academia, and civil society.

Among the topics discussed at the Central Asian Regional Forum on Decarbonization Diplomacy were:

National hydrogen roadmaps

renewable grid integration

inclusivity and investment conditions

Regional certification for a trusted hydrogen market

Exemplifying international cooperation is key to the Central Asian region, as proven by the signing of a cooperation agreement between the Kazakh Ministry of Energy and the German Hydrogen Diplomacy Office, which happened at the event. Green hydrogen has come exceedingly far in a very short time frame as certain European nations aim to boost aid for green hydrogen and ammonia-powered ships.

Among the high-level government attendees was none other than Kazakhstan Deputy Foreign Minister Arman Issetov, who delivered the opening address.

“This gathering comes at a crucial time across the globe. The energy transition is no longer a distant vision for Central Asia. This transition is not just about reducing emissions. It is about economic resilience, regional stability and global relevance. When we talk about energy transition, a key question arises: who will drive this process? It is about people ready to bring the green strategy to life. (…) We believe that we have to invest in our human capital” – Kazakhstan Deputy Foreign Minister Arman Issetov

He also noted that by fostering regional cooperation in training and research, Central Asia has the potential to dominate the hydrogen sector for the foreseeable future.

,Louisiana Environment,2025-10-10 15:38:19+00:00,www.nrdc.org,Setting the Record Straight About Offshore Wind and Whales - NRDC,Not Available,,,,,https://www.nrdc.org/bio/rebecca-loomis/setting-record-straight-about-offshore-wind-and-whales,"Federal agencies and independent scientists have found no causal link between offshore wind development and whale deaths.
Over the last 10 months, President Trump and others in his administration have implied or alleged that offshore wind projects harm whales and that environmental reviews and other permitting processes for offshore wind were rushed or carried out improperly.
Multiple species of great whales—North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and minke whales—are currently experiencing unusual mortality events off the East Coast.
But again, there is no evidence that offshore wind development is the cause.
Offshore wind development is a critical component of mitigating climate change, and responsible offshore wind development enjoys broad support from coastal communities and environmental organizations.","Federal agencies and independent scientists have found no causal link between offshore wind development and whale deaths. In fact, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Fisheries, the agency responsible for marine mammal conservation and management, explains in its FAQ on offshore wind and whales: “There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.” Earlier this year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office similarly reported that NOAA Fisheries “does not anticipate any death or serious injury to whales from offshore wind related actions.” And the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)—the agency responsible for siting and permitting offshore wind projects—stated in 2024 that “[a]ll current evidence indicates that there are no links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities, including site characterization surveys.”

Independent scientists have likewise found “no evidence” that offshore wind development resulted in whale deaths or strandings (when a whale is found onshore due to injury, distress, disease, or death).

There is simply no credible evidence to support claims that offshore wind has caused whale deaths. Over the last 10 months, President Trump and others in his administration have implied or alleged that offshore wind projects harm whales and that environmental reviews and other permitting processes for offshore wind were rushed or carried out improperly. Yet the administration has not identified a single piece of evidence or produced a credible scientific study to back up its claims.

On day one of his second term, President Trump issued a memorandum directing federal agencies to assess the impacts of offshore wind projects on wildlife, including marine mammals, but no assessment has been released. And on April 16, 2025, BOEM ordered the Empire Wind project off Long Island to halt construction while the agency “address[ed] feedback it has received, including from [NOAA], about the environmental analyses for that project[.]” However, the agency never provided an explanation as to why work was stopped or what feedback was received from NOAA, beyond publishing online an almost entirely redacted report. BOEM eventually allowed Empire Wind to resume construction.

Offshore wind projects undergo extensive multiyear reviews and are subject to a variety of laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires agencies to review the environmental impacts of development, and the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act, which require protective measures to help ensure that activities do not harm protected whales. Existing federal permitting requirements provide a robust and established way for federal agencies to engage with developers, state and local agencies, Tribes, and the public to address potential impacts to the environment, national security, and other uses of the ocean from offshore wind projects.

These processes are proven and have helped protect wildlife and improve government decisionmaking for decades. Not to mention that the Trump administration is speaking out of both sides of its mouth—decrying multiyear offshore wind permitting processes as “rushed” while rolling back some of the very same permitting requirements for the fossil fuel industry, even though offshore oil and gas activities pose well-documented and major threats to whales like Cook Inlet beluga whales and Gulf of Mexico Rice’s whales.

Multiple species of great whales—North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and minke whales—are currently experiencing unusual mortality events off the East Coast. Such events are declared when there is a marked increase in death, injury, or morbidity (defined as sublethal injury or illness) for a particular mammal species. But again, there is no evidence that offshore wind development is the cause. Vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear are by far the largest direct human sources of mortality for most whales. These two threats are pushing North Atlantic right whales to the brink of extinction.

For humpbacks, roughly 40 percent of necropsies show harm from vessel strike or entanglement. Necropsies of minke whales indicate that many animals are suffering from infectious diseases or have been impacted by human interaction. The other large whale species found off the East Coast—blue whales, fin whales, and sei whales—are all listed as endangered due to the lasting impacts of industrial whaling and are similarly impacted by human activities.

Climate change exacerbates the stress on whales. As ocean warming changes the distribution of key prey, large whale distributions are shifting. These shifts have brought whales into greater conflict with human activities like fishing and vessels and increased their susceptibility to malnourishment, poor health, and vessel strikes.

Rather than tilting at windmills, the Trump administration could take real steps to address the actual causes of whale injuries and deaths on the East Coast. Science confirms the value of vessel speed restrictions in reducing deaths of large whale species and sea turtles from vessel collisions. If it adopted additional 10-knot speed limits for certain vessels in whale habitat, NOAA would meaningfully reduce vessel strike risk.

The administration could also address entanglement in vertical buoy lines by issuing stronger regulations and investing in ropeless (on-demand) fishing systems for the American lobster and Jonah crab fisheries to offset the economic burden of obtaining new gear.

And, if the administration cares about the long-term health of whale populations in a changing climate, federal agencies should continue to advance responsibly developed offshore wind projects that include mitigation and monitoring requirements to protect whales and other wildlife. Offshore wind development is a critical component of mitigating climate change, and responsible offshore wind development enjoys broad support from coastal communities and environmental organizations.

Instead of attacking the renewable energy sources that we need to avoid climate catastrophe and firing the very scientists working to monitor and protect our beloved whales, the administration should implement science-based protections for these iconic marine mammals.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/seismictesting_549495370_900x600.jpg?h=b69e0e0e&itok=zRbJyx7V,N,,2025-10-10 13:08:10.196826

All approved 2026–29 utility plans and stipulated agreements between utilities and advocates can be found on the ICC’s Stakeholder Advisory Group website.

Consistently considered the key to our clean energy future and the lowest-cost energy resource, energy efficiency reduces household utility bills and energy demand, creates good-paying jobs, and reduces pollution from our buildings and strain on our energy systems. Since energy efficiency programs launched in 2008, they have demonstrated how critical more robust Illinois utilities’ investments are and how they can—and must—be improved.

Although arduous, the 2026–29 energy efficiency plan negotiations toward settlement were successful in modeling that under inclusive and accessible energy decision-making processes, historic gains can be made to ensure clean and efficient technology investments benefit all—especially communities that have been disenfranchised by the legacy energy system.

Key highlights of the approved negotiated portfolios

An increase in income-qualified (low-income) energy efficiency program investments by $25.4 million per year above their 2022–25 portfolio commitments and $41.7 million per year more than companies had first proposed to spend before negotiations began

Nearly $408 million per year invested in workforce training programs and initiatives to expand or launch new local and diverse businesses and community-action agencies in energy efficiency

A significantly expanded focus for electric utilities on installing heat pumps for electrification and in affordable multifamily buildings with highly inefficient electric resistance heat (i.e., window units and baseboards)

Sunsetting methane gas furnace rebates for higher-income residential Ameren customers after 2027 in light of federal appliance standards and focusing on building weatherization improvements for all Illinois gas consumers

Increasing ComEd’s focus on all-electric new construction/gut rehab programming and Ameren’s new income-qualified electrification program for propane-heated homes

Other successful outcomes include greater investments into small business, commercial, and industrial programs; more robust health and safety budgets to address pre-weatherization issues like mold and roof repair; and improved data reporting metrics to better hold utilities accountable to the effectiveness of their programs.

NRDC has estimated that through these programs, the equipment and building upgrades invested each year will, over their lifetime, save enough electricity to power roughly three million homes and save enough gas to heat about half a million homes annually. That’s the annual carbon pollution equivalent of 122,358 average gas-powered cars!

But the work doesn’t end here

The Illinois General Assembly is expected to gather during October 2025’s veto legislative session to reexamine Senate Bill 25 (SB25), a version of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act that the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition introduced last session—which was blocked before a vote could make it law on the final day of session.

SB25 makes critical improvements to the state’s electric energy efficiency program by increasing energy savings targets to 2 percent of total utility sales, introducing a goal to reduce peak demand on the grid, tripling minimum requirements for income-qualified investment, and increasing the amount of building electrification utilities can facilitate.

But, Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City, is wary of a new economic development tool in general.
Additionally, the bill would require lawmakers to submit their request before the date the budget bill containing it was passed by their chamber for the first time.
“This legislation will help address that in the future.” The Michigan Economic Development Corporation has not reported receiving millions of that grant back to the corporation.
Anthony said she also didn’t want to create a cumbersome process for organizations that are traditionally overlooked in the state budget.","Policies like decoupling are “what you get when you support Democrats,” House Speaker Matt Hall said during a press conference on Tuesday.

After the budget passed, business groups pushed back on the plan to separate federal and state tax code, which was an integral part of the plan to provide funding for roads. A coalition of business chambers and stakeholder groups said it would make taxes more confusing and expensive for businesses, thereby making Michigan less competitive.

The legislation, HB 4961, now PA 24, responds to the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act that allows businesses to pay less in taxes federally, around $677 million less to the state. Now, under state law, the federal tax changes will not have bearing on state taxes.

“These business groups support Democrats. Some of them even endorsed Gretchen Whitmer,” Hall said. “That’s what you get when you support Democrats… If you look at the Republican plan, the Republican plan was to eliminate $3 billion of waste, fraud, and abused. We showed how we could do that and fix the roads.”

He said that any plan that raised taxes for working Michigan residents, such as increasing the gas tax or raising registration fees, was untenable to Republicans.

“Actual working people and seniors don’t have lobbyists,” he said. “One thing we’re never going to have is increases in our hunting and fishing fees… as long as I’m speaker.”

Hall said he was willing to stand up to the interests of business groups.

“They don’t like my position on getting rid of the MEGA credits either,” he said. “The ones that get the MEGA credits and the ones that are affected by decoupling, they overlap a lot.”

Hall also touted other Republican wins in the budget, including no taxes on overtime and tips, record education spending– including money for the school safety and mental health, requiring 80% occupancy in state-owned buildings, eliminating unfilled full-time equivalent employees and putting money into the Public Safety Trust Fund.

“Our priorities were public safety, education and fixing roads. Democrats tried to tell you that you had to pick between fixing the roads and funding education, I always said we didn’t have to,” he said. “Decoupling helped us accomplish those priorities.”

The budget process also brought about greater transparency, Hall said.

“You saw the Democrats do some transparency in this budget,” he said. “The reason that these negotiations went on as long as they did…we were just at a standstill for a very long time over transparency.”

He went on to say that legislation was coming that would make the transparency requirements for public hearings and disclosure prior to the budget passing permanent.

During this budget process, Hall said Republicans achieved what they set out to do when they walked off the floor last term during lame duck, which was earned sick time, tipped minimum wage, and funding for local roads.

Next year’s budget will have more cuts, Hall said.

“We’re right sizing this budget,” he said. “We’re getting value for your dollars, and we’re setting priorities… this is the trajectory we’re moving on to eliminate further waste, fraud, and abuse next year.”

In a post-Strategic Outreach and Attraction Revenue fund Michigan, the question stands: If not SOAR money for economic development, then what’s next?

The SOAR fund was ended in the budget passed early Friday morning, not depositing its annual $500 million. Some lawmakers are calling for a brand-new tool to attract businesses and others want to see other issues addressed in efforts to attract businesses without subsidies.

With the critics of SOAR, one theme stands: getting rid of “picking winners and losers.”

In TV interviews on Friday following the passage, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the next challenge facing the state was not ceding the state’s “competitive edge” in creating more jobs in the state (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Oct. 6, 2025).

Stacey LaRouche, press secretary for Whitmer, said Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, and House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, have agreed to pass legislation before the end of the calendar year that would “make it easier to create and retain good-paying, high-skill jobs in Michigan.”

Hall told reporters on Tuesday that his preferred route in economic development would be through a bill not yet introduced by Rep. Mike Hoadley, R-Au Gres, that would change the High-Wage Incentive for Regional Employment program.

Hall also called for eliminating SOAR altogether outside of just defunding it as well as repealing mega credits.

He said the state needs a tool that can prove the jobs are being created and are high-paying, especially with promises from President Donald Trump to help Michigan land deals, and that economic development will take precedence over other conversations.

Hall said one economic development bill from Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn, HB 5073, that would raise the tax cap for the transformational brownfield plans, is not a priority he would like to chase now.

Farhat was the first to say early Friday morning after the House passed the budget bills that the Legislature was going to pivot its focus to economic development (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Oct. 2, 2025).

Farhat told Gongwer News Service on Tuesday that the next economic development plan is a mix of addressing seemingly outside issues from direct business, like the roads deal to make infrastructure changes, but also in creating something new for business attraction.

“I’ll continue having these conversations around what that the new tools look like, but I’ll definitely say we’re going to want something that holds developers accountable to any promises they make, keep employers accountable, but it also spurs growth, and that is something that’s going to generate a positive impact,” Farhat said.

Farhat said the state cannot simply “do nothing” and allow families to face economic uncertainty.

But, Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City, is wary of a new economic development tool in general.

“The best thing that can happen right now is for us not to replace SOAR with anything,” Wegela said. “There are already a million different ways businesses can get help from the state, and we should be repealing those instead of expanding them.”

There are more tax abatements and “tools” that businesses have at their disposal than he can name, Wegela said, making it “absurd” to him that there would be a need to replace SOAR with something else.

He said economic development should not be about handouts, but instead about making life more affordable for Michiganders including addressing public housing, having strong unions, funding roads, in which he said the funding plan probably does not go far enough for all the infrastructure needs, and other “basics” that result in a better economic impact.

The state can’t meet basic functionalities, Wegela said, but is planning again about how to build more tools for businesses.

“To be quite frank, I don’t care about giving businesses more tools, I care about working-class people having things that their taxes paid for first,” Wegela said. “The state hasn’t learned that lesson. I don’t think SOAR going away is going to (teach) that lesson. I guarantee you there is going to be some new magic wand that’s going to make business come here.”

Sen. Mallory McMorrow, D-Royal Oak, said the Legislature is in a “healthy place” where they can acknowledge that while SOAR was well-intentioned, it’s not working and look to the future instead.

She touted her legislation, SB 213 and SB 214 , as something that could change the course of development with the 10-year strategic plan along with a board that would develop and oversee the plan, which would address both underlying issues of access to education, housing, population and others, but then also creating tools that would make sense for the state.

She said there must be this plan before creating more avenues because if not, it may feel like the state is “grabbing copies of tools to put in a toolbox that may not necessarily take us into one singular direction.”

When it comes to Hall’s wishes, McMorrow said she aligns with him on the fact that the state cannot “incentivize our way out of our fundamentals,” like building the talent.

McMorrow said brownfield transformation is essential to avoid businesses passing communities by for other land and there is considerable support in her caucus for that.

Rep. Mark Tisdel, R-Rochester Hills, said his view is that if there were to be a new incentive tool, it should be run on a reimbursement schedule rather than upfront funding, wanting to see more accountability on the backend.

Tisdel pointed to boilerplate language in the recent budget as to what to expect out of a new phase of development that pushes for reimbursement instead of grants and the directives for money only being sent to established businesses or organizations, referencing the 2022 legislative grant for Fay Beydoun and her international business accelerator, Global Link International, which was created only a few days before the money was awarded.

Rep. Steve Carra, R-Three Rivers, said the plan after SOAR should be lower taxes across the board and less regulations so all businesses can thrive.

“Government is getting in the way with too much red tape, paperwork, compliance, data mining by the state, guilty until proven innocent type of governance is suppressing business in general,” Carra said. “If we can have a business-friendly environment with lower taxes across the board for everybody it will be setting our state up for success.”

Alongside the sunsetting of SOAR, lawmakers like Sen. Thomas Albert, R-Lowell, have raised the idea of dismantling the Michigan Economic Development Corporation altogether.

When looking at how the changes in SOAR could affect the MEDC, Wegela said there is still need for some of the uses of the corporation outside of government subsidies. He said there needs to be drastic leadership changes inside the corporation, but that there is no need to get rid of it.

The MEDC was formed in 1999 through an interlocal agreement as a successor to economic attraction efforts housed directly within state government.

He said while people like to blame the MEDC for problems in development, the Legislature ultimately gives the corporation “the green light.”

McMorrow said what she hears from her constituents is a call for decentralizing the economic development arm that may not “accurately reflect the needs or strengths of the different regions,” whether that means resizing or spreading out across the state.

She said Michigan is now in the position that Virginia was in a few years ago, in which their lawmakers were upset with their equivalent of the MEDC, that led to “steep reform” and a plan for development like hers.

On the other hand, Tisdel said there isn’t really a purpose for the MEDC, envisioning the reimbursement incentives he wants to see handled by the Department of Treasury, wanting to push against potential political pressure in these grants that he says the MEDC has. Carra wants to fully abolish the MEDC as well, saying getting rid of SOAR is steps in the right direction.

When asked if there is one correct answer to economic development in the state, Carra said “stop doing it.”

“Let the market run its course,” Carra said.

Danielle Emerson, spokesperson for the MEDC, said in a statement to Gongwer News Service that while SOAR was contemplated to sunset, MEDC will be working with the Legislature on “tools and resources to meet this moment in time while continuing to provide support for Michigan’s small businesses, entrepreneurs, local communities, and more the way we always have.”

The MEDC also released a statement after the budget was signed by Whitmer, saying the corporation would continue work on the “Make it in Michigan” economic development strategy.

“We are encouraged that this budget will sustain investment in job creation and grow our tax base by supporting small businesses and communities on both peninsulas, ensuring continued focus on people, places and projects across the state,” MEDC Chief Executive Officer Quentin Messer Jr. said in a statement. “This budget provides a path forward for Team Michigan, investing in programs ranging from the arts and tourism and hospitality to supporting dual use aerospace and defense activities. While work remains, these budgetary investments ensure Pure Michigan remains a great place to visit, work, create businesses, and put down roots.”

A cannabis industry group has sued the state over a newly passed wholesale tax on cannabis products as part of a long-term road funding deal, arguing the Legislature and executive branch violated the state Constitution.

In a lawsuit, filed Tuesday afternoon in the Court of Claims the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association contends that the Legislature violated the Constitution by passing a law that amends a voter-initiated law without the necessary three-fourths vote required in both chambers.

The bill, HB 4951, now Public Act 23 of 2025, was signed Tuesday by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer moments before the suit was filed.

The suit is against the Department of Treasury and Treasurer Rachael Eubanks in her capacity as state treasurer.

As passed, PA 23 enacts a 24% wholesale tax on cannabis products in Michigan, a move that was staunchly opposed by industry when it began moving through the Legislature late last month. The tax will be collected beginning Jan. 1, 2026.

Member of the House voted 78-21 for the bill on Sept. 25, five votes shy of a three-quarters majority. The Senate early last Friday morning passed the tax 19-17.

In its suit, the group states that the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act passed by voters in 2018 is the exclusive vehicle for imposing excise taxes on all sales and transfers of marijuana.

“Section 13 of MRTMA provides that “in addition to all other taxes, an excise tax is imposed on each marihuana establishment and on each person who sells marihuana[.]”” the suit states. “The import of this language is clear: while other taxes may generally apply to marihuana, such as the sales tax, MRTMA is the exclusive mechanism for imposing excise taxes. Legislative authority over marihuana excises taxes is exclusive to MRTMA; no other statute may intrude upon or duplicate the marihuana excise tax. Thus, additional excise taxes require a direct amendment to MRTMA itself.”

The Comprehensive Road Funding Tax Act created under PA 23 of 2025 by the Legislature without the three-quarters majorities in both chambers is in violation of Article 2, Section 9 of the Michigan Constitution, the lawsuit states.

It was pointed out that many of the definitions and parts of language in the new act were lifted directly from the 2018 voter-initiated law, meaning that Treasury must rely on the 2018 law to implement and enforce the newly passed law.

“Any ambiguity as to which transaction, products, or entities are subject to CRFTA’s excise tax can only be resolved by reference to MRTMA,” the suit states. “It is impossible to construe CRFTA independently without reference to MRTMA. CRFTA is therefore fundamentally dependent on MRTMA.”

The lawsuit also alleges that the new law violates Article 4, Section 24 of the Constitution, which states that no laws can contain more than one subject, nor can a bill be altered by the Legislature to change its original purpose as determined by its content and not alone by its title.

Further, the new law unlawfully amends the 2018 tax law by reference, the suit adds.

The suit seeks a declaratory judgment that PA 23 of 2025 is invalid and unenforceable. The group also seeks an order that the defendants comply with the court’s order and judgement as well as provide for any other relief the court deems proper.

As part of the deal to pass the state’s budget for fiscal year 2025-26 last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee met on Wednesday to discuss a bill that would enshrine transparency measures around budget earmarks, or legislatively directed spending items, in statute.

The committee took up SB 596, which outlines the requirements for earmark transparency, which would require requests to include the name of the requesting legislator, the total amount of the item and estimated cost of the project, the name of the intended recipient or intended location, the expected outcomes and deliverables of the request, a statement attesting there was no conflict of interest, verification of a recipient’s nonprofit status, or a statement that the recipient was not a for-profit entity. Additionally, the bill would require lawmakers to submit their request before the date the budget bill containing it was passed by their chamber for the first time. The bill would allow each chamber to establish other deadlines.

The bill is similar to the earmark transparency passed by the House earlier this year (See Gongwer Michigan Report June 4, 2025).

“The Senate may add more exposure, and the House may have its own spin,” bill sponsor and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Sarah Anthony, said. “Ideally, we would have a shared set of disclosure that we would all make sure are contemplated, and then the flavor the Senate does it versus the House, I think ultimately it’s up to this body.”

The goal, ultimately, Anthony said, is for the public to know how their tax dollars are being spent.

Sen. John Damoose, R-Harbor Springs, said he was eager for this form of transparency in the budget process.

“By and large, I want people to know that I have something in the budget. We’re all trying to prove to our constituents back home that we’re effective for them,” he said.

Damoose went on to say having these measures in place also protected lawmakers from having earmarks put into the budget in their name without their knowledge.

“Now that we have this, we can take credit, basically, for the things we did try to get in there and also have proof of the things we didn’t try to get in,” he said.

The bill also includes requirements for recipients to enter an agreement with the state before receiving the funds, and if they are found not to meet the terms of the agreement, the state would be able to cease payments and cancel the grant if a satisfactory correction plan was not submitted.

“Even when we look at the Fay Beydoun incident, it should not have taken that long to retrieve taxpayer dollars,” Anthony said. “This legislation will help address that in the future.”

The Michigan Economic Development Corporation has not reported receiving millions of that grant back to the corporation.

Senators raised questions about the requirement of making grants only for nonprofit or not for profit entities, which Anthony said could be discussed further.

Anthony said she also didn’t want to create a cumbersome process for organizations that are traditionally overlooked in the state budget.

She said she had little interest in taking up some of the other transparency legislation passed by the House, such as the cooling off period for lawmakers before becoming lobbyists. Instead, Anthony said it would be better to pass legislation that would open the House, the Senate and the Governor’s Office up to FOIA requests, and other legislation that would get the public more involved in transparency.

“It would be great if your average Michigander was interested and involved in (the budget) process. I have always been committed to lifting up the voices of men and women across our state, so I’m looking for ways to make the process not just more transparent, but more accessible,” Anthony said. “I would be thrilled if the Speaker started with FOIA reform. When we talk about transparency, shining a light on how decisions are made in this place is something that I think the speaker has supported in the past. It was one of the first things that came out of our Senate majority this year. It all starts with FOIA reform and making sure that we have a process. From there, I think we build upon that.”

Anthony also briefly discussed the path forward for economic development, now that the budget is passed and transparency legislation is moving.

She said that people on both sides of the aisle were tired of incentives that didn’t yield results for taxpayers.

“I hope that we can get to a place that we can have strong tools to make sure that we are competitive on not just a national stage, but a global stage,” she said. “What we don’t need to do is pay corporations and not get much back in return.”",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Michigan-State-Capitol.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 17:03:46.508980

As the EPA’s authority expanded through the passage of landmark environmental statutes, criticism of the agency has grown to a point where deregulation has become a recurring rallying cry for industries and conservative politicians who see EPA rules as costly, burdensome and an overreach of federal power.

“We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years.
The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead sequester liquified carbon dioxide.
“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said.
Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.","DES MOINES — Iowa biofuels and corn experts congratulated Nebraska for its first shipments of carbon dioxide on the Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline, but said Wednesday that the development means Iowa is no longer king at turning corn into ethanol.

Monte Shaw, the executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said now that Nebraska has a functioning CO2 pipeline, ethanol plants in the state can take advantage of lucrative tax credits from the federal government and sell into the ultra-low carbon ethanol market.

“Iowa has worn the crown,” Shaw said at a new conference Wednesday. “We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years. Last week, we got knocked off.”

Trailblazer and 45z

Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline, which is slated to stretch several hundred miles and transport CO2 from ethanol plants in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming to an underground storage site in Wyoming, had its first CO2 shipment Oct. 3.

The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead sequester liquified carbon dioxide. By sequestering the carbon dioxide created in the process of turning corn into ethanol, the plants are able to lower the “lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions” of the fuel below a certain level, set by the U.S. Department of Energy, that makes the fuel eligible for a per-gallon tax credit.

These credits, known as 45z, were initiated under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. While the IRA was mostly dismantled by the Trump administration, 45z credits were extended under the Republican led tax cut law, known as the “one big beautiful bill.”

Shaw said the credits can add about 66 cents per gallon of ethanol, which is a lot for an industry that “usually tries to make a penny or two.”

Impacts to Iowa

According to IRFA, Iowa produces about 4.7 billion gallons of ethanol annually. Shaw said if each of those gallons could take advantage of the credits and add 66 cents per gallon, it would equate to more than $3 billion in added value to the industry annually.

“If Iowa wants to maintain low taxes, if we want to do further property tax reform and things of that nature, then the state needs a strong ag economy,” Shaw said. “Ethanol producers need access to the tools in this state to remain competitive with the plants around us that are moving forward.”

Steve Kuiper, vice president of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the boost to Iowa ethanol would directly impact corn farmers by increasing demand and potential price for corn, but would also “trickle down” to the state’s economy.

Farmers have faced several years in a row of high interest rates, high input costs, and low market prices for their crops. Trade wars between the U.S. and the countries where it sells ag commodities and purchases inputs have also added stress to farmers. According to a September survey from the National Corn Growers Association, nearly 50% of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis.

“The Iowa agriculture economy is in tough shape,” Kuiper said. “Farmers are farming at a loss. Lenders are very, very anxious right now.”

Dave Miller, the chief economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said as corn yields continue to grow, farmers need a market that accounts for an extra 150 million bushels a year through 2050.

Miller said the low-carbon ethanol market facilitated by carbon sequestration could create the potential for an additional 12 million gallons of ethanol, which he said could be fulfilled by the current farming yield increases.

“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said. “So there’s a real competitive advantage that’s going to open up for Nebraska farmers compared to Iowa farmers.”

Seth Harder, CEO of two ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa, said he has seen the things in the industry that Iowa does “really great” but he also sees that the states he operates in are on the edge of a “paradigm shift.”

“As Nebraska sees this influx of funds, we hear plants are talking about not only expanding, but doubling,” Harder said.

Harder said the demand for ethanol appears to be on the rise with the recent decision from California allowing the sale of a higher blend of ethanol fuel, E-15, and the prospect of more states joining in on the trend.

Challenges

Shaw said he believes Iowa is on the cusp of a “fairly substantial farm crisis.”

“Nothing will solve this problem until we grow demand or reduce production, and reducing production would be devastating to the economy of Iowa in the Midwest,” he said.

Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. Debate on the topic caused splits among GOP lawmakers during the legislative session and has continued to be a divisive issue in the party.

The Trailblazer pipeline had fewer roadblocks than those that have popped up in Iowa. This is in part because Nebraska does not require state approval for CO2 pipelines, and because much of the pipeline was already built as the natural gas line.

Landowners and environmental groups, including the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, that are opposed to CO2 sequestration pipelines call the Summit project a “boondoggle.” Opponents worry about property values and the safety of carbon sequestration pipelines. They have also said sequestering carbon should not qualify as a public use, which a project must have in order to use eminent domain.

Shaw said it doesn’t matter what someone thinks about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and why it should or shouldn’t be sequestered, because for renewable fuel members, this is a “business decision.”

The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is the most well known carbon sequestration project in Iowa, but Shaw said there are other companies and facilities looking for places in Iowa to sequester carbon, or to otherwise build carbon sequestration pipelines.

On the nearest horizon, Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE located near Council Bluffs, is slated to connect to the Trailblazer pipeline and potentially begin sequestering carbon at the plant in late 2026.

The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline cannot begin construction in Iowa until it secures permits for storage in North Dakota and for passage through South Dakota, which has become challenging due to the enactment of a restricting law in South Dakota. The company filed to change its permit with the Iowa Utilities Commission to remove the Dakota-specific language, in the event it is able to secure a “​​better solution” for storage and passage.

Shaw said the “economic consequences” of the development in Nebraska could be a “bump in the road” for Iowa if the state adapts and brings its own carbon sequestration practices online, or it could lead to “production and demand flow from places like Iowa to places like Nebraska.”

“We’re asking the Iowa Legislature to support President Trump’s energy leadership and to help avert what I personally feel is a pending farm crisis, and to help put Iowa’s economy back on stable ground,” Shaw said.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_8614-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:08:55.063334

A Bureau of Land Management webpage providing updates on the progress of Esmeralda Seven Solar—a 6.2 gigawatt (GW) installation in rural Nevada—now states that the endeavor is cancelled, without further context. If built to full spec, the site would’ve been one of the largest power plants in the United States, comparable to the Grand Coulee Dam (about 6.8 GW).

Of course, this should come as no surprise to anyone following the actions of Trump 2.0’s offices. Solar, if you haven’t heard by now, is a big ‘scam’- and it must be a really good one, too, considering so many utilities, states, and hyperscalers continue to fall for it and pursue clean energy projects regardless of federal sentiment and a looming tax incentive rugpull.

And while you’re at it, take any lingering ‘American energy dominance’ rhetoric somewhere else, because I don’t buy it for a second.

“The president doesn’t like windmills” is not even close to being a valid reason to sabotage an entire industry; “The sun doesn’t always shine” is how a six-year-old thinks about solar power.

Clean energy is not just a part of our future- it is the only future, and the longer we wait to catch up to China (and Europe in many respects, quite frankly), the worse off we’ll be for it.

Arevon Starts Up Solar Operations in Indiana

Developer, owner, and operator Arevon Energy announced this week that operations are underway at its Ratts 1 and Heirloom Solar projects in Pike County, Indiana. Together, the projects add 264 megawatts (MWdc) to the grid and are the company’s first owned and operational utility-scale projects in the Hoosier State.

Ratts 1 and Heirloom represent an investment of nearly $400 million and will disburse more than $86 million to local governments over their lifespans, supporting schools, infrastructure, and other essential public services. The two facilities employed more than 200 full-time equivalent personnel to build the projects. Ratts 1 Solar is under a long-term power purchase agreement with Indiana Municipal Power Agency (IMPA), and hyperscaler Meta is the offtaker for Heirloom Solar.

“Ratts 1 and Heirloom are about more than megawatts — they are tangible illustrations of the positive and real impact renewable energy can bring to local communities,” said Arevon CEO Kevin Smith. “These facilities will produce American-made power for decades, while also supporting Pike County’s economy and quality of life. Arevon is proud to be a long-term partner here, as we continue to invest in Indiana’s future.”

“Pike County is an energy community, and renewable energy sources are a piece of our diversified energy strategy. We are grateful for Arevon’s investment in our area,” added Ashley Willis, MPA, EDFP, Executive Director at the Pike County Economic Development Corporation. “Solar power is a wonderful asset for rural communities, like Pike County, to increase assessed value and has had a positive impact on our tax revenue for our taxing districts.”

Arevon, which owns and operates more than 5.5 gigawatts (GW) of solar and energy storage projects across 17 states, is actively growing its portfolio in the Midwest. Besides Ratts 1 and Heirloom, the company is currently constructing the two-phase 430 MWdc Kelso Solar Project in Missouri, and developed and managed the construction of the 251 MWdc Gibson Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), and the 228 MWdc Posey Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company.

Base Power Raises A Billion Bucks

Typical fundraising announcements on this website rarely include a corresponding dollar value starting with the letter ‘B,’ but that should tell you how hot energy storage is right now.

Texas-based distributed storage pioneer Base Power announced Wednesday that it has raised $1 billion in Series C financing, led by Addition. All other major investors in the round are re-investing, including: Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, Elad Gil, 137 Ventures, Terrain, and Waybury. New major investors include Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” stated Zach Dell, CEO and co-founder of Base Power. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.”

In less than two years, Base Power has deployed more than 100 MWh of residential battery capacity, making it one of the fastest-scaling distributed energy platforms in the country. The company has also partnered with homebuilder Lennar and several utilities on virtual power plants, recently qualifying for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, which allows distributed batteries to be combined and bid directly into the grid.

Base Power is building its first energy storage and power electronics factory at the site of the former Austin American-Statesman printing press in the heart of downtown Austin.

Doral Finds Offtaker for Cold Creek Solar

Utility-scale developer and independent power producer Doral Renewables has executed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a corporate buyer for its 430 MWac Cold Creek Solar Project located in Schleicher and Tom Green Counties, Texas. The Agreement covers 75% of the facility’s energy output and 100% of the associated Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). The Cold Creek Solar project is expected to deliver over 1 million MWh annually.

Cold Creek Solar is expected to deliver over 1 million MWh annually. The project will boost local infrastructure and community impact initiatives, such as road improvements and emergency responders, as part of its community engagement. The project also supported a local non-profit during a recent summer flooding emergency.

“Our ability to work with top companies and utilities is a testament to our business plan and commitment to new renewable energy projects across the United States,” said Sean Boyle, Vice President, Markets of Doral Renewables. “This new relationship is a substantial accomplishment and a foundational agreement as Doral continues to expand its operating portfolio across the country”.

The transaction increases the company’s contracted energy generation to more than 1.6 GW in total.

Nexamp Scores $330 Million Construction Warehouse Facility

Distributed solar and storage solutions company Nexamp announced the closing of a three-year, $330 million Construction Warehouse Facility (CWF) with a consortium of leading financial institutions. The financing will enable Nexamp to develop, construct, and finance a revolving portfolio of approximately 20 new distributed generation assets, advancing the company’s mission to address increased energy demand with reliable, affordable domestic resources.

The CWF provides flexible construction capital to support Nexamp’s near-term pipeline of solar and energy storage projects. Once completed, these assets are expected to transition into long-term financing structures, including tax equity funding or refinancing, ensuring sustainable growth and deployment of renewable energy infrastructure nationwide.

MUFG committed $200 million as the largest lender in the facility, also serving as Mandated Lead Arranger and Administrative Agent. ING followed with a $100 million allocation and additional responsibilities as Mandated Lead Arranger, Lender, Hedge Provider, and Green Loan Structuring Agent. Siemens Financial Services contributed $30 million as Joint Lead Arranger. U.S. Bank National Association acted as Collateral Agent.

Zaid Ashai, CEO of Nexamp, said the transaction marks a pivotal moment in the company’s expansion.

“By securing flexible construction capital, we are better positioned to deliver the clean energy projects that communities across the country urgently need as demand rises. Solar continues to be the most cost-effective and easy-to-deploy source of new electricity, outpacing all other sources by a wide margin already this year,” Ashai explained.

Nightpeak Fires up 150 MW Texas Battery

Do-it-all developer and operator Nightpeak Energy announced last Friday that Bocanova Power, a 150 MW, 2-hour duration battery storage project located in Brazoria County, Texas, is now operating. Located 24 miles south of downtown Houston, Bocanova Power reached commercial operation in August 2025 and is now providing quick responding, flexible power to support the Houston region’s peak capacity needs.

Bocanova Power utilizes Tesla’s Megapack 2 XL battery storage systems manufactured in Lathrop, California. The facility operates under a long-term power purchase agreement with an investment-grade power purchaser, unnamed by the company. Nord/LB and MUFG Bank served as co-lead arrangers on the debt financing, which included a tax equity bridge loan, construction to term loan, and letters of credit. Traditional tax equity partnership financing was also utilized for this transaction.

“We submitted an interconnection request for Bocanova Power in mid-2023 and just two years later, this 150 MW project is providing flexible, dispatchable capacity to the Texas grid. Bocanova Power demonstrates the speed at which Nightpeak Energy is overcoming complex challenges to energize projects that support America’s growing need for affordable, reliable, and secure energy,” noted Paris Hays, co-founder and CEO/CDO of Nightpeak Energy.

Nightpeak says its focus is on developing projects in the Western United States and Texas specifically, where the rapid growth of intermittent renewable energy resources has created a significant need for flexible, dispatchable generation assets.

NineDot Lands $175 Million Debt Facility

Northeast community-scale battery energy storage systems developer Ninedot has completed a $175 million revolving debt financing from Deutsche Bank.

The company will use the financing to support activities across its development timeline, from grid interconnection deposits to equipment procurement and project construction. NineDot supports a vision for broad, distributed energy storage throughout New York City, in alignment with New York State’s goal of having 6000 megawatts of battery storage in operation by 2030. The facility also enabled NineDot to pay back its existing revolver for funding grid interconnection deposits with NY Green Bank.

“NineDot’s mission is to create innovative urban energy solutions for a cleaner and more sustainable future, and battery storage is a key part of that for New York City,” said David Arfin, NineDot Energy CEO and co-founder. “With seven projects operating during this past hot summer, we’ve proven that we can deliver safe and reliable energy solutions in a dense urban area. Our next step is to accelerate our growth and scale our business, and Deutsche Bank recognized the importance of and opportunity in our approach.”

NineDot Energy currently has seven operating projects across four locations in The Bronx and Staten Island. These projects recently supported approximately 26,000 New York City households on hot summer days. With more than 60 additional projects in some phase of development or construction, NineDot remains on target to achieve its goal of having 400 MW in development, construction, or operation by the end of 2026.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FT-Template-31-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:09:50.300862

Maybe that’s the lesson Wyatt left us with: Who cares if you get shot down three times?","I’m sure there are a lot of folks who will only attend Oscar Wyatt’s funeral to make sure he’s dead. The Houston oilman, who died Wednesday at age 101, made plenty of enemies.

In the seventies, the questionable business practices of his company, Coastal States Gas, stuck the people of San Antonio with sky-high bills. In the eighties, he convinced one of his stepsons to sue his uncle, a.k.a. Wyatt’s brother-in-law, Robert Sakowitz, when he thought the latter was mismanaging the family department store chain. In the nineties, he paid kickbacks to Saddam Hussein’s government, in violation of United Nations sanctions. (For that he was convicted, at age 83, and spent nine months in federal prison.)

Married four times, Wyatt was considered—to put it politely—a swordsman. “Oscar is the only man I know that has a mattress strapped to his back for convenience,” his first wife told Texas Monthly’s Jan Jarboe Russell.

But he was also shrewd, charming, hilarious, and fearless. He worked with his BFF, former Texas Governor John Connally, to convince Saddam Hussein to release American hostages—after Wyatt had warned George H. W. Bush, whom he did not particularly like, not to go to war with Iraq over Kuwait in the first place.

I’m sure there were many other good deeds that would make Wyatt’s bad deeds pale in comparison—he was very sentimental—but there’s really no point in trying to be binary about him. Wyatt was sui generis. Love him or hate him, we may never see the likes of him again—he was an exemplar of the brash, wily, hell-for-leather Texan. J. R. Ewing was a cheap imitation.

Born in Beaumont, he was shaped by a fatherless, poverty-ridden childhood in Navasota. After serving as a bomber pilot during World War II and graduating from Texas A&M with a mechanical engineering degree, he sold drill bits in the oil fields. He founded his first oil company with an $800 loan and by 1955 had started Coastal. Over the subsequent decades, he did whatever he had to do to acquire millions upon millions, and eventually billions.

His fourth marriage was to Lynn Wyatt (neé Sakowitz), whose name was rarely free of the modifier “international socialite.” So, along with all the Middle Eastern strongmen and U.S. politicians that Wyatt could reach with one phone call, Oscar found himself in the company of Princess Grace, Mick Jagger, Elton John, Karl Lagerfeld, Andy Warhol, Liza Minelli, Rudolph Nureyev, Truman Capote, Prince Charles, Princess Diana, and the Reagans (whom he wasn’t particularly fond of either).

Reading about Wyatt’s constant socializing and deal cutting, I sometimes wondered whether he ever wished he could just stay at home and watch a football game while popping a cold one and snacking on pretzel sticks. But that wasn’t his thing. He nurtured, pruned, and shaped his spectacular life in a way most people couldn’t even begin to imagine. Who puts his own plane into a dive while proposing marriage to scare his lover into saying yes? Who shoots feral hogs from a helicopter at his South Texas ranch to entertain (or shock) his wife’s hoity-toity guests?

Later, after serving his prison time, suffering a stroke, and hitting his nineties, Wyatt was much diminished. Wheelchair-bound, he was unable to speak anywhere close to as fast as he could think. His once bright eyes grew vacant.

Yet he seemed to enjoy his ninety-seventh birthday celebration, in 2021, when he was inducted into the Texas Aviation Hall of Fame at a fancy-pants party at the Lone Star Flight Museum. Old friends, many white-haired and memorable from the heady oil-boom days of the seventies, patted his shoulder and gave him hugs. A B-25, the type of plane he had flown, was prominently displayed. Wyatt wept when his sons paid him tribute, and he squeezed a friend’s hand three times to indicate how many times he had been shot down.

If Oscar Wyatt wasn’t exactly a hero, maybe he was something more important. He was the last real deal, the cunning rogue who provided living proof that our state’s mythology wasn’t just a lot of hot air.

His life was complex and not always pretty—but it was never small. Maybe that’s the lesson Wyatt left us with: Who cares if you get shot down three times? For God’s sake, get back up.

Des Moines – The Iowa Environmental Council (IEC), Environmental Law & Policy Center (ELPC), and Food & Water Watch have sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) challenging the agency’s action to rescind its partial disapproval of Iowa’s 2024 Impaired Waters list under Clean Water Act section 303(d).

EPA issued that partial disapproval on December 30, 2024, listing seven water segments in the state as impaired due to nitrate levels. IEC and ELPC commented in support of the proposed additions to the 2024 impaired waters list in order to limit nitrate contamination in drinking water sources. Drinking nitrate-contaminated water is linked to a host of negative health outcomes including birth defects and cancers.

On July 11, 2025, EPA took the highly unusual step of rescinding its partial disapproval, claiming that it was removing the newly listed impaired segments because it was “appropriate to allow EPA to evaluate additional information.” This unprecedented action means that major rivers in Iowa are not treated as exceeding the nitrate standard for purposes of the Clean Water Act. (Read more about the timeline, the Impaired Waters List, and nitrate impairments here.)

The public only discovered EPA’s action weeks after its decision. EPA and DNR did not provide notice to the public or opportunity for input.

“EPA’s action undermines the public process defined in federal regulations and limits public transparency,” said Michael Schmidt, General Counsel for IEC. “No law says that EPA can change its mind after it made a final decision the way it did in this case, especially when it is weakening protections for the public. The path to this decision lacks transparency and is based on outdated and incomplete information.”

EPA rescinded its December listing of the waters after DNR explained its position in a phone call and provided additional information. IEC submitted a records request that showed the only written communication was an email sending decades-old documents that had already been submitted to EPA, along with EPA’s own decades-old approval letter. The DNR email did not include the DNR position cited in EPA’s letter.

“EPA rolling back water quality protections based on ‘back room’ conversations is not how agencies should operate,” said Josh Mandelbaum, Senior Attorney at ELPC. “While Iowa is in the midst of ongoing and serious water quality problems, there is no justification for EPA to flip-flop because of old documents it already had, especially its own letter from 2002.”

Food & Water Watch Staff Attorney Dani Replogle said:

“The data is clearer than ever that Iowa waterways are overwhelmed with persistent, toxic nitrate contamination. Iowans need more clean water protections — not less. EPA’s baseless decision to turn its back on central Iowa’s water crisis without even providing an opportunity for public input does not inspire confidence in the federal agency meant to safeguard clean water and protect our health. Iowans demand and deserve better.”

The environmental groups’ letter highlights that the new direction will increase regulatory costs for downstream water users, including Iowa’s most populous metropolitan areas. DNR and EPA seek to treat the drinking water standard for nitrate as a long-term, chronic standard – despite the short-term effects such as blue baby syndrome.

“While this path may seem complex, the issue is simple: EPA is not doing the important work of protecting public health. Claiming that our waterways meet drinking water standards when EPA has found those same nitrate levels could cause blue baby syndrome is unjustified and dangerous,” said Colleen Fowle, Water Program Director for IEC. “Removing the impairment at the same time Central Iowa had to implement unprecedented water use restrictions made no sense. EPA’s action fails to put the onus on the polluters to adopt practices that will actually fix the problem.”

The letter sent by the environmental groups states that because EPA has reopened the process to consider additional information, it should consider public input. The letter includes additional information about the application of the drinking water standard on a short-term basis. The groups explain that the documents adopting the water quality standard for drinking water do not justify treating nitrate as a chronic pollutant.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/press_header_cleanwater_8.png,N,,2025-10-10 12:08:24.630182

Treasurer and Minister for Energy David Janetzki said the Energy Roadmap was based on economics and engineering, not ideology.","The Crisafulli Government's Energy Roadmap delivered to improve Queensland’s energy assets while building what is needed for the future.

$26 billion in reduced energy system costs to 2035 compared to the previous Labor Government’s early closure plan.

The Energy Roadmap provides clarity for the future of coal and gas, and support for private sector investment in renewables and firming projects.

The Crisafulli Government has unveiled its Energy Roadmap to deliver affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for Queenslanders.

By improving Queensland’s existing energy assets while building what is needed for the future, the Crisafulli Government is putting downward pressure on energy prices, optimising investment to respect taxpayer money and boosting private sector investment in new generation.

The Roadmap presents a sensible and pragmatic plan to meet Queensland’s energy needs, contrasting with the undeliverable timeframes, poorly scoped projects and tens of billions of dollars in cost blowouts under Labor’s implausible Energy and Jobs Plan.

It also reduces energy system costs for taxpayers by $26 billion to 2035, preventing the average Queensland household paying an extra $1035 a year that they would have paid under Labor.

The Roadmap includes:

$400 million Queensland Energy Investment Fund and Queensland Investment Corporation’s new Investor Gateway to drive private sector investment in new energy generation and firming projects.

$1.6 billion Electricity Maintenance Guarantee to improve our current energy assets.

Clear decision-making framework for the operation of state-owned coal assets, balancing system needs, asset integrity, and economic viability.

A tender for 400MW of new gas-fired generation in Central Queensland.

Consolidated management of future pumped hydro proposals by QIC to provide a consistent approach to assessment and investment.

New $10 million investment into community level batteries for greater solar storage and to help manage minimum system load.

Construction of the Eastern Link of the CopperString transmission line in North Queensland and beginning of work on the Western Link.

Establishment of Regional Energy Hubs to put downward pressure on development costs.

Development of a new code of conduct for renewable energy developers to guide responsible behaviour and set community expectations.

Treasurer and Minister for Energy David Janetzki said the Energy Roadmap was based on economics and engineering, not ideology.

“Our Energy Roadmap delivers what Queenslanders need, which is affordable and reliable energy that enhances their quality of life, fuels economic growth, and ensures long-term sustainability, all while ensuring our state is an attractive destination for private sector capital and creating jobs,” Mr Janetzki said.

“Labor’s energy plan lacked credibility, was undeliverable and would have resulted in Queensland households paying thousands more on top of their energy bills.”

Underpinned by robust electricity system modelling and extensive consultation with investors, industry, and stakeholders, the Energy Roadmap highlights the importance of leveraging existing assets to keep energy prices low while planning for the future.

“The former Labor Government’s ideological decision to close coal units by 2035, regardless of their condition, is officially abolished,” Mr Janetzki said.

“Queensland’s coal-fired fleet is the youngest in the country and state-owned coal generators will continue to operate for as long as they are needed in the system and supported by the market.

“This is an economic solution that places downward pressure on prices for households, businesses, and industry, while ensuring developers have the confidence to plan for the future.

""We’re laying the groundwork for private capital to flow into new energy infrastructure, unlocking economic growth and ensuring Queensland remains competitive in an evolving energy market.”

Chair, Senate Environmental Quality Committee

1021 O Street, Room 3230

Sacramento, CA 95814

RE: Support for AB 30 (Alvarez) State Air Resources Board: gasoline specifications: ethanol blends

Dear Chair Blakespear,

On behalf of Growth Energy, I write in support of AB 30 (Alvarez) which would make transportation fuel blends of up to 15% ethanol (E15) legal for sale and use in California. Growth Energy is the world’s largest trade association representing 97 U.S. biorefineries that

produce more than nine billion gallons of cleaner-burning, renewable fuel annually. Our members account for more than half of the bioethanol produced in the United States each year. Together, we are working to bring consumers better and more affordable choices at the fuel pump, improve air quality, and protect the environment for future generations. We remain committed to helping diversify our country’s energy portfolio, grow more energy jobs, decarbonize our nation’s energy mix, sustain family farms, and drive down the costs of transportation fuels for consumers.

AB 30 will significantly reduce light-duty fuel costs for California’s consumers. A recent study by the University of California, Berkeley and the United States Naval Academy indicates that California drivers could save as much as 20 cents per gallon with the inclusion of E15 in the fuel supply. The same study indicates California drivers could save as much as $2.7 billion annually at the pump if E15 replaced E10.

Furthermore, E15 reduces fuel emissions and has notable environmental benefits. Testing by the University of California, Riverside shows E15 significantly reduces tailpipe emissions compared to E10. This includes the reduction of greenhouse gases and harmful

particulates that contribute to air pollution.

E15 is well tested and has already been used across the country. After extensively testing the fuel in 86 vehicles for a total of six million miles, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approved E15 in 2011 for all passenger vehicles model year 2001 and newer. Since

its approval, E15 has efficiently fueled 150 billion miles driven in the United States. E15 is available for sale in 34 states at more than 4,200 fuel retail locations. It is time for California to approve the sale and use of E15, just as every other state in the nation has done.

For the reasons outlined above, Growth Energy is pleased to support AB 30 and urge an AYE vote on this critical measure. We look forward to continued collaboration with your office and other policymakers to implement E15, reduce air emissions, and make fuel more affordable for Californians.

Sincerely,

A month before that, the manufacturer and energy department agreed to cancel a separate $164 million federal grant related to the project.
During his weekly Team Kentucky update, he said his office hadn’t gotten official word regarding the possibility of funding cuts.
“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy.” Most of the cuts this month yanked funding from Democratic states.
The new, longer list includes grant projects in Republican states, too.","Kentucky’s energy projects could lose about $460 million in federal grants as the Trump administration considers more funding cuts.

An electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility and several energy-related research projects are on the funding chopping block, according to a list of potential cuts first reported by Semafor and now circulating around Capitol Hill.

The list is about a dozen pages long and includes hundreds of project grants totaling about $24 billion.

A $316 million grant for a Hopkinsville electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility being built by Ascend Elements is targeted on the list, and the company said it was notified Oct. 7 it had been terminated. The Massachusetts-based manufacturer announced in October 2022 plans to invest close to $1 billion to build its largest EV battery recycling and manufacturing facility in Christian County, creating 400 full-time jobs.

Ascend Elements CEO Linh Austin said in an email to the Herald-Leader any DOE decision regarding grants doesn’t change the company’s trajectory.

“We will replace the terminated grant with a balanced mix of private growth, equity, project finance, strategic offtake pre-payments, and non-U.S. incentives, including support we’ve been awarded in the EU,” Austin said. “Our business economics are not predicated on grants, but by Consumer Demand, Operational Excellence and our patented Hydro-to-Cathode technology.”

In April, Kentucky Public Radio reported construction had been paused on part of the facility , though it’s set to restart next year.

Also in April, Ascend Elements was named a defendant in a lawsuit over $138 million in unpaid construction bills. A month before that, the manufacturer and energy department agreed to cancel a separate $164 million federal grant related to the project.

Also targeted on the list is a $75 million grant for Diageo, the alcoholic beverage company, which planned to add batteries to its facility in Shelbyville to reduce carbon emissions.

That grant was terminated in May, as was the $72 million one for a carbon capture project at LG&E and KU’s Cane Run Generating Station just outside Louisville. It also appears on the longer list.

The $50 million grant supporting Mitsubishi Electric Corporation as it retrofits a Maysville factory to make high-efficiency heat pumps could also have its funding cut, according to the list.

Five projects through the University of Kentucky Research Foundation are on the list and could stand to lose almost $24 million altogether.

The largest of those grants, almost $7 million, is for a Pigman College of Engineering and Institute for Decarbonization and Energy Advancement project demonstrating the effectiveness of a carbon capture device that then puts the raw material into glass production, according to grant award documents.

The UK Research Foundation and a university spokesperson were not immediately available for comment.

Kentucky has been the recipient of several recent high-dollar economic development announcements related to clean energy. It has seemingly embraced multiple parts of the EV supply chain through incentives from the legislature and tax credits for consumers passed under Former President Joe Biden.

Gov. Andy Beshear is no stranger to securing frozen or canceled federal funds. Just this year, he’s joined multistate lawsuits to restore funding for AmeriCorps, K-12 schools and public health programs.

During his weekly Team Kentucky update, he said his office hadn’t gotten official word regarding the possibility of funding cuts.

“I’d be very disappointed if this is gonna move forward,” he said.

In a statement, Department of Energy Deputy Press Secretary Emery Washington said the department’s staff “have been unable to verify the lists we’ve seen so far.”

In an emailed statement to the Herald-Leader, the department’s chief spokesperson, Ben Dietderich, said no additional determinations have been made about funding aside from cuts already announced this year.

At the start of October, the Department of Energy terminated 321 financial packages totaling $7.56 billion for 223 projects, several of which are on the long list, according to E&E News. About two dozen other grants canceled earlier in the year also appear on the list.

“As Secretary (Chris) Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” Dietderich said.

The cuts so far this year, and the new list indicating more might be coming, match President Donald Trump’s agenda to cancel clean energy programs. Trump has often criticized renewable energy, especially the effort to reduce carbon emissions, as part of a “green energy scam.”

“On day one, the Energy Department began the critical task of reviewing billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard,” Wright said in a statement when the department made its Oct. 2 cuts. “President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy.”

Most of the cuts this month yanked funding from Democratic states. Members of Congress in those states said in a letter to the department secretary that the decision was blatantly partisan and would harm jobs, weaken the grid and give foreign adversaries like China an edge.

The new, longer list includes grant projects in Republican states, too.

It also shows more billions of dollars could be cut for five hydrogen hubs authorized by Biden’s energy department and his infrastructure bill that allocated funding to the system that would have produced and transported clean energy across the country.

ARCH2, headquartered in West Virginia, is one of those hubs. It would have regional activity and support jobs in Kentucky, but it isn’t estimated to be in service until 2027 or 2028, according to the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, or ARCH2.",https://www.kentucky.com/public/latest-news/xrynpf/picture312445365/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/LEX_02_241205WindTurbine_rh.JPG,N,,2025-10-10 12:07:32.961093

Climate change is expected to be less of a priority given the current economic, security, and geopolitical environment, and this is likely to impact green technology firms that develop and manufacture the equipment and services required to produce, install, and manage effective and efficient renewable energy provision. The EU’s green industrial policy must adapt accordingly if the bloc’s policymakers wish to reach their official competitiveness, economic security, and decarbonization goals without sacrificing one for the others. This brief assesses the EU’s green industrial policy, examines the obstacles to decarbonization posed by increasing security challenges, and proposes recommendations to ensure that targeted investments and policies to promote clean technologies in Europe are fit for purpose.

The Return of Industrial Policy

The tripartite challenge of decarbonization, competitiveness, and economic security, sometimes but not always explicitly related to countering China, was central to US policymaking under the Biden administration. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 was itself in part a delayed reaction to Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” industrial strategy and the Chinese state’s enormous support for scaling the production of green tech equipment. Europe’s primary concerns about the IRA were related to its use of local content requirements and the risk that EU firms would leave the bloc’s territory en masse to benefit from the United States’ cheap fossil energy and its green tech subsidies. These worries were not entirely borne out, as the immediate empirical effects of the IRA on the EU and trade and investment flows did not match initial warnings. Still, the legacy of the EU’s response to the Biden administration’s “post-neoliberal” turn to industrial policy remains salient for Europe. The IRA provoked a sense that something more needed to be done to keep up with US (and, increasingly, Chinese) intervention to support strategic green technologies. The legacy of this reaction, coinciding with rising security concerns, presents unresolved challenges for Europe today. Can decarbonization, competitiveness, and an economy fit for new security challenges be achieved together? Are these goals interlinked? Is countering China, for example, an inherent condition for achieving decarbonization? Or does Europe face a trilemma requiring difficult trade-offs?

The Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA), followed by the recent Competitiveness Compass and Clean Industrial Deal, represent the EU’s ongoing attempts to balance competitiveness, security, and decarbonization. But key points remain unclear. The NZIA aims to have 40% of clean tech manufactured in the EU by 2030. But it falls short in addressing how to achieve that goal and specifying the needed funding options in relevant sectors. In addition, intra-European disagreements over the EU’s response to the IRA linger. They include how and whether to maintain World Trade Organization compliance, Europe’s relative ability to match US or Chinese subsidies, and the limits beyond which loosening state aid rules to promote green tech manufacturing would damage the single market. Member states with larger fiscal capacity, such as France and Germany, argue for more subsidies to promote domestic manufacturing of green tech equipment through mechanisms including the 2023 Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework and measures approved under its mandate (e.g., a €10.82 billion French offshore wind scheme). But there are now signs that smaller states such as the Nordics, Belgium, and the Netherlands, usually reticent about carve-outs to the official EU prohibition on state aid, are shifting their traditional positions. Differences of opinion also persist among members states over the need to decarbonize by just importing the cheapest green technology as rapidly as possible, even if it negatively impacts the EU’s own clean tech capabilities or security.

Implementation of these European green industrial policies now faces additional headwinds. First, the days when the IRA seemed like the biggest threat are gone. The Trump administration has terminated the act’s tax credits for wind and solar technology, cancelled clean energy project grants, rolled back Environmental Protection Agency enforcement, and targeted state-level environmental policymaking through a wide-reaching executive order. EU firms such as Denmark’s Ørsted are reeling from a stop-work order on its $6.2 billion Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, showing the knock-on effects of Washington’s actions on European economies. Unlike the United States, Europe is dependent on external energy suppliers, leading to higher structural energy costs and a less competitive manufacturing sector. EU wholesale gas prices in 2024 were five times higher than those in the United States, and wholesale electricity prices also remain higher despite regional disparities. Second, losing market share or increasing dependencies in key clean technologies is its own type of security threat, with EU industry already impacted by Beijing’s dominance of green tech and electric vehicles amid worries about a new China shock. With the Trump administration having withdrawn from international agreements such as the Paris Accords, prohibiting scientists employed by the federal government from attending Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change meetings, and clashing with EU officials over the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) climate agenda, Europe is adapting its role in international climate diplomacy to fill the vacuum left by the United States, including in international development banks. Third, defense spending has become the priority in the halls of Brussels and European capitals as the United States scales back global involvement and Russia continues its aggressive stance. A green industrial strategy that allows the EU to meet its stated economic, security, and climate targets must adapt to this broader global context.

Obstacles to European Decarbonization

Beyond the aforementioned systemic factors, achieving climate targets through green industrial policy faces several other important and overlapping hurdles.

Clean tech is a communications and marketing challenge. The EU needs a compelling narrative around green industrial policy to ensure buy-in and support by providing concrete examples of the benefits of a greener economy for EU citizens. As the Draghi report on EU competitiveness noted, targeted investments that further the most important comparative advantages and strategic interests will have the greatest chance of success. But citizens must be told why difficult decisions are needed using a positive narrative that reflects the trade-offs and synergies between rising defense spending and sustained investment in green technologies. As studies by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund show, green investments are positively correlated with national security, energy independence, and long-term economic resilience.

Lack of demand is a barrier to clean tech uptake and deployment. Even if Europe were able to produce all the wind turbines, solar panels, and other green tech equipment it needs, barriers to the use of that equipment weaken demand for it. The barriers include delayed permitting processes, lack of market integration, and limited purchasing power, including lack of demand for green energy and infrastructure. The NZIA addresses the need to harmonize permitting processes across member state legal structures, but significant amounts of planned capacity remain frozen. In the case of wind energy, for example, an average of 81% of planned EU investment in new wind capacity is stuck in permitting stages. In Portugal, it is 45%, but it is 100% in several other member states. Demand-side support through policies such as guarantees, sustainability standards, or public procurement mandates can strengthen demand for clean technologies over the longer term. The OECD has compiled examples of obstacles, tools, and methodologies for green public procurement across EU member states, and granular data can facilitate targeting policies to sectoral and regional needs.

The EU’s infrastructure is still insufficient to meet the needs of the green transition. The transition requires resilient energy systems. Power grid preparedness and interconnection are foundational aspects of improving the EU’s energy independence and ensuring that new installations can be brought online. 5G and deployment of energy-efficient smart systems can optimize energy use. The April 2025 blackout on the Iberian Peninsula illustrates the importance of modernizing grid infrastructure for new demand and integrating renewable energy sources. Improving vehicle-charging infrastructure is another key aspect of a successful green transition.

The financing environment for green tech investment is inadequate for achieving scale. Research and development, innovation, and commercialization of green technologies depend on a dynamic investment environment and more unified capital markets. But the EU is hampered by saving and investment habits that lead to a largely bank-centered system, persistent division along national lines, and small and fractured capital markets and venture ecosystems. This poses challenges for scaling Europe’s green tech industry, its longevity, and targeting production assistance. According to the European Investment Bank, annual venture capital investments are approximately six times higher in the United States than in the EU. The key challenge to competing with Chinese state support lies in achieving scale across supply chains. The recent bankruptcy of battery startup Northvolt illustrates the challenges of achieving scale despite significant investment. The firm struggled with supply chain administration; prolonged dependency on Chinese and Korean equipment makers, which led to workplace tensions; and had difficulty attracting skilled workers in remote northern Sweden, which meant that the company’s primary plant was producing below 1% of its theoretical capacity.

Clean tech requires new skills, and labor markets must adapt. A robust clean-tech manufacturing ecosystem could be a boon for European economies, but it requires skills training and constant reevaluation as technologies quickly develop. The installation sector in particular is critical for green tech employment and skills development in many geographic regions and throughout the industry. Addressing these issues is mainly a member-state responsibility, which means results have so far varied. A comprehensive mapping of 26 national skills strategies by the OECD, including for the green transition, produced nine key lessons for success, among them the importance of aligning skills policies with other government strategies and ensuring constant feedback among government, industry, and social partners.

Recommendations

As the EU prepares to update its economic security strategy, moving from risk identification to risk mitigation in a world of geopolitical and trade tensions, green industrial policy must adapt. The Commission and member states can readjust their policy approach to align competitiveness, innovation, decarbonization, and economic security goals by prioritizing the following:

1. Good data for good policy

a. Clean tech and security mapping can identify strategic areas at a granular level. Following the Draghi report’s push for strategic focus on certain key areas, the EU’s Directorate-General for Climate Action (DG GLIMA) and Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) should use their shared ownership of the Clean Industrial Deal to identify key choke points and strategic assets across clean tech value chains. This can build on broader frameworks, such as those developed by the IEA, but tailored for the EU and specific security challenges. For example, solar panel production is dominated by China, but European industry is and can remain the lead supplier of many electrical and electronic components integral to solar energy production systems. Such a mapping exercise will be crucial to inform targeted policy interventions at the EU and member-state levels.

b. Green industrial policy requires a range of expertise and insights. Ad hoc knowledge exchange among experts and European Commission and European Parliament policymakers should shift to regular exchanges and briefings, with an emphasis on gathering insights from as wide a range of experts as possible, including industry and national-level experts and regulators close to the issue. For the past decade, a growing body of academic work has identified conditions for success in green industrial policy. Economist Dani Rodrik wrote in 2014 about the key principles of embeddedness (cooperation and iteration between public and private without capturing the process), discipline (carrots and sticks), and accountability. Other recent work has emphasized the firm-specific nature of industrial policy, showing the importance of targeting policy approaches to loans, grants, guarantees, tariffs, and other tools. Checking ongoing initiatives such as new subsidy regimes against the benchmarks laid out in this type of research will ensure that policy is dynamic and responsive to changing circumstances. The European Parliament Research Service’s “What Think Tanks are thinking” reports could be adopted as a model for broader, more frequent updates for policymakers.

2. Targeted international engagement for domestic success

a. Engage with non-EU economies to prioritize scale. An EU green industrial policy should aim at competing for market share within the bloc and in external markets, and at increasing scale to bring down marginal costs. The EU launched negotiations for the first of its new Clean Trade and Investment Partnerships (CTIP) with South Africa in March 2025. These “mini trade deals” could help identify interests within particular markets or governments and adapt instruments to support industries or goals. But for CTIPs to succeed, partner countries will need more concrete guidance about benefits and how this initiative promises to complement existing programs such as Global Gateway. Lessons should also be drawn from Ukraine on grid resilience, the need to build back cleaner energy infrastructure, Russian obstruction, and US ownership or trusteeship of pivotal infrastructure including gas storage. Recognition of Ukraine as a source of critical minerals for the country’s and the EU’s clean tech industries is also needed.

b. Do not give up on targeted transatlantic industrial policy coordination. EU and US companies are strong leaders in green tech development and have deep investments in production on both sides of the Atlantic. Reflecting this, the Trade and Technology Council produced initiatives and policy recommendations to promote transatlantic green industry development, including through its Working Group Two on Climate and Clean Tech and its Transatlantic Initiative on Sustainable Trade. Such close coordination on climate-focused industrial policy is unlikely with the Trump administration, but the EU can and should build on existing industry ties. Even on the government level, deals can be made by focusing on mutual interests and geopolitical considerations. The EU and the United States, for example, still share a common interest in diversifying supply chains for critical minerals and rare earths. Battery supply chains could be an area in which necessity forces cooperation. Work on mapping and accounting for Chinese subsidies across clean tech production could be of mutual interest. Jointly funded research initiatives to identify and close gaps could be easily achieved when broader political agreements remain out of reach.

3. Everything is PR: Improve the politics of industrial policy. To ensure popular buy-in and support, green industrial policy needs to show that it can deliver. The narrative and public perception of investing in clean tech is just as important as the nitty-gritty of policy details. Eurobarometer surveys show security and defense is the top medium-term priority for EU citizens, with migration, economic competitiveness, and climate close behind. A winning political narrative will not frame these as inherent trade-offs but emphasize the mutually reinforcing benefits of green industrial policy, such as stronger local communities and job opportunities, knowledge spillover and upskilling, the benefits of scale for cost effectiveness, and the dangers of dependency in a world of rising tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Focus groups and surveys developing political messaging should explicitly test this framing. Participants could be asked, for example, if the Iberian blackout makes grid capacity a higher priority issue and how citizens link this challenge to integrating renewables into energy networks.

A tripartite ambition of strengthening competitiveness, bolstering strategic readiness, and pursuing decarbonization does not need to be a zero-sum endeavor. A green industrial strategy that is fit for purpose can help Europe achieve these interdependent strategic goals.",https://www.gmfus.org/sites/default/files/styles/watermark/public/2025-10/shutterstock_2402908895_0.jpg?itok=qmnuzR7n,N,,2025-10-10 12:09:00.969954

Above-ground geography and below-ground geology both matter, but for different reasons. CO2 infrastructure experts and technology providers are important, so too are carbon-focused end-users. Internal team buy-in is crucial, almost as much as the support of external stakeholders.

The road to fully integrated CCS or carbon neutrality is—and has been—different from plant to plant for producers not linked to a multi-state pipeline solution. Those that have made progress to date have taken a multifaceted approach. Some are further along than others, sometimes based on their location.

Conestoga’s Net-Zero Goal

Conestoga Energy CEO Tom Willis says his team in Kansas was all about carbon before carbon was ever cool. According to Willis, Conestoga was the first to take low-carbon fuel to California under the LCFS back in 2010. Through two Kansas plants, Conestoga produces roughly 200 million gallons of ethanol per year: 115 MMgy at the Arkalon facility near Liberal and 62 MMgy at the Bonanza plant in Garden City.

The Arkalon facility has been capturing CO2 for roughly 15 years as part of an enhanced oil recovery CO2 injection program operated by CapturePoint LLC throughout parts of Kansas and Oklahoma.

“We looked at carbon and said we could expand and grow,” Willis says of his team’s early adoption of a carbon-focused strategy. Today, Conestoga refers to itself as a low-carbon solutions provider, not just an ethanol producer.

“We are trying to become net zero,” Willis says.

To do that, Conestoga has expanded its CCS efforts to both plants. In May, the company announced drilling was complete on its first Class VI CCS well near its Garden City plant. Willis called the well the “cornerstone of Conestoga’s initiative to permanently store carbon dioxide emissions generated during the ethanol production process.”

The CCS project will be a long-term staple of Conestoga’s net-zero vision, Willis says, but the company will continue to explore ways to lower its CI score and maintain a strong connection to markets in need of carbon solutions, both domestic and foreign.

After completing work on the Class VI well, several interested parties from fertilizer manufacturers to warehouse owners have reached out to Conestoga regarding carbon-sequestration possibilities. “They are coming to us,” Willis says. “We don’t have to go to them.”

The carbon-centric model is one others can follow, Willis says, regardless of a plant’s geographic or geologic footprint. While he notes some plants aren’t able to sequester, he also says every plant can benefit from carbon-related planning or investments, some but not all of which are related to the continuance of the 45Z tax credit.

In addition to the 2024 purchase of a Class VI well which included the leases and easements, Conestoga has also purchased CCS equipment and a CO2 flood field that can use fermentation CO2 for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery efforts in Kansas. The Class VI well work has now moved onto the permitting stage for the U.S. EPA to review.

In August, Conestoga also acquired SAFFiRE Renewables LLC from Southwest Airlines Renewable Ventures LLC. As envisioned, SAFFiRE’s process technology will enable the production of ultra low-carbon intensity ethanol and intermediates.

Willis says his team is working on the buildout of a pilot plant at the Arkalon facility that could be ready by Q4 2026.

The SAFFiRE technology will aid Conestoga’s efforts to produce sustainable aviation fuel feedstock. “The IP acquired in this transaction will provide us with tremendous optionality, not only as it relates to SAF feedstock production, but across our operations,” Willis said in August. “The momentum behind low-CI fuels is undeniable, driven by regulatory requirements, corporate commitments and environmental necessity.”

On top of the Class VI well work, investment in SAFFiRE and the overarching company approach to become a multifaceted low-carbon solutions provider that just happens to make ethanol, Conestoga is planning to invest in paying and training farmers for grain traceability. Such an effort will further reduce the plant’s CI score and help make Conestoga’s sustainability-infused growth plan “sustainable,” Willis says.

One Earth Sequestration

Since first partnering with the Illinois State Geological Survey in 2020, Illinois-based One Earth Energy continues to make progress on a CCS well and CO2 pipeline project that would capture and inject fermentation CO2. A proposed 5.62 mile underground pipeline would move fermentation CO2 from the ethanol plant to an injection well that has already been drilled.

Steve Kelly, general manager for the plant near Gibson City, says his team continues to work through the EPA to receive the Class VI permit for the well. The EPA expects a final permit decision in March 2026, according to the agency’s Class VI well permit tracker.

One Earth Energy created a website—One Earth Sequestration—to keep the public updated on the project, specifically around water quality and safety. The new website explains the state-of-the-art safety features that will be used, including automatic shut-off valves, around-the-clock in-person monitoring, reduced pipeline segments, leak detection, flow measurement devices, monitoring wells, six-foot burial and underground signage and more. Kelly and the team have also organized hazmat training hosted by the Illinois Fire Service, in addition to specific CO2 pipeline training hosted by ExxonMobil. The current work is all in addition to the pre-feasibility and geological studies One Earth Energy already completed to ensure such a project would be economically and environmentally sound, Kelly says.

The next milestones on the timeline revolve around the Class VI permit, acquiring the Certificate of Authority from the Illinois Commerce Commission to construct a CO2 pipeline and securing a Special Use Permit in McLean County, Illinois, at the sequestration well site.

Kelly says the company has worked with governing bodies ranging from local municipalities up to state and federal agencies. It has also worked with landowners to voluntarily secure pore space and pipeline lease agreements. One Earth has held more than 70 public meetings or sessions with farmers.

The CCS work and investment will impact the plant and community in multiple ways, Kelly says. “Once completed, our CCS will capture and compress 521,000 metric tons of CO2 annually. That’s like taking nearly 124,000 gasoline-powered cars off the road for one year.”

According to One Earth Sequestration, the project will generate $231 million in economic activity for Ford County, Illinois, including more than 300 new jobs and nearly $19 million in county and state tax revenue.

“For One Earth Energy, it means we’ll have the opportunity to expand our business into sustainable aviation fuel, which is the next step in renewable fuels,” Kelly says. “It also brings additional stability and longevity to our business and community.”

Chief Ethanol Set for November

Nebraska-based Chief Ethanol General Manager Wayne Garrett joined Brooke Rollins, USDA Secretary, in Nebraska in August to talk biofuels, agriculture and America’s renewable energy future. In November, Garrett expects to be capturing CO2 from fermentation ethanol.

Starting in 2021, Chief Ethanol partnered with Catahoula Resources and the Energy Minerals Group along with Battelle to develop CCS solutions for Chief’s two ethanol plants in Nebraska.

The new CCS infrastructure will capture and store 350,000 metric tons of CO2 through compression stations that will ultimately link to a Catahoula operated pipeline solution.

Gevo Selling Carbon Credits

Gevo Inc. has already earned dividends from its $210 million acquisition of a North Dakota Ethanol plant fully equiped with operating CCS assets. After purchasing Red Trail Energy in early 2025, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber renamed the assets Net-Zero North.

In July, Gevo announced it was officially selling carbon abatement credits into the market. The CCS process creates a carbon removal credit or CO2 removal certificate (CORC). In Gevo’s case, a global financial and technology company purchases CORCs and then retires them to meet its own CO2 abatement requirements.

Puro.earth, a Nasdaq-funded firm that certifies CORCs across the globe and provides a marketplace for suppliers and buyers, provided certification of the Gevo produced CORCs.

“Gevo is demonstrating that durable carbon removal isn’t some distant solution,” says Trenton Spindler, chief growth officer of Puro.earth, “It’s available now. With Puro.earth. certified CORCs, buyers worldwide can act decisively to tackle their toughest emissions with confidence in real, permanent results.”

Puro.earth has strict standards for CORC generation, including 1,000-plus-year permeance of storage. In July, Puro.earth’s CORC index showed CORC prices at roughly $150 each. From 2020 to November 2024, Puro.earth said the use of CORCs increased by 1,200%, rising from 12,000 units produced and sold per year to nearly 160,000. Starting in 2022, many CORC buyers began seeking offtake agreements of three- to five-year periods, but by 2024, many larger CORC buyers were looking for even longer-term CORC supply agreements.

Blue Flint’s CCS Tax Equity Benefits

CCS work at Harvestone Low Carbon Partners’ Blue Flint Ethanol plant in North Dakota continues to pay off. After commencing operation of a 125,000-metric-ton CO2 capture infrastructure and pipeline project in 2023, HLCP announced nearly a year later that it had closed on a first-of-its-kind tax equity financing round with Bank of America worth $205 million.

HLCP was able to structure a tax equity financing package that would allow Bank of America to participate in the 45Q federal tax credit benefits and purchase 45Z clean fuel tax credits generated by Blue Flint’s CCS biorefinery operations.

Karen Fang, global head of sustainable finance at Bank of America, says her team has a strong track record of innovative financing transactions for decarbonization technologies including CCS. Essentially, Bank of America receives that tax credit benefit in exchange for financing. HLCP has not said how it will utilize any Bank of America proceeds, but it does operate additional ethanol facilities that are actively developing or studying CCS infrastructure in North Dakota and Indiana.

Permitting in Process

The Andersons Inc. has acquired full ownership of the four ethanol plants it previously co-owned with a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp., a move the publicly traded grain and biofuels company says will allow for greater efficiency and streamlining of its operations. In its Q2 earnings call, the company stated that the regulatory environment for biofuels, “may support new opportunities,” including at the company’s Clymers, Indiana, facility where a Class VI well permit has been filed with the EPA for CCS.

Front Range Energy in Colorado continues developing its CCS operation, with a completed test well on its property, and is awaiting the Class VI permit. Through a subsidiary called Carbon Capture Solutions, Front Range Energy is playing a part in shaping the future regulatory and compliance framework for CCS in Colorado. In December 2024, representatives from Carbon Capture Solutions participated in discussions with the Colorado Energy & Carbon Management Commission (ECMC) regarding state-level authority over geologic carbon storage. ECMC has now created a state-based policy on CCS with the goal of obtaining primacy over the EPA, similar to other states, including North Dakota, Wyoming and Louisiana.

In California, Aemetis awaits approval of its Class VI well permit for CCS operation that will inject roughly 1.4 million tons of CO2 into a saline formation. Baker Hughes, an oil and gas drilling company, is leading the underground engineering and drilling work, including consultation and project design. ATSI, an engineering, procurement, construction and project management firm, is helping on the project as well.

Expertise and Experience

Vault 44.01 is contracted or partnered with seven different ethanol producers. The CCS experts help each create on-site or near on-site CCS capabilities. Scott Rennie, president and CEO of Vault 44.01, says despite a range of challenges each plant may face, Vault 44.01 has a unique combination of technical expertise and CCS experience.

Hugh Caperton, senior vice president of development for Vault, says the company has grown a presence across the ethanol sector because it has expertise in all facets required to make a CCS project successful, including landowner agreements, commercial development structuring, technical expertise and permitting.

Cardinal Ethanol was the first to join with Vault 44.01. Today, other Vault 44.01 partners include plants owned by Valero, POET and Alto Ingredients. Cardinal Ethanol could earn its Class VI well permit in January 2026, according to projections by the EPA tracker database.

Rennie is quick to point out that the state where a CCS project is located greatly impacts the timeline for completion. North Dakota has seen multiple projects completed because the state has primacy over CCS regulations and permitting. States without primacy must rely on federal regulations, drawing out the timeline. The current administration has made a big difference in the speed at which the Vault team can move on permitting progress, Rennie says.

“We’ve made more progress on our permits recently than we have in the previous two years under the past administration,” Rennie says.

Like Rennie, Caperton is optimistic about the pace of project timelines in 2025 and beyond. He points out that CCS has always had bipartisan support in Congress. Every project will have challenges in design, community engagement and permitting.

“For us, it comes down to having the right skillset and energy level to bring these things to completion,” Rennie says. “Our team had a track record even before we started helping ethanol producers.”

Both Rennie and Caperton believe the ethanol sector’s CCS abilities will act as a seed from which producers and future industries can grow.

“CCS is a gateway,” Caperton says.

For its current producer partners, Vault is focusing on on-site or near on-site CCS. Initially, the team explored options to create connected CO2 sequestration hubs. Rennie says the economics and land commitment agreements were too difficult to pursue. The cost of running and operating pipeline can sometimes be in the range of $1 million or more per half mile. Some CO2 hubs connecting ethanol plants would need at least 40 miles of pipeline, Rennie explains, as most plants in a concentrated area suitable for a hub are 40 to 50 miles apart.

In most cases, Vault is capturing a single source of CO2 and has a flowline on the producer’s property connected to a sequestration or compression station.

“If you were to look at our projects from outer space, the projects are going to look very similar,” Rennie says.

In March last year, Alto Ingredients signed with Vault to further its CCS aspirations. Through the agreement, Alto will install CCS equipment at its Pekin, Illinois, dry mill, and Vault will transport and permanently store the CO2 underground within close proximity.

Bryon McGregor, president and CEO of Alto, says the agreement with Vault will serve shareholders and community stakeholders alike. In addition to operating two ethanol production facilities, Alto operates a liquid CO2 facility in Boardman, Oregon. In early 2025, Alto acquired Kodiak Carbonic LLC, a beverage-grade liquid carbon dioxide processor for $7.25 million.

“In our ongoing pursuit to optimize product value, we identified the beverage-grade liquid CO2 plant as a significant opportunity and pursued the acquisition to continue to expand our premium ingredients portfolio,” McGregor says.

The Time Is Now for On-Site CCS

Rennie says there has never been a better time for CO2 producers like Alto, Cardinal Ethanol and others to pursue CCS. “Now is the right time. The industry has learned a lot about CCS and the current administration has a proclivity for action and accountability.

“The project with Alto exemplifies our view that one of the best options for CCS is often a local solution.”

Sylvain Riba, president and CEO of the Houston-based team of underground energy storage and subsurface injection experts at Geostock Sandia, says the ethanol industry has maintained CCUS momentum since an uptick started in 2020. Riba and his team have been involved with eight ethanol-related CCS wells in the Midwest over the past five years, including the well for North Dakota’s Blue Flint Ethanol.

“We make the earth the best place to store energy,” Riba says. “We know how to drill wells and demonstrate this is the right place to store.”

Geostock Sandia expanded its drilling services for Class VI wells in the early 2000s and has since been a big participant in the CarbonSAFE program under the U.S. Department of Energy. Prior to that, Geostock Sandia helped lead the creation of salt cavern storage for hydrocarbons in the U.S.

Like the natural gas industry, Riba says many ethanol producers are now aware of the value and need for storing carbon.

“A lot of producers realize it’s possible to reduce the intensity of the existing industry and infrastructure in-place,” Riba says.

Successful projects led by teams like Geostock Sandia have helped show what is possible, he adds. The addition of voluntary carbon markets and private equity investors that want to participate in CCS or credit markets has also helped build momentum in the ethanol space.

“If I’m an ethanol producer today, I need to know CCS is safe, it is cost effective and it can really help improve your product,” Riba says.

He explains that a project started in 2025 will still take roughly three years to go through studies, well testing, permitting, infrastructure build-out and additional work, he says. Geostock Sandia can provide management of the process, man the facilities or train current workforce and help maintain the infrastructure for the life of the well. States including North Dakota, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana are all prime for well drilling, he says.

Because of the work and history of Geostock Sandia, Riba says the process today is simpler than most might think. It’s about logistics and managing the land, all skills ethanol producers already possess, he says. Trading on the carbon market is similar to any other daily process, including managing grain payments, he adds.

“Underground storage is really safe and now the momentum is there and it is a really good time to do it,” Riba says. “You don’t have to bring a lot of technology or create a complex logistics process. It doesn’t have to be that complicated.”

Around the country, American families are finding their electricity bills harder and harder to afford. Electricity prices have risen twice as fast as inflation — and they’re still going up, as utilities requested $29 billion in rate hikes so far this year alone. Low-income families already pay nearly 18% of their income on energy. It’s not adding up for households.

Soaring energy demand from hyperscalers, the tech companies building AI data centers, has shattered two decades of relatively flat electricity use. U.S. electricity demand is projected to grow by 128 GW by 2029 — 93 GW of which is to support data centers.

State officials and utilities feel they have to choose between attracting prospective AI business and enduring long interconnection waiting periods and a volatile national landscape for renewables. Many are opting to resurrect coal plants that had been planned for retirement, or greenlight construction on new gas-fired power plants. And many decision makers view increasingly electric households as passive energy consumers that are in direct competition for a limited power supply.

It doesn’t have to be this way.

There is actually a near-term solution that won’t require forgoing climate pledges or waiting years for new power plants: Data center operators should pay for residential upgrades to heat pumps, rooftop solar and storage — to secure the power they need right now, and establish the grid stability we all need for the future.

It’s time to recognize that households — far from being passive energy consumers — are the foundation of our energy infrastructure, and the hero of our energy story.

The roadmap

This is not just a nice idea. It’s a data-backed solution. In our new report, Homegrown Energy: How household upgrades can meet 100 percent of data center demand growth, we demonstrate how upgrading households is the fastest way for hyperscalers to obtain all the electricity they need — while also contributing towards a flexible, resilient and cost-effective all-electric grid that can support sustained growth in the decades ahead.

We calculated a range of direct benefits that come when hyperscalers and utilities first look to the household to solve their energy system challenges.

In the immediate term, we found that hyperscalers can add roughly 30 GW of capacity nationwide — or one-third of their projected capacity needs through 2029 — by putting heat pumps into households that currently use inefficient electric heating, cooling or water heating.

In Pennsylvania, the figure is even higher. We found that 45% of the state’s projected new data center demand, or 1.3 GW, could come from upgrading inefficient electric heating systems to heat pumps.

This is a cost-competitive option. We calculated that if hyperscalers covered half the upfront installation price of 6.5 million households with electric resistance heating to heat pumps, they could secure grid capacity at a price of roughly $344/kW-year. That’s on par with the cost of building a new gas plant, currently about $315/kW-year.

It’s also a faster option. With average wait times for a new gas plant to come online stretching to seven years or more, looking to the household for capacity is the smart move.

There are significant immediate benefits for households. Energy bills would drop by an average of $740 per year. Reduced outdoor air pollution resulting from the upgrades would lead to $2.3 billion in health benefits, based on our past modeling of health outcomes from electrification. And by pairing these investments with negotiated discounts or standardized installs that achieve economies of scale, hyperscalers would create a virtuous feedback cycle that further lowers upfront costs for households and makes existing state and local incentives more efficient and effective.

Reaching 100%

In a second scenario, we ran the numbers to see what it would take for hyperscalers to find even more capacity from households.

We found that if hyperscalers invested in a home battery for all single-family homes and a 5-kW solar panel system for those with a suitable roof — modest, by residential installation averages — they could collectively generate 109 GW of increased capacity on the grid. That’s more than the 93 GW that data centers are projected to need. And with installations at that scale, paired with targeted interventions such as streamlining the permitting process, hyperscalers could secure this capacity at costs comparable to building a gas power plant.

Texas could unlock 13.9 GW of capacity through solar, storage and upgrading inefficient central AC systems to heat pumps, which is 80% of the 17 GW of projected new data center capacity needs in the state.

Georgia could unlock 6.9 GW of capacity through solar, storage and upgrading inefficient electric heating systems to heat pumps, which is 100% of the 6.7 GW of projected new data center capacity needs in the state.

And Pennsylvania could unlock a total of 4.5 GW of capacity through solar, storage and upgrading inefficient electric heating systems to heat pumps, which is 150% of the 3 GW of projected new data center capacity needs in the state.

Foundation for the future

This plan is more than feasible. It presents a win-win solution that is available to us right now. And it begs the question: if the household can play such a large role in delivering the solutions we need, why wouldn’t we commit to that path?

The politics facing hyperscalers and utilities alike are increasingly challenging. In just the last few weeks, there has been a surge of articles drawing the link between increasing energy bills at the kitchen table and data centers coming to town. That is a trade ratepayers are unlikely to make, and it threatens the social license for all parties involved.

Read More in Grid Security & Reliability

It’s time for us to reject the false premise that the only way out of this problem is to focus exclusively on adding more inefficient fossil-fueled power plants to the grid, while ignoring the missed opportunity inside each of the millions of households with existing links to the grid.

We have a practical, economic and political imperative to quantify and pay for the benefits that upgrades can bring both to the household itself and also to the system. We must prioritize policies that support this vision.

There are already successful programs in place across the country where households are being tapped in to contribute — from decades of successful energy efficiency initiatives to the more recent uptick in virtual power plant and load shifting programs. To date, emerging large-load tariff models and other policy mechanisms largely overlook the vast opportunity for data center operators to leverage households as grid assets while investing in tangible benefits for communities.

We can pave the way for a modern, all-electric future that lifts up households and industry alike. It’s time we commit to it.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/R-VcWWQHd37bSDrkEHUbfBsTMsVQ5gCLGLJxq6-MT7s/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8yVDlUSzc0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-10 12:08:07.222199

As the government shutdown stretches into its second week, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not working — and more are not getting paid. The White House has thrown into question whether some will ever be made whole.

Still, for the first time in awhile, Monica Gorman is upbeat.

""I'm feeling energized, honestly,"" says Gorman. ""It's felt for so long to me like federal workers have just been screaming into a void.""

Gorman works at NASA and is a member of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers (IFPTE). She spoke in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the government.

Long before Congress failed to pass a funding bill, the Trump administration essentially started shutting down the government bit by bit, Gorman says. At NASA, entire offices have been shuttered, including her own at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. She had been using data science to predict the cost of future NASA missions.

Due to cuts proposed in Trump's budget request, she was reassigned to a new position working on a lunar communications project. Her first day was supposed to be Oct. 1 — the same day the government shut down.

Now, the shutdown has given her hope that some in Congress may be willing to assert their Constitutional authority over spending and push back against some of the sweeping cuts.

""To see people in Congress taking a harder line, I feel like we're finally being heard now in a way that we weren't before,"" she says.

""I'm done being afraid""

Even as the government shutdown has brought financial and emotional stress to federal workers and their families, it's also given a boost to some who see the standoff in Congress as an opportunity to get the word out that things are not okay.

Nine months into President Trump's second term, Gorman and other federal workers tell NPR they are coming together to strategize, talk to reporters, meet with members of Congress and sound the alarm about everything the government has already lost: institutional knowledge, funding for vital services, the means for holding officials accountable.

Fear of retaliation by the Trump administration has left many federal employees reluctant to speak on the record with NPR. But now?

""I'm done being afraid of them,"" Gorman says. She believes many others are too. ""They say the best organizer is a bad boss, and we all have the same bad boss.""

NPR asked the White House for a response to the criticism coming from some civil servants. In a statement, spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote: ""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing. Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""

Connecting with others for support and information

Sarah Kobrin, who has worked at the National Cancer Institute for nearly 22 years, says the Trump administration's repeated attacks on the federal workforce have brought government workers closer.

""They have made us much, much stronger,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Kobrin says she has met all kinds of people in other agencies and around the country. They've been forced by the Trump administration to turn to each other for information about the administration's latest directives — and for support.

Earlier this year, Kobrin faced the difficult task of calling grantees to inform them that their research funding had been terminated. She'd been told her area of expertise — uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — was not a priority of the current administration. With so much of her work hobbled, she now refuses to stay silent.

""I see the dismantling of the government and the scientific enterprise, specifically, and must speak,"" she says.

Still, in a workforce of more than 2 million people, Kobrin acknowledges that not all federal workers are weathering the shutdown and the turmoil of the past nine months the same way.

""I know there is certainly a wide variety of what people need. How afraid they are, how stable they feel,"" she says. ""It's hard not to be paranoid under the current circumstances.""

With unions sidelined, grassroots employee networks grow

Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal employees, citing national security concerns even at agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Weather Service. That executive order faces multiple lawsuits.

Also targeted were unions representing employees at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), including a local chapter of the National Federation of Federal Employees that was led by Stephanie Rice, an employee of BLM based in Alaska.

With the union's future looking dim, Rice began looking for other ways to connect with federal workers and discovered the Federal Unionists Network, the group that Gorman is also a part of.

Now, from her base in Anchorage, Rice has been able to stay engaged and informed, even with little information coming through official channels.

""This sort of crowdsourcing across the country, with everyone saying, 'I saw this. What have you heard?'… has been really useful,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Before her time in Alaska, Rice served for six years in the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations. She's devoted her entire adult life to public service.

However, they do not explicitly mention consumer-performed replacements of 12-volt batteries — a component generally considered a wear-and-tear item in both gasoline and electric vehicles.","EV maker Rivian is facing criticism from consumers after a YouTuber with nearly 10 million followers accused the EV maker of preventing owners from replacing the 12-volt battery, without risking their warranty.

Zack Nelson — known online as JerryRigEverything and followed by over 900,000 users on X and nearly 10 million on YouTube — said in a post that Rivian refused to sell him a 12-volt battery for self-installation after his unit failed.

The company allegedly warned that using a non-Rivian replacement could void the warranty.

“My 12v batteries died after 3.5 years,” Nelson wrote. “However – Rivian won’t sell me a 12v battery to install myself. And they say if I buy anything off the shelf it could void my warranty.”

He shared a repair invoice showing Rivian charged $775.04 to replace two 12-volt batteries, including $511.30 in parts and $231 in labor, a cost he compared to what he once paid for an entire car.

“The kicker? Rivian charges $775.04 dollars to replace the two 12v batteries. (That’s what I paid for my first car and it came with a 12v battery,)” he wrote.

As of press time, the post had reached 1.2 million people and gathered 19,000 likes.

The tech reviewer contrasted Rivian’s stance with how a similar situation would be handled with his Tesla Cybertruck.

“I could snap my Cybertuck in half and Tesla would give me a manual on how to glue it back together,” he wrote. “But Rivian won’t even let me replace a 12v battery on my own.”

The post quickly spread on social media, reigniting a debate over automakers’ “right-to-repair” policies.

One of the top-voted comments noted that if Rivian’s policy discourages third-party parts or self-service, it could violate the’ Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act’ and Federal Trade Commission rules.

The rules prohibit conditioning warranty coverage on the use of branded parts.

Under 15 U.S.C. § 2302(c) and 16 CFR § 700.10, manufacturers cannot tie warranty validity to the use of their own authorized parts or service unless those parts are provided free of charge or the company has obtained a waiver from the FTC.

David Barclay, who served at the FTC, posted the relevant section of federal law on X, calling Rivian’s practice “illegal under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and FTC rules.”

The company’s warranty terms state that repairs must be performed by Rivian or authorized service centers.

However, they do not explicitly mention consumer-performed replacements of 12-volt batteries — a component generally considered a wear-and-tear item in both gasoline and electric vehicles.

Rivian’s design originally featured two compact 12-volt batteries, positioned side by side near the firewall to free up additional space in the front trunk, according to the X user Alex Edgerton.

After a software malfunction in 2023 temporarily disrupted 12-volt charging and created a shortage of replacement units, the company revised the setup—substituting one of the batteries with a capacitor.

Although it appears identical from the outside, the new component doesn’t store power, and Rivian’s manuals and documentation still refer to both units as batteries, Edgerton noted this Thursday.

As reported earlier this week, Rivian is preparing to replace Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant with Google’s Gemini AI platform in its vehicles.",https://i0.wp.com/eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GkLShrbX0AAHFwr.jpeg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-10 11:01:08.652867

The amendment Stein mentioned—introduced by Republican Senate leader Phil Berger—aims to effectively circumvent the lethal injection lawsuits.
North Carolina hasn’t used a gas chamber since 1998 and hasn’t electrocuted anyone since 1936.
Stein’s decision to sign Iryna’s Law—or allow it to become law without his signature—was seen as a fait accompli.
“Governor Stein chose cruelty over justice,” Deborah Dicks Maxwell, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said in a statement.","Dodging the Bullet

When Gov. Josh Stein signed the Republicans’ crime bill into law on October 3, he released a short video explaining his rationale.

Lawmakers passed the bill, dubbed Iryna’s Law, on September 23 in reaction to the brutal slaying of Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte’s light rail a month earlier. Her killer, Decarlos Brown Jr., suffers from schizophrenia. The law will require more defendants to be evaluated for mental health issues after their arrests.

“That’s a good thing, and why I have signed it into law,” Stein said. But Stein didn’t like everything in the bill. “Most alarming,” he said, “the General Assembly sprung a last-minute amendment that aims to bring about execution by firing squad to North Carolina. It’s barbaric.”

Stein made a promise: “There will be no firing squads in North Carolina during my time as governor.”

It’s not clear how Stein intends to keep that promise. A spokesperson told The Assembly that the governor “is taking a close look at the requirements under Iryna’s Law and is focused on taking steps to take meaningful action to keep people safe.”

North Carolina hasn’t executed anyone since 2006. Long-stalled litigation over Racial Justice Act claims and the state’s lethal injection protocols has led to a de facto moratorium. The amendment Stein mentioned—introduced by Republican Senate leader Phil Berger—aims to effectively circumvent the lethal injection lawsuits.

It doesn’t explicitly mention firing squads. Instead, it says that if lethal injection is deemed unconstitutional or isn’t available, the secretary of the Department of Adult Correction has to choose an execution method approved in another state. That appears to leave several possibilities: firing squad, nitrogen hypoxia, electric chair, and the gas chamber.

If an execution is scheduled, the secretary—a Stein appointee—could keep the governor’s promise by opting for a non-firing-squad alternative, though none is particularly genteel. North Carolina hasn’t used a gas chamber since 1998 and hasn’t electrocuted anyone since 1936. State prison officials did not immediately respond to questions about how much it would cost to restart these execution methods.

Five states have recently authorized the use of nitrogen hypoxia, in which inmates inhale nitrogen through a mask until they suffocate. Critics have said this method might amount to “torture.” Five states also allow firing squads, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. South Carolina has used it twice this year.

Stein might also hope to dodge the issue altogether. At most, he’ll be governor for seven more years, and it’s possible none of the state’s 122 death row inmates will be eligible for execution before he leaves office.

But Iryna’s Law aims to speed up appeals. If it succeeds, Stein might find himself boxed into an uncomfortable corner.

Stein’s Death Penalty Backlash

Before Berger unveiled his amendment to expand execution methods, Iryna’s Law appeared likely to pass with broad bipartisan support. Democrats believed Stein would sign it, according to legislative sources. At least half of Senate Democrats planned to back the bill, as did many House Democrats.

But after Republicans passed the amendment, most Senate Dems walked off the floor, and those who remained voted against the bill. The next day, House Democrats faced a dilemma. Stein’s office didn’t tell them whether his plans had changed, several Democrats said.

Ultimately, 17 Democrats voted for the bill. Most came from Mecklenburg County (where Zarutska was killed), Wake County (whose district attorney, Lorrin Freeman, lobbied for the bill before Berger added his amendment), or competitive districts (Dem leaders told them to “vote for the bill so as to be seen as tough on crime,” one source said).

Robert Reives, the House’s Democratic leader, also voted for it, though he called Berger’s amendment “cynical. … It makes me wonder who we are as a government.”

Senate Republicans have a veto-proof supermajority. In the House, Democrats can sustain a veto—but only if all of them show up and vote together. With 17 defections, it seemed likely that a veto would be easily overridden. Stein’s decision to sign Iryna’s Law—or allow it to become law without his signature—was seen as a fait accompli.

But perhaps not. According to multiple sources familiar with the situation, Reives’ office believed his caucus would have sustained a veto—at least in the short term. Over time, that might get dicier, and Republicans could have called an override vote at any point before the end of next year. A member might also miss a vote due to illness or, um, other unfortunate circumstances (see below).

Senate Democrats sent Stein a letter imploring him to veto a bill they called “fundamentally flawed, legally questionable, and morally wrong,” according to a draft obtained by The Assembly. (A Senate Dem said Stein was “pissed” when he received it.)

Instead, Stein signed the legislation, despite saying it lacked “ambition or vision” and contained a “barbaric” death penalty provision. His decision left some Democrats and their allies fuming.

“Governor Stein chose cruelty over justice,” Deborah Dicks Maxwell, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said in a statement.

The governor’s loudest Democratic critic—publicly, anyway—has been Sen. Graig Meyer of Orange County. Stein’s “decision and his statement on it are such a terrible example of what happens when you abandon principle,” Meyer posted on Substack.

In an interview, Meyer said this episode was indicative of Stein’s term so far. “He won’t touch anything that is an ambitious issue,” he said. “He thinks about what he’s afraid of, what he doesn’t want to touch, and he works backward from there.”

The governor’s office did not respond to The Assembly’s questions about the politics of Iryna’s Law.

Brockman Charged

N.C. Rep. Cecil Brockman, a Guilford County Democrat, is facing bipartisan calls for his resignation after he was charged with multiple sex crimes.

Brockman, 41, was arrested Wednesday and charged with two counts each of indecent liberties with a child and statutory rape. Arrest records show the alleged victim was between the ages of 13 and 15. The offenses are alleged to have taken place on Aug. 15.

Brockman was held without bail in the High Point jail and was scheduled to make his first appearance Thursday at the Guilford County Courthouse. That hearing was postponed at the last minute, when a bailiff said Brockman had a “medical emergency” and was taken to a local hospital.

Democrats including Stein, Roy Cooper, and Anderson Clayton called on him to resign, as did Republican House Speaker Destin Hall.

Meck Yes?

By fall 2020, the Charlotte Moves task force was well on its way to putting together a nearly $20 billion plan to meet the city’s transportation needs for the next 30 years.

There would be rail extensions—including a long-awaited line to north Mecklenburg—as well as road improvements, better bus service, and even an ambitious “micro transit” system that uses on-demand vans to fill gaps. Pieces were falling into place.

That September, the city’s chief financial officer presented the group with a long menu of financing choices that included property and sales taxes, revenue bonds, motor vehicle fees, development fees, federal loans, special tax districts, and private money.

“We really didn’t consider them; I’ll be honest with you,” Harvey Gantt, a Democrat and former mayor, told The Assembly. “The most equitable tax is the sales tax.”

“Before mass timber, we didn’t have a market-ready bio-based structural solution that was competitive with concrete and steel.” Now we do.","From the moment you approach and enter Amazon’s new delivery station in Elkhart, Indiana, you know you’re somewhere special. First, there’s the wood that makes up much of the walls and the ceiling. Then there are the windows, vast expanses of glass that bathe the interior in sunshine. Oh, and the more than 170 electric-vehicle charging stalls just outside.

This is indeed a new kind of delivery station. And those elements that are obvious at a glance are just a few of the ways we’re powering another effort central to our future.

DII5, as we call it, is not just a delivery station. It doubles as an exercise in sustainability, packed with more than 40 market-ready technologies and systems designed to reduce its resource usage and shrink its carbon footprint.

We designed our new delivery station to help us reduce our carbon footprint as well as our resource usage across our global network of buildings. Photos by Kendall McCaugherty and Dronegenuity

And it’s not just meant to make a difference in Elkhart. We’re counting on DII5 to give us vital data on how those sustainability initiatives work in our facilities. The goal is to find out which offer the right balance of cost and performance, and which we might be able to scale across our global operations, taking their impact way beyond one building.

“We have experimented with and implemented a lot of sustainability initiatives over the years,” says Daniel Mallory, Amazon’s vice president of global realty. “DII5 continues that effort by taking a culmination of a lot of big ideas not just in how we operate our facilities, but in how we build them. And it’s going to help us as we steadily climb toward our sustainability goals.”

Globally, buildings and construction account for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Carbon Leadership Forum. As we work to meet our Climate Pledge commitment to operate more efficiently and sustainably and to decarbonize our entire global operations by 2040, we’re investigating and investing in building strategies that increase energy efficiency, prioritize carbon-free energy, use lower-carbon construction materials, and reduce water consumption and waste generation.

DII5, then, is much more than a single node in a global network of fulfillment centers, delivery stations, office buildings, data centers, grocery stores, and entertainment venues. It builds on how we think about all of our buildings and our operations, and serves as one more tool for learning more about how to make a difference.

Let’s take a look

We’ll start with the bones.

DII5’s wooden walls (which are made from over half a million board feet of southern yellow pine and sit atop a foundation of lower-carbon concrete) are made of a material called “mass timber,” or “engineered wood.” It’s a material we’ve been using for years (including at our HQ2 in Arlington, Virginia), and one we’re working to implement at a larger scale.

Mass timber is made by combining pieces of softwood trees like spruce, fir, and pine, the kind of lumber you can buy at your local hardware store. Those pieces are glued or laminated together, resulting in a material that can hold its own against concrete and steel in terms of structural strength, is less carbon-intensive to produce, and locks in the carbon that the trees sequestered before they were harvested.

“Trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere, store it in the cells of their fiber,” says Kristen Dotson, Amazon’s principal for sustainable buildings. “If we can lock up that material in the building for 50 to 100 years, we’re creating a carbon ‘bank’ that keeps that sequestered carbon from being re-released into the atmosphere.”

The net effect is that going with mass timber can put a serious dent in a building’s carbon footprint: A 2022 study found that on average, the embodied greenhouse gas emissions of buildings made of reinforced concrete are 43% higher than those of mass timber structures.

“The game-changing part around mass timber is that it’s taking a ready commodity and turning it into this structural element that can replace much of the concrete and steel that goes into a building,” Dotson says. “Before mass timber, we didn’t have a market-ready bio-based structural solution that was competitive with concrete and steel.”

Now we do.

Collaboration station

Of course, we couldn’t do this alone. To bring DII5 to life, we worked with Graycor as the general contractor, ZGF as design architect and sustainability lead, and Atlantic AE as the architect of record. Climate Pledge Fund company CarbonCure provided the lower-carbon concrete technology.

Other companies including Sterling Structural, Ozinga, TimberHP, and local manufacturer Arborwood also played crucial roles in bringing this facility to life, demonstrating how sustainability innovation can drive economic opportunity.

“DII5 challenges the idea of what a logistics facility can be,” says Marty Brennan, principal at ZGF Architects. “Amazon’s scale and commitment to sustainability allowed us to push boundaries with our design, bringing together numerous partners from across the building industry to create a welcoming experience of light, wood, and native prairies that nurture Amazon associates, delivery service partners, and local wildlife.”

Universal Technical Institute to Expand its Dallas Campus

The Universal Technical Institute is expanding its UTI-Dallas campus, located in Irving. The expansion will allow for the enrollment of 1,000 new students and a variety of new programs, including automation technology and wind turbine technology. A second building will also be constructed near the campus.

The Ohio EPA approved SOBE's 10-year pyrolysis permit in February of 2024. Following this, the City of Youngstown filed an appeal with the Environmental Appeals Commission (ERAC) to have that permit rescinded.

This effort was supported by the group SOBE Concerned Citizens, who held a town hall meeting in August of 2025 to collect signatures on a letter to the Ohio EPA director to rescind the permit.

According to a press release from SOBE Concerned Citizens, over 220 Youngstown residents signed that letter.

In addition to the request to rescind the permit, the letter also asks the EPA to schedule an inspection of SOBE's facility, and if it has already, to share the results of that inspection with Youngstown's residents.

""SOBE operates with one pipe connected to a boiler fired by natural gas in a semi truck trailer to provide the steam heating and cooling for our downtown businesses. Why is SOBE allowed to vent methane directly into the air when burning natural gas to fire the boiler,"" the letter reads.

In a separate letter to the Ohio EPA, the group said it confirmed with Youngstown's Assistant City Attorney that the 10-year permit is considered an asset that may be sold as part of the receivership proceedings.

This means if someone else buys SOBE's facility while the permit is still in effect, it can be transferred to them without proper review or public input.

""For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0 percent financing for 72 months and other incentives.""
Plug-in hybrid deliveries rose 37 percent from last year, offsetting a 16 percent slide in EV sales.
Shaun Bugbee, executive vice president of operations for BMW of North America, attributed the weaker EV sales to limited supply.","Ford is canceling its own version of an electric vehicle leasing program that effectively extended the EV $7,500 federal tax credit that expired on September 30. The news comes just a few days after General Motors abruptly canceled its identical plan thanks to pressure from two Republican senators who claim the automakers were ""bilking the U.S. taxpayer."" Give me a break. Ford said it would continue to offer discounted leases on EVs through December, but it would do so without claiming the tax credit. It's not immediately clear if those discounts equal the $7,500 credit amount. GM, on the other hand, will run its $7,500 credit program through the end of October.

Both automakers used their financing arms to make pre-emptive down payments on EVs that were already in dealership inventory before the tax credits expired on September 30. It — theoretically — allowed them to claim the tax credit on those vehicles and give the benefit of that incentive to customers who later agreed to lease them. From Automotive News:

""Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today to continue providing customers with more affordable electric vehicle options,"" spokesperson Said Deep said in an Oct. 9 statement. ""For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0 percent financing for 72 months and other incentives.""

[...]

GM reversed course Oct. 8 after Sen. Bernie Moreno, a former dealer who represents Ohio, and Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming contacted Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the companies' plans to use what the senators called a ""loophole"" in the law eliminating the tax credit.

The IRS in August issued guidance saying the credit still could be claimed if a vehicle was ""placed in service"" after September, so long as the vehicle already had been acquired with payment made.

While deals like these might sound like a good way to help customers save money on the vehicles they'd like to buy, not everyone (read: Republican senators who used to be dealers) agrees.

""This guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer,"" Moreno and Barrasso wrote to Bessent in a letter dated Sept. 30. ""It has come to our attention that certain car companies are gaming this guidance by instructing their captive financial entities to enter into written binding agreements with dealers for electric vehicles, paying a nominal downpayment, to secure the credits on vehicles that may not be leased to the end user for months. Given this concerning information, we write to request your assistance to close this loophole and address the total violation of Congressional intent by these nefarious actors.""

When AutoNews asked Ford why it was canceling the program just two weeks after it was rolled out, the automaker said, ""Ford makes its own decisions.""

We've reached out to Ford for more clarity on the situation, and we'll update this story when and if we get more information.

Nearly 280 workers at General Motors' Factory Zero electric vehicle manufacturing plant will remain on layoff for the rest of the calendar year. The automaker told employees at the Detroit-Hamtramck facility on August 27 that it planned to partially shut down first- and second-shift production temporarily starting on September 2. GM builds the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ at the facility. From the Detroit Free Press:

""As recently shared, General Motors is making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand,"" said a statement sent by GM spokesman Kevin Kelly. ""We will continue to evaluate and adjust operations based on the market and customer demand.""

GM first said on April 10 that it was temporarily cutting approximately 200 jobs. About 160 more workers started a layoff the day after Labor Day and were meant to return to work Oct. 6.

About 80 of the originally impacted employees received job opportunities within the company.

It's pretty wild that, for all the build-up surrounding Factory Zero and all of the delays it faced before opening, it's already dealing with prolonged temporary layoffs. Hopefully, for these workers' sake, things are back up and running sooner rather than later.

BMW won back the top luxury sales spot from Lexus in the third quarter of 2025, selling 96,886 vehicles to beat the Japanese automaker by a tight margin of 5,277 units. Lexus made itself the sales king in Q2 of this year, but it seems that victory was rather short-lived. In any case, both automakers are expected to set sales records this year.

Part of BMW's strategy right now is bringing in 2026 model year vehicles early. According to Edmunds data, 2026 MY vehicles made up 51% of BMW Q3 sales and just 4.8% of Lexus'. However, Lexus dealers were able to turn inventory faster in the quarter. BMW's took an average of 46 days to sell, whereas the average Lexus was gone in 22 days. From Automotive News:

BMW's third-quarter sales surged 25 percent from a year earlier, when the brand was hampered by a significant recall and stop-sale for faulty brake modules.

Strong demand for BMW's plug-in hybrids and crossovers powered sales in the quarter. Plug-in hybrid deliveries rose 37 percent from last year, offsetting a 16 percent slide in EV sales.

Shaun Bugbee, executive vice president of operations for BMW of North America, attributed the weaker EV sales to limited supply.

BMW took a ""measured reduction"" in EV production in May and June, when there was uncertainty about tariffs, customer demand and the federal tax credit, Bugbee said.

The brand's EV sales in September increased more than 30 percent as buyers rushed to dealerships before the federal subsidy expired at month's end.

[...]

Lexus' third-quarter sales reached 91,609, up 13 percent from last year.

Shawn Domeracki, Lexus' vice president of sales and dealer development, said the brand's U.S. sales were on track to achieve a record of about 355,000 for the year.

He credited two models for driving the pace: the redesigned GX midsize SUV and the three-row TX large crossover. Through nine months, GX sales were up 35 percent this year, at 28,244, while TX volume increased 86 percent to 39,546.

Coming in third was Mercedes-Benz. In the quarter, sales actually fell 13% to about 73,500 passenger vehicles. The automaker attributed the decline to higher sales earlier in the year. There may be something to that. Through the third quarter, retail sales were up 6% to about 223,800 vehicles — putting MB on track to surpass last year's rough total of 302,000 vehicles.

Overall, the U.S. luxury segment grew 4.5% in the third quarter, which is actually slightly less than the 5.6% the rest of the market grew. Rounding out the top five when it comes to luxury sales were Audi (46,758 vehicles) and Cadillac (46,525 vehicles — up 25% year-over-year).

Toyota is recalling about 394,000 2022-2025 Tundras and Tundra Hybrids, as well as 2023-2025 Sequoia Hybrids, because of an issue with the rearview camera. Apparently, there's some sort of software issue with the 14-inch infotainment screen that might cause it to display a ""half green, full green, or full black screen. This is not ideal, especially in trucks this big. From USA Today:

""If this occurs while the vehicle is being reversed, the vehicle may not meet a federal safety standard and there can be an increased risk of a crash with a person behind the vehicle,"" Toyota said in an Oct. 1 notice.

[...]

While three different models were technically included in the recall, Toyota clarified that only ""certain"" vehicles might be experiencing the issue.

Toyota dealers will update the multimedia display software at no cost to owners, and if you own one of these cars, you should expect to get your notification by the end of November.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/ford-cancels-7500-ev-lease-credit-extension-following-pressure-from-republican-senators/l-intro-1760103742.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 13:07:13.210571

For working-class Americans, navigating government systems is like a second job that doesn’t pay the bills.

Every unnecessary delay, form, and regulation is a hidden tax on our most precious resource: time.
The time tax is real — and it’s time to treat it that way.","Modern discussions of inequality focus on wealth gaps and wage stagnation. But there’s an equally sinister version of inequality that doesn’t pit billionaires against the poor. It involves the administrative state’s pilfering a valuable resource from anyone trying to get ahead: time.

“Time inequality” is less visible, harder to measure, and arguably more corrosive than income inequality. One of the greatest achievements of liberal markets has been the steady increase in individuals’ leisure time. Whereas people with fewer means once labored from sunup to sundown to survive, they now enjoy more time for family, rest, and self-improvement. Liberal markets delivered this miracle, but government bureaucracies are quietly taking it back.

For working-class Americans, navigating government systems is like a second job that doesn’t pay the bills. Need to renew your driver’s license? That’s half a day gone. Start a side business? Expect to spend months navigating complex licensing processes, completing paperwork, obtaining approvals, and making repeat visits. File a zoning variance? Bring snacks.

These aren’t mere annoyances. They’re regressive, invisible taxes on time — imposing the greatest burden on those with the least resources. A 2016 study by researchers at the consulting firm Management Lab revealed that bureaucratic waste — including delays and overregulation — costs America 17 percent of its GDP. This number represents real hours lost, opportunities denied, and lives hindered.

The wealthy have ways around all this. They can hire assistants, pay for expedited services, or simply take time off without financial strain. But for the poor, every government-imposed delay comes at a real cost: lost wages, missed shifts, and less time with family.

Consider the maze of occupational licensing laws that govern over 20 percent of U.S. jobs. Want to braid hair, drive a food truck, or give tours? In many states, you’ll need to pay fees, pass tests, and complete hundreds of hours of training. In these cases, it’s not just money being extracted. It’s time. To obtain a cosmetology license in New Mexico, for example, one must complete more than 1,600 hours of instruction. Burdensome requirements such as this are designed to protect incumbents, who benefit from high hurdles that keep out new competition.

Worse still, even after meeting every costly, time-consuming requirement, many find themselves blocked by arbitrary bureaucratic vetoes. Policies like “certificates of need” let government officials decide — often with no justification — that an individual’s services aren’t needed, regardless of that person’s qualifications. That’s precisely what happened to Ursula Newell-Davis, a licensed social worker in Louisiana who has spent years fighting to provide respite care for vulnerable children, only to be told the state doesn’t believe that those children “need” her help. The prospect of having to navigate this rigged system often leads people to give up before they begin.

Some people who are hurt by arbitrary hurdles seek help from the courts. But legal recourse, too, can be a marathon. Take the Supreme Court case Sackett v. EPA. The Sacketts wanted to build a modest home on their land in Idaho. However, the Environmental Protection Agency claimed jurisdiction over their property and threatened to fine them tens of thousands of dollars per day unless they got an expensive permit. The couple fought back — and won. But it took a full 16 years to vindicate their rights.

Here’s the good news: There are solutions.

First, lawmakers should kill deadweight licensure requirements. There’s no reason for someone to need government permission to, for example, do makeup, arrange flowers, or braid hair. There should be no public gatekeeping if there’s no significant public risk. And if some states don’t regulate an occupation and have no problems, that’s a good reason for all other states to rethink their restrictions.

Second, everything should be streamlined. If a government process takes more than 30 days, requires multiple in-person visits, or can’t be completed online, then it’s broken. Implement response-time caps, default approvals, and digital filing for everything. If Amazon can process millions of orders daily, our local governments can issue building permits without dragging the process out for months. Furthermore, regulatory audits shouldn’t measure only monetary costs — they should also measure time burden.

Finally, courts should treat bureaucratic time-wasting — particularly when it burdens people’s right to earn a living — as a matter of constitutional concern. Courts reflexively defer to regulators’ determination that a law is necessary, even when rules arbitrarily block people from earning a living. But if a law consumes people’s time without a clear public benefit, courts should strike it down.

Every unnecessary delay, form, and regulation is a hidden tax on our most precious resource: time. And that tax is anything but equal. The time tax is real — and it’s time to treat it that way.",https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/People-walking-busy-city-.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 14:04:12.409956

During the furlough, aerosol concentrations within a three-kilometer radius of the power plants were higher by 0.018-0.022, on average.","Power plants may emit higher amounts of pollution during lapses in federal monitoring and enforcement, such as during a government shutdown, according to a new study led by researchers at Penn State.

The study, published in the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, details the short-term effects of enforcement of federal environmental laws and regulations on power plant air emissions.

Using data from the 2018-19 federal government shutdown, which lasted 35 days, as a natural experiment, the researchers found that coal-fired power plants increased daily emissions of particulate matter - tiny solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air - during the furlough of federal employees.

This increase may be caused by the temporary reduction of efforts from the power plants to limit pollution, according to Ruohao Zhang, assistant professor of agricultural economics in the College of Agricultural Sciences and lead author on the paper.

At the same time, Zhang explained, the researchers found no detectable increase in daily emissions of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides. This was likely because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Markets Division has monitored and enforced limitations on these pollutants continuously since 1995, so they were not affected by the government shutdown.

Zhang said the findings are important because even small increases of pollution can affect human health. They also suggest that inspections and enforcement efforts are crucial for mitigating pollution both in the long run and on a daily basis.

""Interruptions in inspections and enforcement have the potential to trigger immediate environmental and health consequences,"" he said. ""Moving forward, policies should ensure stable inspection capacity, minimize enforcement gaps and expand continuous emission monitoring.""

The EPA plays a key role in ensuring compliance with federal environmental laws and regulations, the researchers said, with monitoring and enforcement activities as its primary responsibility.

However, the EPA's resources for these activities have declined over time, with shrinking budgets and reduced enforcement staff. Consequently, the number of inspections and time for enforcement have also decreased over the years.

""This reduction in monitoring and enforcement raises concerns about the weakening of regulatory stringency and environmental compliance,"" Zhang said. ""We wanted to investigate the effect of reduced monitoring and enforcement efforts on firms' pollution and compliance with environmental regulations.""

However, the researchers said studying the impact of reduced monitoring and enforcement can be challenging. Fewer inspections may simply indicate strong compliance, for example. Additionally, it can be difficult to pinpoint the effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement in achieving or maintaining regulatory compliance.

For the study, the researchers compiled data from several sources. A list of coal-fired power plants came from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and data on emissions and operations - including daily power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide, as well as daily heat input, electricity generation and steam production - came from the EPA's Air Market Program.

They then compared power plants' daily operations and emission behaviors before and after the EPA furlough to detect any short-term changes resulting from the temporary absence of regulatory inspections and enforcement.

The researchers found that the aerosol concentration of particulate matter surrounding the power plants increased significantly during the EPA's furlough. The average aerosol optical depth - a measurement of how many aerosols are in the atmosphere - for the U.S. is 0.1 to 0.15. During the furlough, aerosol concentrations within a three-kilometer radius of the power plants were higher by 0.018-0.022, on average.

""Studies have shown that even short-lived increases in particulate matter have the potential to worsen public health outcomes,"" Zhang said. ""Evidence links small increases of fine particulate matter with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less to higher mortality risks. Stable enforcement and continuous monitoring are useful tools for ensuring compliance, reducing emissions and protecting health.""

New factory in Austin to anchor U.S. energy resilience and grid modernisation efforts.

Participation in Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource program enables homeowners to feed power directly into the grid.

Austin startup aims to decentralize the grid

Base Power, a fast-growing energy technology company based in Austin, has raised $1 billion in Series C funding to accelerate the rollout of home battery systems across the United States. The round was led by venture firm Addition, with participation from Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, and Elad Gil, as well as new investors including Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

The funding positions Base Power among the most well-capitalized startups in the U.S. energy transition, reflecting investor confidence in distributed energy solutions as the grid faces mounting strain from extreme weather, ageing infrastructure, and rising electrification demand.

CEO and co-founder Zach Dell said the company is driven by a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvent how power is generated, stored, and shared. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality,” he said.

Distributed storage meets domestic manufacturing

Base Power’s business model revolves around leasing batteries directly to homeowners, offering reliable backup power while allowing participants to sell excess energy back to the grid. This decentralised system strengthens grid resilience and helps integrate renewable energy, addressing one of the core challenges of the U.S. clean energy transition: balancing supply and demand in real time.

As part of its expansion strategy, Base Power is developing its first energy storage and power electronics manufacturing facility at the former Austin American-Statesman printing press site in downtown Austin. The company plans to establish additional facilities to meet surging demand for distributed battery systems.

“The only way to add capacity to the grid is by physically deploying hardware,” said co-founder and COO Andrew Lopas. “We need to make that hardware here in the U.S., ourselves. This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning our second.”

By investing in domestic production, Base Power is aligning with national efforts to reindustrialize the energy sector, reduce dependence on imported components, and strengthen supply chain resilience — a priority under the Biden administration’s clean energy and manufacturing policies.

Powering the grid from the ground up

Base Power recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, allowing it to aggregate thousands of home batteries and sell electricity directly into the state’s power market. The initiative could prove pivotal for grid operators struggling with growing demand volatility and the integration of intermittent renewables.

The company’s distributed model also complements recent federal initiatives encouraging grid-edge technologies, such as the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program. With utilities and regulators seeking cost-effective ways to improve reliability, distributed batteries — collectively acting as “virtual power plants” — are emerging as a scalable alternative to large, centralized infrastructure.

For investors, the model offers exposure to one of the fastest-growing segments of the energy transition: behind-the-meter storage. BloombergNEF projects U.S. residential battery capacity could increase fivefold by 2030, driven by falling costs, rising solar adoption, and regional incentive programs.

Rebuilding American energy capacity

Beyond its immediate commercial ambitions, Base Power’s approach speaks to a broader transformation in the U.S. energy economy — one that blends software, manufacturing, and local ownership to rebuild resilience from the household level up.

The company’s long-term vision extends beyond residential markets. Executives have indicated interest in expanding to small businesses, microgrids, and community-scale deployments, leveraging the same distributed platform to support energy equity and grid flexibility.

As Lopas put it, “We’re building the infrastructure, systems, tools, processes, supporting software, and team that’s reindustrialising America and reinventing the grid.”

If successful, Base Power’s model could help redefine how power is produced and consumed in the world’s largest economy — turning homes into active participants in the clean energy transition while strengthening the backbone of U.S. grid infrastructure.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Base-Power-Secures-1B-to-scale-U.S.-Home-Battery-Network.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 14:04:07.051198

While the Energy Department says no final decisions have been made on which additional projects to cut, Secretary Chris Wright has said his department plans to cancel additional funding issued for green projects under the last administration.
“As this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” he added.
After that, a list obtained by The Hill details hundreds of additional projects whose “latest status” is listed as “terminate.” While the cancellations announced last week primarily affect projects in blue states, the new one contains additional and equivalent projects in red states.
Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement that final decisions had not been made on further impacted projects.","The Trump administration is eyeing additional major cuts to green energy projects beyond the billions of dollars that it has already halted.

A list that circulated in Washington this week and was reviewed by news outlets including The Hill detailed billions in further projects whose funds could be on the chopping block. It comes on top of $7.6 billion in cuts announced last week and $3.7 billion announced earlier in the year.

While the Energy Department says no final decisions have been made on which additional projects to cut, Secretary Chris Wright has said his department plans to cancel additional funding issued for green projects under the last administration.

“This is evaluations we’ve had ongoing, and we release these periodically. We released some announcements a few months ago, we’ll have many more coming this fall,”Wright recently told CNN on the $7.6 billion in funding cancellations.

“As this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” he added.

The $7.6 billion included billions under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for “hydrogen hubs” in California and the Pacific Northwest.

After that, a list obtained by The Hill details hundreds of additional projects whose “latest status” is listed as “terminate.”

While the cancellations announced last week primarily affect projects in blue states, the new one contains additional and equivalent projects in red states.

The new list contains cancellations of billions of dollars in investment in hubs for carbon capture and hydrogen energy, as well as cancellations for red states themselves and utilities that operate there and grants for universities.

It was first reported on by Semafor, which said that it was described as a “kill list”. E&E News confirmed the list with seven people familiar with the Energy Department’s internal operations.

Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement that final decisions had not been made on further impacted projects.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” Dietderich said.

“As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration. Rest assured, the Department is hard at work to deliver on President Trump’s promise to restore affordable, reliable, and secure energy to the American people,” he added.

However, the list met much criticism from supporters of such projects.

“DOE is slashing funding to American companies, investors, and communities across the U.S.,” Conrad Schneider, U.S. senior director at Clean Air Task Force, said in a written statement.

“Over the last several years, the U.S. has rightly invested in innovative energy projects that have supported economic growth and workforce development, strengthened global leadership, catalyzed additional investment in local economies, while positioning the country to meet rising energy demands and lowering electricity bills for consumers and businesses. Today’s move jeopardizes the investments and benefits that companies and investors have made,” Schneider added.

The blue state list released last week came amid a moment of particularly heightened partisan tensions during the ongoing government shutdown.

White House Office of Management Budget director Russell Vought, who has threatened federal layoffs during the shutdown, tweeted about the project cancellations impacting blue states.

However, the Energy Department’s review of Biden-era projects it may want to cancel has been longstanding.

Wright told Congress in May that the administration was looking to cancel previously funded projects based on a range of criteria, including whether they aligned with the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The simple little criteria we’re looking at is [is it] legal? … Is the technology viable? Is the engineering done competently? Is there a market for the thing that’s being built? Is there a financial model that that cofunding is coming in together with the DOE funding so the project can be complete, and does it add to national or economic security? … And is it aligned with this agenda?” he said at the time.

TheTrump administration has also repeatedly sought to put up barriers for other climate-friendly technologies, especially renewable energy.

In particular, the administration slashed billions of dollars in tax credits for renewables and has even tried to cancel prior approvals of offshore wind projects.

Other agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, have also sought to claw back previously appropriated green funds.",https://www.myarklamiss.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/10/GreenEnergyCuts_Frazin_AP_AlexBrandon.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-10 11:01:49.503780

“Thanks to Trump’s chaotic leadership, our clean energy economy and climate are at great risk,” said Chicago-area Rep. Ann Williams, who heads the Illinois Green Caucus, during a recent news conference.
“Our goal primarily is to give the state tools to address resource adequacy needs, expand clean energy and keep costs low,” Hoffman told lawmakers.
The Illinois Manufacturers Association and Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers, which represent the state’s largest power users, particularly take aim at the energy storage provision and a requirement for utilities to submit long-range integrated resource plans (IRPs).","Illinois Democratic leaders and clean energy groups are racing to pass a wide-reaching energy bill this month to insulate consumers from the Trump administration and regional grid operators whom they blame for “an electricity affordability crisis.”

A key provision of the bill would require six gigawatts of grid-scale battery storage over the next decade. It’s a provision that the Illinois Power Agency estimates would produce savings for consumers across the state who saw electricity bills rise sharply over the summer.

The effort to pass the legislation before the Illinois General Assembly wraps up its fall veto session at the end of the month faces pushback from Republicans and large power users. The lobbying push also reflects a growing sense of urgency to take more control over the state’s energy future as prices rise across the regional electric grids that serve Illinois, PJM Interconnection and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).

Lawmakers pushing for action say they also want to insulate Illinois from swings in federal energy policy under President Donald Trump.

“Thanks to Trump’s chaotic leadership, our clean energy economy and climate are at great risk,” said Chicago-area Rep. Ann Williams, who heads the Illinois Green Caucus, during a recent news conference. “We have to take action here in Illinois.”

A draft version of the 800-page bill introduced last month by Democratic state Rep. Jay Hoffman, goes far beyond batteries. It would bolster renewable energy procurement, create a long-term planning requirement for Illinois utilities, boost utility energy-savings goals and broaden the state’s existing Solar for All program, aiming to boost solar adoption by low-income consumers.

“Our goal primarily is to give the state tools to address resource adequacy needs, expand clean energy and keep costs low,” Hoffman told lawmakers.

Kady McFadden, legislative strategist for the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, a group of dozens of local, state and national environmental and clean energy organizations, said there’s heightened urgency to take action before lawmakers recess on Oct. 30, given the shift in federal policies since the bill was introduced in the spring and outrage from consumers who saw their electricity bills jump in recent months.

As recently as January, the coalition was pushing for passage of a bill dubbed the Clean and Reliable Grid Act during the Legislature’s lame duck session. In a sign of the times, the title of the bill the group was lobbying for took on a new word, “affordability,” by the time the spring session got underway.

“This is, at its core, a ratepayer protection bill,” McFadden said in an interview.

GOP lawmakers and some of the state’s largest electricity users disagree. They argue Illinois’ existing policies enacted in recent years are at the root of the problem and say core provisions of the legislation being considered will only cause electricity bills to rise further.

The Illinois Manufacturers Association and Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers, which represent the state’s largest power users, particularly take aim at the energy storage provision and a requirement for utilities to submit long-range integrated resource plans (IRPs).

“This is a significant rate increase on every consumer in Illinois, whether it’s a homeowner, a school, a church, a retailer or manufacturer,” said the manufacturing association’s CEO, Mark Denzler.

Denzler blames the recent spike in electricity prices on an imbalance between supply and demand in PJM and MISO. The group wants to extend mandatory closure dates for coal- and gas-fired power plants in Illinois, which were part of the state’s landmark 2021 climate law, and to see development of new power plants, transmission and battery storage.

But the group wants grid-scale batteries financed through state-issued bonds, not procured through the Illinois Power Agency (IPA), a state agency formed two decades ago to buy energy on behalf of the state’s investor-owned utilities.

Hammering out a compromise

The IPA said its “conservative” analysis of the provision shows that the 6 GW of storage, estimated to cost $14 billion, would provide net benefits to ratepayers.

Storage developers and clean energy groups contend the provision would work in much the same way as the state’s nuclear program, which, while initially requiring a subsidy to reactors, is now generating bill credits for consumers.

Illinois House and Senate committees conducted hours of hearings on the sprawling bill in recent weeks and negotiations are ongoing to try to hammer out compromises among a wide array of interests ranges from energy developers to environmental groups, labor, industrial energy users and the data center lobby.

While legislation pushed by the clean energy coalition failed to pass during the spring, that was before electricity bills in Illinois surged beginning June 1 to reflect capacity price increases related to auctions held by PJM and MISO.

Prices for power plant capacity in PJM — a key component of consumer electricity bills — rose fivefold on June 1. They’re poised to jump further next summer. In MISO, which covers the central and southern areas of the state, capacity prices during the summer rose by a factor of 20.

In PJM, three quarters of the capacity price increases were driven by demand from data centers in areas like Northern Virginia, which is outstripping the ability to get new generation online, according to the market’s independent monitor, Joe Bowring, who testified at one of the hearings.

Hoffman, the bill’s sponsor, was among those who pointed a finger at the two regional grid operators for contributing to the rise in prices. Jonathan Feipel, executive director of the Illinois Commerce Commission staff, was even more pointed in testimony last week.

“The real price hikes we’ve seen over the summer, I would argue, are a direct result of PJM and MISO kind of mismanaging markets,” Feipel said.

The unhappiness with rising power prices and the role of the grid operators is reflected in another provision in the bill that would have the ICC conduct a study on whether Illinois would be better off creating its own single-state grid operator, like New York or California, compared with being part of two multi-state markets.

Another piece of the bill is based on a proposal by GOP state Sen. Sue Rezin and would lift a moratorium on new large nuclear power plants in Illinois, the state with the nation’s largest existing fleet of reactors.

Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law in 2023 lifting the ban on nuclear development for projects less than 300 megawatts. The policy was aimed at enabling development of small modular reactors.

Now technology companies are eyeing larger-scale projects, too, as a long-term answer to growing power needs to run AI data centers. Rezin told POLITICO’s E&E News earlier this year that the growing power requirements of companies looking to build projects in her district and elsewhere in Illinois require the expansion of all forms of power generation, including nuclear.

Constellation Energy, which operates nuclear plants in Illinois, backs the proposal. The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, meanwhile, argues that nuclear wouldn’t ease the burden on consumers and said the bill’s focus should be on reducing energy costs and helping the state achieve the goals established in the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.

Illinois’ largest utilities, ComEd and Ameren, said they’re neutral on the bill, though officials from both have been actively involved in hearings.

“This summer’s electric capacity constraints, which led to significant bill increases for our customers, underscore the ongoing energy supply challenge in Illinois,” said Matt Tomc, Ameren Illinois’ vice president of regulatory policy and energy supply. He added that the utility is “sensitive to the projected costs of the proposed solutions” and urged lawmakers to move cautiously.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/cd/b1/3c154d244fdd9ab935af237bf6f4/illinois-capitol.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 11:00:38.637285

United States Renewable Energy Market is expected to reach US$ 1,002.13 Gigawatt by 2033 from US$ 429.55 Gigawatt in 2024, with a CAGR of 3.64% from 2025 to 2033.

With continuous growth anticipated across solar, wind, hydro, and developing green technologies, the U.S. renewable energy business is still expanding strongly because to investor interest, technology advancements, and governmental incentives. With significant activity in the West, Midwest, and Northeast, the U.S. renewable energy sector is regionally diversified. Infrastructure, policy support, and resource availability all affect regional growth rates and technological choices.

Over the past ten years, the US renewable energy sector has grown significantly and is now a significant part of the country's energy mix. The sector, which is fueled by federal and state laws, uses a variety of energy sources, including as geothermal, hydroelectric, wind, solar, and biofuels. Businesses at every stage of the value chain, from utilities and financiers to equipment makers and project developers, are actively involved in the national expansion of sustainable energy solutions.

As governments, corporations, and consumers place a higher priority on decarbonization, investments in renewable energy have increased dramatically. Advances in battery storage and smart grid technology are complementing major infrastructure investments like offshore wind projects and utility-scale solar arrays. Renewables are now more competitive with fossil fuels because of the private sector's dedication to clean energy procurement and supportive laws like tax credits and clean energy standards.

With costs continuing to drop and innovation accelerating, the future of the U.S. renewable energy sector is bright. Although there are differences in regional markets, the overall trend indicates that usage is rising across all industries. Integration issues still exist, particularly with regard to energy storage and grid modernization, but continuous research and development is overcoming these obstacles.

The industry's contribution to energy independence, environmental sustainability, and job creation guarantees its ongoing strategic significance. All solar market categories saw this growth, which resulted in a total installed capacity of almost 188 GW across the country. With 22.5 GW of additional capacity, the utility-scale sector was instrumental, and almost 800,000 US residents installed solar systems in their homes.

Before ramping up to 60 GW yearly between 2025 and 2030, the United States intends to add an average of 30 GW of solar capacity annually until 2025. With cumulative solar installed capacity predicted to reach 673 GW by 2034 - enough to power over 100 million homes - this ambitious objective is anticipated to propel the market for solar photovoltaics (PV) to grow quickly.

The Edwards & Sanborn Solar + Energy Storage project, which was introduced by Terra-Gen and Mortenson in January 2024, is a noteworthy undertaking that highlights this expansion. 1.9 million First Solar panels, with a solar capacity of 875 megawatts direct current (MWdc) and roughly 3.3 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of energy storage, are part of this enormous renewable energy project, which covers 4,600 acres. Additionally, it has the biggest interconnection capacity in the US at 1.3 GW.

Key Factors Driving the United States Renewable Energy Market Growth

Support for Policies and Regulatory Incentives

Policies at the federal and state levels are crucial to the growth of renewable energy in the United States. The economics of renewable projects have been greatly enhanced by incentives like the Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC). Long-term risks are decreased and investor confidence is further increased by the Inflation Reduction Act and associated green legislation.

These regulations encourage widespread implementation by reducing up-front expenses while simultaneously offering long-term stability. States are also enacting strict clean energy laws and climate targets, which is accelerating the industry. Financial incentives and clear regulations increase the viability and appeal of renewable energy projects nationwide.

Advancements in Technology and Cost Reduction

One of the main drivers of growth is innovation in renewable technologies. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for renewables has significantly decreased due to ongoing advancements in solar photovoltaic (PV) efficiency, wind turbine design, and energy storage technologies. A more dependable and responsive energy network is supported by technological developments in battery storage, smart metering, and grid integration.

Because of these advancements, renewable energy sources are becoming more competitive with conventional power sources in terms of scalability and performance. As technology advances, learning curves and economies of scale further reduce costs, facilitating wider deployment and quicker adoption in the commercial, industrial, and residential sectors.

Demand for Clean Energy from Businesses and Consumers

Growing consumer and corporate demand for renewable energy is a result of growing knowledge of sustainability and climate change. Big businesses are using power purchase agreements (PPAs) and green tariffs to source renewable electricity and set aggressive net-zero goals. This business demand stabilizes developers' revenue streams and aids in the financing of new renewable projects.

Residential customers are becoming more interested in community solar initiatives and rooftop solar. Clean energy adoption is being driven by cost savings, energy independence, and environmental concerns, which is driving market growth for both individuals and companies.

Challenges in the United States Renewable Energy Market

Limitations of Grid Infrastructure and Integration:

Outdated grid infrastructure is one of the main issues facing the US renewable energy industry. The intermittent nature of solar and wind electricity is too much for many components of the current electrical infrastructure to handle. The implementation of renewable projects is delayed by transmission congestion, a lack of interconnection capacity, and sluggish new line permitting procedures.

Advanced grid management technology, such as real-time monitoring, forecasting, and storage, are also necessary for integrating large amounts of fluctuating renewable energy. Renewable capacity growth could surpass the system's capacity to handle them effectively if substantial investment is not made in updating the grid.

Complexities of Regulation and Permitting:

Prolonged permitting processes and regulatory obstacles are commonplace for renewable energy projects. Delays and higher project costs may arise from different state and municipal permitting requirements. In particular, utility-scale solar and offshore wind are subject to land-use disputes, stakeholder consultations, and stringent environmental studies.

These administrative obstacles slow down rollout and deter investment. Additionally, developers may experience uncertainty due to uneven alignment between federal and state regulations. Accelerating the transition to renewable energy requires uniform regulatory frameworks and simplified permitting procedures.

United States Renewable Energy Market Overview by States

California Renewable Energy Market

Due to its plentiful solar resources and aggressive clean energy policies, California is the state with the highest adoption rate of renewable energy in the United States.

The market is dominated by distributed and utility-scale solar energy, with important contributions from wind, geothermal, and biofuels.

Demand response and battery storage investments are being made in response to overgeneration and intermittency issues facing California's system. A key player in grid integration and renewable planning is the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). California continues to lead the U.S. in the transition to renewable energy because to its sizable consumer base and strong environmental commitment.

Texas Renewable Energy Market

Texas is a leader in renewable energy, particularly wind, where it has the most installed capacity in the US. The state is a good place for renewable energy because of its large land area, robust wind corridors, and deregulated energy market. The use of solar energy is growing quickly, and large utility-scale installations are already under way. ERCOT, Texas' grid operator, manages market dynamics and grid stability while integrating significant amounts of renewable power despite its oil heritage.

Transmission infrastructure and extreme weather resilience continue to face obstacles, but innovation keeps pushing things forward. Continued investments in renewable energy are fueled by the state's economic competitiveness and energy independence philosophy. Texas is a prime example of how market-driven strategies may hasten the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources, especially in areas that have historically relied heavily on fossil fuels.

New York Renewable Energy Market

With its Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which requires net-zero emissions by 2050 and 70% renewable electricity by 2030, New York is actively pursuing a clean energy transition. With the support of financial incentives and public-private partnerships, the state makes significant investments in offshore wind, solar, and hydroelectric generation.

Large-scale renewable energy project planning and funding are coordinated by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). Energy storage and grid upgrades are crucial areas of focus to support intermittent renewables and guarantee dependability. Although there are obstacles due to urban density and high energy demand, development is aided by effective governmental leadership and community involvement.

While both of these models were in the works before the Trump administration confirmed that the credit would be axed, they may help to convince some shoppers to buy an EV who would have otherwise been priced out of the market.

According to Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, automakers are taking varied approaches to a common problem.

“The overarching message of tax credits going away for EVs has had a very different set of approaches from each automaker,” he told Business Insider. “Which approach will be most successful? Debatable. Nobody’s looking to increase. That’s cuckoo talk at this point. You just want to maintain that basic level of sustainable sales, and this is the different methodologies that each of them have taken.”

Some brands have decided that cutting losses may be the most practical move. Both Stellantis and Acura have opted to discontinue certain EV models altogether. Acura recently confirmed it will pull the plug on its all-electric ZDX SUV, while Stellantis has shelved plans for the RAM 1500 REV.

Ford is canceling its dealer EV lease program linked to the expired $7,500 federal credit but will maintain competitive lease offers.

The move follows GM’s similar cancellation and underscores the challenges automakers face in sustaining EV demand without federal incentives.

Some automakers offer alternative incentives, while industry experts remain divided on how much the credit’s expiration will affect EV sales.

On Thursday, Ford announced it’s canceling a program that would have allowed dealers to apply the $7,500 federal EV tax credit to lease payments after the subsidy expired September 30. The automaker said it will maintain its current competitive lease offers but will not claim the credit.

The decision follows a similar move by General Motors, which ended its own program Wednesday. Both automakers had planned to have in-house lending arms purchase EVs from dealers, claim the tax credit, and roll the benefit into customer lease payments.

While Ford Credit will continue to offer 0% financing for 72 months and other incentives for customers purchasing EVs, some manufacturers, including Hyundai and Stellantis, have provided cash incentives to bridge the gap left by the expired credit.

GM canceled its program after Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer active in auto policy, raised concerns. However, Ford has not provided a clear reason for its decision.

Automakers have been working closely with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to develop strategies to sustain EV sales amid the upcoming expiration of the federal credit. While industry leaders remain divided on the potential impact, with some warning that sales could decline significantly without the credit, others asserting that the EV market is resilient, the industry continues to adapt and respond to these evolving circumstances.

Solar alone accounted for 83 percent of the increase, with several countries setting new solar generation records.
Total renewable generation worldwide grew by 363TWh, a 7.7 percent increase, while coal generation fell by 31TWh to 4,896TWh.
In a recent report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) revised its projection for US renewable energy growth over the rest of the decade.

Solar alone accounted for 83 percent of the increase, with several countries setting new solar generation records.

The biggest increases were seen in China, where solar generation grew by 55 percent; the US, which saw a 14 percent increase; the EU, which increased by 12 percent; India, which grew by 5.6 percent; and Brazil, which saw a 3.2 percent uptick. The rest of the world accounted for the remaining nine percent of the total.

Total renewable generation worldwide grew by 363TWh, a 7.7 percent increase, while coal generation fell by 31TWh to 4,896TWh. As a result, renewables’ share of global electricity rose to 34.3 percent from 32.7 percent, while coal’s share fell to 33.1 percent from 34.2 percent.

The growth in renewable generation was mirrored by overall electricity demand, which increased 2.6 percent (+369TWh) in the first half of 2025. Despite the overall increase in electricity demand, emissions fell slightly by 12 megatons of CO2, driven by falls in China and the EU.

The report focused on monthly electricity data from 88 countries, representing 93 percent of global electricity demand, and included estimated changes in the remaining generation.

Despite global growth in renewables, the US market is expected to enter a downturn due to the current administration's growing apathy toward the sector. In a recent report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) revised its projection for US renewable energy growth over the rest of the decade.

The agency had previously anticipated that the US would install around 500GW of additional renewable capacity, mainly from wind and solar, by 2030. That estimate has now been lowered to about 250GW.

However, while the US is expected to see a sharp drop off, overall global renewable capacity is expected to surge by 2030. The IEA’s latest medium-term outlook forecasts an additional 4,600GW of renewable capacity by the end of the decade, driven predominantly by solar PV, which will account for 80 percent of the growth. According to the report, India is on track to become the world’s second-largest renewables growth market after China.

Data center companies are among the largest offtakers of renewable energy worldwide. In 2024, Amazon was recognized as the largest corporate buyer of renewables for the fifth year in a row, citing data compiled by BloombergNEF.

According to the company, it has supported more than 600 wind and solar projects to date. Of those 600, 40 are in countries with high fossil fuel penetration, including Australia, China, Greece, India, Indonesia, Poland, and South Africa, and US states such as Louisiana and Mississippi.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/Amazon_wind_china.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.png,N,,2025-10-10 08:02:34.851350

Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.
The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming.
A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered.
Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining, drilling and other development in three Western states, advancing President Donald Trump’s ambitions to expand energy production from public lands.

Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.

The timing of Biden’s actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president’s signature.

The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.

Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.

The road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden’s goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump’s efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices … and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Democrats urged rejection of the repeals, arguing that Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly agenda is driving up energy prices because renewable sources are being sidelined even as the tech industry’s power demands soar for data centers and other projects.

“We are seeing dramatic increases in the price of energy for American consumers and businesses and the slashing of American jobs, so that Donald Trump can give an easy pass to the fossil fuel industry,” Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

Ashley Nunes, public lands specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said Republicans were unleashing “a wholesale assault on America’s public lands.” Using the Congressional Review Act to erase land management plans “will sow chaos across the country and turn our most cherished places into playgrounds for coal barons and industry polluters,” she said.

This time, it’s the hyperscalers and Big Tech who are set to leapfrog utilities as the first major customers for and early adopters of multi-day energy storage (MDS), which can provide dozens of hours of capacity. For data centers, which require 24/7/365 firm power, MDS could be an attractive offer.

“Data centers are looking for as much energy and power as they can get, as quickly as possible,” explained Aric Saunders, the executive vice president of commercialization at ultra-long-duration storage and carbon battery start-up Noon Energy. The company is developing batteries that utilize reversible solid oxide fuel cell technology to convert between electricity and stored chemical energy.

He told pv magazine USA that speed to power has become a critical component of data center development. But, many of the most common solutions have one thing in common, he said: backlogs in shipping or technology development.

While long-duration storage and MDS are still in their (comparatively) early days vis-a-vis lithium-ion batteries, the technologies are scaling fast and are set to “become a viable solution in terms of power, speed and costs.”

“We haven’t had load growth for 20 years,” Saunders said, adding that the current moment is a turning point. Coupled with increasing renewable penetration, the 4-8 hours of storage capacity provided by most lithium storage systems just “isn’t sufficient” to create a satisfactory level of firm power for data centers without also needing diesel generators, which many companies are trying to move away from.

He sees MDS following a similar path to lithium, which evolved from a niche technology into a dominant industry force.

“It’s not necessarily a new technology, but a new application of the technology,” he said. While electric vehicles helped catapult lithium batteries to the spotlight, Saunders believes Big Tech may be the spark that sets off the long-duration boom.

“This is that push to get us off the margins and more mainstream, but it won’t be the final one,” he said. While we’re no longer in the earliest days of long-duration storage, Saunders expects the industry’s growth to be “exponential” in the next few years once the tech reaches bankability.

“There will always be early adopters and that’s where hyperscalers are our best allies,” Saunders added, noting that “utilities will admit it themselves that they’ll never be that first mover.”

Noon is focused more on not only continuing to derisk their tech, but making sure that their current customers, including hyperscalers, understand how it works and the value it can bring them.

“Solar or wind plus a long-duration battery? That’s an onsite power plant,” Saunders said.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2048px-Google_data_center.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 08:01:05.714417

(NYSE: TE) (“T1,” “T1 Energy,” or the “Company”) has made a strategic investment in Talon PV LLC (“Talon”), acquiring a minority equity stake in the developer of a solar cell fab.

T1 is advancing its own solar cell fab, the 5 GW G2_Austin project in Rockdale, Texas. The first phase is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2026. Talon is developing a 4.8 GW solar cell plant in Baytown, Texas. Both Texas-based companies plan to utilize advanced manufacturing to produce the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S.

The T1 and Talon projects are examples of American companies investing in American energy, supported by President Trump’s OBBBA and 45x tax credits. The Texas projects are expected to reshore jobs and deliver power to meet rising electrical demand driven by AI, industrialization and residential load growth.

Both projects are expected to meaningfully add domestic manufacturing capacity and produce TOPCon solar cells, the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S. TOPCon cells utilize the quantum tunneling technology awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics earlier this week.

Under terms of the deal, T1 has entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (“SAFE”) to acquire an equity stake in Talon. T1 and Talon remain in discussions to potentially deepen the strategic relationship in the future.

“We are excited by the opportunity to invest in another American solar energy project that complements our G2_Austin development,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “Expanding the output of American solar cells is necessary to support energy security, achieve regulatory compliance and build an American solar industry based on advanced manufacturing and cutting-edge solar technology.”

T1 Energy owns the 5 GW G1_Dallas solar module facility in Wilmer, Texas, and this summer signed a long-term deal with Corning Inc to obtain polysilicon and solar wafers manufactured in Michigan.

“Our partnership with T1 Energy strengthens the foundation of U.S. solar manufacturing. Together, we’re building scalable, non-FEOC supply chains that deliver true domestic content and reinforce America’s energy independence and national security,” said Adam Tesanovich, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Talon.

Talon PV LLC is a privately held U.S. company developing an advanced 4.8 GW TOPCon solar cell manufacturing fab with anticipated commercial availability starting in Q1 2027. The company is majority owned by Eagle Group, a diversified industrial firm with a long-standing commitment to investing in and advancing American energy production.

While the Energy Department says no final decisions have been made on which additional projects to cut, Secretary Chris Wright has said his department plans to cancel additional funding issued for green projects under the last administration.
“As this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” he added.
After that, a list obtained by The Hill details hundreds of additional projects whose “latest status” is listed as “terminate.” While the cancellations announced last week primarily affect projects in blue states, the new memo contains additional and equivalent projects in red states.
Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement that final decisions had not been made on further impacted projects.","The Trump administration is eyeing additional major cuts to green energy projects beyond the billions of dollars it has already halted.

A list circulated in Washington this week and reviewed by news outlets including The Hill detailed billions in further projects whose funds could be on the chopping block. It comes on top of $7.6 billion in cuts announced last week and $3.7 billion announced earlier in the year.

While the Energy Department says no final decisions have been made on which additional projects to cut, Secretary Chris Wright has said his department plans to cancel additional funding issued for green projects under the last administration.

“This is evaluations we’ve had ongoing, and we release these periodically. We released some announcements a few months ago, we’ll have many more coming this fall,” Wright recently told CNN on the $7.6 billion in funding cancellations.

“As this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” he added.

The $7.6 billion included billions under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for “hydrogen hubs” in California and the Pacific Northwest.

After that, a list obtained by The Hill details hundreds of additional projects whose “latest status” is listed as “terminate.”

While the cancellations announced last week primarily affect projects in blue states, the new memo contains additional and equivalent projects in red states.

The new list contains cancellations of billions of dollars in investment in hubs for carbon capture and hydrogen energy, as well as cancellations for red states themselves and utilities that operate there and grants for universities.

It was first reported by Semafor, which said that it was described as a “kill list.” E&E News confirmed the list with seven people familiar with the Energy Department’s internal operations.

Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement that final decisions had not been made on further impacted projects.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” Dietderich said.

“As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration. Rest assured, the Department is hard at work to deliver on President Trump’s promise to restore affordable, reliable, and secure energy to the American people,” he added.

However, the list met much criticism from supporters of such projects.

“DOE is slashing funding to American companies, investors, and communities across the U.S.,” Conrad Schneider, U.S. senior director at Clean Air Task Force, said in a written statement.

“Over the last several years, the U.S. has rightly invested in innovative energy projects that have supported economic growth and workforce development, strengthened global leadership, catalyzed additional investment in local economies, while positioning the country to meet rising energy demands and lowering electricity bills for consumers and businesses. Today’s move jeopardizes the investments and benefits that companies and investors have made,” Schneider added.

The blue state list released last week came amid a moment of particularly heightened partisan tensions during the ongoing government shutdown.

White House Office of Management Budget Director Russell Vought, who has threatened federal layoffs during the shutdown, posted about the project cancellations impacting blue states.

However, the Energy Department’s review of Biden-era projects it may want to cancel has been long-standing.

Wright told Congress in May that the administration was looking to cancel previously funded projects based on a range of criteria, including whether they aligned with the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The simple little criteria we’re looking at is, [is it] legal? … Is the technology viable? Is the engineering done competently? Is there a market for the thing that’s being built? Is there a financial model that that cofunding is coming in together with the DOE funding so the project can be complete, and does it add to national or economic security? … And is it aligned with this agenda?” he said at the time.

TheTrump administration has also repeatedly sought to put up barriers for other climate-friendly technologies, especially renewable energy.

In particular, the administration slashed billions of dollars in tax credits for renewables and has even tried to cancel prior approvals of offshore wind projects.

Other agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, have also sought to claw back previously appropriated green funds.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/10/GreenEnergyCuts_Frazin_AP_AlexBrandon.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-10 13:08:20.462448

(NYSE: TE) (“T1,” “T1 Energy,” or the “Company”) has made a strategic investment in Talon PV LLC (“Talon”), acquiring a minority equity stake in the developer of a solar cell fab.

T1 is advancing its own solar cell fab, the 5 GW G2_Austin project in Rockdale, Texas. The first phase is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2026. Talon is developing a 4.8 GW solar cell plant in Baytown, Texas. Both Texas-based companies plan to utilize advanced manufacturing to produce the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S.

The T1 and Talon projects are examples of American companies investing in American energy, supported by President Trump’s OBBBA and 45x tax credits. The Texas projects are expected to reshore jobs and deliver power to meet rising electrical demand driven by AI, industrialization and residential load growth.

Both projects are expected to meaningfully add domestic manufacturing capacity and produce TOPCon solar cells, the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S. TOPCon cells utilize the quantum tunneling technology awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics earlier this week.

Under terms of the deal, T1 has entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (“SAFE”) to acquire an equity stake in Talon. T1 and Talon remain in discussions to potentially deepen the strategic relationship in the future.

“We are excited by the opportunity to invest in another American solar energy project that complements our G2_Austin development,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “Expanding the output of American solar cells is necessary to support energy security, achieve regulatory compliance and build an American solar industry based on advanced manufacturing and cutting-edge solar technology.”

T1 Energy owns the 5 GW G1_Dallas solar module facility in Wilmer, Texas, and this summer signed a long-term deal with Corning Inc to obtain polysilicon and solar wafers manufactured in Michigan.

“Our partnership with T1 Energy strengthens the foundation of U.S. solar manufacturing. Together, we’re building scalable, non-FEOC supply chains that deliver true domestic content and reinforce America’s energy independence and national security,” said Adam Tesanovich, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Talon.

Talon PV LLC is a privately held U.S. company developing an advanced 4.8 GW TOPCon solar cell manufacturing fab with anticipated commercial availability starting in Q1 2027. The company is majority owned by Eagle Group, a diversified industrial firm with a long-standing commitment to investing in and advancing American energy production.

The announcement was made on Thursday in Zurich, at the closing of this year’s congress. The decision acknowledges Hungary’s strong performance and commitment to renewable energy, with the country now ranked among the top five in Europe for geothermal utilization.

The EGC, held every three years, gathers more than 1,200 participants from across the continent, bringing together policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders to discuss innovations, new technologies, and market developments. First organized in 1999, the event last took place in Hungary in 2003 in Szeged. 25 years later, it returns to the country’s capital.

Budapest won the hosting rights against strong competition from five other European cities—Dublin, Glasgow, The Hague, Porto, and Sofia. The decision was made by the European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC), which oversees the event and represents the continent’s geothermal sector. Hungary’s bid, submitted jointly by the Supervisory Authority for Regulated Activities (SZTFH), the Ministry of Energy, and the Hungarian Mining Association, received the highest possible score. According to the organizers, the unity of Hungary’s geothermal community, the strength of its national energy strategy, and the government’s policy support were decisive factors in securing the win.

Viktor Horváth, Deputy State Secretary for Energy Transition at the Ministry of Energy, said that Hungary aims to make efficient and environmentally friendly geothermal energy a driving force of its green economy. He recalled the creation of the National Geothermal Utilization Concept and Hungary’s leadership role in drafting the EU’s first action plan for accelerating geothermal energy use. Under the Jedlik Ányos Energy Programme, record funding has been allocated to support geothermal expansion. ‘Hungary is not only an excellent choice because of its past achievements but also because of its promising future,’ Horváth said.

Strategic Deputy President of the SZTFH Bence Gonda noted that Hungary’s geothermal strategy—featuring simplified licensing, state-backed risk reduction measures, and stronger cooperation between public, academic, and private sectors—has become a European benchmark. Hosting the congress, he added, will give Budapest and the entire Central European region an opportunity to showcase their expertise and contribute to shaping future energy policy directions.

Hungary currently leads the region with around 1.1 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity. According to the National Geothermal Utilization Concept, developments in the sector could replace more than one billion cubic metres of natural gas by 2035. The reformed regulatory framework and financial incentives are expected to further accelerate growth, with municipal and district heating capacity projected to double and geothermal power generation to increase ten- to twentyfold.

The 2028 congress in Budapest will serve as a platform to present these achievements, strengthen Hungary’s role in Europe’s energy transition, promote domestic companies on international markets, and highlight the accomplishments of Hungarian researchers in the field.",https://www.hungarianconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20250930__2606657__v1__HighRes__GeothermalAreaHveradalirInKerlingarfjoellMounta-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 08:59:57.528283

“Packages are being delivered with the same reliability our customers expect and we still get to test our sustainability initiatives,"" a statement from Amazon explained.
This project follows other Amazon developments that have used mass timber, including its HQ2 buildings in Arlington, Virginia.","Amazon has developed a mass timber warehouse in Elkhart, Indiana, which will serve as a live testing environment for more than 40 distinct sustainability strategies.

The project could provide a blueprint for integrating sustainable practices into logistics and industrial buildings without disrupting core business operations.

Amazon’s Chief Sustainability Officer Kara Hurst says: “In climate action, we need to move fast. So our teams got creative and asked: ‘What if we created a real-world testing ground for some of the best sustainability initiatives, in one place?’

“That's exactly what we did at DII5, our brand-new mass timber delivery station in Elkhart, Indiana.”

Scalable green building solution

The DII5 facility was constructed primarily from mass timber and designed by ZGF Architects.

It incorporates features such as clerestory windows for natural light, circadian lighting systems and electric vehicle charging stations.

These elements align with Amazon's objective to achieve net-zero operations by 2040. The project demonstrates a large investment in exploring scalable green building solutions.

""By testing several sustainability initiatives under one roof, we're accelerating our progress toward achieving scalability and standardisation of these initiatives across our building portfolio,"" Daniel Mallory, VP of Global Realty at Amazon, says.

Daniel continues: ""At the same time, it serves as a 'test and learn' platform for Amazon and the broader industry to explore how buildings can become more adaptive, high-performing and resilient in a changing climate.

“The lessons we learn here will guide the future design, construction and operation of our spaces.""

Data gathering for sustainable change

Amazon’s aim is to use the findings from the test centre to scale sustainable projects.

Kara explains: “Buildings account for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions globally and with that in mind we designed DII5 to be a working laboratory with dozens of solutions – from the walls, water and lighting, to the desks where our employees work.

“The data we are gathering will help us determine which technologies and initiatives can be scaled across our global operations.”

Mass timber and embodied carbon

According to Amazon, the building is ""the first large-scale owner-occupied mass timber logistics facility in the United States"".

The construction utilised Southern Yellow Pine cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels, glulam beams and wood fibre insulation.

The use of mass timber in construction can significantly lower a building's embodied carbon compared to traditional materials like steel and concrete.

Beyond the structure, the site integrates permeable paving, ""lower carbon concrete"", high-efficiency outdoor lighting and a bio-retention pond for managing stormwater.

These site-wide features contribute to a holistic sustainability strategy, addressing water management, energy use and material science.

The building’s clerestory windows, which line the delivery floor, ""bathe the interior in sunshine"", according to Amazon.

A testbed for operational sustainability

The facility is designed to prove that sustainability can be integrated without compromising operational efficiency.

""These solutions can be changemakers - and the beauty of this approach is, it doesn't impact our operations at all.

“Packages are being delivered with the same reliability our customers expect and we still get to test our sustainability initiatives,"" a statement from Amazon explained.

This approach allows for real-world testing of green technologies in a live, high-volume logistics environment.

Daniel says Amazon will track a range of data points.

""We're tracking multiple metrics, including total embodied carbon reduction compared to conventional construction, operational energy efficiency, water conservation performance, impacts of biodiversity, etc,"" he says.

""We're also studying how the building performs in various weather conditions and monitoring construction and operational costs to assess the business case for scaling these approaches.""

Scaling innovations across existing assets

The insights gained from the Indiana warehouse are not just for future constructions.

The project is intended to generate a catalogue of proven, retrofittable solutions for Amazon's existing portfolio of buildings.

This makes the facility a strategic tool for decarbonising a vast real estate footprint.

""While we view DII5 as a strategic investment in designing and implementing sustainability strategies in our future buildings design, it will also give us an opportunity to test which of these initiatives can be scaled across our existing buildings portfolio,"" says Daniel.

Readers are cautioned that given these risks, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of their dates.","Revolve Renewable Power Corp. (TSXV:REVV)(OTCQB:REVVF) (“Revolve” or the “Company“), a North American owner, operator and developer of renewable energy projects, is pleased to announce it has signed a partnership agreement dated October 8, 2025 with an experienced Engineer, Procure and Construct company (the “EPC Partner“) in Mexico to develop and build a new portfolio of distributed generation power solutions for commercial and industrial customers (the “Partnership Agreement“). The EPC Partner has previously developed more than 50 MW of distributed generation solar projects and brings valuable expertise to the partnership.

Under the Partnership Agreement, Revolve and the EPC Partner have agreed to target two initial portfolios of commercial projects totalling more than 5 megawatts (“MW”) of capacity (the “Target Projects“). The partnership is a key element of Revolve’s broader mandate to increase the size of the Company’s operating asset portfolio in Mexico by partnering with EPC groups that have access to pipelines of late stage, investment ready distributed generation projects that deliver innovative power solutions.

“This is a watershed partnership for Revolve as we join forces with a new partner to advance this portfolio of distributed generation projects in Mexico,” said COO, Omar Bojorquez. “The aim of the partnership, and others we are pursuing, is to accelerate the development and deployment of commercial power solutions throughout Mexico. This partnership has the potential to accelerate our distributed generation pipeline and bring a meaningful number of projects to us for assessment and execution.”

Following the signing of power purchase agreements of any of the Target Projects, the Company intends to own and operate the projects and will provide financial forecasts once definitive agreements are signed. The Partnership consists of a 70% ownership interest for Revolve and 30% for the EPC Partner, with economic benefits being shared on a pro-rata basis on anything over and above Revolve’s required rate of return. The EPC Partner will contribute project opportunities and construction services to the partnership and Revolve will provide project finance and operating expertise, with the economics determined on a project-by-project basis.

With the growing regulatory certainty in Mexico and a lack of investment in the electricity network over the last number of years companies are increasingly focusing on reducing their energy costs and improving energy resiliency. Mexico’s distributed generation market increased by 32% in 2024, reaching 4.4 gigawatts (“GW”) from 3.4 GW, primarily driven by solar installations, according to BNamericas. This growth is occurring as companies seek on-site power solutions and decarbonization to alleviate strain on the national power grid. With a history of operating in Mexico since 2012, Revolve is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth.

“As part of the agreement, the EPC Partner will originate, develop and construct projects and Revolve will finance, own and operate them under long-term power purchase agreements with commercial customers. We are confident this partnership will result in additional distributed generation opportunities for Revolve fueled by increasing electricity demand growth from data centers, electrification and industrial onshoring,” concluded Bojorquez.

More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.

United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) executive director Inger Andersen told AFP in an exclusive interview that countries were not walking away, regardless of their sharp differences on combating the ever-growing problem, including in the oceans.

A large bloc wants bold action such as curbing plastic production, while a smaller clutch of oil-producing states wants to focus more narrowly on waste management.

Supposedly final talks in South Korea in 2024 ended without a deal -- and a resumed effort in Geneva in August likewise collapsed.

Countries voiced anger and despair as the talks unravelled, but said they nonetheless wanted future negotiations.

""We left with greater clarity. And no-one has left the table,"" said Andersen.

""No-one has walked away and said, 'this is just too hopeless, we're giving up'. No-one. And all of that, I take courage from.""

- 'Totally doable' -

The plastic pollution problem is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.

More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.

While 15 percent of plastic waste is collected for recycling, only nine percent is actually recycled.

Nearly half, or 46 percent, ends up in landfills, while 17 percent is incinerated and 22 percent is mismanaged and becomes litter.

Annual production of fossil fuel-based plastics is set to triple by 2060.

As things stand, there is no timetable for when further talks might be held, and no countries have made formal offers to host them.

But Andersen ""absolutely"" thinks a deal is within reach.

""This is totally doable. We just need to keep at it,"" she said.

- Red line clarity -

UNEP has been shepherding the talks process, which began in 2022.

Summarising where countries are at, Andersen said: ""The mood music is: 'we're still in the negotiations. We are not walking away. We have our red lines, but we have a better understanding of the others' red lines. And we still want this'.""

Andersen said Norway and Kenya convened a well-attended meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York last month.

The COP30 climate summit in Brazil in November will provide another opportunity to put the feelers out, ahead of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi in December.

Luis Vayas Valdivieso, Ecuador's ambassador to Britain who chaired the last three of six negotiation rounds, has announced he is stepping down, leaving the process rudderless.

- 'Serious allegation' -

Vayas's Geneva draft treaty text was instantly ripped apart by countries in brutal fashion, and while a revised effort gained some traction, the clock ran out.

British newspaper The Guardian reported that staff from Andersen's UNEP team held a covert meeting on the last night in Geneva, aimed at coaxing members of civil society groups into pressuring Vayas to quit.

""This is a very, very serious allegation,"" Andersen said.

""I did not know and obviously had not asked anyone to do something of this sort.""

She said the allegation had been referred to the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services.

""I've been in this business for 40 years, and I have never, ever done such a thing, and I would never have asked a staff of mine, or anyone else for that matter, to go and have covert meetings and quote my name and ask to undo a seated chair who is elected by member states. It's outrageous.""

As for whether a new chair could provide fresh momentum, she said: ""As always, when there's change, there is a degree of a different mood.""

With the conclusion of construction, the facility is now positioned to accelerate North American battery supply.

The plant was built on schedule and without major incidents, according to company leadership. Moreover, the joint venture emphasized safety and thorough execution in each phase. With this milestone, the project now transitions into the commissioning and operational stages.

Project Factsheet: NextStar / ANC Battery Plant

Developer / Partners NextStar Energy (Stellantis + LG Energy Solution)

Project Type Large-scale lithium-ion battery manufacturing

Capacity approximately 49.5 GWh annually

Size approx. 4.23 million sq ft of facility footprint

Location Windsor, Ontario, Canada

Construction Duration Began August 2022, Completed September 2025

Workforce 3,200 trades & installation staff

Economic Impact Thousands of jobs; major boost to local EV supply chain

Strategic Significance & Market Context

With this plant complete, Canada secures its first large-scale domestic EV battery manufacturing facility. Indeed, NextStar’s facility will supply around 40 % of Stellantis’s electric vehicle needs in North America.

Furthermore, the project supports the auto industry’s shift toward electrification. As more automakers plan EV lineups, stable local battery supply reduces reliance on distant overseas sources. Hence, NextStar’s plant strengthens resilience in North American supply chains, much like the Louisiana EV battery plant that recently broke ground as a first-of-its-kind facility in the United States.

This momentum parallels Texas’ clean energy expansion, particularly through Eolian’s Padua 2 and 3 battery storage projects, which secured $463 million in financing to bolster grid reliability. Together, these initiatives represent a coordinated push to power the future of transportation and energy independence across North America.

Teams, Timing & Execution

Construction of this facility began in August 2022 with site clearing and foundation work. Over succeeding years, the project advanced steadily, marked by topping-out ceremonies and structural milestones.

Project leadership reports that work proceeded with adherence to safety protocols and schedule benchmarks. As a result, the building envelope, mechanical systems, and installation phases were completed on time. Now, the transition is toward testing and startup.

The plant’s workforce included up to 3,200 trades and installers. Of these, a large share were local and Canadian, reinforcing regional industrial capacity.

Challenges & Mitigations

Although the project achieved completion, it faced typical risks: supply chain constraints, labor availability, and cost inflation. To mitigate these, the joint venture applied rigorous procurement protocols and phased staging. In addition, close coordination among Stellantis, LG, and contractors helped streamline operations.

Moreover, contingency planning allowed flexibility in schedule buffers. The project’s success underscores the value of proactive risk management in big-ticket EV infrastructure builds.

Next Steps & Outlook

With construction now done, the plant enters the commissioning and start-up phase. Over coming months, equipment will be tested, systems calibrated, and production ramped. Once operational, the plant will begin delivering modules and cells to EV assembly lines.

The broader implication is clear: this facility positions Windsor, and Canada, as a strategic hub for EV battery manufacturing. As demand for electric vehicles grows, the NextStar plant becomes a cornerstone for regional energy transition and auto growth.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/project-3.avif,N,,2025-10-10 06:59:49.398303

Venture Global highlighted: “The company is disappointed by the arbitration tribunal’s decision in the proceeding with BP, which it believes contradicts the decisive findings in the prior arbitration involving Shell and the facts verified by independent third parties and regulatory agencies with oversight of the Calcasieu project.
“The company is currently evaluating all available options in response to the tribunal’s ruling and will continue to vigorously defend our position.

While reporting on the arbitration ruling in an LNG dispute, Venture Global explained that the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) International Court of Arbitration notified its indirect subsidiary, Venture Global Calcasieu Pass (VGCP), on October 8, 2025, about a partial final award issued in arbitration proceedings with BP Gas Marketing regarding LNG sales from the Calcasieu Pass project under the duo’s long-term LNG sales and purchase agreement (SPA).

According to the award issued by the arbitration tribunal, VGCP had breached its obligations to declare COD of the Calcasieu project in a timely manner and act as a “reasonable and prudent operator” pursuant to the SPA, along with certain other obligations.

While remedies will be determined in a separate damages hearing, which has not been scheduled but is anticipated to occur in 2026, BP is seeking damages in excess of $1 billion, among other remedies, as well as interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees.

Venture Global highlighted: “The company is disappointed by the arbitration tribunal’s decision in the proceeding with BP, which it believes contradicts the decisive findings in the prior arbitration involving Shell and the facts verified by independent third parties and regulatory agencies with oversight of the Calcasieu project.

“The company is currently evaluating all available options in response to the tribunal’s ruling and will continue to vigorously defend our position. Importantly, the award does not impact the terms of the SPA as entered into and presently performed by the parties, as evidenced by 14 cargos delivered to BP to date from the Calcasieu Project pursuant to the SPA.”

As the final award is expected to follow the damages portion of the hearing, the LNG player does not anticipate that the final award will be subject to the seller’s aggregate liability cap in the SPA, based on the terms of the award issued by the arbitration tribunal.

This follows the win the U.S. firm secured in the arbitration process with Shell over the delay in beginning full commercial operations at the same project.

In the aftermath of the positive decision in the arbitration with Shell, Venture Global Calcasieu Pass claims to have reached another resolution with a post-COD SPA customer related to the arbitration proceeding concerning the Calcasieu Pass facility.

“The settlement has no material impact on the company. This arbitration is now resolved in its entirety. The company remains committed to its long-term contractual relationships and looks forward to continuing to supply this customer with low-cost U.S. liquefied natural gas,” emphasized the U.S. player.

“Coal has been incredibly challenged in the New England market for over a decade,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.
Merrimack Station, a 438-megawatt power plant, came online in the 1960s and provided baseload power to the New England region for decades.
The closure ​“is emblematic of the transition that has been occurring in the generation fleet in New England for many years,” Dolan said.
The agreement included another commitment to shut down the company’s Schiller plant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, by the end of 2025; this smaller plant can burn coal but hasn’t done so since 2020.","“The end of coal is real, and it is here,” said Catherine Corkery, chapter director for Sierra Club New Hampshire. ​“We’re really excited about the next chapter.”

News of the closure came on the same day the Trump administration announced plans to resuscitate the coal sector by opening millions of acres of federal land to mining operations and investing $625 million in life-extending upgrades for coal plants. The administration had already released a blueprint for rolling back coal-related environmental regulations.

The announcement was the latest offensive in the administration’s pro-coal agenda. The federal government has twice extended the scheduled closure date of the coal-burning J.H. Campbell plant in Michigan, and U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has declared it a mission of the administration to keep coal plants open, saying the facilities are needed to ensure grid reliability and lower prices.

However, the closure in New Hampshire — so far undisputed by the federal government — demonstrates that prolonging operations at some facilities just doesn’t make economic sense for their owners.

“Coal has been incredibly challenged in the New England market for over a decade,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.

Merrimack Station, a 438-megawatt power plant, came online in the 1960s and provided baseload power to the New England region for decades. Gradually, though, natural gas — which is cheaper and more efficient — took over the regional market. In 2000, gas-fired plants generated less than 15% of the region’s electricity; last year, they produced more than half.

In recent years, Merrimack operated only a few weeks annually. In 2024, the plant generated just 0.22% of the region’s electricity. It wasn’t making enough money to justify continued operations, observers said.

The closure ​“is emblematic of the transition that has been occurring in the generation fleet in New England for many years,” Dolan said. ​“The combination of all those factors has meant that coal facilities are no longer economic in this market.”

Granite Shore Power, the plant’s owner, first announced its intention to shutter Merrimack in March 2024, following years of protests and legal wrangling by environmental advocates. The company pledged to cease coal-fired operations by 2028 to settle a lawsuit claiming that the facility was in violation of the federal Clean Water Act. The agreement included another commitment to shut down the company’s Schiller plant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, by the end of 2025; this smaller plant can burn coal but hasn’t done so since 2020.

At the time, the company outlined a proposal to repurpose the 400-acre Merrimack site, just outside Concord, for clean energy projects, taking advantage of existing electric infrastructure to connect a 120-megawatt combined solar and battery storage system to the grid.

It is not yet clear whether changes in federal renewable energy policies will affect this vision. In a statement announcing the Merrimack closure, Granite Shore Power was less specific about its plans than it had been, saying, ​“We continue to consider all opportunities for redevelopment” of the site, but declining to follow up with more detail.

Still, advocates are looking ahead with optimism.

“This is progress — there’s no doubt the math is there,” Corkery said. ​“It is never over until it is over, but I am very hopeful.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-91/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bowmerrimack-1024x7781760087085.jpg?h=7854dcef&itok=VicX6aPv,N,,2025-10-10 06:59:31.996296

While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) open enrollment period does not begin until November 1, Americans across the country are already seeing the consequences of Congress' failures to extend enhanced premium tax credits. Marketplace window shopping is open in several states, and premium sticker shock is already rattling households as they review their coverage options for 2026.

Contrary to House Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) claims that the expiring tax credits are ""an issue for the end of the year,"" consumers across the country are already confronting skyrocketing premiums and difficult choices about whether they can afford their health insurance. Several states are previewing 2026 premiums, insurers' renewal notices are imminent, and Americans with marketplace coverage are considering options now. Lawmakers must act immediately to keep people insured and preserve affordability by extending the enhanced premium tax credits.

The enhanced premium tax credit fight

The enhanced premium tax creditsfirst enacted under the American Rescue Plan and extended through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Actlower the cost of coverage for the more than 20 million Americans who receive financial help with marketplace plans. By increasing the generosity of subsidies and capping premiums at 8.5 percent of household income for those above the previous eligibility limit of 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), the enhanced tax credits made coverage more affordable for millions of low- and middle-income consumers. Notably, the changes enabled households with incomes from 100 to 150 percent of the FPL to obtain silver plan coverage for $0, which will no longer be the case if the enhanced subsidies expire.

Currently, the enhanced tax credits are set to expire on December 31, 2025, and congressional Republicans declined several opportunities to extend them as part of the Big Beautiful Bill that passed in July. Marketplace insurers priced 2026 plans expecting that the enhanced credits would end, and millions of Americans will face higher premium costs as a result. A KFF analysis found that if the enhanced tax credits expire, average premium costs would more than double for 20 million Americans; and the Center for American Progress previously estimated that average premium costs would spike by 300 percent in some states. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that letting the enhanced tax credits expire would increase the number of uninsured Americans by about 4 million by 2034.

2026 sticker shock is already here

To date, state-based marketplaces in Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Nevada, New York, and Virginia have opened their window-shopping tools for 2026. These tools allow consumers to preview plan options and premium prices before open enrollment begins on November 1. The early sticker shock offers a glimpse of what will soon become reality for millions more Americans with marketplace coverage, unless Congress acts to extend the enhanced tax credits.

Premium increases depend on individual household characteristics and plan selections, but examples using state marketplaces' window-shopping tools show how costs will rise for illustrative households who keep the same silver plan from 2025 to 2026:*

Virginia: A 51-year-old and 50-year-old couple from Roanoke with a household income of $85,000 would see their premium cost rise from $602 to $1,410 per montha 134 percent increase.

New York: A family of four in Rockland County with a household income of $105,000 would see their premium cost rise from $1,809 to $3,101 per montha 71 percent increase.

Nevada: A single 61-year-old in Las Vegas earning $68,000 would see their premium cost rise from $505 to $1,179 per montha 133 percent increase.

Elaine Buckberg leads the Driving Toward Seamless Public EV Charging project at Harvard University.","Concern about public charging is the number one reason people do not buy an electric vehicle.

If all charging providers reported their status live, drivers could easily navigate to working and available chargers.

The Tennessee General Assembly should require open real-time data.

Not long ago, when my husband and I moved from Detroit to Boston, we drove the 600 miles twice in electric vehicles. A short road trip by American standards turned into a frustrating validation of our range anxiety.

The reason: a lack of data.

While Tim concentrated on the highway, my job as passenger was to cross-reference charger apps. One app would plan a route with supposedly optimized charging stops, but it often didn’t tell me if the chargers were working. So I would try looking up each one on the charging provider’s proprietary websites − a time-consuming effort that would be dangerous for anyone driving solo.

This frustrating status quo is holding back EV sales and costing American jobs. Many charging providers do not share live data about their equipment − basic stuff, like whether it’s working or broken. This discourages prospective EV drivers: Concern about public charging is the number one reason people do not buy an EV, according to J.D. Power surveys. Publishing this data is a way to spur EV adoption.

State can require sharing of real-time charging data

Tennessee can lead the way with a straightforward fix − and it will cost the state next to nothing.

If all chargers reported their status live so that any mapping app could include this basic information, drivers could easily navigate to working and available chargers. Were this data available, the chargers’ status would appear in your favorite map app, much like Google Maps shows if a restaurant is open. That would go a long way toward eliminating range anxiety.

Moreover, by shining a light on broken chargers, operators will fix them faster, enabling EV drivers to trust what their phones tell them.

My team’s research estimates that making real-time data universal for highway fast chargers would raise the EV share of new vehicle sales by 6 percentage points in 2030 − to about 46% − under current policies. As a result, there would be 3.5 million more EVs on the road by 2030.

Opening data will help Ford and VW keep hiring in Tennessee

That means jobs, including in Tennessee. Ford’s BlueOval City plant in Stanton is scheduled to begin making batteries this year and EVs in 2027, employing 6,000 Tennesseans. Volkswagen builds EVs in Chattanooga, where it employs 6,000 workers. When Congress ended EV tax rebates with the One Big Beautiful Bill, it threatened those jobs. Open data, by increasing EV adoption, will help Ford and VW keep hiring.

Charging operators may object, saying that their data is available in their proprietary apps, has commercial value, and they don’t want to provide too much information to their competitors.

Yet those very operators would benefit if this data helped the EV market take off faster. With 3.5 million more EVs on the road in 2030, operators will enjoy a market that is 9% larger. That means more charging sessions, enabling them to pay off their investments faster.

If charging providers don’t start voluntarily posting the real-time status of their fast chargers, the Tennessee General Assembly should require open real-time data. Massachusetts has done so, and the California Electricity Commission is proposing the same.

My team and I have just published model legislation that can help Tennessee adopt such common-sense policies.

Making a road trip in an EV shouldn’t be hard. And it doesn’t have to be. If charging providers open access to their data, expect to see many more EVs on the road.

“Coal has been incredibly challenged in the New England market for over a decade,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.
Merrimack Station, a 438-megawatt power plant, came online in the 1960s and provided baseload power to the New England region for decades.
The closure ​“is emblematic of the transition that has been occurring in the generation fleet in New England for many years,” Dolan said.
The agreement included another commitment to shut down the company’s Schiller plant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, by the end of 2025; this smaller plant can burn coal but hasn’t done so since 2020.","“The end of coal is real, and it is here,” said Catherine Corkery, chapter director for Sierra Club New Hampshire. ​“We’re really excited about the next chapter.”

News of the closure came on the same day the Trump administration announced plans to resuscitate the coal sector by opening millions of acres of federal land to mining operations and investing $625 million in life-extending upgrades for coal plants. The administration had already released a blueprint for rolling back coal-related environmental regulations.

The announcement was the latest offensive in the administration’s pro-coal agenda. The federal government has twice extended the scheduled closure date of the coal-burning J.H. Campbell plant in Michigan, and U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has declared it a mission of the administration to keep coal plants open, saying the facilities are needed to ensure grid reliability and lower prices.

However, the closure in New Hampshire — so far undisputed by the federal government — demonstrates that prolonging operations at some facilities just doesn’t make economic sense for their owners.

“Coal has been incredibly challenged in the New England market for over a decade,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.

Merrimack Station, a 438-megawatt power plant, came online in the 1960s and provided baseload power to the New England region for decades. Gradually, though, natural gas — which is cheaper and more efficient — took over the regional market. In 2000, gas-fired plants generated less than 15% of the region’s electricity; last year, they produced more than half.

In recent years, Merrimack operated only a few weeks annually. In 2024, the plant generated just 0.22% of the region’s electricity. It wasn’t making enough money to justify continued operations, observers said.

The closure ​“is emblematic of the transition that has been occurring in the generation fleet in New England for many years,” Dolan said. ​“The combination of all those factors has meant that coal facilities are no longer economic in this market.”

Granite Shore Power, the plant’s owner, first announced its intention to shutter Merrimack in March 2024, following years of protests and legal wrangling by environmental advocates. The company pledged to cease coal-fired operations by 2028 to settle a lawsuit claiming that the facility was in violation of the federal Clean Water Act. The agreement included another commitment to shut down the company’s Schiller plant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, by the end of 2025; this smaller plant can burn coal but hasn’t done so since 2020.

At the time, the company outlined a proposal to repurpose the 400-acre Merrimack site, just outside Concord, for clean energy projects, taking advantage of existing electric infrastructure to connect a 120-megawatt combined solar and battery storage system to the grid.

It is not yet clear whether changes in federal renewable energy policies will affect this vision. In a statement announcing the Merrimack closure, Granite Shore Power was less specific about its plans than it had been, saying, ​“We continue to consider all opportunities for redevelopment” of the site, but declining to follow up with more detail.

Still, advocates are looking ahead with optimism.

“This is progress — there’s no doubt the math is there,” Corkery said. ​“It is never over until it is over, but I am very hopeful.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bowmerrimack-2048x1556.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 06:59:37.390321

Landry wants to give hundreds of millions of dollars to a company that promises jobs it may not deliver.","$600 million. That’s the price tag on Gov. Jeff Landry’s massive taxpayer-funded incentive package to lure multinational corporations to our state.

While details are unclear, and we the people were not treated to public disclosure of the spending, this eyewatering giveaway is reported to be one of the largest publicly funded enticements for a single project in our state’s history. This despite the fact that Hyundai Steel — one of the intended corporate beneficiaries — reported nearly $86 billion in profits last year. Hardly the sort of shop that needs an influx of cash from the taxpayers of America’s poorest state.

As usual, Landry trotted out the same old rationale to justify sending taxpayers’ money to giant corporations: A big government giveaway would “create jobs.” Since announcing the project from the White House in March of this year, he has been all over our state touting it as if luring mega-polluters to Louisiana was a new idea with economic promise.

Recently, the whole world learned the truth.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in Ellabell, Georgia, where Hyundai has been building an electric vehicle plant, resulted in the arrest of 475 people. More than 300 were South Korean nationals who had been brought in by the company. So much for “job creation” for our communities.

Louisiana is about to see history repeat itself. Only this time, we don’t need to look back any further than when the raid happened. Hyundai has already shown us how it operates in Georgia, and there is no indication that things will be any different here in Louisiana. Landry wants to give hundreds of millions of dollars to a company that promises jobs it may not deliver.

Let’s be clear. Despite the news about Hyundai’s hiring of its own people, our governor is still ready to roll out the red carpet. He has not uttered a word since the raid revealed the truth about employment at Hyundai. Louisiana cannot afford another company that sells us a dream of prosperity while leaving us with pollution and broken promises.

In Georgia, construction of the plant was not even complete and already the company was bringing in labor from overseas. We can expect the same in Ascension Parish.

We hear the same story every time a corporation wants to build here in Louisiana, whether it’s a plastics plant, a pipeline or an ammonia facility. The only things discussed are the so-called benefits, while the costs — more wasted tax dollars, more pollution, more sickness — are never mentioned.

Just think of all the ways our taxpayer funds could be reinvested here at home, creating jobs and raising the quality of life for all Louisiana residents. Our state ranks 46th in opportunity, 48th in infrastructure and 50th in economics overall, according to U.S. News and World report. With $600 million in investment, we could build the infrastructure and provide the influx of working capital that entrepreneurs need to make it here in Louisiana and create jobs all along the way. From education and the arts to professional services, health care and more, there are so many services Louisiana residents need. Each presents an opportunity for growth.

If we want that future, we have to make it. We must stand up and pay attention right now. We cannot let the news releases, ribbon-cuttings and positive coverage fool us. We will always be promised new jobs and quick returns on investment when our hard-earned money is sent to another corporate interest, but we can’t let that distract us from the reality that our money will be sunk into someone else’s project. They’ll keep the profits. We’ll be left with the mess.

So what can we do? That part is simple. We can call on Landry to end this wasteful spending today. He needs to hear from every Louisiana taxpayer at his Baton Rouge mansion. Our message is simple common sense: If you have $600 million to spend on economic development, spend it on the Louisiana businesses that commit to staying in our state and creating real jobs for Louisiana residents.

We’re not asking for much.

POLITICO: Johnson unaware his district risks losing $500M for carbon removal

Republican lawmakers from Louisiana and Texas on Wednesday shrugged off news reports that their states could together lose $1 billion in federal funds for megaprojects that could suck carbon dioxide from the sky.

Two direct air capture hubs being planned for the Gulf Coast of Texas and western Louisiana would be capable of removing 1 million metric tons of climate pollution from the atmosphere annually and storing it underground.

That’s the equivalent to the annual emissions of nearly three gas-fired power plants, according to EPA data, and would make the hubs the largest carbon removal projects on the planet.

The hubs were funded through a $3.5 billion direct air capture program created by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and are being developed by Occidental Petroleum and a consortium led by the scientific nonprofit Battelle.

The fate of the projects was thrown into doubt on Tuesday when their awards were included in an unconfirmed Department of Energy cancellation list that made the rounds in Congress and on K Street.

But the leaked document appears to have not made it to the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson, whose economically challenged Louisiana congressional district would be home to Battelle’s Project Cypress.

“I haven’t seen it yet,” he told POLITICO’s E&E News when asked about the list of proposed DOE funding cuts. Johnson added that he hadn’t spoken to Energy Secretary Chris Wright about the status of the hub award…

Johnson’s response echoed his comments in May, when the president’s budget request first called for zeroing out “Green New Scam funds committed to … removing carbon dioxide from the air.” Four days after the White House released that proposal, Johnson told E&E News that “I haven’t had a chance to look at that yet, so I can’t comment on it.”

The median household income of Johnson’s district was just over $59,176 in 2023, according to the Census Bureau. That was more than 26 percent below the national average of $80,610.

Across the Capitol, Texas Sen. John Cornyn (R) also told E&E News he had not seen the list.

“We can talk after I look at it,” said Cornyn, who is running for reelection against more conservative primary challengers.

The rumored cancellations come more than a week into a funding fight that has shuttered vast swaths of the federal government. The Trump administration confirmed plans to cancel nearly $7.6 billion of clean energy projects, including almost half of DOE’s other direct air capture hub awards.

Direct air capture plants generally use carbon-absorbing materials, fans, electricity, heat, and piping to pull carbon dioxide from the sky and store it permanently underground.

To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists have determined that the world would need to deploy direct air capture and other carbon removal technologies at a massive scale by mid-century while also slashing the use of oil, gas and coal.",https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Meta-Image_Climate-Power.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 11:00:42.811917

It addresses concerns legislators have expressed that existing generators will sell output to data centers, making that generation unavailable to other customers and adds new regulatory steps for developing data centers in most of Texas.","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a law in June that empowers the state’s grid operator to remotely disconnect data centers and other large energy users if the grid is under extreme stress. The so-called “kill switch” is just one aspect of the wide-ranging state legislation meant to govern the growing number of energy-intensive supercomputer warehouses being planned and built out across the state.

The legislation comes as Texas, like other states across the country, tries to balance remaining an attractive place to do business for the booming data center industry while addressing the challenges that come with the huge amounts of electricity the facilities demand, especially when grid capacity has been maxed out by extreme summer heat or freezing winter storms.

Much of the legislation around energy and the grid in recent years has aimed to prevent a rerun of Winter Storm Uri in 2021. During the dayslong freeze, millions of households went without power and at least 246 people died, while some industrial sites’ lights stayed on.

The new law, Senate Bill 6, which currently applies to electricity customers using at least 75 megawatts—equivalent to a medium-sized power plant—aims to shift transmission costs to the large load users, so upgrades and new connection costs aren’t paid through residential and small commercial customer rates.

The legislation also looks to establish grid reliability protection measures and add credibility to electricity demand forecasting.

As with other aspects of Senate Bill 6, the Public Utility of Commission of Texas (PUC), the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and other stakeholders are still working out how the new responsibilities and rules around data centers will be implemented. Public comment periods for stakeholders on S.B. 6 rulemaking close this month.

Both the energy and data center industries are expected to participate in and follow the rulemaking closely, as the two sectors have grown accustomed to the free trade of energy with few state-imposed restrictions.

As the bill made its way through the legislative process, both industries warned that the new oversight measures, requirements to shoulder costs relating to grid reliability and disclose private power deals, could discourage business in Texas.

Attorneys for Crusoe Energy Systems, the artificial intelligence infrastructure company behind the massive Stargate Project in Abilene, said in a state filing that it would be unfair for ERCOT to introduce another approval requirement for private power agreements between Stargate’s users and its power suppliers when they had no time to plan for it. It would subject project developers who have invested billions and have obligations to meet certain timelines to a 180-day delay, the attorneys wrote. The Stargate proposal, involving OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, is set to become the largest data center project in the world.

Crusoe’s attorneys are also seeking a definition of a new large load user from the PUC — asking whether those already in the interconnection queue with planned co-located generation will be subject to the new rules.

The large load interconnection queue faced by ERCOT, Texas’ power grid, is now dominated by data centers, according to data from ERCOT’s latest system planning and weatherization update. Compared to September 2024, ERCOT is now tracking more than three times as many large load interconnections, with nearly 69 percent of 189 gigawatts of large load requests coming from data centers. By contrast, in May 2024, non-cryptocurrency data centers made up less than half of the large power demand requests.

The large load requests in the ERCOT queue—189 gigawatts—equal about 40 percent of the nation’s estimated electricity consumption for 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

With such eye-popping growth, there’s been suspicion that the figures are artificially high. A possible explanation for why that is: Grid operators and utilities have complained that developers are pitching duplicative interconnection requests to multiple sites in or outside of Texas as they wait to see where a green light first appears for developments that may never materialize. This complicates load forecasting and infrastructure planning.

Also, a 2023 law change required ERCOT to include all prospective large-scale power users in demand projections without fully vetting each project. Before that, ERCOT did not count projects in early stages of development until specific financial commitments were made.

S.B. 6 seeks to address unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing proof of financial commitments, including an interconnection studies fee of at least $100,000 and proof that a developer actually controls a proposed site.

But trying to nail down numbers about how much investment is required to be considered in grid planning will be tough, said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant.

“What demonstrates significant commitment?” Lewin asked. “That’s a huge question.”

One firm, Schaper Energy Consulting, whose clients account for more than nine gigawatts of large load projects in ERCOT, suggested in a comment filed to the PUC that the interconnection study fee should be between $150,000 and $300,000, site control be either ownership, an executed lease or an exclusive option to purchase or lease the land, and an interim security requirement of $3,000 per megawatt of requested capacity.

For Woody Rickerson, chief operating officer of ERCOT, the new rules outlined in S.B. 6 are exemplary of why Texas is an opportune place for the growth of data centers, particularly those servicing artificial intelligence. Grid operators and regulators want to move quickly, he said at a data center industry conference in San Antonio on Sept. 30.

Rickerson said in recent years, they’ve proven they can transform the grid through the widespread adoption of renewable energy in ERCOT. The state’s independent grid now hosts more solar, wind and batteries than any other state in the country, with operators saying it can grant customers access to large amounts of power without the bureaucracy other grids face.

“We can change. We can adapt,” Rickerson said. “We can put new processes in place more quickly.”

The PUC staff expects to complete rulemaking on various portions of the law’s implementation, such as private agreements between power plants and data centers and what constitutes a significant financial commitment to enter ERCOT’s large load interconnection queue, throughout this year and 2026. Those new rules would determine when and how the grid operator would cut off power to data centers in an emergency and how to manage costs for grid infrastructure upgrades.

S.B. 6 requires the PUC to consider whether its ratemaking practices, in place for more than two decades, are recovering transmission costs from the appropriate customers.

The current system largely incentivizes big customers to save energy during four 15-minute periods each year when capacity on the grid is tight. The amount of electricity they use during these four instances is used to calculate their bill for the following year.

While this method benefits large load users, including San Antonio’s CPS Energy, one of the nation’s largest city-owned utility companies, it exposes the utility’s residential customers to higher net costs and is less fair, attorneys for CPS Energy submitted to the PUC.

The Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance cautioned the commission from shifting costs onto power generators. ERCOT has never asked generators to pay for transmission upgrades, a senior principal at the business alliance wrote, and doing so would undermine the “friendly” interconnection process for the worse, and delay investments in new power plants in Texas.

Rulemaking on this contentious part of the law is expected to continue until December 2026. Utility commission staff weighed in at a September meeting on whether limiting such considerations to customers using 75 megawatts or more is a good idea. The law gives the PUC authority to lower the threshold if the commissioners see fit.

Some analysts asked whether adopting the 75 megawatt standard would inadvertently create a gap and simultaneously incentivize loads to develop just below that threshold to avoid meeting financial obligations. Jessie Horn, an attorney for the PUC, said the staff suggested eliciting comments from projects above 25 megawatts might be the right number to get comprehensive feedback from across the industry regarding the rulemaking of S.B. 6.

But given that comment deadlines with stakeholders are due this month, the expectation for the initial year is to use the 75 megawatt threshold and revisit the figure later. PUC Chairman Thomas Gleeson said he’s most comfortable with the 75 megawatt threshold until the rulemaking is finalized, meaning only customers who need that much power or more would be subject to disconnection during extreme weather.

ERCOT can instruct utilities and large load customers to curtail operations or switch to on-site backup generators during an energy emergency when the grid is trying to shed demand. S.B. 6 also empowers ERCOT to install technology or necessary equipment to curtail the load before non-critical customers, such as data centers, are interconnected to the grid.

An industrial customer applies for and is awarded a “critical” classification when an interruption of their electric service would create a dangerous or life-threatening condition at their site.

Data center developers and industry members lobbied during the legislative session to make the kill-switch concept more palatable for facility operators by requiring a 24-hour notice before ERCOT could turn off their grid power. The PUC plans to have a proposal on how to implement this part of the rule in February.

S.B. 6 could address some of the issues ERCOT and its users encountered during Winter Storm Uri, said Chris Crosby, the CEO of Compass Datacenters, a design and construction firm for huge, “hyperscale” data centers and cloud providers. The legislation formalizes planned emergency events on the grid and addresses critical scenarios that may span a few hours each year, he said.

While Crosby sees the new legislation as positive, he knows that data center developers across the industry have mixed opinions about S.B. 6., including the Data Center Coalition, the industry’s leading lobbying group.

“While the final product did not fully address all our key concerns, the Data Center Coalition is appreciative that changes made to Senate Bill 6 during the legislative process intend to balance the need to support economic development with efforts to ensure the continued stability of the Texas electricity grid,” said Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, in a statement to Inside Climate News.

The industry group plans to continue working with regulators and grid operators to ensure S.B. 6 is properly implemented and outlines efficient processes, Diorio said. There’s still concern about the uncertainty S.B. 6 imposes on projects already in the pipeline in Texas and on data centers that host digital infrastructure for health care, emergency services, security and banking, which could be disconnected.

Crusoe Energy Systems, the artificial intelligence infrastructure system company behind the massive Stargate Project in Abilene, submitted a comment to the PUC seeking a definition of a new large load user, and asking whether those already in the interconnection queue with planned co-located generation will be subject to the new rules. The Stargate proposal, involving OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, would become the largest data center project in the world.

Attorneys for Crusoe Energy Systems Inc. said in a state filing that it would be unfair for ERCOT to introduce another approval requirement for private power agreements between Stargate’s users and its power suppliers when they had no opportunity to plan for it. It would subject project developers who have invested billions and have obligations to meet certain timelines to a 180-day delay, the attorneys wrote.

The legislation also creates new rules around co-located power generation at data center sites. Large load users often look to locate their projects near a power plant or develop their own gas-fired plants to lower transmission costs and secure a dedicated power supply.

There had been prior thinking that emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar and battery growth would power this new generation of digital infrastructure. But that vision isn’t panning out as speed and around-the-clock, dispatchable power take precedence. As developers rush to get online and ensure power reliability beyond the grid, concerns about powering data centers with renewable energy to reduce their carbon footprints have fallen in priority.

Under S.B. 6, any new, private agreement between an existing standalone power plant connected to the grid and a new large load customer of 75 megawatts or more, must notify ERCOT and undergo a study and obtain PUC approval. The grid operator has 120 days to evaluate the grid impacts and submit the study to the PUC, along with any recommendations. Then the regulatory agency has 60 days to impose conditions on the agreement as necessary to maintain grid reliability and transmission security.

Those conditions could require that, during certain events, data centers with behind-the-meter power would have to reduce load or the generator must make capacity available to ERCOT. It also makes them responsible for stranded transmission assets, or powerlines or substations, that age out earlier than expected or become financially unviable due to customers generating their own power onsite.

Notably, it doesn’t include power plants that were co-located with a large load user at the time they were connected to ERCOT or if the customer is a majority owner of the generating plant. It’s intended to address concerns that data centers are effectively taking capacity from ERCOT through these private agreements.

According to the law, the PUC must require that any dispatchable capacity the power plants sold to ERCOT prior to entering an agreement with a large load user must be made available to ERCOT before an anticipated emergency.

It addresses concerns legislators have expressed that existing generators will sell output to data centers, making that generation unavailable to other customers and adds new regulatory steps for developing data centers in most of Texas.

Maria Faconti, a partner at K&L Gates’ power practice group, said the rulemaking around this aspect of S.B. 6 is top of mind for her clients. Faconti, who works with clients across the energy industry to navigate ERCOT’s regulatory environment, said she’s advised them to submit comments to the PUC.

“I’ve encouraged them to participate, to make sure that, not only are their voices heard, but that how they thought S.B. 6 would be implemented is actually how it ends up being implemented,” Faconti said.

In a submitted comment, Brock Petersen, the chief operating officer of Satoshi Energy, a data center and renewable energy developer, echoed the same concern about the unclear definition of a new large load user. Peterson also wrote that the rules for private power agreements between data center users and developers would disrupt project timelines and compromise investments made under the assumption of regulatory clarity.

With increased demand for electricity driven by larger loads over the past few years, Faconti and her clients knew regulation was inevitable. Before S.B. 6 passed, there were concerns about what the regulatory landscape would look like in a few years. Now, her clients, and their investors, have some clarity.

“I don’t think S.B. 6 has slowed development in Texas by any means,” Faconti said. “Good or bad, S.B. 6 has created some sort of parameters.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TexasEnergy-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 04:59:23.498802

Following a September 9 Montreal, Quebec bus fire, similar sentiment spread on social media and in blog posts evoking prior fires in the same electric models to denounce low-emission goals and accuse Canada's leaders of failing to prioritize ""children's safety.""

As part of a push to fortify low-emissions manufacturing in Canada, Quebec province pledged millions of dollars to electrify its school bus fleet in 2022, giving preference to local company Lion Electric.

After the most recent fire, Quebec temporarily pulled 1,200 of the manufacturer's buses from service.

Lion Electric said in a September 12 statement that it was working with Transport Canada to determine the exact cause but confirmed ""neither the electric battery nor the propulsion system was involved"" (archived here).

The company also said the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec approved its plan to return its electric school buses to service.

Transport Canada said in a September 19 statement that a safety defect in the LionC model had not been identified yet ""due to the extent of fire damage in affected buses"" but that the focus is on issues with the low-voltage heating system (archived here).

Montreal fire department spokesman Guy Lapointe told AFP on October 8 that the September 9 fire did not involve the electric bus's battery.

Valerie Tremblay (archived here), sustainable mobility lead for climate non-profit Green Communities Canada, told AFP September 23 that ""electric bus fire incidents deserve attention, but they are rare.""

She said most of the fires seen in the past year were linked either to the HVAC wiring or the heating and defrosting system, components she said operate similarly across electric and traditional combustion buses.

While batteries can malfunction and cause fires, she said electric vehicles were not more at risk than those using diesel and gas, which can also be flammable.

Different challenges

Kate Whitefoot, a mechanical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University (archived here), cautioned that she had not seen enough evidence to establish that electric vehicles were safer than gas-powered ones, but said she was confident in them having at least similar rates of fire risk.

""And that looks the same across all types of vehicles. So including buses, as well as passenger vehicles,"" she told AFP on September 24, referencing multiple investigations.

AFP located a Chinese study which found electric car fire incidents to be comparable or lower to those in traditional gas-powered vehicles (archived here).

A paper from Sweden also reported a minuscule percentage of the country's electric fleet caught fire between 2018 and 2024, lower than the numbers reported in other types of vehicles (archived here).

The company AutoinsuranceEZ similarly analyzed recall statistics and data from the American National Transportation Safety Board, finding that 25 electric vehicle fires occurred for 100,000 automobiles sold. Meanwhile, hybrid- and gas-powered vehicles burned at rates of 3,475 and 1,530 per 100,000 sales, respectively (archived here).

The National Fire Protection Association, a US-based non-profit, also reports ""there are fewer electric vehicle fires"" but that more research is needed to understand the fire safety challenges unique to electric vehicles (archived here).

Most electric vehicles, including buses, are powered by lithium-ion batteries.

When fires occur, the batteries can enter a state known as thermal runaway (archived here), where the cells overheat. Blazes with a chemical origin can burn much more intensely and be more difficult to put out.

In the case of traditional gas-powered vehicles however, Whitefoot said the risk for conflagration comes into play with the flammable fuel used to power the engine.

The Bolt is set for a limited model run in 2026 and according to GM Chief Sustainability Officer Cassandra Garber it is “better than ever”.

The re-release of a popular model points to a strategic manufacturing decision by General Motors to leverage an established product line.

Cassandra says: “To all my sustainability friends who love the Chevy Bolt and have been asking when the next one’s coming — THIS. IS. IT!”

Following a test drive at GM headquarters Cassandra adds: “I had the chance to drive the new Bolt recently at GM headquarters, thanks to my friend Mandi Damman (officially Executive Chief Engineer, but forever the Bolt Queen). “And I can confirm: it’s everything you already love about the Bolt – with some new reasons to fall in love again (or for the first time).”

Scaling production for market accessibility

This announcement arrives as General Motors experiences a period of rapid growth within the US EV market.

Research found that the car manufacturer is on the verge of challenging Tesla’s market share in the US. The reintroduction of the Bolt alongside the Equinox EV could be seen as a strategic manufacturing move to secure a larger portion of the affordable EV segment by increasing production volume.

According to GM the Bolt will offer the longest range in an EV under US$30,000. “Bolt joins the Chevrolet Equinox EV, currently one of the market’s best-selling EVs, solidifying Chevy's position in the affordable EV segment,” GM says.

“Together, Bolt and Equinox EV are expected to account for most of Chevrolet’s 2026 EV volume.”

Cassandra states this production strategy makes EV ownership more attainable. “With the Bolt joining the Equinox EV, one of the market’s best-selling EVs, GM is helping make electric driving truly accessible,” she explains.

Chevrolet's role in an electric manufacturing future

The decision to restart Bolt production was heavily influenced by consumer feedback, directly impacting manufacturing priorities.

Scott Bell, VP, Global Chevrolet, says: “The Chevrolet Bolt was the industry’s first affordable mass-market, long-range EV and it commanded one of GM’s most loyal customer bases thanks to its price, versatility and practicality.

“After production ended, we heard our customer’s feedback and their love for this product. “So the Bolt is coming back – by popular demand and better than ever – for a limited time.”

Chevrolet: a potted history

Founded in 1911 Chevrolet has been a cornerstone of General Motors' manufacturing operations. Headquartered in Detroit Michigan the brand has produced a wide range of vehicles.

Under the leadership of General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Chevrolet is now key in the corporation's strategic transition to an all-electric manufacturing future. This pivot is demonstrated by an EV portfolio that includes the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV as well as upcoming models like the Silverado EV and Blazer EV.

""Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today,"" a spokesperson told Reuters. Currently, the American automaker’s lending arm, Ford Credit, offers 0% financing for 72 months on new EVs, as well as other incentives, according to the company’s spokesperson.

Earlier this week, GM backed out of a similar solution. It initially wanted to pass on the discount to consumers “at participant dealers, while supplies last,” according to a company spokesperson who confirmed the program last month for InsideEVs. After dropping the support scheme, GM said it will self-fund the lease incentives until the end of October.

Both Ford and General Motors came up with their strategies after discussions with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as reported by Reuters.

GM dropped its program after U.S. Senator Bernie Moreno, who has a luxury car dealership empire in Ohio, sent a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent condemning the actions of “certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer.” It’s unclear why Ford canceled its program.

The American EV market is expected to take a big hit after the Trump administration pulled the plug on the $7,500 federal tax credit at the end of last month. Ford CEO Jim Farley said he wouldn’t be surprised if the EV market share goes down from the current level of roughly 10-to-12% to just 5%.

The American Nuclear Society fully supports environmental cleanup of former Manhattan Project nuclear sites as a cornerstone strategy for establishing U.S. energy dominance.
Environmental cleanup of legacy nuclear sites offers the industry its most powerful tool for rapid, cost-effective capacity expansion.","Eighty years after the Trinity Test launched the nuclear age, America is at the precipice of another pivotal moment. As artificial intelligence drives unprecedented energy demands and accelerates the commercial nuclear renaissance, our industry faces a critical question: How do we rapidly deploy the clean-energy capacity our nation needs?

The answer lies not in greenfield development alone but in completing the nuclear cleanup at our legacy sites to position them for reindustrialization. Environmental cleanup of former nuclear facilities isn’t just about addressing the past—it’s about unlocking the future of American energy dominance.

The Oak Ridge model: Cleanup as an economic strategy

The transformation of Oak Ridge’s East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) embodies this principle. The K-25 uranium enrichment facility—once the world’s largest building, spanning 44 acres—became a contaminated liability after operations ceased in 1985. For decades, five massive gaseous diffusion facilities (~100 acres under roof) and hundreds of support structures stood as monuments to environmental challenges and cleanup costs.

United Cleanup Oak Ridge, an Amentum-led environmental cleanup leader working for the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management, tackled the world’s largest environmental cleanup project. Completing this first-ever cleanup of a uranium enrichment complex four years ahead of schedule and $80 million under budget, UCOR achieved something remarkable: the first Manhattan Project “secret city” to fully close its nuclear life-cycle and open the next chapter of advanced nuclear energy and material production.

The economic results speak volumes: ETTP has attracted billions in investment, created hundreds of new jobs, and now hosts dozens of thriving businesses. Most significantly, it has become the home of next-generation nuclear companies including Kairos Power, Orano USA, and X-energy.

At the site that once enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, Kairos Power’s Hermes low-power demonstration reactor is now under construction—the first non–light water reactor permitted in the United States in more than 50 years.

The Tennessee Valley Authority recently signed an agreement to purchase power from Kairos’s Hermes 2 reactor that will also be constructed at ETTP, becoming the first utility to agree to buy power from an advanced reactor. This collaboration, which will deliver 50 MW of reliable 24/7 energy to the TVA grid, will bolster the country’s leadership in advanced nuclear energy.

Adding to the growing momentum, in what state officials say is the largest private investment in Tennessee history, Orano USA’s construction of a $6 billion state-of-the-art uranium enrichment plant in Oak Ridge will help meet future needs for reactor fuel. That facility will be built on 800 acres of federal property, and UCOR has partnered with the state of Tennessee to expedite the land transfer to Orano USA.

Strategic advantages of legacy site redevelopment

In a recent visit to Oak Ridge, Wright defined “Manhattan Project 2.0” as a symbiotic relationship between nuclear energy and AI. In this global race for technological supremacy, legacy nuclear sites offer unique strategic advantages that new, undeveloped locations cannot match.

First, these communities understand nuclear. Host communities that served the nation 80 years ago bring institutional knowledge, workforce expertise, and cultural acceptance that would take decades to develop elsewhere. Oak Ridge’s workforce didn’t just adapt to new nuclear technologies, it embraced them, understanding the national security and economic benefits these projects deliver.

Second, infrastructure matters. Legacy sites retain critical infrastructure elements: electrical grid connections, transportation networks, security systems, and regulatory frameworks developed specifically for nuclear operations. This existing foundation dramatically reduces development timelines and costs, compared with greenfield projects.

Third, environmental cleanup creates immediate dual benefits. Every dollar spent on remediation reduces long-term liability to the American taxpayer while creating developable land. Rather than viewing cleanup as pure cost, the industry should recognize it as investment in future capacity. The Oak Ridge model created by UCOR demonstrates how environmental restoration becomes economic development, turning liability into opportunity.

National security imperatives

America’s leadership in nuclear energy directly correlates to our technological and economic security. China continues with its aggressive nuclear deployment while we debate permitting processes. Russia leverages nuclear exports for geopolitical influence while our legacy sites remain underutilized. The window for maintaining American nuclear leadership is narrowing.

Accelerating cleanup at sites like Hanford, Savannah River, Idaho, Portsmouth, and Paducah isn’t just environmental stewardship—it’s strategic necessity. These locations represent billions of dollars in stranded nuclear infrastructure and expertise. While we invest years in developing new sites, our competitors advance their nuclear capabilities on existing foundations.

The AI boom intensifies this urgency. AI data centers require massive, reliable baseload power that only nuclear energy can provide carbon-free. Tech companies are already partnering with nuclear developers, but project timelines remain the critical constraint. Legacy sites offer the fastest path to deployment, provided we complete necessary environmental work.

The American Nuclear Society fully supports environmental cleanup of former Manhattan Project nuclear sites as a cornerstone strategy for establishing U.S. energy dominance. This position reflects not only environmental responsibility but recognition that these cleanup efforts are essential investments in America’s nuclear future and competitive position in the global energy landscape. As Piercy accurately pointed out in his article, ANS has remained committed to advancing nuclear science and technology for the betterment of humanity.

Industry leaders should champion the Oak Ridge cleanup model nationwide. Other DOE sites from Washington state to South Carolina represent enormous untapped potential for nuclear deployment. Each successful cleanup creates jobs, attracts investment, and demonstrates nuclear energy’s positive community impact.

The nuclear renaissance won’t be built on good intentions alone. It requires practical solutions to real deployment challenges. Environmental cleanup of legacy nuclear sites offers the industry its most powerful tool for rapid, cost-effective capacity expansion.

Oak Ridge transformed from contaminated liability to nuclear innovation hub through bold vision and committed execution by the UCOR workforce. As Wright noted, we’re in a race. The communities that answered the call 80 years ago stand ready to serve again. The question is whether we’ll give them the tools—through accelerated cleanup and strategic investment—to help America win Manhattan Project 2.0.

The future of nuclear energy isn’t just about new technologies. It’s about completing the cleanup of our legacy sites, turning today’s challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities. In Oak Ridge, we delivered on the vision UCOR has termed “Cleanup Today for a Nuclear Tomorrow.” Across America, our industry can flourish in the same way.

Solar PV projects with capacities ranging from 50 kW AC to 3 MW AC will be evaluated as distributed solar, separate from those facilities with more than 3 MW AC capacity that will be treated as utility-scale projects.

The power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed will provide Dominion Energy with exclusive rights to 100% of the output from selected facilities. For renewable energy projects, the PPA contract term will be 20 years, while renewable plus storage and standalone storage facilities will be contracted for 15 years.

The company is inviting proposals for up to 100 MW AC of distributed solar, 1 GW of large-scale solar and onshore wind, and 500 MW of energy storage projects.

All selected facilities will be required to come online by December 31, 2029, at the latest. The utility said it may accept PPAs where the interconnection schedule makes a 2029 COD unattainable.

Launched on October 8, 2025, the tender will be open to proposals till February 9, 2026.

They say the Trump administration‘s termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program’s termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,” formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump’s assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/10/Solar.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:09:37.538773

The company’s valuation now stands at $4 billion after receiving the new investment, Base Power founder and CEO Zach Dell said.
And Dell is scoping out other geographical markets where the rules could allow the Base Power model to grow.
Now Base Power employs 250 people and installs double that rate.
Base Power is already finalizing a location for a ​“much, much larger” facility outside Austin to continue growing its manufacturing capacity.","Investment in cleantech startups is tracking toward the lowest level in years. But Base Power shrugged off the market trends and just raised $1 billion to turbocharge its home battery buildout.

The colossal Series C funding round comes only six months after it raised $200 million in an April Series B. Addition led the latest round, which brought back all previous investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Valor Equity Partners. The company’s valuation now stands at $4 billion after receiving the new investment, Base Power founder and CEO Zach Dell said.

The pace and scale of those investments put the Austin, Texas–based firm in a league of its own among clean energy startups this year — beating out even the outlandish $863 million that Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised in August. Dell says his company’s traction comes down to a very clear value proposition: It’s potentially the fastest way to expand on-demand grid power at a time when everyone wants more of it.

“Right now, we’re in a capacity crunch — everyone needs capacity,” Dell said. ​“We install capacity faster and cheaper than really anyone out there.”

The U.S. is going through the fastest electricity demand growth in decades, as AI data centers proliferate, more factories open up, and customers purchase electric vehicles. Utilities have long maintained a skeptical stance toward startups’ plans to turn home energy devices into substantial forces on the grid; now, Dell said, they’re not just willing but ​“more excited than ever” to have that conversation.

The key to Base Power’s model is finding households in Texas who want cheap electricity with the benefit of backup power. The company becomes their retail power provider and installs one or two unusually large batteries on-site. Base owns the batteries, and the customers pay an installation fee starting at $695 and a small monthly rate instead of purchasing them for many thousands of dollars. Then the startup aggregates this dispersed fleet of batteries to essentially create miniature power plants it can profit from in the state’s competitive energy market.

The batteries earn money through simple arbitrage: They charge up when wind or solar production pushes prices down and then discharge when demand and prices spike. Base Power also earned certification to deliver ancillary services, which are rapid-fire adjustments to maintain grid reliability, for which batteries are uniquely suited. The company has already maxed out the 20 megawatts it can bid through the Aggregate Distributed Energy Resource pilot, a virtual power plant program, and is pushing for the cap to be raised, Dell said.

Base Power has begun selling its services to regulated utilities so that they can help their customers with backup power and free up more grid capacity. And Dell is scoping out other geographical markets where the rules could allow the Base Power model to grow. But for now, Texas is the ideal place to start. It not only has the competitive market run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, but it is also awash in more utility-scale solar and wind than any other state, enhancing the value of battery-based arbitrage.

When Dell spoke to Canary Media for the previous fund raise, he employed 100 people, and his in-house teams were installing 20 home battery systems per day, for a total of about 10 megawatt-hours in March. Now Base Power employs 250 people and installs double that rate. A year from now, Dell wants to install 100 megawatt-hours per month.

That’s a brash goal for a two-year-old company. But Base Power has actually followed through on its goals, a rare distinction among buzzy cleantech startups. In April, Dell had promised 100 megawatt-hours of cumulative installations by midsummer; he hit that target and is now approaching 150 megawatt-hours.

The firm has also been planning to move from contract manufacturing for its bespoke battery enclosures to in-house manufacturing. In April, Dell said he planned to break ground on a factory near Austin by the end of the year. Now the company has leased the old Austin American-Statesman newspaper headquarters in the heart of town and has begun moving in manufacturing equipment.

“It’s a 90,000-square-foot empty warehouse that happens to be right across the street from our HQ. There’s massive amounts of benefits you get from colocating engineering and manufacturing — having the engineers be really close to the factory, being able to walk the line and make iterations in real time.”

This factory will take imported battery cells and build the modules, packs, and power electronics needed to turn them into large home-battery products. The plan is to start manufacturing in the first quarter of 2026 and ramp up to 4 gigawatt-hours per year of production capacity, Dell said. This supply chain strategy also shores up compliance with new federal rules limiting tax credits for batteries that contain too much content from China.

Base Power is already finalizing a location for a ​“much, much larger” facility outside Austin to continue growing its manufacturing capacity.

Other startups have opted for ​“capital light” strategies to get solar or batteries into the hands of customers. Base Power, in contrast, went capital-heavy, fronting the money to design, own, and install the batteries with the expectation of making future profits on their capacity. It’s too soon to know how that business bet will play out over years, but Dell indicated the early returns were attractive.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Image_Batteries_By_Home.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f1405d8afb488e8e0c204ac842608267,N,,2025-10-10 04:59:03.493072

They include the big four investor-owned providers — Duke Energy Florida, Florida Power & Light, Florida Public Utilities, and Tampa Electric Co. (TECO).
“We know it’s going to be a fight and it’s going to take time,” said Clearwater City Council member David Albritton after the board approved the study.
“Be rational,” suggests former Boulder City Council member Bob Yates, when asked what words of advice he would give Clearwater and St. Petersburg council members who support municipalization efforts.
St. Petersburg City Council member Brandi Gabbard is also enthusiastic about pursuing municipal power.","ST. PETERSBURG — Last Saturday morning in South St. Petersburg’s Wildwood Park, 16 members of a group calling itself “Dump Duke” gathered to share strategy before pairing up to canvass in nearby neighborhoods.

They were there to inform residents and ratepayers frustrated about the prices and services provided by Duke Energy that they could do something about it by signing a petition.

The signature drive was part of a grassroots effort to demonstrate to the City of St. Petersburg legitimate interest within the community to seriously explore jettisoning Duke — their longtime energy provider — when the 30-year franchise agreement between the two parties expires next summer.

“It’s one of the easiest things to canvas for,” said Dump Duke organizer Marley Price, comparing it to her experience knocking on doors last year for an unsuccessful candidate for St. Pete City Council.

“With Duke, everyone knows them. Most people have had a bad experience with them, so it’s really to relate that back and tell them something new — that it doesn’t have to be that way.”

Those and earlier efforts have spurred several members of the City Council to take up the idea. The board voted, 5-3, in August to call on Mayor Ken Welch to seek bids for a feasibility study evaluating the pros and cons of leaving Duke and forming a municipal utility, something that 33 other communities now operate in Florida.

Consultant study

That early vote came as Pinellas County’s next largest city — Clearwater — has received its own, long-anticipated feasibility study prepared by NewGen Strategies & Solutions about what would happen if that city ended its relationship with Duke Energy, whose franchise agreement expires at the end of this year.

Projecting a 30-year period beginning in 2026, the report concluded that if the city dropped Duke Energy, its effective rates over the next five years would end up approximately 7% lower on average than the Duke rate on an annualized basis. After that, the effective rate would run approximately 18% lower on average than the Duke rate for the remainder of the 30-year period.

The study values the cost of acquiring Duke property at $572 million but also notes that the real cost of Duke’s assets could run between 50% lower or 100% higher than its estimate — meaning around $1 billion. That was the estimate offered by an outside energy consultant hired by Duke Energy of Clearwater’s costs.

In Florida, 54 utilities provide electricity to residents. They include the big four investor-owned providers — Duke Energy Florida, Florida Power & Light, Florida Public Utilities, and Tampa Electric Co. (TECO). Those four serve approximately 75% of the state’s population, with the remaining 25% provided by 33 municipal electric utilities and 16 rural electric cooperatives, according to the Florida Municipal Electric Association.

While it would be convenient if an investor-owned utility sold its private assets to a public entity, it never works that way. If Clearwater municipalizes its electric utility, it would have to go the eminent domain route — by far the most expensive option, as Duke officials have been explicit in stressing that they have no intention of selling their system.

“We know it’s going to be a fight and it’s going to take time,” said Clearwater City Council member David Albritton after the board approved the study. “It’s a risk. We all know that. But it could be a lower rate.”

The NextGen study is loaded with caveats, however, including an explicit statement that “there can be no guarantee that Clearwater … will achieve cost savings.”

Winter Park’s success

Some of Florida’s largest communities, such as Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee, have run their own municipal utilities for decades, but not a single one has launched since Winter Park, a northern suburb of Orlando, did so in 2005. That took place following a referendum approved by 69% of the electorate in 2003.

Randy Knight, city manager for Winter Park, described recently on the Florida City and County Management Association podcast how its municipal utility has buried 80% of its power lines underground over the past 20 years, which “has been just huge in reliability … and not having storm outages at all has been fantastic.”

“In this last storm, we had 271 customers out of power after the hurricane came through, and had all of that restored in 12 hours,” he said (the Winter Park municipality serves approximately 15,000 customers). “None of those outages were in the underground part of the system … . It was a testament to what we were doing was the right thing and, you know, the community loves that.”

“As of May, our rates were 32% lower than Duke Energy’s and 2% lower than the statewide average for municipal utilities,” Knight added to WKMG television in August.

Nationally, the last local community to form its own electric utility was the Jefferson County Public Utility District in Washington state in 2013.

Boulder’s decade-long experiment

There is no greater example of how hard it can be to break away from an investor-owned utility than what happened in Boulder, Colorado, which spent nearly a decade trying to break away from Xcel Energy. That effort ended in 2020 when voters approved a settlement with Xcel to trigger the reinstatement of a franchise agreement abandoned a decade earlier.

“Be rational,” suggests former Boulder City Council member Bob Yates, when asked what words of advice he would give Clearwater and St. Petersburg council members who support municipalization efforts. “Be objective and clear-eyed about your evaluation, not only of your goals and objectives, but also how long it will take and how much it will cost.”

In the case of Boulder, taxpayers approved $29 million for the losing effort. Yates says that when investor-owned utilities decide to fight, they won’t give up easily.

Boulder residents pushed the local government to separate from Xcel because of frustration with the lack of urgency the power company expended in pursuing electricity from green power sources like wind and solar.

Yates, who served on the Boulder City Council from 2015 to 2023, said that while he personally never supported the effort, he wishes Pinellas County lawmakers the best of luck. “I don’t think it was a good use of time or money, but the situation may be very different in Florida, so I wouldn’t want to presume to tell the good folks of Florida how to handle their affairs,” he said.

Ursula Schryver is senior vice president for education, training, and events for the American Public Power Association, a D.C. trade group representing the nation’s 2,000 public power utilities. While there is a sense of urgency with the impending end of the franchise agreements in Clearwater and St. Petersburg, it’s generally “a long process and requires a lot of commitment on the part of the community and leadership and so forth,” she said.

The end of a franchise agreement doesn’t mean the end of service

St. Petersburg Mayor Welch, who at one point in his career worked as an accountant with the old Florida Power Corp., has suggested establishing a new 10-year agreement with Duke next year to ensure that residents could rely on “stable and dependable services” as the future of energy in the city is debated. But Schryver says that rather than signing a shorter franchise agreement, “now’s the time” for the city to begin negotiating its wants and needs.

“They have to continue serving the community — Duke or whomever the incumbent is has to continue to serve the community, even without a franchise agreement,” she said. “I would suggest negotiating and continuing to look at the option of forming a public power utility without signing that franchise agreement vs. signing a five-year one and then you’re going to be in the same place that you’re in now, five years down the line.”

That’s what the city of Tampa did during the aughts. After its 20-year franchise agreement with TECO expired in 2006, the city spent two years negotiating with the utility before signing a new 25-year agreement in 2008.

St. Petersburg City Council member Richie Floyd says the fact that the city’s franchise agreement is scheduled to end next year gives the city “a once-in-a-generation opportunity to look into the city’s options.”

“It’s not a radical idea or anything, although I think it’s an important one,” he said.

St. Petersburg City Council member Brandi Gabbard is also enthusiastic about pursuing municipal power.

“What the residents are asking of us is for us to really be able to control costs and to be able to give them a level of service that they are demanding, and so I think that we need to listen to our residents,” she said. “We need to explore it. I’ve been very honest with residents that I don’t have a crystal ball. I don’t know what the future holds.”

Gabbard expressed dissatisfaction that the city hadn’t as of early October even set a timeline for sending out the request for proposals for a consultant study. “There’s no guarantees that this is actually going to come to fruition, but for us to drag our feet and not respond the way that residents are asking us to, I think is doing a disservice.”

Orlando Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani argues that having a local utility through which residents can exercise direct influence “is always preferable to relying on the Public Service Commission as your advocate.”

“Most constituents don’t even know the Public Service Commission exists, but having a local utility board that you can present to, engage with, and really influence leads to better consumer experiences,” she said.

After the Clearwater City Council voted to begin a formal reappraisal of Duke’s distribution system, Duke said in a written statement that creating a city-owned electric utility would be “enormously expensive, risky, and take years to complete.”

“As we have said before, our system is not for sale. That position has not changed. Duke Energy remains committed to serving our Clearwater and St. Petersburg customers, and we look forward to working with both cities on the best path forward — which we believe is renewing the franchise agreement.”

Pinellas County residents are also being hit by social media ads from “We Stand for Energy,” a campaign created by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), calling on them to “Tell the Council: Don’t Waste Taxpayer Money” by pursuing municipalizing.

“As feasibility studies consistently show, municipalization efforts threaten to increase customer costs by billions of dollars without improving service,” said an EEI spokesperson when asked about the campaign. He declined to respond to a question about how much EEI was investing in the effort.

Meanwhile, Dump Duke advocates say they’re not relenting, although Price concedes it’s discouraging that Mayor Welch has declined to meet with the group.

“Hopefully, there will still be enough public pressure still that they have to do something,” she said.

Saturday, as Dump Duke advocate Jason Scott began knocking on doors in South St. Petersburg, he met a man who said that he used to work for Duke as a lineman but now works across the bay for Tampa Electric.

“What’s your opinion of Duke?” Scott asked him.

“It’s a good company to work for, but I understand that a lot of residents were complaining about high bills and stuff,” the man, who did not want to be identified, responded. “I do understand why.”

When Scott asked him about the cost of his monthly bill, the man quickly jumped in.

“Of course I want cheaper bills, but at the same time that Duke kind of monopolizes everything. I don’t see a way to get out of the situation without it being more expensive.”

Nevertheless, he ended up signing Scott’s petition.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-44/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-4-1024x7711760069277.jpeg?h=d1f0e8ce&itok=x9X8d5B0,N,,2025-10-10 08:01:56.108375

That’s according to a new scorecard from a leading environmental group, which gives a North Dakota utility a failing grade.
Todd Leake, executive committee chair with the Sierra Club’s North Dakota chapter, said he doesn’t like recent developments within this sector.

That’s according to a new scorecard from a leading environmental group, which gives a North Dakota utility a failing grade.

The Sierra Club’s latest “Dirty Truth” report grades 75 utilities across the country based on their plans to retire coal plants, their alternatives for new gas plants and their overall transition to clean energy. It says Basin Electric Power Cooperative is still too reluctant to make a noticeable switch, no matter the pledges it’s made.

Todd Leake, executive committee chair with the Sierra Club’s North Dakota chapter, said he doesn’t like recent developments within this sector.

“This is blowing out of the water the whole path that we were taking forward with clean energy generation and retiring the coal plants,” he said.

For Basin Electric, the report criticizes the utility for securing recent approval of a new large gas plant. Leake worries about similar moves amid the push to build data centers. Basin officials did not respond to a request for comment.

Nationally, the Trump administration is pushing to extend the life of fossil fuel plants scheduled for closure, even with analysts warning about the bigger costs for ratepayers.

Wind energy has gained a stronger footing in North Dakota, and industry experts often argue the power source is more affordable for customers compared to fossil fuel plants. Leake wants to see more scrutiny of data centers, noting their rapid expansion complicates current planning.

“Why this one particular industry has a total carte blanche to go and consume as much electricity as it wants, to the detriment to everyone else,” he said.

Supporters of keeping coal and natural gas as part of the energy mix warn that data centers are pushing electricity demand even higher, and that cleaner sources can’t meet that demand alone. The Sierra Club says this year is the first time the aggregate score for all utilities dropped below the inaugural report.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.minotdailynews.com/images/2016/11/03084632/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 04:58:45.829102

About ESS Tech, Inc. At ESS (NYSE: GWH), we deliver safe, sustainable, long-duration energy storage to ensure energy abundance and security.
Established in 2011, ESS enables project developers, independent power producers, utilities and other large energy users to deploy reliable, sustainable long-duration energy storage solutions.","Salt River Project (SRP), a not-for-profit public power utility serving the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, and ESS (NYSE: GWH), a leading manufacturer of iron flow long duration energy storage (LDES) systems, today announced an agreement to add Project New Horizon, a five megawatt (MW), 50 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery system, to the grid. The pilot project will be installed at SRP’s Copper Crossing Energy and Research Center in Florence, Arizona. ESS will sell capacity to SRP under a ten-year energy storage agreement.

The ESS Iron Flow Battery (IFB) project will be part of SRP’s effort to evaluate emerging, non-lithium ion LDES technologies and support SRP’s reliability and sustainability goals. The system, which will utilize ESS’ Energy Base technology, will store enough energy to power 1,125 average-size homes for 10 hours. This project is the result of an RFP issued by SRP in 2024 for LDES pilots.

SRP is working to at least double the number of generating resources on its power system in the next 10 years to meet increasing energy demand in the Phoenix metropolitan area. SRP has nearly 1,300 MW of energy storage currently supporting its grid, which includes 1,100 MW of battery storage— spanning eight facilities— and 200 MW of pumped hydro storage.

“As the Valley continues to see rapid commercial and residential growth, projects like this allow us to better understand the efficacy and impact of different kinds of LDES technologies as they mature,” said Chico Hunter, SRP Manager of Innovation and Development. “This is another opportunity for SRP to evaluate the real-world performance of emergent technologies on our grid and in the Arizona climate.”

ESS’ technology uses a combination consisting mainly of iron, salt and water to store and discharge energy. The Energy Base will be designed to deliver 10 hours of discharge with “fast charging” of 10 hours or less. ESS’s products are safe and sustainable with no risk of thermal runaway, operate in a wide range of temperature environments and are Made in America with over 90% domestic content. They further offer a competitive levelized storage cost with a 25-year life expectancy.

“SRP once again demonstrates its leadership with its commitment to non-lithium, long duration energy storage,” said Kelly Goodman, Interim Chief Executive Officer of ESS. “This project is a significant validation in both the LDES industry and ESS as a technology provider. We are thrilled to be working with SRP to deliver more hours of clean energy to its customers.”

The Copper Crossing Energy and Research Center currently includes a 99-MW flexible natural gas facility. A 55-MW utility scale solar project is currently under construction at the site. The site will also host CMBlu Energy's “Desert Blume”, a 5 MW, 10-hour LDES project.

ESS will be partnering with industry leaders to deliver the project by December of 2027. Design is already underway, and manufacturing will begin in 2026. SRP and ESS will work with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to monitor performance data of the project.

North Omaha State Sens.
Both said energy rates might rise, partly due to unregulated data centers requiring more power or other power demands, but not because of the North Omaha Station plan.
Combined, OPPD has said those facilities would produce 600 megawatts, more than all of the units operating now in North Omaha.
Most questions were for Williams and sought more information about the North Omaha plant transition, Spivey said.","LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers sued the Omaha Public Power District on Thursday, seeking to stop a plan to retire three of five power-producing units at the utility’s North Omaha Station and switch the other two coal-fired units to natural gas.

The 46-page lawsuit, filed in Douglas County District Court, seeks to stop the changes planned for the North Omaha Station, as well as prevent OPPD from pursuing any policy that prioritizes considerations other than price or reliability, including “environmental justice.” Residents had fought to get OPPD to modify the plant, citing health concerns.

Hilgers said data doesn’t support the assertion that the plant harms neighbors’ health.

In a midday announcement, he said he wants to focus the publicly owned utility on what he says state law requires: reliability and affordability. He said OPPD’s plan for the North Omaha plant would retire 240 megawatts of electricity production as OPPD sees skyrocketing increases in demand. Though the local power district’s plan says moving forward is contingent on opening new power-generation facilities this year, Hilgers said the changes wouldn’t add power capacity and would only help OPPD “tread water.”

“We should not be taking one electron off the grid,” Hilgers said.

OPPD declined to comment because of pending litigation. Multiple board members could not be reached for comment.

Targeted in the lawsuit are OPPD, its CEO and president and six of eight elected OPPD directors. It was not immediately clear why board members John Hudson and Michael Cavanaugh are not named in the lawsuit. One of the elected members, Sara Howard, served with Hilgers in the Legislature, where she chaired the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee.

North Omaha State Sens. Ashlei Spivey and Terrell McKinney said they adamantly disagree with Hilgers’ decision. Both said energy rates might rise, partly due to unregulated data centers requiring more power or other power demands, but not because of the North Omaha Station plan.

Spivey, a member of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, called the lawsuit a “witch hunt” she said is meant to “strong-arm” OPPD into following state leaders’ political whims.

“We have seen the AG’s Office do that a number of times on a number of divisive political issues,” Spivey said. “It’s a waste of taxpayer dollars.”

‘Delays are at an end’

In 2014 and 2016, OPPD directors agreed to a plan that, by 2023, OPPD would retire the three North Omaha units in operation since the 1950s and switch the other two in operation since the 1960s from coal to natural gas. The oldest three units switched to natural gas in 2016.

The plan was delayed in 2022 and then made contingent upon the construction of two new power-producing stations: Standing Bear Lake and Turtle Creek. Combined, OPPD has said those facilities would produce 600 megawatts, more than all of the units operating now in North Omaha.

The timing could be tied to OPPD, which appears ready to move forward with the North Omaha Station plan during a “procedural” meeting next week, Spivey said.

Hilgers, too, said he feels “the delays are at an end” and that’s part of why the lawsuit came now. He said it takes a lot of work to decommission power plants, a process he said is also hard to unwind.

Supply and demand

Part of the AG’s concern comes as OPPD hopes to achieve a greener-energy goal of “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, a plan the utility board approved in 2019. OPPD leaders are balancing the desire to meet that goal, which was set when demand for electricity was fairly flat, with rapid recent increases in consumer demand for power.

“Ultimately, it is a supply and demand issue,” Hilgers said. “It would defy reality and economics to suggest that taking 200-plus megawatts offline, given this demand environment we’re in, will do anything other than increase the cost to [OPPD] ratepayers.”

On health concerns, Hilgers said he checked the air quality in North Omaha on his phone just hours before his afternoon event. The quality was at 29, he said, on a metric that considers any number under 50 “great.” He said he’s not dismissing air quality as a concern, nor is he saying local control doesn’t matter.

However, Hilgers argued that taking energy production offline would undermine the utility’s key legal guideposts of affordability and reliability. He argued OPPD directors elevated “environmental justice” as equally or more important in violation of a 1963 Nebraska law that the state “provide for dependable electric service at the lowest practical cost.”

Nebraska is the only state with exclusively publicly owned utilities providing power.

Jim Pillen was among those praising Hilgers on Thursday, calling it “foolish” for any power district to avoid coal, a resource he called “the single most affordable means of energy production known to mankind.” He pointed to coal reserves in neighboring Wyoming as a plus and said coal production is cleaner today than before, with “science is on our side.”

“Foreign adversaries have sped up their own coal production, most notably China and Russia,” Pillen said in a statement. “It is unfathomable why we would take any action that would slow or stop our own expansion of coal-driven energy.”

OPPD serves about 1 million Nebraskans, Hilgers said, in a service area that spans 13 eastern Nebraska counties, including much of the Omaha area.

‘Stop acting like a dictator’

The two North Omaha state senators said they see a different health reality on the ground, including on Wednesday, when they hosted a town hall with OPPD Director Eric Williams, whose district includes North Omaha. Most questions were for Williams and sought more information about the North Omaha plant transition, Spivey said.

McKinney said his constituents have faced respiratory problems, with Spivey noting her oldest son has asthma and that the concerns impact whether her constituents can achieve the “good life.” McKinney said a daycare owner close to the power plant annually cleans residue left behind, and McKinney argued state leaders “only care about dollars and cents.”

“It’s time for Hilgers to stop acting like a dictator and let our public power utilities do their job: providing affordable, reliable and clean energy for the people who actually own it,” McKinney said.

McKinney said that to say coal isn’t harmful is “ignorant, to say the least.” McKinney said that if Hilgers is focused on affordability and reliability, “he should build a coal plant in his backyard and let it burn on his property and see how he feels.”

Hilgers said there are “plenty of avenues” for the public to work with OPPD and find solutions without shutting down an “enormous amount of power.” Spivey said the community has already worked with OPPD for the solution at hand.

‘True cost’ of ‘net-zero?’

Part of Hilgers’ lawsuit relies upon and cites information gathered this summer and fall as part of Legislative Resolution 234, an interim study from freshman State Sen. Jared Storm of David City and 19 other lawmakers into the “true cost” of “net-zero” carbon emissions plans.

Storm could not be reached for comment Thursday.

The Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee hosted a Sept. 5 hearing on Storm’s LR 234, in which State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln accused Storm and his cosponsors — including five of Conrad’s fellow committee members — of each being a “climate denier or a climate skeptic.”

Storm told Conrad he knows the climate is constantly changing and that his resolution was about keeping power affordable and maintaining jobs and the community. He wanted an “off-ramp” for consumers. His resolution could hint at legislation for the 2026 legislative session.

“I’m all for green energy, if it can stay affordable, reliable and doesn’t sacrifice Nebraska jobs,” Storm told Conrad.

State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, the Natural Resources Committee chair who was among those signing onto Storm’s resolution, reached out to OPPD and three other utilities in July in preparation for LR 234. Brandt specifically asked OPPD about its North Omaha plans.

OPPD CEO and President Javier Fernandez told Brandt that while OPPD’s system is forecasted to be reliable under federal and regional regulations, “it is reasonable to say the system would have more margin and better reliability/resiliency had the assets [at North Omaha Station] remained in service with applicable maintenance and life extension work.”

One of the tables Fernandez provided Brandt suggests, based on current OPPD plans, that the agency could hit a wall by 2028 and have consumer demand outpace supply. This includes plans by 2029 to bring on 900 new megawatts in natural gas production. Fernandez indicated OPPD is looking to address the “unprecedented load growth” but faces execution and timing challenges with permitting, supply chains, workforce availability and regulatory approvals.

Hilgers, echoing those challenges, said there is a “world of difference” between planning and what actually will happen with any additional new plants or contracted power coming online.

‘Not in the best interests’

The lawsuit posits that maintaining the status quo in North Omaha could reduce or stabilize OPPD consumer rates for power even as demand increases.

In response to another Brandt question as part of the interim study, Fernandez said delaying the plans by five years could net savings of $36 million with potential revenue growth, or $439 million if delayed by 15 years. He testified in September that keeping the status quo would make for better affordability and enable economic growth for consumers, though “slower progress” toward “net-zero.”

In an Oct. 1 email on additional questions from Storm, Fernandez said the North Omaha Station plan was “primarily based on environmental considerations.”

Brandt repeated that he is unaware of any study or data showing health concerns because of the North Omaha energy production. Fernandez told Storm he had no scientific evidence to the same and that emissions are strictly regulated at the state and federal levels.

While Pillen defended coal production, Hilgers said he might be more open to an alternative, such as moving all of the North Omaha units to natural gas but keeping all five operational. Hilgers said he hopes OPPD comes to the table and that he is open to ideas and a possible settlement.

Brandt, reached Thursday, said: “In a time when the state needs all the generation it can possibly get, it is not in the best interests of the utilities and the state to shut down generation.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47648/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/north-omaha-station-cropped1760069976.jpg?h=f21521f5&itok=UFU5l1K2,N,,2025-10-10 09:03:47.737543

Holtec International described an “untenable path forward for used fuel storage in New Mexico” as it walked away from the proposal to temporarily hold spent fuel from commercial nuclear power plants across the nation. The New Jersey-based company confirmed its decision Thursday.

Holtec said the move would allow it to work with other states that are more amenable.

The New Mexico project was cast aside despite a favorable U.S. Supreme Court ruling in August that rebooted plans for a temporary storage in Texas and New Mexico.

The U.S. is at an impasse over a permanent solution for storing spend nuclear fuel, as roughly 100,000 tons (90,000 metric tons) of spent fuel, some of it dating from the 1980s, pile up at current and former nuclear plant sites nationwide. The waste was meant to be kept there temporarily before being deposited deep underground.

U.S. nuclear regulators in 2023 licensed the proposed multibillion-dollar storage complex in New Mexico, while opposition persisted.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and the Legislature put up stiff resistance with legislation that threatened to withhold local permits and a lawsuit by the state. By contrast, Lujan Grisham’s Republican predecessor, Susana Martinez, had been supportive.

Critics of the project, including the Sierra Club, said Holtec’s decision highlights an enduring roadblock.

“The DOE’s decision regarding the grant doesn’t change our trajectory,” Ascend President and CEO Linh Austin says in a statement. “We’re moving forward.”

Austin notes the company already is producing recycled lithium carbonate at commercial scale at its Base 1 facility in Covington, Georgia, with a purity of more than 99 percent, and is scaling output in the U.S. and Europe toward approximately 15,000 metric tons annually by 2027.

He adds that the company’s funding path is diversified beyond the DOE.

“We are replacing the remaining unused portion of the DOE grant with a mix of other sources of funding available to the company, including equity, project finance, municipal bonds and other forms of debt,” Austin says.

Ascend was included in a recently announced wave of DOE funding cuts totaling $7.5 billion. In all, 321 financial awards were terminated for 223 projects. Awards were issued by the Biden administration via the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Grid Deployment (GDO), Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and Fossil Energy (FE).

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the department says in an Oct. 2 announcement of the cuts.

According to Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the department has reviewed billions of dollars in financial awards, “many rushed through the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.”

Of the 321 terminated awards, the DOE claims 26 percent were awarded between election day in November and inauguration day in January. Affected award recipients have 30 days to appeal a termination decision, and the DOE says some of those recipients already have begun that process.

Headquartered in Westborough, Massachusetts, Ascend was awarded the DOE grant in October 2022 and broke ground on its 140-acre Hopkinsville site soon after. At the time, the company said it planned to invest close to $1 billion in the project, claiming Apex 1 would be the largest electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling and engineered materials manufacturing facility in the U.S.

The sprawling campus was initially expected to create 400 full-time jobs—making it the single largest investment in Western Kentucky—and produce enough cathode active material (CAM) and precursor cathode active material (pCAM) to power 250,000 EVs per year, though that trajectory has changed somewhat over the past year. Materials the company specializes in developing include lithium carbonate, nickel sulfate, cobalt sulfate and manganese sulfate from black mass.

“While construction at Apex 1 is paused, we will restart beginning in 2026, with both lithium extraction and pCAM lines aligned with commercial offtakes,” Austin says in his statement regarding the DOE funding cut. “Our business economics are not predicated on grants, but by customer demand, operational excellence and our patented Hydro-to-Cathode technology.”

Construction of the Apex 1 campus has been on hold since late 2024. In April, the company told area media outlets that changing market conditions led to several major customers requesting to push back the start of the facility’s pCAM deliveries by 12 to 18 months, prompting the pause. At a Hopkinsville City Council meeting the same month, Plant Manager Mark Fern said construction would resume once the facility’s design phase is completed.

In February, Ascend came to a mutual agreement with the DOE to cancel a $164 million grant intended to fund CAM manufacturing infrastructure at Apex 1, citing changing market conditions that caused demand for domestic pCAM to exceed demand for CAM. Going forward, the company said it would focus on producing only pCAM and lithium carbonate in Hopkinsville.

“By voluntarily returning the CAM grant, we are freeing up $164 million of federal funding for the current administration to reallocate as it deems most appropriate,” Ascend Vice President of Government Affairs Roger Lin said at the time, adding that the Apex 1 project “squarely aligns” with the Trump administration’s goal of increasing domestic production of critical materials. “We are committed to creating good jobs in Kentucky, providing a domestic supply of lithium-ion battery materials and enhancing U.S. energy independence.”",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/10/09/ascend_apex1_rendering-web.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 04:58:53.354443

Fleming, a distinguished museum leader, historian, husband, father and mentor to many in the museum profession, passed away on Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. He was 81 years old. He had lived in Yellow Springs for 35 years. Dr. Fleming was well known as a pre-eminent scholar, academician and author whose life’s work was the preservation and interpretation of African American history and culture.

His career was firmly rooted in the historic black community as he came of age. A native of Morganton, North Carolina, he received his bachelor’s degree from Berea College and in the 1960s served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Malawi, East Africa, where he was assigned to the Ministry of Agriculture. After his return to the United States, he worked for Pride Inc. under Marion Barry and as a program analyst for the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.

Dr. Fleming went on to pursue advanced degrees, earning both a master’s degree and a doctorate in American history from Howard University in Washington, D.C. While serving as a Senior Fellow at Howard’s Institute for the Study of Educational Policy, he wrote two books on African American education: “The Lengthening Shadow of Slavery” and “The Case for Affirmative Action for Blacks in Higher Education.”

Dr. Fleming’s museum career began in 1980 when he joined the Ohio Historical Society as the Afro-American Museum project director. He was the founding director of the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center in Wilberforce, Ohio, and later became the director and chief operating officer for the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Over the course of his career, he was directly involved in the development of six museums, including the International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina; the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson, Mississippi; and the National Museum of African American Music, in Nashville, Tennessee, where he served as immediate past director. He also served as director emeritus of the Cincinnati Museum Center and as an adjunct professor in the department of history at the University of Cincinnati.

His leadership extended across several respected historical and cultural organizations. He was president of the Ohio Museums Association, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History and the Association of African American Museums. He was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the commission for the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. He was the immediate past chair of the board for the American Association for State and Local History and was recently appointed by Gov. Mike DeWine to the Ohio Semiquincentennial Commission. Locally, he was an active member of the YS Men’s Association.

Dr. Fleming was also a prolific writer and scholar: He was author of five books and 50 articles throughout his career. In addition to his scholarly works, he published two memoirs: “A Summer Remembered,” about his childhood in North Carolina, and “Mission to Malawi,” about his time in the Peace Corps.

He was a recipient of numerous accolades, including distinguished service awards from the Association of African American Museums, the American Association for State and Local History, the National Peace Corps, Berea College, the Ohio Library Association, and the National Peace Corps. In his honor, the Association of African American Museums named its highest honor the John E. Fleming Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2020, he was named one of the Top Ten African Americans in Dayton, Ohio.

But Dr. Fleming was proudest of the time that he devoted to his family and community. He is survived by his wife, Barbara, a psychologist and writer, of Yellow Springs; and his two daughters, one a lawyer and the other a museum professional who followed in her father’s footsteps as a curator of American art. Dr. Fleming is also survived by two grandsons, a brother, a sister and numerous relatives.

He was a former board member and volunteer for the St. Vincent de Paul Homeless shelter in Dayton. And he was a proud member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and Sigma Pi Phi, known as the Boule.

Win underscores leadership in sustainable, U.S.-based battery production and innovation across performance, scalability, and environmental impact.

Award presented at The Battery Show North America in Detroit, Michigan.

[Detroit, MI – October 7, 2025] – Ateios Systems, a pioneer in advanced battery manufacturing, has been named the 2025 Battery Manufacturer of the Year at The Battery Show North America, held October 6–9 at Huntington Place in Detroit, MI. The award recognizes companies advancing innovation, performance, and sustainability across the global battery industry.

The honor highlights Ateios’ breakthrough RaiCure™ electron-curing platform, which delivers the world’s fastest solvent-free electrode production—achieving industrial speeds while eliminating harmful PFAS chemicals and dramatically reducing energy use.

Rajan Kumar, CEO and Founder of Ateios Systems, said:

Technology becomes truly profound not through complexity, but through ubiquity, when it is so abundant and effortless to produce that it feels as accessible as air,

“This award shows we are getting closer to that reality. It is an incredible honor for our team, whose belief in our mission continues to drive constant improvement across the company, product, and vision. I am extremely proud of how we have validated performance at scale while uniting production, supply chain, and sustainability in one cohesive solution.”

Transforming Battery Manufacturing

RaiCure™ replaces traditional, solvent-heavy coating methods with a rapid electron-curing process inspired by semiconductor manufacturing. The platform enables industrial throughput with near-zero emissions and drop-in compatibility for existing production lines.

Key technology advantages:

Record-speed manufacturing – 80 meters per minute, nearly 3× faster than the conventional 30 m/min process

PFAS-free and solvent-free – Eliminating toxic “forever chemicals” and reducing energy use by up to 96%

High-energy electrodes – Thick cathodes up to >5 mAh/cm² with yields exceeding 95%

Domestic supply chain integration – All raw materials are sourced from domestic suppliers that can compete on performance, price, and volume in a global market

Scalable deployment – Drop-in solution that can bring immediate returns and faster time to market development of batteries

In September, Ateios announced a partnership with Kodak, leveraging Kodak’s decades of precision film-coating expertise to accelerate the commercialization of its RaiCure™ platform. The collaboration combines Kodak’s 130 years of proven manufacturing infrastructure with Ateios’ clean, solvent-free process to deliver high-performance, U.S.-made electrodes at GWh scale.

Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.
The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming.
Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue.
A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining, drilling and other development in three Western states, advancing President Donald Trump’s ambitions to expand energy production from public lands.

Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.

The timing of Biden’s actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president’s signature.

The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.

Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.

The road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden’s goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump’s efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices … and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Democrats urged rejection of the repeals, arguing that Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly agenda is driving up energy prices because renewable sources are being sidelined even as the tech industry’s power demands soar for data centers and other projects.

“We are seeing dramatic increases in the price of energy for American consumers and businesses and the slashing of American jobs, so that Donald Trump can give an easy pass to the fossil fuel industry,” Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

Ashley Nunes, public lands specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said Republicans were unleashing “a wholesale assault on America’s public lands.” Using the Congressional Review Act to erase land management plans “will sow chaos across the country and turn our most cherished places into playgrounds for coal barons and industry polluters,” she said.

Last week, the White House announced that it was going to abruptly terminate nearly $500 million in clean energy grant funding to factories and other businesses across New York.
Companies that had been planning their next steps forward in the clean energy sector will now be faced with unnecessary hardship or be forced to reconsider critical investments.
There’s a huge demand for energy, and the elimination of this clean energy funding will do irreparable harm.

Last week, the White House announced that it was going to abruptly terminate nearly $500 million in clean energy grant funding to factories and other businesses across New York. These cuts will risk more than 1,000 good-paying jobs and harm economic growth in regions across the state, with an estimated statewide economic hit of $650 million. With the cancellation of these projects, communities will suffer and families will go without paychecks, including those in the very districts whose Congressional representatives continue to greenlight reckless cuts out of Washington.

“Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are playing politics with the government shutdown, and New York’s economy and hard-working families are paying the price,” Governor Hochul said. “These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress. New York Republicans should grow a spine, stand with our workers and demand that President Trump restore this funding.”

Projects earmarked for termination across New York State based on numbers provided by the House Committee on Appropriations:

Empire State Development President, CEO, and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “These federal cuts are shutting down projects already underway, and will stifle New York’s clean energy economy while killing good paying jobs. Communities that were on the brink of transformative growth will now face stalled investments and lost paychecks, as New York’s progress toward a sustainable future stalls. Governor Hochul continues to stand up and speak out for New Yorkers, and the businesses looking to drive economic growth in the 21st century.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “These federal funding cuts put thousands of good-paying jobs at risk while harming the momentum of New York’s clean energy industry by creating further uncertainty for the organizations and businesses that need stability to plan, invest, and grow here. Once again, short-sighted political games at the federal level will undermine innovation and progress in one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy.”

Senator Charles Schumer said, “Donald Trump’s rash actions will hike energy costs for New Yorkers and waste hundreds of millions in investment by wiping out projects already underway in his reckless campaign of chaos & revenge. This goes beyond targeting blue states. It is taking a wrecking ball to working families’ lives from Jamestown to Rockland County, putting countless construction workers out of jobs and raising families’ electric bills just to score petty political points. NY House Republicans’ silence — as Trump rips away billions of sound investment and thousands of good-paying jobs from their backyard — is deafening. Instead of playing politics with the shutdown, President Trump should be working on bipartisan solutions to lower Americans’ costs, boost diverse energy supply, and create jobs.”

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, “Clean energy is the way of the future for a healthier and more affordable New York State. These Trump administration cuts will have devastating consequences for New Yorkers’ quality of life, the state’s economy, and the overall wellbeing of our communities. I am deeply disappointed in my Republican colleagues who are turning their backs to their constituents by supporting these funding cuts.”

Representative Jerrold Nadler said, “Trump has brazenly cut half a billion dollars in clean energy funding, and my Republican colleagues lack the spine to stand up to him. We will not let Donald Trump’s personal campaign of retribution against our city and state continue down this reckless path. This careless decision will have detrimental consequences; if New York’s economy gets hit, the entire country will feel it, thousands of good paying jobs will be lost, and hard-working families will go without paychecks. These cuts must be reversed immediately, and I hope my Republican colleagues will join me in calling on Trump to give New York our already approved funding back.”

Representative Nydia M. Velázquez said, “These cuts are a direct attack on New Yorkers and our clean energy future. These grants create good jobs, grow our economy, and move our state toward sustainability. Stripping away this funding threatens workers in my district and across the state and undermines the progress our communities have fought to achieve. New York Republicans need to stand with their constituents instead of standing by while this administration puts New Yorkers’ livelihoods on the line.”

Representative Yvette D. Clarke said, “At a time when Trump’s devastating cuts risk undermining the economic stability of communities across New York, our neighbors statewide are pleading with their Republican representatives to stand up for them, their families, and their futures – but they’ve heard nothing back but betrayal. New York Republicans are running out of time to figure out if they serve the people who put them in Congress, or the corrupt president who will toss them aside the instant they’re no longer useful. I stand with Governor Hochul and the people of our state in demanding my Republican colleagues make the right choice by, at long last, putting New York first.”

Representative Grace Meng said, “We should always be working to promote jobs and economic growth in our state and that includes New York’s clean energy sector. I have spoken out against cuts made by the administration that harm our local communities, and I will continue to do so. New York deserves to receive all the resources we require.”

Representative Adriano Espaillat said, “From the rising costs of groceries, utilities, and housing, affordability is among the highest concerns facing New Yorkers and their families. Yet, the Trump administration has failed to work collaboratively to find solutions that would provide families the much needed relief they deserve. Rather than focusing on solutions to curb these ballooning costs, the administration has canceled critical projects and programs that communities rely on. We will stand firm to combat the administration’s ineffective and dangerous policies that threaten the livelihoods and wellbeing of New York families and we will hold them accountable.”

Representative Paul Tonko said, “Instead of working in a bipartisan fashion to advance our state’s growing 21st century economy, Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have chosen to unilaterally terminate hundreds of millions of dollars in clean energy funding for New York State and our Capital Region. Let’s be clear — these aren’t Democratic or Republican projects. These are cutting-edge programs working to drive innovation and bring energy costs down for everyone. By canceling hundreds of these projects across the nation, Donald Trump and his enablers are showing that they care more about their own power than about making life affordable or delivering good-paying jobs for the American people. It’s time for my Republican colleagues to stand up to this bullying behavior and advocate for the best interests of our communities.”

Representative Joe Morelle said, “At the direction of Donald Trump, Congressional Republicans chose to shut down the government rather than negotiate with Democrats—and New Yorkers are paying the price. These cancelled grants—including over $75 million destined for the Rochester region—will hurt businesses and families across our great state. As Vice Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I’m working with my colleagues to stand up to Donald Trump and secure the federal investments New Yorkers deserve.”

Representative Dan Goldman said, “Donald Trump’s reckless and shortsighted clean energy cuts are nothing short of partisan warfare against New Yorkers. After kicking over a million New Yorkers off their health care, Trump and his New York Republican allies like Elise Stefanik and Mike Lawler are now yanking away half a billion dollars in clean energy funding as punishment for a shutdown they caused. They’re putting politics over paychecks and jeopardizing thousands of good-paying union jobs in communities across our state. Once again, New York Republicans in Congress would rather serve Trump’s political agenda than stand up for their own constituents.”

Representative Tim Kennedy said, “Canceling these shovel-ready projects will kill jobs, stifle innovation, and raise costs for working families. These projects would have lowered energy costs and strengthened our grid during severe weather. Instead, Trump and Congressional Republicans have again sided with special interests over their own constituents, making it harder for families to pay their bills and for America to lead in the industries of the future. Western New Yorkers should be building the technologies that power the next generation, not watching those opportunities disappear because of Republicans in Washington.”

Representative John W. Mannion said, “This administration thinks research and innovation only matter in the states they won in an election. They’re wrong. These reckless cuts are job killers that hurt families across New York. They also sell out our future, hand an advantage to China, and will drive up energy costs for everyone. This funding should be restored immediately – and I’m advocating to restore it in congressional districts represented by either party, because that’s what’s good and right for all New Yorkers and all Americans.”

Representative Josh Riley said, “Families and small businesses in the Hudson Valley and Southern Tier are already getting squeezed by sky-high utility bills — and now this administration wants to make it even harder to keep the lights on. These cuts will only make life more expensive for working people. I’ve fought utility monopolies and their outrageous rate hikes, and I’ll keep fighting to restore funding and lower costs for Upstate New Yorkers.”

Assemblymember Al Stirpe said, “The ongoing attack from the current federal administration on anything that promotes clean energy continues unabated. Any disruption in already approved funding for these programs threatens the potential for new, high-paying jobs, stifles economic growth, and stagnates significant progress towards greener alternatives. As Chairman of the State Assembly Economic Development Committee, it is clear that such cuts do nothing but set New York State’s businesses and communities back – all while hurting real people and working families in the process. Companies that had been planning their next steps forward in the clean energy sector will now be faced with unnecessary hardship or be forced to reconsider critical investments. Without restoring this funding, New York risks falling behind in one of its fastest-growing industries and losing hard-won progress in the clean energy sector.”

Assemblymember Micah Lasher said, “Donald Trump is once again targeting New York’s economy by slashing funding for clean energy, putting thousands of good-paying jobs on the chopping block. Every Republican member of Congress from New York has a lot to answer for. I stand with Governor Hochul in demanding that these cuts be immediately reversed.”

Albany County Executive Daniel P. McCoy said, “Clean energy investment has been one of the most effective drivers of growth in our state, fostering innovation, strengthening our economy, and positioning us as a leader in sustainability. The withdrawal of these funds threatens to stall that momentum and undermine years of progress. I urge the Trump administration to reconsider this decision and fully restore the funding. Maintaining our commitment to clean energy is not only sound environmental policy, but it is also a vital economic necessity for the Capital Region and New York State as a whole.”

Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz said, “Who is served by these cruel and vicarious cuts supported by New York’s cravenly sycophantic GOP caucus? Did New York Republicans realize that they were electing ‘representatives’ who would gladly vote to crush their local economies, strip away good-paying jobs, and let their communities wither all to pay for tax cuts for billionaires? It’s disturbing that elected officials would so openly and brazenly vote against the best interests of their constituents, but that’s today’s GOP. Their legacy will be one of shame and dishonor, accumulated in the service of a felon. New York deserves far, far better than this group of feckless bootlickers who sell us out for their own benefit.”

City of Schenectady Mayor Gary McCarthy said, “GE Vernova has played a vital role in revitalizing the GE campus through continued innovation in clean energy technologies. However, the proposed federal funding cuts threaten to significantly impede this progress, with far-reaching negative impacts not only on the company’s momentum but also on the broader economic and workforce development efforts across the city and county.”

Amherst Town Supervisor Brian Kulpa said, “Not only do these cuts immediately impact families and businesses, by cutting funding for clean energy development, Washington is taking direct aim at future generations. There’s a huge demand for energy, and the elimination of this clean energy funding will do irreparable harm. Today’s investments are the cornerstone that builds industry of tomorrow. These cuts are reckless and they significantly hurt local communities. I join Governor Hochul in urging our local representatives to immediately restore this vital funding – we need to invest in energy the same as we invest in infrastructure, it is our lifeblood.”

Henrietta Town Supervisor Steve Schultz said, “The need to reduce our environmental impact is reinforced almost every news cycle with violent storms, record high temperatures, shrinking glaciers, and rising sea waters. As with any developing technology, it can have difficulty competing with established solutions. This is where a responsible government steps in with incentive programs and policies to help level the playing field while those new technologies mature. The United States has a long history of such programs, which has helped the nation not only lead the world in new technologies but become an economic superpower while doing so. The investment in these new technologies pays dividends in the long term. Plug Power, Inc, in Henrietta, is an example of this, creating clean energy equipment for use in industrial and commercial settings. Dramatic cuts, especially those of a retaliatory or vindictive nature as we have seen lately out of Washington, will have a lasting negative impact that could take years or decades to recover from.”

Brighton Town Supervisor William Moehle said, “The Trump administration’s attacks on green energy investments are bad for the nation, but they are especially bad for Brighton. $4,969,022 in funding has been cut for one of Brighton’s high technology businesses, Ionomr Innovations, which conducts cutting edge clean technology research here in Brighton. Now more than ever, it is important to fund advances in clean energy technology, and I call on the administration to restore this important research funding for America’s future.”

Albany County Legislature Chairwoman Joanne Cunningham said, “We are resilient in Albany County. Even with nearly $111 million of our taxpayers’ funding not returning to us, we will continue to support our local business community with our state partners and Governor Hochul in particular. Recognizing the uncertainty of federal funding, we are proactively working to advance development in Albany County through our partnership with the State and the Governor on the multi-million-dollar expansion of the Albany Capital Center. We’re also thankful for the $400 million the State is investing in Downtown Albany at her request. With this continued support, we’re confident we can overcome this latest challenge.”

Rensselaer County Legislature Deputy Minority Leader Nina Nichols said, “Governor Hochul stands with the thousands of New Yorkers whose livelihoods are threatened by Washington’s reckless cuts. Slashing $500 million in clean energy grants doesn’t just stall progress—it risks over 1,000 good-paying jobs and delivers a $650 million blow to our economy. These communities deserve investment, not abandonment.”",,N,,2025-10-10 03:57:38.683732

Similarly, renewable diesel imports tumbled to 5,000 b/d from 33,000 b/d a year earlier.
Blenders pivot to domestic supply Facing tighter margins and the adjusted tax credit framework, fuel blenders have increasingly turned to domestic biofuel production over imports.
The company has historically supplied all the renewable diesel imports to the US.
Looking ahead, the EIA forecasts net US biodiesel imports in 2025 and 2026 to remain at their lowest levels since 2012.","In the first half of 2025, US imports of biodiesel and renewable diesel plunged to their lowest levels in more than a decade.

According to the US Energy Information Administration, biodiesel imports averaged just 2,000 barrels per day, down sharply from 35,000 b/d in 1H 2024. Similarly, renewable diesel imports tumbled to 5,000 b/d from 33,000 b/d a year earlier.

These are the weakest first-half import numbers since 2012, a period when domestic biofuel use was only a fraction of today’s volumes.

This dramatic drop follows a major tax-credit policy shift. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the previous $1/gallon blender’s tax credit (BTC), which applied to both imported and domestic biodiesel/renewable diesel, was replaced in 2025 by the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

The main change? 45Z excludes imports.

The removal of import eligibility has undercut the economics of foreign biofuels entering the US market. The change reflects several other US actions that aim to focus on domestic production rather than imports.

Why Imports Fell (and Why Domestic Producers Gained)

1. Tax credits no longer favor imports

Prior to 2025, both domestic and imported biomass-based diesel qualified for the $1/blender’s tax credit. This gave importers a competitive footing alongside US-based production operations.

With the credit now limited to US production under Section 45Z, imported biodiesel and renewable diesel face a structural disadvantage.

2. Weak domestic demand and poor blending margins

Import volumes were also squeezed by lower domestic consumption.

Compared to 1H 2024, US renewable diesel use in 2025 was down ~30%, and biodiesel use was down ~40%. That drop reflects market uncertainty over blending mandates and thin or negative margins on biofuel blends.

3. Blenders pivot to domestic supply

Facing tighter margins and the adjusted tax credit framework, fuel blenders have increasingly turned to domestic biofuel production over imports. This applied even for the reduced volumes they still blend.

The shifted dynamic squeezed out imports further as foreign producers had fewer profitable outlets.

One example of this change in action: Neste. The company has historically supplied all the renewable diesel imports to the US. But in early 2025, Neste sent a smaller share of exports.

Looking ahead, the EIA forecasts net US biodiesel imports in 2025 and 2026 to remain at their lowest levels since 2012.

Implications for Domestic Markets and Policy

Stronger Domestic Biofuel Demand

The tax-credit change shifts value to US producers, potentially spurring new investments in domestic biodiesel and renewable diesel facilities. As imports retreat, the burden of meeting RFS mandates increasingly relies on local capacity.

Feedstock Pressure Intensifies

Greater demand for domestic output means more pressure on feedstock supply (e.g. used cooking oil, animal fats, residues). Regions with abundant low-cost feedstocks may tighten further, fueling competition, price volatility, or supply constraints.

Credit and Compliance Dynamics Shift

RIN markets may see upward pressure if biofuel volumes grow but supply remains constrained. Domestic producers now gain more exclusive access to the Clean Fuel Production Credit, which could enhance profitability for efficient operations.

Importers and Exporters Pivot Strategies

Foreign biofuel producers will likely reroute supply away from the US and toward markets still offering incentives or favorable trade conditions. Some may pursue joint ventures or local US assets to regain eligibility under the new credit scheme.

Lagged Consumption Recovery and Regulatory Risk

As blending demand rebounds later in 2025 (to meet RFS mandates), domestic producers and infrastructure must be ready. Yet regulatory swings or uncertain credit program details could still destabilize market participation.

Key Risks and Wild Cards

Feedstock Bottlenecks: If domestic biofuel plants scale without securing sustainable feedstocks, raw material costs may spike, eroding margins.

Policy Reversals or Litigation: Import restrictions could provoke legal challenges (e.g. from trade groups arguing unfair treatment), or future administrations may reintroduce import credits.

Overcapacity and Margin Pressure: Rapid new builds could create oversupply and compression on margins. This holds especially true within a volatile RIN environment.

What These Changes Will Mean

The 2025 policy pivot didn’t just shift tax credit rules. It has completely reshaped the US biodiesel/renewable diesel trade landscape.

Import volumes have collapsed almost overnight, and the competitive balance now tilts toward domestic producers. For stakeholders across the value chain like feedstock suppliers, refiners, investors, and compliance-focused entities, this shift highlights two critical concerns:

Feedstock Strategy Matters More than Ever

Securing high-quality, sustainable, scalable feedstocks will be a competitive differentiator.

Intelligence and Agility are Essential

With shifting credit rules, variable mandates, and a dynamic supply environment, staying ahead requires real-time market monitoring, scenario modeling, and readiness to pivot as policies evolve.

In short: the tax credit change is not merely a change in incentive. It’s a structural realignment of the US biofuel paradigm. Those who understand and adapt will be better positioned in this next phase of low-carbon fuel markets.

Bannister grazier Ken Ikin, who runs Cloverlee Poll Hereford Stud, will have the HumeLink project span part of his property, which is near the Gullen Range Wind Farm.
HumeLink is being delivered in two stages, HumeLink East and HumeLink West.
HumeLink East Project Director Carel Nagel said ACCIONA and GenusPlus Group are incredibly proud to be part of the landmark project.
“It is a privilege for our whole team to be part of such a significant project for Australia's energy future.","The delivery of this project will reinforce NSW’s southern electricity grid and enable the integration of more renewable generation into the National Electricity Market (NEM), helping to realise Australia’s transition to cleaner, more affordable energy and meet the Australian Government’s recently announced emissions targets.

Providing a critical backbone to the NEM by reinforcing the southern grid, it will connect at Wagga Wagga with EnergyConnect and form the energy superhighway needed to help bring cheaper, cleaner renewable energy online from solar and wind generators in south-west NSW.

It will also unlock the full capacity of Snowy 2.0, which will provide an additional 2,200 megawatts of on-demand energy into the grid – enough to power up to three million homes for a week.

Transgrid Group CEO, Brett Redman, said the 365km transmission line is expected to deliver more than $1 billion in net benefits to the Australian economy and provide consumers in NSW with better access to cleaner, more affordable electricity.

“This is a pivotal moment for the country’s energy transition as Transgrid and our delivery partners get on with the job of delivering this once-in-a-generation project that will help make Australia’s clean energy transition a reality,” Mr Redman said.

“HumeLink is a major step forward in delivering the sustainable, affordable and reliable energy all Australians deserve. I want to thank the Australian Government and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation for supporting this critical project under the Rewiring the Nation program.

“Nation-building projects such as HumeLink are crucial to helping the Australian Government achieve its new 2035 climate change target of a 62 to 70 per cent reduction in emissions, compared with 2005 levels.

“Transgrid and our delivery partners will continue to work closely with landowners, communities and key stakeholders as construction of the project proceeds. We will also invest in local communities to create jobs, deliver education and training opportunities, support local businesses, improve community facilities and services, and boost local economies.”

Transgrid has now reached negotiated land access and easement agreements, either in place or agreed in principle, with 98.9 percent of private landholders for the HumeLink project.

Bannister grazier Ken Ikin, who runs Cloverlee Poll Hereford Stud, will have the HumeLink project span part of his property, which is near the Gullen Range Wind Farm.

Mr Ikin, who has an existing transmission line on his property, said the tower and transmission line that will be installed on his property will not interfere with his operations and livelihood.

“It's a step forward for the future for our grandchildren and children,” Mr Ikin said.

“The existing line was here the day we came to look at the property.

It's been here for a long time. To put another one alongside and to get paid for it is really, you know, there's a lot of other things to worry about than that.”

In a significant win for regional NSW, HumeLink is expected to create 1,600 construction jobs and deliver $6.3 billion of direct and indirect investment into the regional economy.

HumeLink is being delivered in two stages, HumeLink East and HumeLink West.

HumeLink East is being designed and constructed by ACCIONA and GenusPlus Group Joint Venture.

HumeLink East Project Director Carel Nagel said ACCIONA and GenusPlus Group are incredibly proud to be part of the landmark project.

“It is a privilege for our whole team to be part of such a significant project for Australia's energy future.

This has been in the planning phase for a long time and it’s great to see the success of early works which has set us up for main construction,” Mr Nagel said.",https://www.acciona.com.au/content/dam/accioname/logo-acciona.svg?v=20251010025749,N,,2025-10-09 23:00:11.168001

FAQs About China's Rare Earth Export Controls What specific rare earth elements are now under export control?","China's Rare Earth Export Controls: Strategic Implications for Global Supply Chains

China has dramatically expanded its rare earth export restrictions, adding five additional elements and various refining technologies to its controlled list. This strategic move, announced by China's Ministry of Commerce on October 10, 2025, introduces new licensing requirements for holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium exports—elements critical for manufacturing advanced technologies including EVs, wind turbines, semiconductors, and defense systems.

New Restrictions and Their Scope

The latest measures significantly broaden Beijing's control over global rare earth supply chains. The restrictions not only cover the raw materials themselves but extend to refining technologies and, for the first time, impose constraints on foreign producers using Chinese materials or equipment.

These export controls represent a calculated strategic move that leverages China's dominant position in rare earth processing, where it handles more than 90% of global production. The comprehensive nature of these restrictions suggests a deliberate attempt to maintain China's technological advantage while potentially responding to Western export controls in other sectors.

The new compliance measures will take effect on November 8, 2025, with additional regulations for foreign companies beginning December 1, 2025, adding further complexity to already strained global supply chains.

Timeline of China's Tightening Export Controls

China has been systematically expanding its rare earth export control framework:

December 2020: Implementation of Export Control Law establishing the legal foundation for strategic export restrictions

April 2025: Initial export restrictions on seven rare earth elements (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium)

July 2025: Ban on exports of rare earth alloys, magnets, and chemical mixtures

October 2025: Expansion to five additional elements and refining technologies

This progressive tightening demonstrates China's strategic approach to leveraging its resource advantages in response to broader geopolitical tensions.

Why Are Rare Earth Elements Strategically Important?

Critical Applications Across Key Industries

Rare earth elements play an indispensable role in numerous high-technology applications despite being used in relatively small quantities:

Renewable Energy: Permanent magnets containing neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are essential for wind turbines and electric vehicle motors. A single 3MW wind turbine contains approximately 600kg of rare earth permanent magnets, while electric vehicle motors typically require 1-2kg of these specialized magnets.

Defense Technology: The U.S. Department of Defense identifies rare earths as mission-critical materials. Each F-35 Lightning II fighter jet requires approximately 920 pounds of rare earth materials, while Virginia-class submarines use around 9,200 pounds. Precision-guided weapons, radar systems, and electronic warfare equipment depend heavily on these elements.

Consumer Electronics: A typical smartphone contains approximately eight rare earth elements—lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, gadolinium, terbium, and dysprosium—used in speakers, vibration motors, displays, and glass polishing compounds.

Aerospace: Aircraft engines, navigation systems, and satellite components rely on rare earth elements for their unique magnetic, luminescent, and temperature-resistant properties.

Medical Technology: MRI systems require superconducting magnets containing significant quantities of rare earth elements, particularly gadolinium, which is also used as a contrast agent in approximately 30% of MRI procedures.

China's Dominant Market Position

China's control over the rare earth supply chain has developed over decades through strategic investments in mining, processing capabilities, and technological expertise:

China's Rare Earth Industry Dominance Percentage Global processing capacity >90% Global mining production ~60% Refined rare earth exports ~80% Rare earth magnet manufacturing ~85%

This dominance is particularly pronounced in heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), where China controls over 95% of global supply. While China produces approximately 60-70% of raw rare earth materials, its near-monopoly on processing creates a critical bottleneck in global supply chains.

What Is Driving This Strategic Move?

Geopolitical Context and Timing

The announcement comes at a critical juncture in US-China relations, preceding a scheduled meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. This timing suggests a deliberate strategic calculation by Beijing.

The expansion of rare earth export controls represents a powerful reminder of China's ability to leverage its resource advantages in response to broader geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

Reciprocal Response to Western Technology Restrictions

China's actions appear to be directly linked to recent Western technology restrictions:

Follows U.S. lawmakers' calls to expand bans on chipmaking equipment exports to China

Responds to the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security's expanded semiconductor export controls, which affect approximately $30-50 billion in annual semiconductor equipment sales to China

Demonstrates China's willingness to use its resource dominance as a countermeasure in the ongoing technology competition

This tit-for-tat approach highlights how resource control has become a key tool in the broader strategic competition between major powers.

Strategic Resource Nationalism

The move aligns with China's broader ""dual circulation"" economic strategy, which emphasizes:

Greater self-reliance in critical supply chains to reduce vulnerability to external disruptions

Maintaining leverage in international markets through controlled export policies

Protecting domestic technological development by ensuring priority access to strategic resources

Securing long-term economic and national security interests through resource control

According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) emphasizes this ""dual circulation"" approach, prioritizing domestic consumption and production while maintaining international trade. The strategy aims to reduce dependence on foreign technology while strengthening China's position in global supply chains.

How Are Global Markets Responding?

Immediate Market Reactions

The announcement triggered significant movement in rare earth stocks globally, with particularly strong gains for North American companies:

Critical Metals Corp: +17%

Energy Fuels: +11%

MP Materials: +6%

USA Rare Earth: +6%

These price movements reflect investors' expectations that Western rare earth producers will benefit from higher prices and accelerated investment as consumers seek alternatives to Chinese supply.

Long-Term Market Implications

Market analysts anticipate several long-term effects:

Price Volatility: Historical precedent suggests significant price increases for the newly restricted elements. During previous export restrictions in 2010-2011, neodymium prices surged from $40/kg to over $300/kg within months.

Investment Acceleration: Western governments and private investors are likely to increase funding for rare earth projects outside China. This could compress development timelines for projects that might otherwise take 7-10 years from discovery to production.

Strategic Stockpiling: Countries may expand strategic reserve initiatives of rare earth materials, similar to Japan's program that maintains approximately 60 days of consumption in strategic reserves.

Technology Adaptation: Manufacturers may accelerate research into reduced rare earth usage or alternative materials to mitigate supply risks.

The rare earth market's thin trading volumes and opaque pricing mechanisms make it particularly susceptible to volatility in response to supply chain disruptions, potentially creating both risks and opportunities for investors.

How Could Australian Companies Benefit?

ASX-Listed Companies With North American Exposure

Accelerated Project Development: Government support could fast-track permitting and financing processes that typically delay mining projects.

Premium Pricing: Non-Chinese rare earth products may command premium pricing from manufacturers prioritizing supply security over cost.

Enhanced Government Support: Australian projects align with both domestic defence-critical materials strategy and U.S.-Australia defense cooperation, potentially unlocking additional support mechanisms.

Long-Term Offtake Agreements: Western manufacturers seeking supply security may offer favorable long-term purchase agreements to support project development.

What Does This Mean for Global Supply Chains?

Supply Chain Bifurcation

Industry analysts describe the move as accelerating a ""structural bifurcation"" of global supply chains:

China focusing on localizing its rare earth and semiconductor value chains to ensure domestic technological development

Western nations racing to build alternative refining and processing capacity through coordinated investment programs

Creation of parallel ecosystems for critical materials based on geopolitical alignment rather than pure economic efficiency

This bifurcation reflects a fundamental shift from globalized, efficiency-focused supply chains toward regionalized, security-oriented networks.

Western Response Strategies

Western nations are implementing multi-faceted approaches to reduce dependency on Chinese rare earth supplies:

Domestic Production Incentives: The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provides production tax credits of 10% for critical minerals and up to 30% for clean energy manufacturing, specifically prioritizing North American and Free Trade Agreement partner sourcing.

Strategic Partnerships: The Minerals Security Partnership (14 nations) and bilateral agreements prioritize supply from democratic allies, accepting potentially higher costs in exchange for supply security.

Technology Development: Western governments are funding alternative processing methods, with the U.S. Department of Energy's ARPA-E program supporting research into rare earth alternatives.

Stockpile Creation: Japan's approach to maintaining approximately 60 days of rare earth consumption in strategic reserves may be adopted by other nations concerned about supply disruptions.

Trade Policy Alignment: Democratic allies are increasingly coordinating their approaches to critical minerals energy security, creating a more unified response to China's market dominance.

The European Commission exemplifies this approach, targeting processing at least 40% of critical raw materials consumed within member states by 2030 and recycling 15% of critical materials. This represents a strategic shift from near-complete import dependence for several rare earth elements.

What Are The Long-Term Implications?

Reshaping of Global Resource Geopolitics

China's export controls are accelerating several fundamental shifts in how nations approach resource security:

Friend-Shoring Acceleration: Countries are increasingly prioritizing politically aligned trading partners for critical materials, even at premium prices.

Premium for Stable Jurisdictions: Mining projects in politically stable, Western-aligned countries may receive higher valuations due to their strategic importance.

Government Intervention: Increased direct government involvement in rare earth supply chains through investment, regulation, and strategic stockpiles.

New International Frameworks: Development of new multi-lateral agreements governing critical minerals trade among like-minded nations.

According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, ""friend-shoring"" involves preferential trade and investment relationships among politically aligned nations. For critical minerals, this includes formal partnerships like the U.S.-Australia-Japan-India Quad partnership and bilateral agreements prioritizing supply from democratic allies.

Investment Considerations

The emerging rare earth landscape creates several investment implications:

Supply-Demand Imbalance: The International Energy Agency projects demand for rare earth elements could increase by 3-7 times by 2040 under various clean energy transition scenarios, creating potential for sustained higher prices.

Capital Requirements: Developing alternative supply chains requires substantial investment—approximately $15-25 billion over the next decade to meaningfully diversify global rare earth supply chains.

Value Chain Integration: Companies controlling multiple stages of the rare earth value chain may receive premium valuations due to their strategic importance.

Acquisition Activity: Established mining companies and OEMs may acquire early-stage rare earth projects to secure future supply.

Technology Development Impacts

The supply chain disruption is driving several technological responses:

Materials Research: Manufacturers are increasing funding for research into reduced rare earth usage or complete alternatives.

Recycling Expansion: Urban mining initiatives are targeting electronic waste, although current battery recycling advancements remain below 1% due to technical and economic challenges.

Resource Efficiency: Product designers are optimizing rare earth usage to minimize supply vulnerabilities.

Alternative Technologies: Development of non-rare earth motors, magnets, and other components that can perform similarly to rare earth-based systems.

How Can Investors Position For This New Reality?

Key Investment Criteria for Rare Earth Companies

Investors evaluating rare earth opportunities should consider several factors:

Geographic Location: Projects in politically stable, Western-aligned jurisdictions with clear permitting pathways

Development Stage: Near-term producers with defined timelines to production face lower execution risk than early-stage exploration projects

Processing Capability: Companies with refining expertise or established processing partnerships can capture more of the value chain

Customer Relationships: Established connections with Western manufacturers provide revenue visibility and potential financing support

Government Support: Projects aligned with national security interests may receive expedited permitting, financing assistance, and offtake agreements

Risk Factors to Consider

Despite the positive investment thesis, significant challenges remain:

Technical Complexity: Rare earth processing involves chemically intensive, environmentally challenging processes requiring specialized expertise developed over decades in China.

Capital Intensity: Establishing rare earth refining capacity requires $500 million to $1.5 billion in capital investment and 5-7 years for facility development.

Potential Oversupply: If too many Western projects advance simultaneously, new capacity could eventually exceed demand, pressuring prices.

Regulatory Hurdles: Environmental permits for processing facilities remain challenging in many Western jurisdictions due to concerns about radioactive byproducts.

Chinese Counter-Strategies: China could potentially lower prices temporarily to make Western projects uneconomical or increase investment in rare earth resources outside its borders.

FAQs About China's Rare Earth Export Controls

What specific rare earth elements are now under export control?

The latest restrictions add holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium to the previously restricted elements (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium). These elements are critical for applications ranging from fiber optic communications and lasers to specialized glass and nuclear technologies.

How quickly could Western supply chains adapt to these restrictions?

Developing alternative rare earth supply chains typically requires 5-10 years for new mines and 3-5 years for processing facilities. However, accelerated government funding and existing projects could potentially reduce these timeframes. The most immediate responses will likely come from existing producers expanding capacity rather than entirely new operations.

Will these restrictions affect consumer product prices?

While rare earths represent a small portion of final product costs (typically less than 2% of an EV's cost), sustained supply constraints could eventually impact pricing for products like EVs, smartphones, and wind turbines if manufacturers cannot secure alternative supplies. The more immediate impact may be on product availability rather than direct price increases.

How might China respond to Western efforts to develop alternative supplies?

China has several potential counter-strategies, including temporarily lowering rare earth prices to make Western projects uneconomical, increasing investment in rare earth resources outside China, developing new technologies that reduce reliance on restricted elements, or offering preferential access to manufacturers who maintain production facilities within China.

What role will recycling play in addressing rare earth supply challenges?

Recycling currently accounts for less than 1% of rare earth supply but could grow significantly as new technologies and economic incentives develop. Urban mining of electronic waste represents a potentially significant future source, though technical challenges include the low concentrations of rare earths in individual products and complex material mixtures.

Queensland led state-level capacity additions with 2.2GW of new projects, followed by New South Wales contributing 2GW to the national pipeline. The state’s solar sector has also demonstrated strong operational performance, with utility-scale plants dominating performance rankings and consistently topping utility performance metrics.

Solar PV additions totalled 800MW, primarily from smaller hybrid projects that combine solar generation with battery storage. The hybrid approach has become increasingly common as developers seek to optimise project economics and grid integration capabilities.

This is perhaps best showcased in the latest Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) Tender 4 results, which saw 6.6GW of renewables awarded long-term contracts, many of which comprise solar-plus-storage configurations.

Utility-scale battery storage additions make up 78% of new capacity

Utility-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) comprised 78% of total capacity additions during September, with 4.5GW distributed across 24 individual assets.

The dominance of battery storage projects reflects the growing recognition of energy storage as essential infrastructure for grid stability as renewable energy penetration increases across the National Electricity Market (NEM).

ACEnergy emerged as a major contributor via its Croydon solar-plus-storage project, which combines 625MW of solar generation with a 500MW/2,000Wh battery system.

Lightsource bp also advanced its storage portfolio with a 49MW/562MWh DC-coupled BESS addition at the Goulburn River Solar Farm. At the same time, Neoen achieved a milestone with the completion of the 270MW/540MWh Western Downs BESS Stage 2.

The system brings Neoen’s Western Downs facility’s total capacity to 540MW/1,080MWh, establishing it as Australia’s largest operational battery project, Shukla said.

Developer Tilt Renewables also contributed to the battery storage expansion with its 100MW/200MWh Latrobe Valley BESS, adding grid-scale storage capacity in Victoria’s transition away from coal-fired generation.

Wind energy additions proved minimal during September, with only Green Wind Renewables’ 450MW Mahogany Wind Farm in Western Australia contributing to the technology segment.

Shukla said the limited wind activity contrasts with stronger performance in previous months and reflects the project-specific nature of development announcements.

Strong approval and deal activity

Project approvals exceeded 3GW during September, indicating continued regulatory progress despite slower development pipeline announcement activity.

Federal EPBC approvals advanced several major developments, including ACEN’s 943MW Valley of the Winds project and the 1.3GW Pottinger Energy Park developed by AGL and Someva Renewables.

Edify Energy secured federal approval for its 300MW Nowingi solar-plus-storage project, adding to the company’s substantial development pipeline before its acquisition by La Caisse.

State-level fast-track approvals included TrinaSolar’s Killawarra Hybrid project in New South Wales and Pacific Green’s 1GW Portland Energy Park in Victoria.

GPU hardware is becoming more efficient each year, and much of the electricity in new data centres will come from renewables.
Transparency is vital Many of the figures circulating about AI energy use are unreliable because AI firms disclose so little.","OpenAI’s recent rollout of its new video generator Sora 2 marks a watershed moment in AI. Its ability to generate minutes of hyper-realistic footage from a few lines of text is astonishing, and has raised immediate concerns about truth in politics and journalism.

But Sora 2 is rolling out slowly because of its enormous computational demands, which point to an equally pressing question about generative AI itself: What are its true environmental costs? Will video generation make them much worse?

The recent launch of the Stargate Project — a US$500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX — to build massive AI data centres in the United States underscores what’s at stake. As companies race to expand computing capacity on this scale, AI’s energy use is set to soar.

The debate over AI’s environment impact remains one of the most fraught in tech policy. Depending on what we read, AI is either an ecological crisis in the making or a rounding error in global energy use. As AI moves rapidly into video, clarity on its footprint is more urgent than ever.

Two competing narratives

From one perspective, AI is rapidly becoming a major strain on the world’s energy and water systems.

Alex de Vries-Gao, a researcher who has long tracked the electricity use of bitcoin mining, noted in mid-2025 that AI was on track to surpass it. He estimated that AI already accounted for about 20 per cent of global data-center power consumption; this is likely to double by year’s end.

According to the International Energy Agency, data centres used up to 1.5 per cent of global electricity consumption last year, with consumption growing four times faster than total global demand. The IEA predicts that data centres will more than double their use by 2030, with AI processing the leading driver of growth.

Research cited by MIT’s Technology Review concurs, estimating that by 2028, AI’s power draw could exceed “all electricity currently used by US data centers” — enough to power 22 per cent of U.S. households each year.

‘Huge’ quantities

AI’s water use is also striking. Data centres rely on ultra-pure water to keep servers cool and free of impurities. Researchers estimated that training GPT-3 would have used up 700,000 litres of freshwater at Microsoft’s American facilities. They predict that global AI demand could reach four to six billion cubic metres annually by 2027.

Hardware turnover adds further strain. A 2023 study found that chip fabrication requires “huge quantities” of ultra-pure water, energy-intensive chemical processes and rare minerals such as cobalt and tantalum. Manufacturing the high-end graphics processing units — the engines that drive AI boom — has a much larger carbon footprint than most consumer electronics.

Generating an image uses the electricity of a microwave running for five seconds, while making a five-second video clip takes up as much as a microwave running for over an hour.

The next leap from text and image to high-definition video could dramatically increase AI’s impact. Early testing bears this out — finding that energy use for text-to-video models quadruples when video length doubles.

The case for perspective

Others see the alarm as overstated. Analysts at the Center for Data Innovation, a technology and policy think tank, argue that many estimates about AI energy use rely on faulty extrapolations. GPU hardware is becoming more efficient each year, and much of the electricity in new data centres will come from renewables.

Recent benchmarking puts AI’s footprint in context. Producing a typical chatbot Q&A consumes about 2.9 watt-hours (Wh) — roughly 10 times a Google search. Google recently claimed that a typical Gemini prompt uses only 0.24 Wh and 0.25 mL of water, though independent experts note those numbers omit indirect energy and water used in power generation.

Context is key. An hour of high-definition video streaming on Netflix uses roughly 100 times more energy than generating a text response. An AI query’s footprint is tiny, yet data centres now process billions daily, and more demanding video queries are on the horizon.

Jevons paradox

It helps to distinguish between training and use of AI. Training frontier models such as GPT-4 or Claude Opus 3 required thousands of graphics chips running for months, consuming gigawatt-hours of power.

Using a model takes up a tiny amount of energy per query, but this happens billions of times a day. Eventually, energy from using AI will likely surpass training.

The least visible cost may come from hardware production. Each new generation of chips demands new fabrication lines, heavy mineral inputs and advanced cooling. Italian economist Marcello Ruberti observes that “each upgrade cycle effectively resets the carbon clock” as fabs rebuild highly purified equipment from scratch.

And even if AI models become more efficient, total energy keeps climbing. In economics, this is known as the Jevons paradox: in 19th-century Britain, the consumption of coal increased as the cost of extracting it decreased. As AI researchers have noted, as costs per-query fall, developers are incentivized to find new ways to embed AI into every product. The result is more data centres, chips and total resource use.

A problem of scale

Is AI an ecological menace or a manageable risk? The truth lies somewhere in between.

A single prompt uses negligible energy, but the systems enabling it — vast data centres, constant chip manufacturing, round-the-clock cooling — are reshaping global energy and water patterns.

The International Energy Agency’s latest outlook projects that data-centre power demand could reach 1,400 terawatt-hours by 2030. This is the equivalent of adding several mid-sized countries to the world’s grid. AI will count for a quarter of that growth.

Transparency is vital

Many of the figures circulating about AI energy use are unreliable because AI firms disclose so little. The limited data they release often employ inconsistent metrics or offset accounting that obscures real impacts.

One obvious fix would be to mandate disclosure rules: standardized, location-based reporting of the energy and water used to train and operate models. Europe’s Artificial Intelligence Act requires developers of “high-impact” systems to document computation and energy use.

Similar measures elsewhere could guide where new data centres are built, favouring regions with abundant renewables and water — this could encourage longer hardware lifecycles instead of annual chip refreshes.

Balancing creativity and cost

Generative AI can help unlock extraordinary creativity and provide real utility. But each “free” image, paragraph or video has hidden material and energy costs.

Acknowledging those costs doesn’t mean we need to halt innovation. It means we should demand transparency about how great the environmental cost is, and who pays it, in order to address AI’s environmental impacts.

As Sora 2 begins to fill social feeds with highly realistic visuals, the question won’t be whether AI uses more energy than Netflix, but whether we can expand our digital infrastructure responsibly enough to make room for both.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/695410/original/file-20251009-56-py3wn3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C247%2C3967%2C1983&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-10 11:00:59.757811

This new laboratory, located in the Auburn Hills Oakland Technology Park complex near Detroit, places UL Solutions at the heart of Michigan’s automotive and clean energy ecosystem. Being so close to Detroit, a city known as the automotive capital of the world, positions UL Solutions in a prime location to connect with a diverse clientele, especially those affiliated with the rapidly growing EV market.

LuxWall, Inc.

When LuxWall, Inc. opened the doors to its state-of-the-art production facility in Litchfield on August 12, 2024, it wasn’t just another factory opening — it was a significant leap forward in the clean energy movement. The world’s first high-volume vacuum-insulating glass production facility is already making waves.

Founded in 2016 in Ypsilanti, a suburb of Ann Arbor, LuxWall’s mission has always been clear: to push the boundaries of energy efficiency through innovative materials. But the decision to expand in Michigan was about more than just business — it was about honoring its roots. Despite competitive offers from neighboring states, LuxWall chose Michigan, a place that not only fosters its growth but remains steadfast in cultivating an equally pro-business and suitable environment.

The Litchfield facility, with its 87 workers, is already producing cutting-edge, energy-efficient windows designed to help buildings reduce heating and cooling costs while minimizing their carbon footprint. This $20 million investment represents the first phase of a much larger vision that will see 450 new jobs created across Michigan as part of a broader $165 million investment. The company already has plans to evaluate Detroit for a second facility that will triple production capacity.

This project is supported by $6 million in state grants and over $31 million in federal funding, underscoring the importance of this venture not only to LuxWall but to the State of Michigan and its growing green tech economy.

Robert Bosch, LLC

Robert Bosch, LLC, a part of the Bosch Group, has a long history of developing advanced solutions across a variety of industries, including mobility solutions, industrial technology, consumer goods, and energy and building technology.

Recently, Bosch has turned its focus to the emerging clean energy sector, investing $13.7 million to expand its Farmington Hills headquarters with a cutting-edge Regional Hydrogen Research and Development Hub. Backed by a $500,000 performance-based grant through the Michigan Business Development Program (MBDP), Bosch plans to upgrade and restructure 2,200 sq. ft. of existing space dedicated to driving advancements in hydrogen technologies, including Bosch’s Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell power module, a highly integrated and compact system solution for fuel cell-electric commercial vehicles. The new hub will include facilities to test hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen combustion engines, as well as produce onsite hydrogen via water electrolysis.

While Bosch operates in over 100 locations across North America, the decision to expand in Farmington Hills was influenced by several factors unique to Michigan. Matt Thorington, engineering manager of hydrogen stacks and systems at Bosch USA, emphasizes the state’s ongoing commitment to hydrogen development, including its involvement in the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen (MachH2), as a contributing component.

This regional initiative supports the development of clean hydrogen technologies and fosters collaboration to build a sustainable hydrogen economy — an effort that resonates deeply with Bosch’s own goals.

“Hydrogen will play a role in a diversified mix of powertrain options in the future,” says Thorington. “Our work at the Farmington Hills location underscores our commitment to advancing hydrogen technology, enabling us to deliver innovative solutions that support our customers' needs and drive progress toward the hydrogen economy. We have a strong team developing here and by locating our knowledge close to our existing powertrain expertise, we benefit from the broad system knowledge that Bosch has when it comes to powertrain. Having a site where the completion of this hydrogen cycle is possible is key to taking advantage of the entire ecosystem from production to offtake.”

Carolina Renewable Products (CRP), a clean energy company, announced it is establishing operations in Orangeburg County.

The company’s $280 million investment will create 155 new jobs, according to Gov. Henry McMaster’s office.

“South Carolina has a rich forestry and agricultural tradition, and we are proud to harness that strength to fuel a cleaner, more resilient future,” said Carolina Renewable Products CEO Robert Bryan.

Bryan added, “Our facility will not only provide a reliable outlet for local forestry but also create products that aid South Carolina’s energy independence and help farmers, growers and businesses thrive while advancing the state’s leadership in renewable energy.”

CRP converts sustainable wood biomass into renewable diesel, biochar and wood vinegar.

The company offers a modular and cost-effective design, delivering low-carbon fuel solutions while supporting local agriculture and forestry.

CRP recently purchased its inaugural site, at 546 Prosperity Drive in Orangeburg, which will be a next-generation biomass-to-renewable diesel facility and serve as the company’s headquarters and training hub.

Operations are expected to be online in late 2026. Those interested in joining CRP should contact jobs@carolinarenewableproducts.com.

The state’s Coordinating Council for Economic Development approved job development credits related to the project.

The council also awarded a $750,000 Closing Fund grant to Orangeburg County to assist with the costs of site preparation and building construction.

“Carolina Renewable Products is making a major investment in our state and our agribusiness industry, and it couldn’t come at a better time,” said state Commissioner of Agriculture Hugh Weathers.

He added, “This new facility and training hub will support South Carolina timber growers and local farms while protecting natural resources.”

Pratt Industries, a provider of custom packaging solutions, announced it is expanding its York County operations with a new manufacturing facility.

The company’s $92.5 million investment will create 116 new jobs, according to the South Carolina Department of Commerce.

“We are excited to expand our operations in the great state of South Carolina and the mid-Atlantic region,” said Pratt Industries Global Executive Chairman Anthony Pratt. “Our new facility supports our continued commitment to invest in recycling, clean energy infrastructure and American manufacturing jobs.”

“Pratt Industries investing $92.5 million to establish a new facility in York County is a big win for South Carolina’s recycling industry,” said Gov.

The outlook for the U.S. economy among financial decision-makers improved somewhat in the third quarter of 2025, as uncertainty declined.

However, concerns about the impact of tariffs on prices and business performance continued to weigh on firms, according to the CFO Survey, a collaboration of Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business and the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Atlanta.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond represents the Fifth District, which includes the states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, and most of West Virginia, along with Washington, D.C.

Uncertainty remains a top concern of financial decision-makers, but it dropped in importance from second highest in the second quarter to seventh in the third quarter.

“Likely, it is the fall in uncertainty that helped boost optimism in the third quarter,” said Sonya Ravindranath Waddell, vice president and economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

Waddell added, “The return of optimism and GDP expectations to levels more in line with the beginning of 2024 is reassuring. But concern about tariffs is real and impactful for many CFOs in the survey.”

For the third consecutive quarter, tariffs and trade policy were the top concern among survey respondents, followed by monetary policy and inflation. The firms that cited tariffs as a top concern were notably more downbeat about the economy and their own firm.

Specifically, these firms:

* Were less optimistic about the U.S. economy (59.9 for the tariff-concerned group versus 64.3 for those unconcerned).

* Projected lower real GDP growth for the year ahead (1.6 percent versus 2.0 percent).

* Had lower revenue and employment growth expectations for 2025.

* Forecasted notably higher input cost growth in 2025 and 2026.

* Expected higher price growth in 2025 and 2026.

Overall, CFOs projected that tariffs would have a big impact on price growth: On average, price growth would be about 30 percent lower in 2025 and roughly 25 percent lower in 2026 without the addition of tariffs, indicating that firms expect to grapple with tariff-related price increases into 2026.

Meanwhile, almost a quarter of firms continued to report that they will decrease capital spending in 2025 due to tariffs.

The CFO Survey is issued by Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business and the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Atlanta.

The latest survey, as well as historical data and a detailed analysis of the impact of the election on the corporate outlook, can be found at www.cfosurvey.org.

The city of Orangeburg said City Council has passed the Hate Intimidation Ordinance, aimed at protecting residents from acts of intimidation or harassment based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and other protected classes.

The ordinance establishes clear penalties for violations, including:

* A fine of up to $500.

* A misdemeanor charge or up to 30 days in jail, or both at the discretion of the judge.

Mayor Michael C. Butler emphasizes the significance of the legislation:

“Passing the Hate Intimidation Ordinance is a major step in ensuring that every resident of Orangeburg feels safe, respected, and valued in our community. Our city stands firmly against acts of hate and intimidation, and this ordinance reinforces that commitment.”

The city of Orangeburg encourages residents to report any incidents of hate intimidation to local law enforcement.

Officials said the ordinance reflects the city’s ongoing dedication to public safety, civil rights, and a welcoming environment for all citizens.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, praised the move.

“We welcome the passage of this important ordinance to combat hate crimes,” said CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper. “We again urge South Carolina lawmakers to follow suit and pass an anti-hate crime bill statewide.”

‘Pueblo is being robbed‘ Elected officials and community leaders in Pueblo County are not happy with the plan.","As Colorado darts toward a future powered by “clean” energy, a battle is brewing in Pueblo, where coal closures, union jobs and lost tax revenue collide with a community demanding a solution as its power plants are a primary target for a shutdown.

Between 2025 and 2031, six more coal-fired power plants in Colorado are scheduled to be shut down or converted to another energy source, such as natural gas.

With more than 800 jobs to be affected, another three plants are on the list for future closures.

The closures are raising alarm bells, notably for the unions that count the power plant workers as members. A group has put forward an action plan called the Colorado Energy Compact, calling for a “balanced and sustainable energy policy” and a transition that is “are “clear, stable, and grounded in the realities of our grid, our workforce, and our economy.”

Besides unions and jobs, taxes paid to local communities are also a major worry, with revenue ranging from 12% of the total collected in Pueblo County to as high as 33.7% in Moffat County.

The compact is drawing together more than two dozen organizations and individual experts in energy, labor and public policy, according to Action Colorado’s Sara Blackhurst.

The plan is designed as both a tool and an accountability check for lawmakers and regulators, focusing on a state standard that, the compact maintains, should be technology-neutral and which supports a balanced mix of current and emerging technologies. The goal, the compact said, is to ensure a transition that benefits Colorado’s environmental and economic future, protects families, and sustains local economies.

The fight over Comanche plants

In Pueblo, residents are fighting back to keep the Comanche power plants open. They oppose wind or solar energy, which they claim is unreliable.

The Comanche station just south of Pueblo is a 695-acre site with a rail system, water contracts, transmission capacity and injection, according to a report from the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee. It includes three coal-generating units “that have provided highly-paid, family supporting jobs and tax payments of tens of millions of dollars for decades,” the report said.

Comanche 1 closed in 2022. Comanche 2 will close in 2025. Comanche 3, which opened in 2010, will close no later than Jan. 1, 2031, about 10 years ahead of schedule.

The controversy surrounding the Comanche power plants comes at a time when the Trump administration has withdrawn support for “clean” energy, cutting over $500 million in grants to Colorado companies and universities. Additionally, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a Colorado native, said he wants to “unleash American energy at home and abroad.” Wright said America should focus on ensuring a wide array of cheap, abundant and sustainable energy sources that include geothermal, nuclear, oil and gas.

The campaign to save the Comanche plants suggests a major battle is brewing over the two Xcel units in Pueblo.

The Colorado Fiscal Institute, in a Sept. 2024 report, said the closure of Comanche 3 alone will cost about 77 jobs and about $31 million annually in tax revenue to the Pueblo community.

The same report said the Environmental Protection Agency’s CO-Benefits Risk Assessment tool estimated that closing Comanche 3 would result in avoided health costs benefiting Colorado between $52 million and $67 million annually, with Pueblo County specifically benefiting between $4.6 million and $5.6 million.

The report downplayed the benefits of nuclear energy as a replacement energy source and instead recommended wind and solar.

On the opposite side, the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, a group initiated by Xcel Energy and made up of community leaders, has looked at potential replacements for the energy sources at Comanche 3.

The PIESAC group is led by attorney Frances Koncilja and investor Corinne Koehler; members Jerry Bellah, vice president of IBEW local 8; Sara Blackhurst of Action Colorado; Russell De Salvo, who heads the Pueblo Depot Authority; Patty Erjavec, former president of Pueblo Community College; former judge Dennis Maes; Timothy Mottet, a former president of CSU-Pueblo; Duane Nava, head of the Greater Pueblo Chamber; Jeff Shaw, president of Pueblo Economic Development; and former Pueblo County Commissioner Chris Wiseman.

The group’s report, which came out in January 2024, looked at all the impacts, noting “the Pueblo community has supported these early closures and done more to reduce emissions in the state than any other community.”

The report said the economic hit from closing Comanche 3 would total $196 million to Pueblo and result in the loss of hundreds of high-wage, career-level jobs. Pueblo would lose more than $845 million in tax revenues by 2070, the report added.

Its proposed solution: “Of all the technologies we studied, only advanced nuclear generation will make Pueblo whole and also provide a path to prosperity.”

The group believes that nuclear power would support 200 to 300 permanent high-paying jobs and generate $95 million in local property taxes.

The backup plan is combined cycle natural gas plant with carbon capture for 20 to 25 long-term jobs and about $16.5 million in annual tax revenue.

Wind and solar would generate “a handful of non-union jobs” and about $2 million annually in tax revenue, PIESAC said.

‘Just transition’

In August, the Public Utilities Commission deliberated on the first phase of a $15 billion “just transition” energy resource plan submitted by Xcel, Colorado’s largest utility company and operator of the Pueblo plants, that includes the future of the Comanche operations.

The plan is tied to a settlement agreement reached in 2022 between Xcel and partners that include state agencies, environmental groups, local governments, including the city of Pueblo and Pueblo County, and large customers, such as Walmart, and labor unions.

The “just transition” plan would add more than 6,000 megawatts of new generation and storage. Over the next five years, Xcel would add 10,000 megawatts of new generation and storage capacity. Final approval of both phases of the plan, according to Xcel, is expected sometime next year.

The settlement agreement aims to keep Pueblo “whole” regarding tax revenue by compensating the county for property tax revenue due to the acceleration of the retirement date of Comanche 3.

During the meeting, PUC Chair Eric Blank called the “just transition” plan the “single largest resource acquisition in the history of Colorado and an over $15 billion commitment from customers.”

The plan’s cost raised worries among the commission about its potential for “exorbitant” hikes in utility rates to ratepayers.

The PUC said it would issue a final decision on the first phase in the coming weeks.

In a statement issued by the Colorado Energy Office after the meeting, Gov. Jared Polis said he is “enthusiastic about the plan to save people money and achieve faster pollution reductions while bringing new jobs to communities and investing in rural Colorado.”

Polis added that “the free market is driving the transition to clean energy in a way that will help people hold on to more of their hard-earned money, clean our air, achieve energy independence, and continue our state’s economic growth.”

For its part, Xcel said it is committed to supporting its workforce both in Pueblo and Hayden with “reskilling and retraining programs, and efforts to retain employees in both the short and long term.” The company also said it is committed to addressing the tax revenue issue and listening to the voices of local leaders.

‘Pueblo is being robbed‘

Elected officials and community leaders in Pueblo County are not happy with the plan.

At the end of August, Pueblo County commissioners fought back, telling the PUC through a filing that they had invested limited financial resources and time to participate in the PUC’s proceeding, “as well as the promised follow-on ‘Pueblo Just Transition Solicitation’ to ensure that the residents of Pueblo County would receive a meaningful ‘Just Transition’ from a coal community to a high tech clean energy hub.”

The county also spent $2 million on the PIESAC study to develop clean energy generation options for Pueblo, and if implemented, those options, they said, would render Pueblo “whole.”

The commissioners claimed other partners in a settlement agreement, including the Colorado Energy Office, ignored Pueblo’s “bargained-for solutions.” They accused the Colorado Energy Office, the Office of Just Transitions and the Utility Consumer Advocate, which is part of PUC, of failing to act in good faith, including failing to consider the option of small modular nuclear reactors as a replacement energy source.

The commissioners asked that Comanche 2 and Comanche 3 continue to operate, saying they would approach the Trump administration and Wright, the energy secretary, “until replacement generation is constructed in Pueblo.”

“The (PUC) has made it clear that it is a futile exercise to participate in these proceedings,” the county commissioners wrote.

The local electrical worker union in Pueblo also weighed in through a letter submitted to U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Grand Junction, whose district includes Pueblo.

In a Sept. 10 letter, Jerry Bellah, international vice president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, told Hurd his group supports green energy “but that the green jobs being offered to Pueblo do not come close to replacing the jobs that are currently at Comanche.”

Bellah said the handful of solar farm jobs are low-paying positions.

“For too long, the hardworking men and women of the IBEW have been ignored with false promises of middle-class, family-supporting jobs in exchange for our support in closing coal plants,” Bellah wrote. “We are smart enough, however, to know when we are getting the shaft, which is what is being done to the Pueblo community and the workers at Comanche. We all deserve better than this.”

Bellah noted Hurd had reached out to Trump to keep Comanche open and said his group would “support any elected leader, regardless of party, who supports jobs, and we will oppose any elected leader who votes to end our jobs.”

Pueblo County voters have now twice voted for Trump over his Democratic opponents.

Blackhurst of Action Colorado added that the union jobs issue is the primary reason for the energy compact.

“Pueblo is being robbed,” she told Colorado Politics. “They (state government) have made labor workers acceptable collateral,” as well as the communities in which they live and work.

The Colorado Energy Compact

Led by Action Colorado, the compact’s authors intend for it to provide a roadmap for building an energy future that is “ambitious, achievable, and rooted in Colorado’s best interests.”

It focuses on five areas — affordability and economic competitiveness; labor, community and “just transition;” energy system reliability and feasibility; legal and regulatory integrity; and transparency and accountability.

The first focus area, on affordability, would look at the cost to consumers, protecting the tax revenue base and long-term economic resilience.

The second focus — on labor and community — said any legislation or regulation should ensure comparable wages and benefits, as well as “enforceable” retraining, union participation and local hiring. It also calls for policies that allow workers to stay in their current communities.

A survey conducted by Colorado Mountain College and the state Office of Just Transition, and as reported by the Steamboat Pilot in March, said 61% of workers at the Craig Xcel plant and the Colowyo and Trapper mines want to stay in their local communities if they transition to new jobs.

The third focus — on energy system reliability — calls for a “realistic” phasing of timelines tied to permitting, workforce readiness and infrastructure — “not political deadlines.” It also recognizes the role of natural gas and emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, geothermal and nuclear power, which was added to the state’s list of “clean” energy technologies by the legislature in the 2025 session.

In the focus on legal and regulatory integrity, the compact said terms like “clean energy” and “eligible technologies” must be defined in law, not by regulators.

Additionally, transparency and accountability must include an open stakeholder process, with full notice and “without surprises” and models made public and independently validated, the compact said. It should also include a regular public review.

“Without accountability,” the compact said, “even well-intentioned rules look like closed-door deals and public trust collapses.”

Blackhurst told Colorado Politics that the groups behind the compact are sharing it with lawmakers, hoping it would provide a tool for reviewing legislation in the future.

That’s critical, Blackhurst said, as the PUC is going through a sunset review in the 2026 session.

A fact sheet provided to the Town of Gilchrist earlier this year stated that the compact, unlike the governor’s “top-down” Clean Energy Planning process, is more inclusive and offers a framework rooted in local control.

It is not a lobbying effort, the fact sheet insisted. But “without stakeholder-driven guardrails, the direction will be set by others — without you in the room,” it said.

Gilchrist town councilmembers unanimously approved joining the compact in August, along with providing some financial support.

Office of Just Transition

Approved by legislation in 2019, the Office of Just Transition focuses on economic development for communities affected by the closure of coal mines.

For the past several years, the office, with 3.5 full-time employees, has spent about $15 million annually on community development, worker education, and training for those areas.

What’s missing, many said, is wage parity — what workers earn when they transition from high-paying jobs to whatever comes next.

The BlueGreen Alliance, in a 2023 report, pointed to the wage parity issue.

When coal mines close, workers are vulnerable to job loss, and many will struggle to find comparable employment that aligns with their existing skills, experience, and compensation levels, according to the report.

The office has made progress in economic development by supporting small businesses and entrepreneurship, the report added. But the opportunities to find local “high-road” jobs for former coal workers have been missed.

“The quality of the job — such as the benefits offered like health insurance, a retirement plan, and workers’ compensation benefits, or wage parity to previous employment — is not being considered in program development or implementation” for OJT, the alliance said.

‘Extreme claims‘

In a response to Pueblo commissioners on Sept. 12, several environmental groups said any decision by PUC to change votes would lead to further controversy and litigation over procedural improprieties.

That’s a reference to comments by Blank, the PUC chairman, in a Sept. 4 hearing that he is considering taking “another look at some of the labor issues raised in the county’s response,” as well as revisiting a prior vote tied to Xcel’s plans for “credits for resource located in communities with retiring coal plants,” a main concern raised by Pueblo County.

The credits are part of a Near Term Procurement request by Xcel — a solicitation for the development of energy generation that would draw federal and state tax credits.

The coalition of environmental groups includes GreenLatinos, the Sierra Club, Vote Solar, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Physicians for Social Responsibility Colorado.

“Moreover, promising to revisit votes in response to baseless accusations of political bias and extreme claims (including a threat to invite federal interference) sets problematic precedent and may incentivize parties to make similarly baseless and extreme claims in the future to get the Commission’s attention when they are displeased with the Commissioner’s oral deliberations and decisions,” the coalition said.

The coalition, in particular, took issue with Blank’s statements and the Sept. 4 hearing, which the group said hinted at “unfairness,” since the PUC had already deliberated on the Xcel plan in August and failed to provide opportunities to other parties to address the issues raised by Pueblo County.

By revisiting votes on the Xcel plan, the PUC would reward Pueblo County for “flouting the Commission’s well-established hearing and deliberations process” without allowing other parties the same opportunity, the coalition said.",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f4d16eb3761c62277059baa5a2ab669e.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 21:59:38.502911

At least $5 billion has already been spent on investments such as the renewable power operator Neoen, the energy developer Geronimo Power, and the Indian wind and solar giant Evren. “Energy demand is growing fast, driven by the growth of artificial intelligence as well as electrification in industry and transportation,” Connor Teskey, Brookfield’s president and renewable power chief, said in a press release. “Against this backdrop we need an ‘any and all’ approach to energy investment that will continue to favor low carbon resources.”

2. Orsted’s stock issuance raises $9.4 billion

Orsted has been facing down headwinds for months. The Danish offshore wind giant has absorbed the Trump administration’s wrath as the White House deployed multiple federal agencies to thwart progress on building seaward turbines in the Northeastern U.S. Then lower-than-forecast winds this year dinged Orsted’s projected earnings for 2025. When the company issued new stock to fund its efforts to fight back against Trump, the energy giant was forced to sell the shares at a steep discount, as I wrote in this newsletter last month. Despite all that, the company has managed to raise the money it needed. On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Orsted had raised $9.4 billion. Existing shareholders subscribed for 99.3% of the new shares on offer, but demand for the remaining shares was “extraordinarily high,” the company said.

That wasn’t enough to stave off job cuts. Early Thursday morning, the company announced plans to lay off 2,000 employees between now and 2027. The cuts represented roughly one-quarter of the company’s 8,000-person global workforce. “This is a necessary consequence of our decision to focus our business and the fact that we'll be finalizing our large construction portfolio in the coming years — which is why we'll need fewer employees,” Rasmus Errboe, Orsted’s chief executive, said in a statement published on CNBC. ""At the same time, we want to create a more efficient and flexible organization and a more competitive Orsted, ready to bid on new value-accretive offshore wind projects.”

3. Gavin Newsom blocks permitting reform for geothermal in California

California operates the world’s largest geothermal power station, The Geysers, and generates up to 5% of its power from the Earth’s heat. But the state is far behind its neighbors on developing new plants based on next-generation technology. Most of the startups racing to commercialize novel methods are headquartered or building pilot plants in states such as Utah, Nevada, and Texas. A pair of bills to make doing business in California easier for geothermal companies was supposed to change that. Yet while Governor Gavin Newsom signed one statute into law that makes it easier for state regulators to certify geothermal plants, he vetoed a permitting reform bill to which the industry had pegged its hopes. “Every geothermal developer and energy org I talked to was excited about this bill,” Thomas Hochman, who heads the energy program at the right-leaning Foundation for American Innovation, wrote in a post on X. “The legislature did everything right, passing it unanimously. They even reworked it to accommodate certain classic California concerns, such as prevailing wage requirements.”

In a letter announcing his veto, the governor claimed that the law would have added new fees for geothermal projects. But an executive at Zanskar — the startup that, as Heatmap’s Katie Brigham reported last month, is using new technology to locate and tap into conventional geothermal resources — called the governor’s argument “weak sauce.” Far from burdening the industry, Zanskar co-founder Joel Edwards said on X, “this was a clean shot to accelerate geothermal today, and he whiffed it.”

4. Generate Capital lays off staff after replacing CEO

Last month, Generate Capital trumpeted the appointment of its first new chief executive in its 11-year history as the leading infrastructure investment firm sought to realign its approach to survive a tumultuous time in clean-energy financing. Less publicly, as Katie wrote in a scoop last night, it also kicked off company-wide job cuts. In an interview with Katie, Jonah Goldman, the firm’s head of external affairs, said the company “grew quickly and made some mistakes,” and now planned to lay off 50 people.

Generate once invested in “leading-edge technologies,” according to co-founder Jigar Shah, who left the firm to serve as the head of the Biden-era DOE Loan Programs Office. That included investments in projects involving fuel cells, anaerobic digesters, and battery storage. But from the outside, he said on the Open Circuits podcast he now co-hosts, the firm appears to have moved away from taking these riskier but potentially more lucrative bets. “They ended up with 38 people in their capital markets team, and their capital markets team went out to the marketplace and said, Hey, we have all this stuff to sell. And the people that they went to said, Well, that’s interesting, but what we really would love is boring community solar.”

5. Boston’s public housing to install heat pumps

Three of New England’s largest public housing agencies signed deals with the heat pump manufacturer Gradient to replace aging electric heaters and air conditioners with the company’s 120-volt, two-way units that provide both heating and cooling. The Boston Housing Authority, New England’s largest public housing agency, will kick off the deal by installing 100 all-weather, two-way units that both heat and cool at the Hassan Apartments, a complex for seniors and adults with disabilities in Boston’s Mattapan neighborhood. The housing authorities in neighboring Chelsea and Lynn — two formerly industrial, working-class cities just outside Boston — will follow the same approach.

Public housing agencies have long served a vital role in helping to popularize new, more efficient appliances. The New York City Housing Authority, for example, is credited with creating the market for efficient mini fridges in the 1990s. Last year, NYCHA — the nation’s largest public housing system — signed a similar deal with Gradient for heat pumps. Months later, as Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo exclusively reported at the time, NYCHA picked a winner in its $32 million contest for an efficient new induction stove for its apartments.

THE KICKER

Three chemists — Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar Yaghi — won the Nobel Prize for “groundbreaking discoveries” that ""may contribute to solving some of humankind’s greatest challenges, from pollution to water scarcity.” Just a few grams of the so-called molecular organic frameworks the scientists pioneered could have as much surface area as a soccer field, which can be used to lock gas molecules in place in carbon capture or harvest freshwater from the atmosphere.

Yet China’s dithering is more than just an environmental failure — it is a governing mistake. China’s weak climate pledge isn’t just bad news for the world; it shows an indecisive leadership that is undermining its country’s own competitiveness by sticking with dirty coal rather than transitioning rapidly to a cleaner future.

The new pledge — known in UN jargon as a nationally determined contribution, or NDC — reveals a disconnect between the government’s official position and the optimistic discourse that now surrounds China’s clean energy sector. China today is described as the world’s first electrostate; it stands at the vanguard of the solar and EV revolution, some say, ready to remake the world order against a coalition of petrostate dinosaurs.

The NDC makes it obvious that the Chinese government does not yet view itself in such a fashion. China might look like an adult, but it more closely resembles a gangly teenager who is still getting used to their body after a growth spurt. As the analyst Kingsmill Bond recently put it on Heatmap’s podcast Shift Key, Chinese clean tech manufacturers have unlocked a cleaner and cheaper path to economic development. It isn’t yet clear that China is brave enough to commit to it. If China is the adult in the room, in other words, we’re screwed.

The devil’s in the details

Let’s start by giving credit where due. For a country that had never offered an absolute emissions reduction target before, Xi’s promise — to cut emissions by 7% to 10% by 2035 — is a kind of progress. But observers expected China to go much further. Researchers at the University of Maryland and the Center for Research on Clean Air, for example, each suggested that emissions could decline by roughly 30% by that year. Only a reduction of this magnitude would actually keep the planet on a trajectory sufficiently close to the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius.

Many inside China’s policy apparatus considered such ambitious cuts to be infeasible; for instance, Teng Fei, deputy director of Tsinghua University’s Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy, described a 30% reduction as “extreme.” Conversations with knowledgeable insiders, however, suggested a headline reduction of up to 15% was viewed as plausible. In that light, the decision to commit a mere 7% to 10% can only be seen as disappointing.

The NDC obviously represents a floor and not a ceiling, and China has historically only made climate promises that it knows it will keep. But even then, China’s leadership has given itself tremendous wiggle room. This can be seen in part by what is not in Xi’s pledge: any firm commitment about when, exactly, China’s emissions will peak. (His previous pledge only said that it would happen in the 2020s.) While it’s quite possible that 2024 or 2025 will end up being the peak, as some expect, the new pledge creates a perverse incentive to delay and pollute more now. The speech also contained little on non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide — which, given China’s previous commitment to reach net zero on all warming gases by 2060, seems like a significant blind spot.

Other commitments are only impressive until you scratch the surface. Xi pledged that China would install 3,600 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity by 2035. That may sound daunting: The United States, the world’s No. 2 country for renewables capacity, has a combined 400 gigawatts of solar and wind. But China already has about 1,600 gigawatts installed. So China’s promise, in essence, is to add around 200 gigawatts of solar and wind each year until 2035 — and while that would be a huge number for any other country, it actually represents a significant slowdown for China. The country added 360 gigawatts of wind and solar combined last year, and has already installed more than 200 gigawatts of solar alone in the first eight months of this one. In this light, China’s renewables pledge seems ominous.

More distressingly for climate action, it is unclear if this comparatively slower pace of clean electricity addition will actually allow China’s electricity sector to decarbonize. As the electricity analyst David Fishman has noted, China’s overall electricity demand grew faster than its clean electricity generation last year, leaving a roughly 100 terawatt-hour gap — despite all that new solar and wind (and despite 16 gigawatts of new nuclear and hydroelectric power plants, too). Coal filled this gap. Last year, China began construction of almost 100 gigawatts of new coal plants even though its existing coal fleet already operates less than half of the time. These new plants represented more than 90% of the world’s new coal capacity in 2024.

China’s climate strategy — like every other country’s — requires electrifying large swaths of its economy. If new renewables diminish to only 200 gigawatts a year, then it seems implausible that its renewable additions could meet demand growth — let alone eat away substantial amounts of coal-fired generation — unless its economic growth significantly slows.

Slow-walking, not sprinting

Yet the news gets worse. Taken alone, the NDC’s weakness may speak of mere caution on China’s part, yet a number of policy changes to China’s electricity markets and industrial policy over the past year suggest its government is now slow-walking the energy transition.

In 2024, for instance, China started making capacity payments to coal-fired power plants. These payments were ostensibly designed to lubricate a plant’s economics as it shifted from 24/7 operation to a supporting role backing up wind and solar. Yet only coal plants — and not, for instance, batteries — were offered these funds, even though batteries can play a similar role more cheaply and China already makes them in scads. Even more striking, coal plants have been pocketing these funds without changing their behavior or even producing less electricity

At the same time, China’s central leadership has cut the revenues that new solar and wind farms receive from generating power. New solar and wind plants are now scheduled to receive less than the same benchmark price that coal receives — although the details of that discount vary by province and remain uncertain in most of them. Observers hope that this lower price, along with a more market-based dispatch scheme, will eventually allow renewables-heavy electricity systems to charge lower rates to consumers and displace more expensive coal power. However, there’s little clarity on if and when that will happen, and in the meantime, new renewables installations are plummeting as developers wait for more information to emerge.

Chinese industrial policy is exacerbating these trends. The world has long talked about Chinese overcapacity. Now even conversation in the Western media has progressed to discussing “involution” — a broader term that centers on the intensive competition that characterizes Chinese capitalism (and society). It suggests that Chinese firms are competing themselves out of business.

The market-leader BYD, for instance, has become synonymous with the Chinese battery-powered auto renaissance, but there are fears that even this seeming titan might have corrupted itself on the way. The company has larded an incredible amount of debt onto its books to fuel its race to the top of the sales charts; now, murmurs abound that the firm might be “the Evergrande of EVs” — a reference to the housing developer that collapsed into bankruptcy earlier this decade with hundreds of billions of dollars in debt. In recent months, BYD’s engine seems to be sputtering, with sales dropping in September 2025 compared with last year.

As such, the government has come in to try to negotiate new terms of competition so that firms do not end up doing irreparable harm to themselves and their future prospects. It is doing so in other sectors as well: In solar, it has tried to create a cartel of polysilicon manufacturers, a solar OPEC of sorts, to make sure that the pricing of that key input to the photovoltaic supply chain is at a level where the producers can survive.

This may all seem positive — and there is certainly an argument that the government could play a role in helping these new sectors negotiate the difficult waters that they find themselves in. But I interpret these efforts as further slow-walking of the energy transition. A slight reframing can help to understand why.

What is literally happening in these meetings? The government is bringing private actors into the same room to bang their heads together and deal with the reality that the current economic system is not working, largely because of intense competition — a problem likely best solved by forcing some of the firms and production capacity to shrink. Firms are unprofitable because exuberant supply has zoomed past current demand, and the country’s markets and politics are not prepared to navigate the potentially needed bankruptcies or their fallout. So the government is intervening, designing actions to generate the outcomes it desires.

Yet there is something contradictory about the government’s approach. A decarbonized world, after all, will be a world without significant numbers of internal combustion vehicles, so traditional automakers will eventually need to shut down or shift into EVs — yet their executives aren’t being dragged in for the same scolding. Likewise, a decarbonized world will be a world without as many coal mines and coal-fired power plants. Firms in the power sector should be scolded for continuing coal production at scale.

These are problems of the mid-transition, as the scholars Emily Grubert and Sara Hastings-Simon have described decarbonization’s current era. But China is further along in this transition than other states, and it could lead in the management and planning required for the transition as well.

The middle-income trap

China is stuck. For four decades, China’s growth rested on moving abundant cheap labor from low-productivity agriculture to higher productivity sectors, often in urban areas. The physical construction of China’s cities underpinned this development and became its own distorting bubble, launching a cycle of real-estate speculation. The government pricked this bubble in 2020, but since then, Chinese macroeconomic strength has failed to return.

Despite the glimmering nature of its most modern cities, China remains decidedly middle income, with a GDP per capita equivalent to Serbia. Many countries that have grown out of poverty have reached this middle income territory — but then become mired there rather than continuing to develop. This pattern, described as “the middle income trap,” has worried Chinese policymakers for years.

The country is obviously hoping that its new clean industries can offer a substitute motor to power China out of its middle-income status. Its leadership’s apparent decision to slow walk the energy transition, however, looks like a classic example of this “trap.” The leadership seems unwilling to jettison older industries in favor of the higher-value added industries of the future. The fact that the government has previously subsidized these industries just shows the complexity of the political economy challenges facing the regime.

The NDC’s announcement could be seen as an easy win given Trump’s climate backwardness. Clearly that’s what Xi was counting on. But China is too important to be understood only in contrast to the United States — and we should not applaud something that not only fails to recognize global climate targets, but also underplays China’s own development strategy. The country is nearing the release of its next five-year plan. Perhaps that document will incorporate more ambitious targets for the energy transition and decarbonization.

This summer, I visited Ordos in Inner Mongolia, a coal mining region that is now also home to some of China’s huge renewable energy megabases and a zero-carbon industrial park. Tens of thousands still labor in Ordos’ mines and coal-hungry factories, yet they seem like a relic of an earlier age when compared to the scale and precision of the new green industrial facilities. The dirty coal mines may still have history and profits on their side, but it is clear that the future will see their decline and replacement with green technology. I hope that Xi Jinping and the rest of the Chinese political elite come to the same conclusion, and fast.

Goldman’s comments echoed those of the firm’s new CEO, David Crane, a former undersecretary for infrastructure at the Department of Energy. In an article published to Generate’s website a few weeks ago, Crane admitted that the firm had “deviated from our operational roots,” a reference to the firm’s unconventional investment strategy.

Generate is unique as a sustainability-focused investor, in that it often acts as an owner and operator for the projects it finances rather than taking a passive equity stake The firm also provides tailored project financing options for its partners to help manage risk.

But over the past few years, Generate made a number of large equity investments in companies whose projects it did not directly oversee. These included utility-scale solar and energy storage developer Pine Gate Renewables, which is on the verge of bankruptcy, and green hydrogen developer Ambient Fuels, which was recently acquired by Electric Hydrogen amidst tumult in the industry.

“While other investors had no choice but to act as pure investors, we were distracted from who we are and what we were good at,” Crane wrote, noting that this distraction led to “poor performance in one component of our investment portfolio.” That would appear to be its equity division.

Generate’s model is designed to bridge a critical gap in the climate tech ecosystem known as the “missing middle,” the phase at which a company with some proven tech has outgrown early-stage venture capital but is still considered too risky for most traditional infrastructure investors. Historically, the firm has generated high returns by backing “leading-edge technologies,” Jigar Shah, the firm’s co-founder and former director of the DOE’s Loan Programs Office, said on the Open Circuit podcast he co-hosts. These include investments in projects involving fuel cells, anaerobic digesters, and battery storage.

Shah hasn’t worked at Generate since he joined the Biden administration in 2021. But from the outside, he says, the firm appears to have moved away from taking these riskier but potentially more lucrative bets. “They ended up with 38 people in their capital markets team, and their capital markets team went out to the marketplace and said, Hey, we have all this stuff to sell. And the people that they went to said, Well, that’s interesting, but what we really would love is boring community solar,“ Shah said on the podcast. As he saw it, Generate began making equity investments into lower-risk projects such as community solar, which naturally generated stable but lower returns. Then once interest rates went up post-Covid, that put downward pressure on equity returns.

Shah said it’s these slipping returns that have made it harder for Generate to raise capital over the past two years. Axios Pro recently reported that the firm is now exploring an IPO to bring in additional funding, following hesitation from some of its existing backers to reinvest.

While Goldman acknowledged that “there is some skepticism in the capital markets about our space now,” he disagreed with the idea that Generate has abandoned its focus on leading-edge technologies. “We have invested over the last number of years in a lot of assets that are predictable assets with predictable cash flows that have performed very strongly for our investors. And we continue to have the creativity of the team that’s focused on trying to bring newer technologies to the market to bridge the bankability gap,” he told me.

By way of example, he highlighted two of the firm’s most recent investments, a $200 million loan to Pacific Steel Group for the first green steel mill in California and a $100 million scalable credit facility for green data center developer Soluna, which allows the company to increase its borrowing capacity as new projects come online.

The latter deal was announced just weeks after Crane stepped into his new role. Having served as the CEO of five publicly traded energy companies before joining Generate, Crane is now promising to turn around the firm’s fortunes. With the Trump administration rolling back federal support for clean energy infrastructure and investors remaining cautious, Crane has said that now is the time to jump on undervalued opportunities.

“Right now, there’s a lot of noise telling people to stop writing checks. But this is precisely the time to invest in the infrastructure that will power the next twenty years,” he wrote. Goldman backed this up, telling me, “We believe managers who understand the space and who can take advantage of the opportunities that are underpriced in this tougher market environment are set up to succeed.”

Just as tech giants such as Google, Salesforce, and Amazon were able to expand rapidly in the wake of the dot-com bubble and consolidate their positions in the market, Generate’s leadership say they’re now well positioned to help select clean energy companies do the same.

It will certainly be a boon for the sector if they can, given the abundance of undercapitalized climate tech opportunities, from clean cement to thermal energy storage, next-generation geothermal, and carbon capture, all looking to build first-of-a-kind projects. And there’s not nearly enough infrastructure funding to go around.

So if Generate has indeed lost the confidence of its investors, it’s critical that Crane, Goldman, and company regain it swiftly. Their ability to do so could shape not only which technologies drive the energy transition, but how quickly they do so.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTcyNTg4MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxODE1NDU4OH0.yYhTWN0LaJR3xTSnvYmolk4qn24gG-j_3uPJx-ruyvc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-10 05:59:20.806637

Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.

The timing of Biden’s actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president’s signature.

The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.

Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.

The road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden’s goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump’s efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices … and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Democrats urged rejection of the repeals, arguing that Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly agenda is driving up energy prices because renewable sources are being sidelined even as the tech industry’s power demands soar for data centers and other projects.

“We are seeing dramatic increases in the price of energy for American consumers and businesses and the slashing of American jobs, so that Donald Trump can give an easy pass to the fossil fuel industry,” Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

Ashley Nunes, public lands specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said Republicans were unleashing “a wholesale assault on America’s public lands.” Using the Congressional Review Act to erase land management plans “will sow chaos across the country and turn our most cherished places into playgrounds for coal barons and industry polluters,” she said.

Federal tax credits are now dead, the automaker has wiped out up to $12,000 in lease incentives on the ID.4, and ended $10,500 in discounts on the ID. Buzz. The move bucks the trend as other brands continue to sweeten their EV lease offers.

As of September 30, 2025, Volkswagen offered up to $12,350 in lease cash on the ID.4, depending on configuration. That included a $7,500 federal lease tax credit for lessees as Bonus Customer Cash, plus $3,500 to $4,850 in Dealer Lease Cash. It made the ID.4 one of the top EV lease deals around.

On October 1, those incentives vanished. While the ID.4 still has a 0% APR equivalent lease rate, drivers lost more than $12,000 in savings overnight. The ID. Buzz took a similar hit. Last month, the 2025 ID. Buzz offered $10,500 off MSRP between the $7,500 tax credit and $3,000 Dealer Lease Cash. Now, almost all lease cash is gone. VW Credit is offering just $750 in Dealer Lease Cash, and weirdly, not on models with two-tone paint. According to CarsDirect’s lease calculator, the lowest-priced ID. Buzz trim now carries an effective monthly cost topping $1,000 — a considerable jump.

For comparison, the ID. Buzz Pro S was previously advertised at $589 a month for 36 months with $5,999 due at signing, or an effective monthly cost of $756.

The ID.4 lease once cost just $233 a month, making it one of the cheapest EVs to lease. According to updated estimates, that figure is now north of $800 – that’s hair-raising.

Meanwhile, VW’s rivals are going in the opposite direction. Ford extended its Mustang Mach-E lease deals through early January. Subaru’s updated 2026 Solterra still qualifies for the $7,500 lease credit, and Jeep replaced the expiring EV lease credit with equivalent bonus cash.

If you really want a Volkswagen, though, there’s some good news: financing deals haven’t changed. The 2025 ID.4 continues to offer 0% APR for 72 months, and buyers of the ID. Buzz can still get up to $3,250 in Bonus Customer Cash through November 3, a perk unavailable to lessees.

It kinda seems like VW doesn’t want to lease their EVs anymore…?? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.

EPA has doubled down on certain regulatory fronts, defending key hazardous substance designations for PFOA and PFOS, while simultaneously scaling back certain PFAS drinking water limits. These developments, together with EPA’s latest Unified Regulatory Agenda, reveal a more targeted approach to PFAS regulation in certain respects while, on the whole, continuing the march toward increased governmental obligations on the other.

Hazardous Substance Listings

On September 17, 2025, EPA filed an unopposed motion to lift the EPA-requested abeyance in U.S. Chamber of Commerce v. EPA, No. 24-1193 (D.C. Cir. 2024), informing the Court that the Agency intends to keep in place the designations of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA. In a concurrent public statement, EPA confirmed that it will continue defending these designations in court and initiate a rulemaking to establish a uniform framework for future PFAS “hazardous substance” designations, including how costs will be considered.

The underlying litigation challenges the CERCLA designations as arbitrary and capricious on multiple grounds, including the alleged inadequacy of EPA’s regulatory impact analysis (discussed in detail in here). Given these arguments and the change in administration, many stakeholders anticipated that EPA would support rescission of the designations. The Agency’s recent filings, however, indicate that it intends to preserve them, signaling a continued commitment to maintaining PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances.

On September 25, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA’s motion to lift the abeyance and set briefing to resume, with petitioners’ joint reply due November 14, 2025.

Maximum Contaminant Levels

Separately, on September 10, 2025, EPA filed a motion in American Water Works Association v. EPA, No. 24-1188 (D.C. Cir. 2024), seeking partial vacatur of certain elements of its April 2024 PFAS drinking water rule. That rule established maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for six PFAS compounds: PFOA and PFOS, regulated individually, and PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (GenX) and certain mixtures, regulated collectively.

In May of 2025, however, EPA announced its intent to maintain its NPDWRs for PFOA and PFOS but withdraw the other four MCLs. During a July 2024 meeting of EPA’s National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC), the Agency indicated that by the end of 2025, it would propose a rulemaking to retain the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS but extend compliance deadlines to 2031. The September 10, 2025, motion is consistent with this announcement, as EPA requested that the Court vacate the MCLs for PFNA, PFHxS, HFPO-DA (GenX) and the combined Hazard Index for PFAS mixtures, while leaving the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS in place. Responses to the motion to vacate were filed; however, the case is currently stayed at EPA’s unopposed request in light of the lapse in federal appropriations.

The Unified Regulatory Agenda Indicates a More Comprehensive Regulatory Approach

EPA’s September 2025 Unified Regulatory Agenda further illustrates the Agency’s sustained yet more selective focus on PFAS regulation. Several pending and planned rulemakings indicate continued PFAS-focused regulatory activities from EPA, including:

Clean Water Act Permitting. EPA is considering updates to PFAS-related requirements in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for sewage effluent treatment facilities. Currently, permit applicants are only required to report discharges of certain pollutants listed in existing regulations. (See 40 CFR 122.21.) A future rulemaking could add certain PFAS compounds to this list, though EPA has acknowledged that there are no currently approved analytical methods for PFAS in NPDES permitting.

The Agency anticipates a proposed rule by the end of 2025 and finalizing updates in 2027.

Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs). EPA is also considering ELGs for organic chemicals, plastics and synthetic fibers to address discharges from facilities at which PFAS are manufactured. ELGs set industry-specific wastewater standards based on the performance of the best available, economically achievable technology. Facilities are not required to use the specific technology EPA identifies in setting the limits, but they must meet the resulting discharge limits.

EPA first signaled its intent to revisit PFAS-related ELGs in its 2023 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan 15, which outlines the Agency’s strategy for reducing water pollution. In that plan, EPA noted that landfill ELGs should be revised to account for PFAS in landfill leachate. The September 2025 Unified Agenda indicates that a proposed ELG rulemaking is anticipated in 2026.

TSCA Reporting Rule. EPA intends to revise the scope of the PFAS Reporting Rule under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule creates a potentially time-consuming and onerous reporting obligation for any PFAS, including the importation of any PFAS incorporated within mixtures and articles. EPA has already moved to delay the PFAS Reporting Rule twice, with the required data submission window now set to open for most manufacturers on April 13, 2026, and close on October 13, 2026.

The Unified Agenda provides that “EPA plans to propose the incorporation of certain exemptions and other modifications to the scope of the reporting rule.” A proposed rule on this issue may be released by the end of 2025.

Sixth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 6). The UCMR provides a mechanism for EPA to collect data regarding impacts to public water systems from “emerging contaminants,” for which the SDWA does not otherwise require sampling and mitigation. Both UCMRs 3 and 5 included PFAS among the 30 chemicals for which each rule required sampling. Although it is still unclear whether UCMR 6 will do so as well, several entities that responded to the request for comments on this rule—published in the Federal Register on February 8, 2024—advocated that PFAS be included within the sampling suite of chemicals.",https://pfas.pillsburylaw.com/files/2023/07/social-image-logo-og-1000x1000.png,N,,2025-10-09 22:00:11.364338

It’s exposing pressing issues and pushing us toward a more dynamic, decentralized, and digitally native power system.","The U.S. power system is entering uncharted waters. The conversation at RE+ this year wasn’t just about renewables; it was about navigating a new energy reality. On one hand, demand for electricity is surging, from the explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers to the rapid electrification of vehicles and buildings. On the other hand, how do we ensure “just and reasonable” utility rates, keeping the electricity bills affordable for customers?

A Perfect Storm of Challenges

A major concern is resource adequacy. While AI and data centers are driving significant load growth, the interconnection queue is clogged with renewable projects. This interconnection backlog is delaying clean energy from coming online just as new load growth accelerates.

Electricity affordability is another concern amid load growth and lagging supply. The IRA’s tax credits have turbocharged clean energy investment, but the phaseout schedule under the OBBBA, coupled with foreign entity of concern (FEOC) compliance rules, threatens to drive up project costs. Developers are already warning that power purchase agreement (PPA) prices could climb, and ultimately, those costs land on customer bills. In addition, higher transmission buildout costs and soaring capacity auction prices have created more pressure on customers.

Turning Challenges into Opportunities

Unleash What We Can Build Fast

Among all the available technologies, solar and storage can be brought online quickly, making them the most viable option to support near-term AI-driven demand growth. Developers can bring solar projects online within just 18 to 24 months, compared to other resources such as wind, small modular reactors (SMRs), natural gas, and hydrogen fuel cells, which typically take 3 to 15 years from project conception to commercial operation.

To deploy the resources faster, we must react quickly to address the “soft cost” of time. Permitting and interconnection delays are the primary bottleneck. Every month of delay adds cost, jeopardizes project viability, and keeps us reliant on more expensive, marginal resources during peak times. We can speed things up by creating narrow, time-limited fast-track lanes for near-term reliability needs—limited to projects with proven site control, deliverability, and financing. MISO and SPP’s Expedited Resource Adequacy Study (ERAS) pilots show the feasibility of this model. Pair that with surplus interconnection at existing POIs, and clear transfer of rights at retiring sites to plug in capacity faster.

Maximize the Grid We Already Have

Building new transmission is essential, but slow and expensive. We can act now by deploying Grid Enhancing Technologies (GETs) across our existing network. Tools like Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) use sensors to determine a line’s real-time capacity, which is often higher than its static rating. Grid topology optimization software can re-route power flows to reduce congestion. These GETs are not silver bullets, but they can be an effective solution to maximize the transmission capacity across the existing power system.

Value Flexibility as a Resource

The existing U.S. grid can handle significant new loads such as data centers, as long as they can be curtailed when the electric system is stressed. Grid operators like ERCOT and PJM are now exploring policies like mandatory curtailment and demand-response programs for large load customers during critical hours.

On the supply side, at the grid edge, distributed energy resources (DERs) and virtual power plants (VPPs) can shave peaks, provide frequency services, and ease congestion. Unlocking this at scale takes market design and regulatory reform: FERC Order 2222 compels RTOs/ISOs to enable DER/VPP participation, while performance-based regulation can align utility incentives with demand-side optimization and include LMI-focused metrics to reduce bill spikes.

Therefore, metros with an established presence in these sectors, or that have planned investments, should be most poised to benefit.

Reindustrialization efforts began with the previous administration’s passing of the CHIPS and Inflation Reduction Acts (IRA), which fueled new factory construction in these subsectors, particularly in Phoenix, Austin, Raleigh, Columbus, and Houston. While it will take time for construction to finish and jobs to materialize, we expect these—and Southern metros more broadly—to see the greatest benefits of the reindustrialization agenda.

Manufacturing-heavy metros, including those with large shares of jobs in these dynamic subsectors—Detroit (autos), San Jose (semiconductors and computers), Seattle (aerospace), Reading (batteries), and New York (pharmaceuticals)—saw healthy job growth through 2023. But many have since incurred declines over the last year as concerns stemming from tariffs, CHIPS and IRA funding, and lower immigration have clouded the outlook. These losses reinforce the need to maintain the momentum of building new capacity to support manufacturing job growth.

For planners looking to jumpstart more manufacturing, and who are considering criteria for selecting the best sites for new factories—available labor, density of skillsets, established supply chains, and broad-based infrastructure—we found that metros in Midwest states and central Pennsylvania score highest on these measures.

1) In 300 words or less, please give our readers your elevator pitch: Why are you running? Why should voters entrust you with this position? What prior experience will make you an effective member of the Carrboro Town Council?

I first ran for Carrboro Town Council in 2021 because I want to make our town more accessible to families like mine. We were drawn here for the reasons many people are—the cultural vibrancy, the proud activist legacy, the natural beauty combined with walkability. But the affordability crisis we’re seeing throughout the Triangle threatens those elements of our character, and makes it harder for more people to share the life I feel so lucky to have here. In my first term, we’ve taken major steps toward building a more economically diverse and accessible community, but the work isn’t done. It’s vital we continue to refine our land use policies to increase housing supply and affordability, improve our connectivity and climate resilience, and implement community safety practices that meet the problems of our current moment with care and compassion. I’m proud to have been a leading voice advocating for these changes as we’ve hired key leaders to new positions, adopted our first-ever Comprehensive Plan, and begun the revision of our town Land Use Ordinance. We’ve built a lot of momentum toward carrying out priorities that I think a lot of Carrboro shares, and I want to stick around to make sure we’ve got the results to show for it.

2) What would your priorities be as a member of the Carrboro Town Council? Please identify three of the most pressing issues Carrboro currently faces and how you believe the town should address them.

The largest priority I have in the coming term is the adoption of a new Land Use Ordinance. We need to codify an approach to development that accomplishes several crucial objectives: we need to add more housing at different price points to make it possible for more people to enter our housing market; we need to balance density against stormwater management, cooling, and green space preservation to maximize climate resilience in our community design; we need to increase the amount of businesses and build the density those businesses need to survive. All of this needs to happen while we use every tool legally permissible to construct affordable housing in market conditions that make it a steep challenge—in addition to incentivizing affordable units in our zoning approach, we need to be putting dollars into land banking and gap financing structures that allow us to have more transformative outcomes than we’ve been able to achieve through zoning alone. Ultimately, we know that we’re swimming upstream to help make dignified housing, which is a human right, available in a market and policy structure that has commodified it, but we can get more imaginative and aggressive to take a bigger bite out of the problem than we’ve been able to thus far.

I’m probably violatiing the spirit of the question by continuing to go on here, but we’re also very close to making strides with community safety practices built around mental health care and social service rather than armed police response, and we’ve put a lot of effort into streamlining our bike and pedestrian infrastructure project delivery, which I think will bear fruit over the next four years.

3) What’s the best or most important thing the Carrboro Town Council has done in the past year? Additionally, name a decision you believe the town should have handled differently. Please explain your answers.

Beginning the process of entirely revising our Land Use Ordinance is a massive, massive step for our Town. Given the fact that development decisions comprise the vast majority of what towns in North Carolina are responsible for, our land use is the biggest single thing we can control to see our values implemented.

In the last year, we explored some paid parking policies that I think I could have helped lead a more productive community discussion on. Ultimately, we’ve paused plans to pursue paid parking, and I think it’s a decent outcome that gives us a chance to consider the right order of operations to achieve the connectivity, transit usage, revenue strategies, and climate resilience we want. But I think the way we approached community for feedback—notwithstanding the efforts of our always-excellent communications staff—could have benefited from more framing that I failed to provide. Parking is a good synecdoche for the kinds of difficult trade-offs we have to consider when we look at values-driven polices at the local level: everybody appreciates what easy access to our downtown does for our businesses and arts communities, but road safety and eliminating Vehicle Miles Traveled are priorities I hear about constantly from Carrboro residents. I wish I’d taken a more active role to facilitate a broader, deeper discussion that built trust and mobilized more people into these considerations. While our staff did an excellent job gathering input and equipping Council to make deliberate decisions, I think I can do much better as a leader the next time we consider where we want to go on these policies.

4) President Trump is working to ramp up deportations and curtail visas. At the same time, the state legislature has passed laws requiring agencies to cooperate with ICE. What do you think Carrboro can or should do to ensure safe, welcoming communities for immigrants in light of these policies?

This is an area where people don’t often think about land use, but it’s a good issue for demonstrating how absolutely vital it is that more people can afford to live in Carrboro. The inclusivity and acceptance in our town is an active practice for many of our neighbors—as we’ve learned over and over in the past decade, nothing is safer than a strong community. But if people can’t afford to access communities that prioritize our values, we’re not as able to protect them as neighbors. An economically diverse town is a more racially and intergenerationally diverse town, and offers more opportunities for immigrant families to put down roots in a welcoming community. Otherwise, we’re in constant communication with leaders closer to the fight throughout the state to make sure we’re offering the most appropriate, proportional, and strategic help we can in our official capacity—such as when we adopted our 4th Amendment workplace resolution in partnership with Siembra NC.

5) The town has prioritized climate action and climate resiliency, but historic flooding from Tropical Storm Chantal shows that the town and its residents continue to be vulnerable to these disasters as climate change leads to more intense rainfall. How can Carrboro best help impacted residents and prepare for future disasters?

Our incredible Fire Chief and Emergency Manager Will Potter is already doing a great job helping to educate community members about the best ways to prepare at the individual level, so I think a lot of this work is underway, and we just need to continue to expand our outreach to make sure as many residents can get this information as possible. Outside of our official town offerings, I want to make sure as a leader I’m connecting with nonprofits, businesses, and grassroots organizers to form the less institutional community resilience that I think is a vital component for keeping us safe in the first 48-96 hours after these emergencies.

6) As with most places in the Triangle, Carrboro is grappling with a shortage of affordable housing. How effectively has the town helped address rising rents, particularly for low-income residents? How effectively has the town helped homeowners who were hit by this year’s property revaluation? What more should the town do to address housing affordability in the next few years?

Hopefully my extremely long-winded earlier answers cover a lot of what I think we can do better, but I do want to say briefly that I’m pleased that we’ve been able to assist the vast majority of tax-burdened residents who applied to our relief program. Another reason we need to increase our development of every kind in Carrboro is because our status quo places the entire burden of our town revenue on the backs of homeowners, which is increasingly untenable. As we increase our housing supply, explore novel and more impactful roads to subsidization, and expand our commercial tax base, we should be doing everything in our toolkit to slow the rise of rents, help more folks who need it find a home at lower than market rates, and slow the rate of expense on longtime property owners.

7) How should the Town of Carrboro encourage more walking, biking, and public transit use?

Would you believe that I think we need to add more housing, especially to our downtown area? The highest return we can get in terms of reducing car dependency is to make it possible for people to live where they need cars less, and at present our downtown area includes precious little housing, which our LUO and upcoming Downtown Area Plan should go a long way toward rectifying. Separately, we’re exploring some new tactics to make our bike and pedestrian projects more achievable—we’re really scrutinizing our workflows and considering the way we design and bid projects to make them more competitive for what state and federal money there is. Finally, an additional consideration for adding housing is that we need to add density to increase public transit service; Chapel Hill Transit is an incredible fare-free resource for a town like ours, but in order to make more service make more sense, we’ve got to make it possible for folks to live where the buses can serve. As we’re in partnership with Chapel Hill and UNC, who both naturally contribute more to our transit partnerships with their larger footprints, we need to build the density that makes it viable for us to increase our transit investment.

8) From cancelled grants to layoffs, federal funding cuts this year have hit the Triangle particularly hard and local government officials are having to make difficult decisions about what to fund and how. How should the town council prioritize competing funding needs? What role, if any, should the town play in supporting Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools in light of federal funding pressures?

While I’ve spent a good deal of ink and inches elsewhere lamenting the fact that Carrboro is so economically dependent on property taxes, perhaps the sole benefit our otherwise suboptimal economic composition provides is that we, as a town, are not dependent on federal funds in our regular operating budget. We do need to consider the scarcity of resources available for road, transit, and bike/ped projects, and I think the efficiency improvements I mentioned above to the way we fund the design phase of projects should help us to deliver the projects we can in this environment. As far as the schools, we’re incredibly invested in the success of CHCCS, and we’ll continue to be partners in the direct places we’re able—like the Safe Routes to School plans we coordinate on—but the scale of our operating budget and the separation of responsibilities from the County and the Board of Education mean that direct assistance beyond our residents’ contributions will probably not be in the form of revenue. As an individual leader, I’ll continue working with Board of Education members to stay responsive, flexible, and creative, to help Carrboro be the best partner we can feasibly be.

9) If there are other issues you want to discuss, please do so here.

My experience in my first term has been eye opening. I have spent a great deal of this questionnaire talking about land use because I think it’s vital that we use the tools of every office to get the results those tools can provide. But of course I recognize that these are somewhat limited answers to what most of the INDY’s readers are feeling in our increasingly frenetic, isolating age of rising fascism. I was extremely proud to be the first candidate endorsed by Democratic Socialists of America to win office in North Carolina, and I believe using the specific tools of my office to reduce capital’s influence in eroding our democracy is the best way I can serve working people in Carrboro and beyond. But it is not enough. The North Carolina General Assembly has been gerrymandered to such an extent as to functionally disenfranchise most of the INDY’s readers. Courts at every level have been packed with conservative activists, corporate apologists, and in the case of the North Carolina Supreme Court, literally the son of the North Carolina Senate President Pro-Tem, himself an instrumental figure in the gerrymandering in the first place. I note these conditions not to despair, but because I think anytime we consider electoral roles like mine, we need to consider their place in a vast power structure that needs everyone who reads this to get organized for the results they can get where they are. Join DSA—it is one of the few truly member-led democratic political organizations working across labor, climate, electoral, racial and gender solidarity issues. Organize your workplace—right now, white or blue collar, public or private sector: you are holding power that we need to put into the fight. If you need help, my contact info is on Carrboro’s website, and I’ll connect you however I can.

Holtec International described an “untenable path forward for used fuel storage in New Mexico” as it walked away from the proposal to temporarily hold spent fuel from commercial nuclear power plants across the nation. The New Jersey-based company confirmed its decision Thursday.

Holtec said the move would allow it to work with other states that are more amenable.

The New Mexico project was cast aside despite a favorable U.S. Supreme Court ruling in August that rebooted plans for temporary storage in Texas and New Mexico.

The U.S. is at an impasse over a permanent solution for storing spend nuclear fuel, as roughly 100,000 tons (90,000 metric tons) of spent fuel, some of it dating from the 1980s, pile up at current and former nuclear plant sites nationwide. The waste was meant to be kept there temporarily before being deposited deep underground.

U.S. nuclear regulators in 2023 licensed the proposed multibillion-dollar storage complex in New Mexico, while opposition persisted.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and the Legislature put up stiff resistance with legislation that threatened to withhold state permits at least until a permanent storage solution is in place.

“It’s inappropriate to call anything ‘interim’ when you don’t have a permanent repository” for spent nuclear fuel, said Sen. Jeff Steinborn of Las Cruces, lead sponsor of the bill.

He called Holtec’s decision to withdraw “a huge relief,” adding that “of course it’s still a national problem that needs to be solved.”

By contrast, Lujan Grisham’s Republican predecessor, Susana Martinez, had been supportive of the project. Holtec had argued the plan was safe and would be an economic boon for the region, without interfering with nearby oil development.

Critics of the project, including the Sierra Club, said Holtec’s decision highlights an enduring roadblock.

A separate resolution passed unanimously that urges all companies to discuss their plans to capture or sequester carbon in parish with the police jury’s CO2 Committee.","Police juries in Jeff Davis and Allen Parishes approved resolutions this week requesting that Gov. Jeff Landry grant local governments the authority to approve or deny Class VI CO2 injection wells within their jurisdictions. Class VI wells, used to inject carbon dioxide deep underground for long-term storage, are subject to the most stringent permitting requirements and have monitoring systems designed to protect underground sources of drinking water.

The Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy is currently reviewing 34 applications for Class Vi wells, which are located mostly in the southern and central parts of the state.

Environmental advocacy groups contend carbon leakages could potentially harm the Chicot Aquifer, the primary source of water in Jeff Davis and Allen parishes and other parishes in southeastern Louisiana.

The Louisiana CO2 Alliance, an advocacy group chaired by elected officials in Allen, Vernon, Jefferson Davis and Beauregard parishes, seeks a voice in crafting legislation that would address local concerns about carbon capture sequestration, as The Center Square reported in May.

In mid-September, the police jury in nearby Vernon Parish rescinded an ordinance expressing opposition to carbon sequestration projects that passed in 2024, according to a report by TV station by KALB. The jury also voted in September to pass a resolution limiting the issuance of permits on Class VI wells to give its members more time to understand safety issues. In another resolution, the police jury expressed support for industries that provide economic development to Vernon Parish, without regard to whether companies require carbon capture and sequestration in their operations.

Representatives of Highland Pellets, an Arkansas-based wood pellet manufacturer, spoke at the September meeting about the company’s plan to build a plant in the parish that would directly employ 100 to 200 people. The investment depends on the use of carbon capture sequestration, the company said.

Will Green, president and CEO of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry (LABI), said the state’s leaders must move quickly so that neighboring states, especially Texas, do not take the lead in establishing themselves as carbon sequestration hubs.

“LABI encourages all parish leaders to focus on the facts, not rhetoric from anti-business, out-of-state activist groups intent on preserving the status quo, and to weigh the long-term economic health of their communities,” Green said in a statement emailed to The Center Square. “Rejecting CCS could mean turning away jobs, growth, innovation and the chance to secure a stronger future for Louisiana.”

Carbon capture sequestration projects will typically generate $6 million to $12 million in local property taxes during the first five years of operation and $30 million over 20 years, according to a study done by the Center Emerging Energies cited by LABI.

The Allen Parish Police Jury voted unanimously Monday to ask Landry to refrain from issuing any Class VI carbon injection permits without prior approval from Allen Parish residents. A separate resolution passed unanimously that urges all companies to discuss their plans to capture or sequester carbon in parish with the police jury’s CO2 Committee.

A CO2 risk assessment commissioned by the police jury found a single carbon capture project would create over $81 million in local labor income over a 12-year period in Allen Parish while increasing gross domestic product (GDP) in the parish by $103 million.

The 151-page study done by Baton Rouge-based GEC found the fiscal impact for Allen Parish would include $3.5 million to $4.4 million in tax collections during 2026 through 2035. Additionally, lease payments for surface rights and pore space use have been agreed with landowners and could be substantial, according to GEC.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining, drilling and other development in three Western states, advancing President Donald Trump's ambitions to expand energy production from public lands.

Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.

The timing of Biden's actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president's signature.

The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.

Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.

The road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation's most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden's goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump's efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices ... and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Democrats urged rejection of the repeals, arguing that Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly agenda is driving up energy prices because renewable sources are being sidelined even as the tech industry’s power demands soar for data centers and other projects.

“We are seeing dramatic increases in the price of energy for American consumers and businesses and the slashing of American jobs, so that Donald Trump can give an easy pass to the fossil fuel industry,” Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

Ashley Nunes, public lands specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said Republicans were unleashing “a wholesale assault on America’s public lands.” Using the Congressional Review Act to erase land management plans “will sow chaos across the country and turn our most cherished places into playgrounds for coal barons and industry polluters,” she said.

Energy Vault

Global grid-scale energy storage provider Energy Vault announced it secured a $300 million preferred equity investment with Orion Infrastructure Capital, launching a fully consolidated subsidiary called Asset Vault.

The company said Asset Vault is dedicated to developing, building, owning and operating energy storage assets globally. It said the capital will accelerate the deployment of 1.5 GW + of energy storage projects. The preferred equity instrument is non-dilutive to common shareholders and includes milestones for common equity participation in the listed company.

Jefferies LLC acted as sole placement agent and exclusive financial advisor, and Vinson & Elkins LLP acted as legal advisor, to Energy Vault. Greenberg Traurig, LLP acted as legal advisor to OIC.

Including the recapitalization of the recently completed Calistoga Resiliency Center (CRC) in California, as well as the Cross Trails BESS, located in Snyder, Texas, Energy Vault said it expects to draw nearly $200 million over the next six months to commence work on two additional late-stage projects in the U.S. and Australia, which includes the 125MW / 1,000MWh Stoney Creek BESS, along with the advancement of additional pipeline projects under development.

Energy Vault said the Asset Vault platform creates a vertically integrated business, capturing value across the entire energy storage lifecycle by combining Energy Vault’s proven operational experience with long-term asset ownership to generate predictable, recurring cash flows. Energy Vault will self-perform engineering, procurement, construction (EPC), and long-term service agreements for Asset Vault projects.

Nexamp

Community solar developer Nexamp announced it secured a $330 million construction warehouse facility. The financing is expected to help Nexamp develop, construct and finance a portfolio of about 20 new distributed solar assets, representing about 120 MW of new capacity.

The capital is expected to support Nexamp’s near-term pipeline of solar and energy storage projects. Once completed, these assets are expected to transition into long-term financing structures, including tax equity funding or refinancing.

MUFG committed $200 million as the largest lender in the facility, also serving as mandated lead arranger and administrative agent. ING followed with a $100 million allocation and additional responsibilities as mandated lead arranger, lender, hedge provider, and green loan structuring agent. Siemens Financial Services contributed $30 million as joint lead arranger and U.S. Bank National Association acted as collateral agent.

“By securing flexible construction capital, we are better positioned to deliver the clean energy projects that communities across the country urgently need as demand rises. Solar continues to be the most cost-effective and easy-to-deploy source of new electricity, outpacing all other sources by a wide margin already this year,” said Zaid Ashai, chief executive officer, Nexamp.

NineDot Energy

NineDot Energy, a developer of community-scale battery energy storage systems for the New York City metro area, announced the close of a $175 million revolving debt financing from Deutsche Bank.

NineDot said it will use the debt financing to support activities across the development timeline, from grid interconnection deposits, to equipment procurement, and project construction. The facility also enabled NineDot to pay back its existing revolver for funding grid interconnection deposits with NY Green Bank.

New York State has a goal of 6 GW of battery storage in operation by 2030.

NineDot Energy currently has seven operating projects across four locations in The Bronx and Staten Island. The company said its projects supported approximately 26,000 New York City households on hot summer days in 2025. With more than 60 additional projects in some phase of development or construction, NineDot pursues a goal of 400 MW of energy storage in development, construction or operation by the end of 2026.

Generate Capital

Generate Capital, an infrastructure investment firm, announced it closed $85 million in tax equity with Solcap, a renewable energy tax equity and investment tax credit transfer platform run by KeyState. Launched in 2019, Solcap has deployed or committed over $1 billion in capital to develop 200+ renewable energy projects in communities across more than a dozen states.

The funds are expected to support eight community solar projects across New York and Illinois, totaling 38 MW. The projects are scheduled to achieve commercial operation between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026.

Counsel for the transaction included Orrick as sponsor counsel and Kutak Rock as investor counsel.

Including the latest close, Generate Capital has raised over $807 million in project debt and over $608 million in tax equity, or over $1.4 billion in total in 2025. The company owns and operates more than 430 MW of community solar in the United States.

The majority of data centres we are tracking that are under construction are being built in markets with regulated utilities.
Regulated utilities that provide data centres with certainty of power through grid access.
Existing power producers with spare capacity, including old coal plants set for retirement that suddenly have economic life left in them.","Visiting industry and finance customers in the US last week confirmed just how surging demand from hyperscalers is shaking up the US power industry, even beyond our initial take a year ago. WoodMac’s experts, Chris Seiple and Ben Hertz-Shargel, shared their latest thoughts.

How much power demand will data centres add?

Hyperscaler investment in data centres is accelerating rapidly. Spend for five of the biggest companies rose by a third in 2024 and is forecast to jump by 50% to over US$300 billion in 2025.

Our tracking shows US utilities have committed to add 116 GW of large loads to their networks, equivalent to approximately 20% of total US electricity demand in 2024. Vertical utilities are building all of the 16 GW under construction, while the rest is concentrated in two major power markets, PJM (the Mid-Atlantic region) and ERCOT (Texas). This is the tip of the iceberg, with an additional 32 GW that utilities are representing to investors as ‘high confidence’ of being built and a further 277 GW with an undisclosed commitment status.

Can the industry deliver sufficient supply to meet the demand?

That’s one of the big questions. There is plenty of political support, with the Trump administration determined that the US wins the battle with China for global AI leadership.

Ideally, large load customers want reliable, 24/7 low-carbon power. Renewables are the cheapest and most readily available resources, and variability can be mitigated when paired with energy storage. Nuclear and geothermal can contribute clean baseload power but are longer-term solutions.

The near-term focus, though, is on new-build gas-fired power plants to do the heavy lifting. The challenge here is a very tight supply chain, with gas turbines a critical bottleneck. GE Vernova has recently announced a 50% increase in turbine manufacturing capacity while Mitsubishi plans to double its capacity. But new orders still face at least a five-year wait for delivery.

Will power prices rise?

They’re already moving up. With supply chain constraints, including turbines, transformers and switchgear, demand growth looks certain to outstrip new supply in the next few years. There are also factors driving costs up that have nothing to do with data centres, including tariffs imposed on materials and components through the power value chain in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. We estimate the cost of new-build gas-fired plants has soared from US$1,400/kw four years ago to over US$2,400/kw today.

The wholesale power price in ERCOT, for example, needs to double to over US$100/MWh to incentivise the investment required for new-build combined-cycle gas turbine, even before any upside risk to Henry Hub gas prices is taken into account. The impact of rising wholesale prices on consumers will be compounded by higher transmission and distribution costs, including component inflation, as the network is strengthened to replace ageing components and for climate change-induced extreme weather. The price of pad mount single phase transformers, for example, has doubled since 2020.

How are power companies responding to higher demand?

It’s a challenge for a sector that’s just recently had a decade of no demand growth. The majority of data centres we are tracking that are under construction are being built in markets with regulated utilities. In the current power-scarce market, these one-stop shops that can build community support and provide power supply along with the grid connection are dominating new data centre capacity. Some data centre developers have pursued their own on-site generation to reduce their connection requests and speed time to power. This approach is still rare but will become more popular in the future and could include small nuclear and geothermal.

In the meantime, a bring-your-own-capacity movement has begun, calling for utilities to accelerate interconnection if the data centre company brings third-party generating capacity or demand-side resources, such as batteries and demand response. Google is promoting this model, alongside solution providers Cloverleaf Infrastructure, Voltus, Piclo and Camus Energy.

What are the risks to developers?

That they don’t recover the capital cost of their new capacity and are left with underused assets. The concern is that the current, bullish outlook for demand growth might prove a short-lived phenomenon if there’s a breakthrough on chip energy efficiency or less energy-intensive AI models or AI business models turn out to be not as profitable as anticipated. Utilities have started to insist on longer-duration contracts for large load buyers as a risk mitigation strategy. Contracts with large load buyers signed this year have typically been to supply power for 10 to 20 years, whereas in early 2024, few were longer than five years.

Will consumer bills increase?

Yes, and could become a political hot potato – “affordability” was the watchword among energy experts during New York Climate Week in September. A structural increase in wholesale prices will feed through into retail bills over time in deregulated retail markets and will come on top of record bill increases from the current heavy investment in strengthening the grid. State regulators approved US$29 billion in retail rate increases in H1 2025, more than double the same period in 2024.

The difficulty will be developing new utility cost recovery schemes that allocate exclusively to data centres the capital and operating costs that would normally be shared among all customers. One solution which many utilities are working on to protect retail customers’ bills are discrete tariffs for hyperscalers, which reflect the cost of dedicated generation and the associated transmission costs. While many utilities are moving in this direction, there’s a wide variety of approaches.

Who are the winners?

Regulated utilities that provide data centres with certainty of power through grid access. Existing power producers with spare capacity, including old coal plants set for retirement that suddenly have economic life left in them. And a large prize waits for the companies first able to develop cost effective solutions for off grid projects, which are currently proving too expensive and running into engineering challenges.","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/photography/environmental-social-and-governance/micro-esg/micro_esg_gettyimages-157366413.jpg?w=800&h=480&mode=crop&center=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-10-09 20:01:21.726764

Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.

The timing of Biden's actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president's signature.

The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.

Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.

The road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation's most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden's goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump's efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices ... and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

The Senate approved three resolutions this week that wipe out resource management plans enacted during the Biden administration in Alaska, Montana and North Dakota.
The resolutions came under the Congressional Review Act, which empowers Congress to nullify executive branch rules.
These plans had never before been considered rules, which is a requirement for eligibility under the Congressional Review Act.
“You see Congress potentially going down a path of micromanaging all the resource management plans in the country,” Hamby said.","Congress took the unprecedented step this week of repealing management plans for public lands in three states in an effort to expand access to fossil fuel mining and drilling.

Critics of the move warn it could inject a new level of uncertainty into management of these areas and open a wave of litigation over leasing for energy development, grazing and other uses.

The Senate approved three resolutions this week that wipe out resource management plans enacted during the Biden administration in Alaska, Montana and North Dakota. The resolutions came under the Congressional Review Act, which empowers Congress to nullify executive branch rules. Each resolution had previously passed the House of Representatives.

The Biden-era plans had ended coal leasing in the prolific Powder River Basin and limited access to oil and gas development across millions of acres of public lands compared to previous plans.

Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who sponsored one of the resolutions, said in a Wednesday speech celebrating the vote that the Biden-era plan was enacted despite opposition from local communities and officials, and called it “an attack on Montana jobs” and “on Montana communities.”

Daines also rejected the notion that the resolution would cause chaos, arguing that it simply repealed the Biden administration’s latest amendment to the management plan while leaving the rest of the plan in place.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a sponsor of the bill covering that state’s plan, said in a statement that the Bureau of Land Management had violated its obligation to balance multiple uses of the land by all but eliminating coal leasing.

Democrats voted against the measures, and conservation groups have said the repeal will threaten conservation gains made after years of painstaking work, including protections for caribou, Dall sheep and salmon in Alaska.

The Bureau of Land Management uses resource management plans to set parameters for how to balance multiple uses on public lands, including energy development, grazing, conservation and recreation. The plans are usually in place for years, and can take years to develop, incorporating input from numerous stakeholders, said Rachael Hamby, policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group.

These plans had never before been considered rules, which is a requirement for eligibility under the Congressional Review Act. Now that lawmakers have taken this step, some legal experts have warned it could open up hundreds of plans for review.

Hamby warned that applying the Congressional Review Act would open what is normally a slow, deliberative process to the whims of Congress and partisan swings.

“You see Congress potentially going down a path of micromanaging all the resource management plans in the country,” Hamby said.

On Wednesday, lawmakers from Wyoming introduced a resolution to repeal a resource management plan for that state.

In a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) warned that the resolutions could cast doubt on resource plans across the country. Because other existing management plans have not been submitted to Congress as rules, he said, it could now be possible to argue that all of the plans enacted since the Congressional Review Act was passed, in 1996, are technically not in effect.

“And if they never went into effect, then all of the leases, and permits and rights of way that flow from those plans may not be legally valid,” Heinrich said.

Because the Congressional Review Act prohibits agencies from adopting rules that are “substantially the same” as what has been repealed, it also injects uncertainty into how future management plans can be shaped, Hamby said.

A group of legal experts wrote to Congress last month warning that using the Congressional Review Act on the plans could open up an “endless cycle of litigation.”

The Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas companies in Western states, praised the passage of the North Dakota resolution, which it said would have the most significant impact on its members. “The Senate resolution is a welcome step that will bring more certainty to energy development and other multiple uses on public lands managed by BLM,” said Melissa Simpson, the group’s president, in a written statement.

Aaron Johnson, the Western Energy Alliance’s vice president of public and legislative affairs, dismissed the concern that repealing the plans would cause legal chaos, saying it will simply revert them to the previous versions.

Hamby said the move could come back to harm some of the interests these resolutions were meant to support, by opening up any leases offered under the now-repealed plans to legal challenges.

“I would not be surprised if we see something like that soon,” Hamby said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2236770251-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 19:03:03.283151

“We hope you will pass these bills quickly from committee and bring Massachusetts closer to tapping its full solar potential,” wrote Neumann and Cummings.","With utility bills rising and lawmakers working to develop pathways for the state to meet its renewable energy goals and limit harmful pollution, Johanna Neumann, the Acting Director of Environment Massachusetts and Deirdre Cummings, the Legislative Director for MASSPIRG submitted testimony to the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy in support of S.2269//H.3520, An Act Facilitating Distributed Energy Resources and S.2270/H.3521 An Act Maximizing and Optimizing Small-scale Assets in Communities.

Massachusetts has the technical potential to provide all of its electricity needs from in-state renewables, even under a scenario where we electrify our transportation and building sectors, and have other applications largely run on electricity.

Although rooftop solar represents a relatively small segment of our overall solar potential, if maximized, rooftop solar has the potential to meet a lot of our energy needs while bringing with it some significant benefits, including reduced dependence on fossil fuels, less strain on the grid during periods of high demand, and the potential for increased resilience to threats like extreme weather. The advocates noted that Massachusetts will likely need some utility-scale solar to meet our energy needs, but that maximizing rooftop solar can help limit the amount of land we’ll need to place clean energy infrastructure on.

If passed S.2269 and H.3520 will support that effort by helping automate the residential solar permitting process and streamlining the interconnection process for rooftop solar systems. Meanwhile, S.2270 H.3521, the MOSAIC Act, establishes a 20% distributed energy resource target by 2035 and creates virtual power plant (VPP) programs. Just like other types of power plants, VPPs can provide a variety of benefits to the grid. VPPs reduce demand on the grid, help to balance energy supply and demand at critical moments, and reduce the risk of blackouts.

Earlier this year, at a staged media event at the White House’s South Lawn, the president publicly announced that in support of Musk, he was purchasing a red Tesla Model S. But by June, amid their deteriorating relationship, the White House said the president was exploring options to sell or give away the vehicle.

Shortly thereafter, on July 4, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law, making it clear that the federal government was determined to inhibit the EV industry in the United States. A provision of the OBBBA outlined the end of the federal government’s EV tax credit—which in 2022 had been extended and revised by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act—as of Sept. 30, 2025.

The end of the federal incentive dealt a blow to the burgeoning EV market, which had seen U.S. sales grow from around 233,000 units in 2020 to more than 1.5 million units in 2024. But the effort falls short of a death knell, as adoption rates continue to increase despite the administration’s efforts to stifle it. According to Grand View Research, the global EV market is forecast to undergo a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.5% between 2025 and 2030. And while the Asia Pacific region represents the largest market in the world, the U.S. EV market is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR through the start of the next decade.

So it’s little surprise that legacy automakers like and have found a loophole that allows them to directly offer consumers the same $7,500 incentive that the federal government’s now-expired EV tax credit once did.

Legacy Automakers Forge Their Own Path Forward… With a Catch

Knowing the EV tax credit’s expiration was looming, Ford and took proactive measures in advance of the Sept. 30 deadline that have allowed the two companies to continue offering customers a price break.

By working within IRS guidelines for clean vehicle tax credits, the financing departments of Ford and GM made down payments on EVs prior to the expiration date. In turn, those savings are allowed to be passed on to buyers for EVs that are either already on dealership lots or were in transit. According to the IRS, those down payments were enough to satisfy the tax credit requirements with the agency.

However, there’s a catch. Even though it isn’t necessary for consumers to take possession of their EVs prior to the Sept. 30 deadline, because it was necessary for dealerships to have done so, the offer is only available for pre-qualified leased EVs. Separately, there is a $4,000 tax credit available for qualifying used EVs.

According to Ford Credit, the company’s financing arm, these offers will be available until Dec. 31. Importantly, while this appears to be a stopgap measure, it demonstrates a commitment by the two largest U.S. automakers to transform their product lines of EVs.

Both Companies Are Heavily Invested in the EV Transition

While the efforts to extend the tax credit savings to customers may be temporary, both Ford and GM have an eye on the future, and that future is decidedly electric.

Ford has committed $5 billion to a multi-pronged approach to electrification of its fleet. That involves investments in 4,000 American jobs at the Louisville Assembly Plant and BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan to deliver a new EV pickup and produce advanced prismatic LFP batteries.

Additionally, the plan entails the Ford Universal EV platform, which aims to produce a family of affordable EVs produced at scale, with over-the-air updates for perpetual vehicle improvement. The first vehicle in that class will be a midsized, four-door electric pickup with a targeted MSRP of around $30,000, which Ford says should reach customers by 2027.

The company is also investing in an improved assembly line—the Ford Universal EV Production System—the goal of which is “radically simplifying vehicle assembly for safety, quality, and speed.”

For its part, GM is planning on investing $4 billion over the next two years into expanding both its EV conversion and increasing production of its internal combustion engine vehicle line.

That plan includes transitioning its factory in Detroit-Hamtramck—rebranded as Factory ZERO—to 100%.

At that plant, GM will only produce EVs, beginning with the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ, and GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV.

What Does That Mean for Investors?

In the near-term, the two companies’ capex toward the EV transition will have little to negative impacts. Long-term, that picture will very likely look different. But Wall Street is tepid in its analysis, with Ford’s average one-year price target 13% lower than today’s share price, and GM’s average one-year price target just 8% higher than today’s share price.

For investors following the money, GM appears to have an edge with 93% institutional ownership versus Ford’s 58% institutional ownership. Given that GM is now the second largest manufacturer of EVs in the United States with Q2 EV sales up 111% year-over-year, accounting for 16% of the U.S. EV market, the smart money might be on to something.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 22:00:27.937658

“As the economy electrifies and more electrons flow through the grid, capital expenditures will be distributed across a larger base, driving down costs for everyone,” it noted.
The report also suggests the industry’s capital allocation priorities have again shifted markedly toward power generation.
The approach reflects a comprehensive system upgrade required to accommodate both increased power flows and changing generation patterns.","America’s investor-owned electric companies are poised to deploy record-breaking investment to launch one of the most aggressive infrastructure modernization campaigns in industry history in a bid to confront unprecedented electricity demand growth and prepare for a fundamentally transformed energy landscape.

In total, over the next five years, the industry is poised to invest more than $1.1 trillion to enhance and expand the grid, according to the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), a trade group that represents all U.S. investor-owned electric companies. That represents an unprecedented accelerated investment pace. By comparison, industry deployed $1.3 trillion over the past 10 years, the research released on Oct. 7 says.

“EEI member companies are on pace to invest nearly $208 billion this year to make the energy grid smarter, stronger, more efficient, and more secure,” the analysis notes. The investment is a direct response to rising demand for energy. Last year, power generation in the U.S. jumped 3% to reach 4,304,038 GWh—marking the “largest annual jump in years,” it notes. By 2030, U.S. electricity generation could soar to more than 4,500,000 GWh and surpass 5,400,000 GWh by 2040, which would mark an average annual growth of 1.7%.

The injection of investment will bolster construction of “more energy- and cost-efficient infrastructure” to meet surging electricity demand,” EEI said. “As the economy electrifies and more electrons flow through the grid, capital expenditures will be distributed across a larger base, driving down costs for everyone,” it noted. EEI added that “these investments will ensure reliability and enable companies to provide electricity at the lowest-possible cost for customers.”

Investment Priorities May Be Shifting Back Toward Power Generation

The scale of planned system expansion also defies historical precedent. EEI suggests 91 GW of new generating capacity is currently under construction, and an additional 488 GW is planned or has been proposed for the next five years. “For comparison, the grid currently has approximately 1,250 GW of capacity,” the report notes. Combined, the 579-GW pipeline represents 46.3% of the nation’s existing grid capacity, and it potentially positions utilities to expand the power system by nearly half its current size within the next half-decade.

The report also suggests the industry’s capital allocation priorities have again shifted markedly toward power generation. While generation investments have represented a rising share of total capital expenditures for four consecutive years, the shift marks a definitive pivot from the previous decade’s emphasis on transmission and distribution modernization, as utilities confront the immediate need for new generating resources to meet exploding demand.

The data show generation spending has nearly doubled since 2020, rising from 24% to 30% of total capex, reflecting a decisive pivot to new power supply amid surging load growth from electrification, AI, and industrial expansion.

Distribution infrastructure, however, continues commanding the largest investment category within the projected $207.9 billion in functional capital expenditures for 2025, followed by transmission, generation, and gas-related infrastructure investments. The approach reflects a comprehensive system upgrade required to accommodate both increased power flows and changing generation patterns.

A Historic Infrastructure Pipeline Is Emerging

As a whole, total spending by investor-owned utilities is projected to reach $207.9 billion in 2025, up from $139.8 billion in 2020—a nearly 50% increase in five years. For now, distribution is set to remain the single largest spending category, accounting for about one-third ($66.5 billion) of this year’s total, while generation surges to 30% ($62.4 billion)—its highest share in more than a decade. Transmission, meanwhile, will make up roughly 18% ($37 billion), followed by gas-related infrastructure at 14% ($29 billion) and other investments at 6% ($12 billion).

EEI notes that while the gas-related infrastructure category covers natural gas delivery and pipeline infrastructure, it does not cover gas-fired electric generation. While gas infrastructure’s share has remained relatively stable over the past decade, total gas-related investment has grown by nearly 22% since 2020, likely to improve safety, resilience, and efficiency. But investment also likely supports the industry’s broader grid reliability goals, particularly given that many utilities rely on natural gas networks for winter peak supply and to balance intermittent renewable generation.

The historic surge in capital spending follows decades of incremental, maintenance-driven investment that plugged critical gaps without realigning the grid’s interconnected layers. As POWER reported in its detailed June 2025 feature (“Out of Sync: The Infrastructure Misalignment Undermining the U.S. Grid”), the U.S. power system has long relied on piecemeal upgrades—patching aging lines, retrofitting equipment, and adding local projects in isolation—while generation, transmission, and distribution evolved on disconnected timelines under fragmented regulation.

That reactive approach has left the grid misaligned. POWER found that without a coordinated, systemwide vision that synchronizes planning, permitting, and financing across all assets, investment—even if unprecedented—risks entrenching these structural mismatches rather than resolving them.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/eeiexenditures2015-2029.png,N,,2025-10-09 18:03:33.368217

Energy is now a strategic priority: Reshoring manufacturers must treat energy planning as key to cost, resilience, and sustainability.

Policy shifts require flexibility: Evolving federal energy priorities make tailored, jurisdiction-aware strategies essential.

Plan early and strategically: Each energy option — RECs, PPAs, or on-site generation — carries long-term legal and financial implications.

As manufacturers accelerate plans to re-shore operations to the U.S., energy strategy has become one of the most material and multidimensional issues in the facility planning process. For energy-intensive industries, power procurement isn’t just a line item on the budget or a utility concern — it’s a strategic input with legal, financial, and operational implications.

This importance is amplified by today’s political and regulatory uncertainty. The Trump administration has already made significant changes to the energy landscape, and has signaled that more is to come. This could mean different priorities for decarbonization, incentives for renewables, or permitting rules for fossil fuel projects and transmission lines.

These shifting priorities directly affect how manufacturers evaluate energy options — especially when long-term investments are at stake. Manufacturers must take a more strategic and tailored approach to energy planning to ensure operational goals and cost structure for decades.

Features of Energy for Manufacturing

Manufacturers’ energy needs are different than many other types of commercial operations:

Load Size: Manufacturing operations, in particular heavy manufacturing, often have relatively large loads. This opens additional supply avenues to manufacturers, and provides market leverage.

Load Profile: Manufacturing operations have relatively consistent and predictable energy needs, particularly facilities that operate multiple shifts.

Long horizons: Manufacturing facilities are long-lived assets. This allows manufacturers to make energy decisions over decades instead of months.

Consistency and uptime: Energy interruptions mean costly facility downtime. For some manufacturers, energy interruptions mean damage to inventory or equipment, and protection against energy interruption is of paramount importance.

Process Steam: Some manufacturing operations also require thermal energy, process steam, or similar non-electric energy inputs. Such requirements will substantially limit the available energy supply options. Here, we will focus on electric-only load requirements.

For manufacturers, energy supply is on par with labor availability and similar operational planning. In some sectors, energy considerations even outweigh traditional factors like real estate cost or proximity to suppliers. Energy should be an intentional operational opportunity to align with long-term cost, sustainability, and resilience goals.

Four Strategic Energy Goals

Manufacturers’ energy strategies balance some combination of four competing energy goals:

Reducing total energy costs, particularly in price-sensitive or energy-intensive sectors.

Price predictability, to support long-term financial planning.

“Greening” the energy supply, for ESG or regulatory reasons. For some products and jurisdictions, a sufficiently green energy supply may also extend “green” benefits to the manufacturer’s products.

Interruption protection, to avoid operational losses and liabilities.

No energy strategy can perfectly achieve all of these goals simultaneously, however. Choices and compromises must be made.

Energy Management Approaches

With competing energy goals in play, manufacturers should evaluate available management approaches which vary in complexity, commitment, and impact.

Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). While technically not energy, RECs are a straightforward tool for achieving energy greening goals. The manufacturer buys energy from the grid (or any other source), and separately purchase RECs in the desired amounts. This allows the manufacturer to offset the emissions from purchased energy.

Pros: Low cost; limited commitment; easy to execute; no physical facility required.

Cons: Increases overall energy cost; does not contribute towards goals other than greening.

Use case: Companies needing quick ESG reporting solutions or early-stage green targets.

Offsite Power Purchase (Virtual or Physical Delivery). With this approach, the manufacturer signs an agreement with the owner of a power plant not co-located with the manufacturing facility, and the remote power plant supplies energy to the manufacturing facility. This energy will reduce the amount of energy purchased from the local utility. These long-term financial contracts allow manufacturers to lock in their energy cost long-term.

Pros: May provide overall cost reduction, price certainty, and energy greening; no local construction required.

Cons: Potentially long-term commitment; limited availability in fully-regulated energy markets; does not provide interruption protection; remote supply may not provide energy greening in all circumstances.

Use case: Sophisticated buyers with strong legal/financial teams.

On-Site Energy Facility. An energy facility constructed at or adjacent to the manufacturing facility can provide energy generation, energy storage, or both.

Pros: Strong alignment with all four goals; physical interruption protection available.

Cons: Requires land, capital, and time for development and construction; long-term commitment.

Use case: Long-term manufacturing facilities with access to land or favorable permitting regimes; manufacturing facilities that require interruption protection.

Microgrids. Self-contained energy systems that can island from the grid offer resilience and autonomy. Microgrids combine multiple generation and storage solutions to maximize control of energy supply.

Pros: Resilience; price control; custom design.

Cons: High operational complexity; regulatory hurdles; redundancy/oversupply may be required.

Use case: Mission-critical manufacturing; remote or off-grid locations.

Choosing a Path: Legal and Operational Considerations

No matter the technology, key decision parameters should guide manufacturers’ energy planning:

Setup time – Strategies that require energy plant development/construction generally take longer than strategies involving only contractual arrangements. Technologies require differing lead times.

Commitment Duration – Most of the options discussed require long-term commitment, but the duration of that commitment can vary significantly depending on technology and structure selections. Factor those timelines into your choice.

Financial and Contractual Terms – The contracts involved in energy planning can be complex, and the specific terms can vary significantly. Evaluation of financial and contractual details should be considered early in the process.

Regulatory Considerations – Energy generation and transmission is highly regulated everywhere, but there is still significant variation across jurisdictions. The process, structure, terms, and even availability of both on-site and off-site solutions will be subject to and limited by local/regional rules.

Siting and Permitting – Local zoning and environmental rules can change the cost/benefit analysis for various energy strategies, and in some cases may limit available on-site options.

Manufacturers planning new or expanded U.S. operations should take an informed, flexible, and jurisdiction-aware approach to energy.

In this case, though, GM is trying to undercut the competition as much as possible by including destination charges in its sub-$30,000 price tag.","Tesla might have just made waves by debuting cheaper versions of its two most popular models, but another EV competitor is coming for the title of ""cheapest American-made EV,"" and that competitor is General Motors. More specifically, the upcoming 2027 Chevrolet Bolt will take the prize as the first American-made EV to start below $30,000 — almost $10,000 under the cheapest Tesla. While questions remain around just how reliable EVs are as everyday vehicles, there's no doubt that one of the biggest pain points of adoption is how much many of these ""environmentally friendly"" vehicles cost.

One way to offset that cost used to be the federal EV tax credits, which Americans could take advantage of to effectively cut the price of a EV by up to $7,500. However, the Trump administration killed off the tax credit after taking office earlier this year — just one of several sweeping changes that Trump and his team have made since taking over the government again.

The Bolt has always been marketed as an affordable EV, even when we last reviewed one back in 2022. Despite its affordability, GM temporarily ended production of the Bolt in 2023. That didn't last long, though, as the company later announced the Bolt would make a comeback. Now we know what that comeback looks like, as the 2027 Chevy Bolt will be the cheapest American-made EV on the market.

According to Car and Driver, the 2027 Bolt will start at $29,990 when it launches in 2026. The low price will come with some concessions as GM has noted it won't support CarPlay or Android Auto. That said, Google's infotainment system will be built in, so drivers can still access Google Maps, HBO Max, and other apps. If you aren't as concerned about staying under $30,000, there will be a sportier RS trim available for $32,995. A base 1LT model is expected a few months later as well, which will start at $28,995.

The important thing to note here is that these prices also include destination charges. Other EVs, like the Nissan Leaf, have previously debuted for under that $30,000 mark, but those prices haven't included destination charges. Destination charges are usually non-negotiable charges passed on to the customer to help cover the cost of moving the vehicles from the factory to the lot where they're purchased. In this case, though, GM is trying to undercut the competition as much as possible by including destination charges in its sub-$30,000 price tag.",https://www.bgr.com/img/gallery/the-federal-ev-tax-credit-is-dead-but-this-new-ev-will-cost-under-30000/l-intro-1760044667.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 23:00:04.781080

Those notices advised staffers they’re entering “non-duty, non-pay status,” effective Thursday, according to records viewed by POLITICO’s E&E News.

The notices said EPA could no longer incur “further financial obligations” and “a number of EPA employees will be placed in a furlough status.”

How many EPA employees have been furloughed so far is not clear. The agency didn’t answer questions about the number of staffers being sent home or whether EPA had exhausted its available funds to stay open.

EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said the agency was operating according to its shutdown or “lapse” plan. Under that plan, once carryover funds expire, EPA could furlough more than 13,000 employees until the shutdown ends.

Multiple EPA employees, who have been granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, said they’ve been told this is the first phase of furloughs at the agency. But details have been sparse, leaving employees in a new phase of limbo.

Since the shutdown began last week, EPA staffers have been reporting to work as usual. Exemption notices sent to many employees, potentially the entire staff, gave no timeline on when furloughs would start.

EPA’s largest union denounced staff being furloughed.

“Furloughing EPA employees is not just an attack on federal workers, but an attack on every American’s right to clean air, safe water, and uncontaminated soil,” said Justin Chen, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, in a statement.

Chen added, “When the essential services that EPA workers provide stop, that means pollution monitoring, toxic cleanup, and other public health protections stall and communities suffer.”

The union leader also took issue with the White House questioning whether furloughed government workers would receive back pay once the funding lapse ends. EPA’s own guidance indicates they will be paid in accordance with a law President Donald Trump signed after the 2019 shutdown (see related story).

“Now President Trump is adding insult to injury by threatening to withhold guaranteed pay for furloughed employees, a move that is not only disgusting, but illegal,” Chen said.

EPA employees took note of the administration’s threats, including issuing a reduction in force, or RIF, during the shutdown. One agency staffer said they didn’t appreciate the president’s intent “to defy the law and deny us back pay or lay people off.”

“But I honestly think federal workers are so traumatized that the threats mostly just bounce off us at this point,” the EPA employee said.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor is walking back a program that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired September 30, the company said on Thursday.

""Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today,"" a spokesperson said.

The decision follows a similar move from General Motors on Wednesday. While automakers including Hyundai and Stellantis have offered cash off incentives to bridge the gap for buyers, Ford and GM took a different approach.

The in-house lending arms at these two automakers planned to initiate the purchase of EVs in dealers’ inventory, and the companies would apply for the $7,500 credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0 percent financing for 72 months and other incentives, a spokesperson said.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. It is unclear why Ford canceled its program.

Ford and GM developed their strategies after discussions with officials at the Internal Revenue Service, Reuters previously reported.

Some auto executives, including Ford CEO Jim Farley, have warned that EV sales will drop significantly in the absence of the credit. Other automotive leaders, such as the CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, have affirmed that the electric vehicle market is more resilient than that.

We’ve pulled together the cancellations into a visualization that illustrates just how rough these cuts are going to be for nascent industries - and well established ones too.
The largest sets of cuts are from the offices of Clean Energy Demonstration ($4.44 billion) and Manufacturing Energy Supply Chain program ($4.03 billion).
Some of the largest project cuts target electric vehicle manufacturers, battery producers, and critical minerals processing.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is losing $530 million in federal investment for electric vehicle factories in Illinois and Indiana.","On October 2nd, the Department of Energy announced that it cut 321 projects supporting American companies in advanced manufacturing, hydrogen production, grid reliability, and efficient industry, “saving” $7.56 billion - or $5.8 billion with a review of the actual data from USAspending. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s DOE targeted the cuts towards projects in districts held by Democrats - 4:1 by total dollar amount.

This week, it was revealed that the DOE is looking at another tranche of cuts - this time with Republican districts on the block. So what’s at stake here? The answer is $15.5 billion in federal government spending, another $13.3 billion in state matching funding, and an extraordinary amount of private investment that’s likely to get wiped out overnight.

We’ve pulled together the cancellations into a visualization that illustrates just how rough these cuts are going to be for nascent industries - and well established ones too. We took the reported list of awards, and pulled up their records (although as of this writing, the records from the first tranche of projects have already been expunged from USAspending).

The largest sets of cuts are from the offices of Clean Energy Demonstration ($4.44 billion) and Manufacturing Energy Supply Chain program ($4.03 billion). Clean Energy Demonstration is a program funded under the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and has largely spurred major US industries to look for improvements in their manufacturing processes. Programs funded under the OCED included low emissions cement manufacture, clean steel, and advanced chemical manufacturing. The Manufacturing Energy Supply Chain program was spurred through the Inflation Reduction Act, and is largely geared towards improving the supply chain of critical minerals, battery production, and parts manufacturing for electric vehicles.

Also on the chopping block are key projects from the Grid Deployment Office ($3.29 billion), a BIL program meant to help both big utilities and state and local authorities buff up aging transmission systems through cutting edge technology improvements; and programs funded by the Office of Fossil Energy ($1.97 billion), the group in charge of the vaunted hydrogen hubs and carbon capture projects. Another $1.69 billion in cuts are being made to the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, almost all of which are innovative projects by small and medium industries to make big steps forward in improving their own processes and reducing cost, or to state academic institutions for industrial research and development.

Some of the largest project cuts target electric vehicle manufacturers, battery producers, and critical minerals processing. General Motors in Michigan is losing $500 million in federal investment to spur new electric motor factories in Michigan, Kansas, and Kentucky. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is losing $530 million in federal investment for electric vehicle factories in Illinois and Indiana. Mercedes in South Carolina ($285 million), Volvo in North Carolina ($208 million), and even Harley Davidson in Pennsylvania ($89 million) are all being slashed.

But it’s not just electric vehicles. Batteries, used in cars, industries, houses, and consumer goods - as well as by utilities - are being cut with big losses for lithium processing in Nevada ($123 million), cathode production in Kentucky ($316 million), and graphite manufacturing in South Carolina ($150 million).

Some of the most innovative manufacturing processes are also being cut. A massive investment in clean steel is on the block in Louisiana (Vale, $283 million), a brand new advanced concrete production facility in Indiana (Heidelberg, $500 million), and a solar/storage facility that would have reduced the cost of gold mining in Nevada (Nevada Gold, $95 million) are now out the window as well.

These projects are critical not only to the communities and jobs that they serve, but are core to a robust supply chain to keep prices - and emissions - low for consumers and businesses. This kind of federal funding is the stuff that actually makes things work. Investments in our economy drive new industries, drive American innovation, and keep our economy competitive. Slashing these programs is a relatively small short-term gain for a huge long-term loss.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-10/screenshot-2025-10-09-at-4.17.19-pm.png.webp?itok=7d6j9pbT,N,,2025-10-09 19:03:37.910895

How to revive community solar growth A few factors could change the sector’s fortunes, however.","The future of community solar is dimming, hampered by federal attacks on clean energy and shifts in state markets.

Installations of the shared-solar approach took a nosedive in the first half of 2025, dropping by 36% from the same period last year, according to a new report by consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Working in collaboration with the Coalition for Community Solar Access, an industry trade group, Wood Mackenzie forecasts that by the end of 2025, installations will fall by 29% from 2024’s record high of 1.7 gigawatts. According to the analysis, growth will likely contract by an average of about 12% annually through 2030.

“I’m dismayed by this report,” said John Farrell, co-director of the research and advocacy nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance. ​“Of the places where we have policies [that drive community solar], it looks like things are slowing down.”

Why community solar is buckling despite its benefits

Community solar makes clean power accessible to those who can’t put solar panels on their roofs — be it because they rent, can’t afford them, or have other reasons. Households can subscribe to a share of an off-site array, which is typically 2 to 20 megawatts, per the report, to get credit for the power and save on their energy bills. Third-party developers usually build and own these installations — not utilities.

About 9.1 gigawatts of shared solar have been installed in the U.S. to date, according to the report’s authors. They expect community solar capacity to reach roughly 16 GWby 2030.

The megabill that Republicans passed in July is a major reason for the community solar market’s shake-up. The law set an early expiration date for a key tax credit worth 30% to 50% of the cost of a project. Developers once had until 2034 to claim it; now companies must either start construction by July 2026 and finish within four years or start producing power by the end of 2027.

Because of the law’s passage, Wood Mackenzie slashed its community solar figures through 2030 by about 8%, or 655 megawatts, from its prior forecast, said Caitlin Connelly, senior analyst at the firm and lead author of the report.

But factors at the state level are also contributing to the slowdown. In particular, New York and Maine are driving the steep decline.

Developers in New York, a mature market, are having trouble finding sites, paying higher permitting and land costs, and having to wait an average of nearly three years to get connected to the grid, making projects more expensive to develop, Connelly said.

Meanwhile, in Maine, two regulatory changes are at play. Last year saw record growth as developers sprinted to get projects done by the December phaseout of the state’s net metering program, leading to fewer in the pipeline now, Connelly noted. In June, legislators also passed a bill that retroactively overhauled compensation for community solar power and added fees for new and established projects. The industry has said these provisions will make the state a ​“pariah for investors.”

Some states, such as Virginia and New Mexico, also have caps on the size of their community solar programs that are limiting new developments, according to Connelly.

And more federal turbulence could be ahead.

The Trump administration is also trying to claw back funding that would’ve supported solar: the $7 billion Solar for All program and the $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, programs passed under the landmark Inflation Reduction Act.

“The impact of [losing] Solar for All is one that we are tracking closely,” Connelly said, as the move could stymie community solar in places where it’s just getting off the ground.

While this year is likely to be a rough one for community solar, Connelly sees growth returning in 2026 and 2027. This is in part due to rebounds in Massachusetts and New Jersey, both of which are transitioning into new iterations of existing programs.

Public advocate praises new net energy billing reform law that could save ratepayers money

Massachusetts will open up its Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target program, SMART3.0, to developers on October 15. And New Jersey recently eliminated a 150-megawatt annual cap and unlocked a whopping 3 gigawatts of community solar capacity.

But that growth is just a temporary reprieve. Over the longer term, the forecast shows community solar installations trending down.

How to revive community solar growth

A few factors could change the sector’s fortunes, however.

For one, if states were to start new community solar programs, as well as address interconnection bottlenecks, they could drive up to 1.3 gigawatts of additional capacity through 2030, according to the report. But ​“we don’t really see any new programs opening up, at least in the near term,” Connelly said. ​“Policymakers have made a lot of progress in some state markets over the last six months to a year, but the difficulty is getting that legislation over the finish line.”

In deep red Montana, for example, legislators approved a new community solar program, with 100 in favor and 50 opposed, underscoring the model’s growing appeal to Republicans. But Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) vetoed the bill, claiming that it could result in ​“unreasonable costs” being foisted on other energy customers.

Only 24 states plus Washington, D.C., have passed community solar legislation as of February, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Iowa are all considering shared-solar bills, said Jeff Cramer, president and CEO of the Coalition for Community Solar Access.

Other states could be tempted to authorize a flood of clean, cheap solar power. The grid is facing soaring demand from data centers, electric vehicles, buildings, and manufacturing, and distributed community solar is among the fastest options to deploy.

“If you want to build a new gas plant right now, you’re going to need five-plus years minimum to do it. You want to build a new utility-scale [solar or wind] facility — at least five years as well, and that’s pending the development of new transmission,” Cramer said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DSC_0370-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 18:03:18.495206

The lessons we learn here will guide the future design, construction, and operation of our spaces.""
According to the company, the building is ""the first large-scale owner-occupied mass timber logistics facility in the United States"" and the project is aiming to achieve Living Future's Zero Carbon Certification.
Mallory says the company will track the performance of the building and implement successful features in other Amazon buildings.
The building joins others that Amazon has used mass timber to build, including its HQ2 buildings in Arlington, Virginia.","Amazon has completed a mass timber warehouse in Indiana, USA, which the company says will be used as a testbed for ""over 40 sustainability strategies"" to implement in existing and future buildings.

Located in Elkhart, the DII5 warehouse is primarily made of mass timber and was designed by design architect ZGF Architects with elements such as clerestory windows, circadian lighting, and EV charging stations as part of the company's goal of reaching net zero operations by 2024.

""By testing several sustainability initiatives under one roof, we're accelerating our progress toward achieving scalability and standardization of these initiatives across our building portfolio,"" Amazon vice president of global realty Daniel Mallory told Dezeen.

""At the same time, it serves as a 'test and learn' platform for Amazon and the broader industry to explore how buildings can become more adaptive, high-performing, and resilient in a changing climate. The lessons we learn here will guide the future design, construction, and operation of our spaces.""

According to the company, the building is ""the first large-scale owner-occupied mass timber logistics facility in the United States"" and the project is aiming to achieve Living Future's Zero Carbon Certification.

It encompasses one large delivery building surrounded by a site that includes elements such as permeable paving, ""lower carbon concrete"", high-efficiency outdoor lighting and a bio-rentention pond for stormwater management.

The building itself was made using Southern Yellow Pine CLT panels and glulam beams, as well as wood fibre insulation.

Its celestory windows, which line the delivery floor, ""bathe the interior in sunshine"", according to Amazon.

""From the moment you approach and enter Amazon's new delivery station you know you're somewhere special,"" said the company. ""This is indeed a new kind of delivery station.""

Mallory says the company will track the performance of the building and implement successful features in other Amazon buildings.

""We're tracking multiple metrics, including total embodied carbon reduction compared to conventional construction, operational energy efficiency, water conservation performance, impacts of biodiversity, etc,"" he said.

""We're also studying how the building performs in various weather conditions and monitoring construction and operational costs to assess the business case for scaling these approaches.""

The building joins others that Amazon has used mass timber to build, including its HQ2 buildings in Arlington, Virginia. The company notes several of its buildings have achieved Living Future's Zero Carbon Certification, including warehouses in Australia and one in the UK.

""While we view DII5 as a strategic investment in designing and implementing sustainability strategies in our future buildings design, it will also give us an opportunity to test which of these initiatives can be scaled across our existing buildings portfolio,"" said Mallory.

""If certain features don't perform as expected or cannot be implemented in certain existing facilities, that information will be valuable in refining our approach to our future sustainable building design.""

Some of the company's sustainability claims have received criticism in the past. Last year, the New York Times reported that despite claims it had reached its green energy goals, some groups raised concern over a reliance on renewable energy certificates, though Amazon disputed these criticisms.

Elsewhere in Indiana, concerns have been raised about the extensive energy usage of its AI processing facility. Some reports claim Amazon's greenhouse gas emissions rose by 6 per cent in 2024.

While the company recently completed phase one of its HQ2 project, the second phase of the project previously came under fire for its proposed, spiralled Helix building, which drew public comparisons to an ice-cream scoop and poop emoji. Construction on the second phase of the project is currently paused.

It also updated its logo earlier this year.

JK Tyre has already achieved 53% renewable energy in its operations and targets 75% within five years.","India's leading tyre manufacturer MRF Limited has announced a strategic investment of ₹99 crores to acquire a 26% stake in Serentica Renewables India 26 Private Limited, marking the company's significant entry into renewable energy sector. This move represents MRF's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and enhancing sustainable manufacturing practices as the automotive industry transitions toward cleaner energy solutions.

The Chennai-based tyre giant will invest ₹99 crores through cash consideration to acquire up to 26% equity stake in Serentica Renewables India 26 Private Limited, a company incorporated on May 5, 2025. The deal includes a power supply and consumption agreement for solar and wind power under the government's captive power policy, with completion expected by July 31, 2026.

Serentica Renewables India 26 Private Limited, headquartered in Gurugram, operates as a developer in build, own, operate, maintain and manage hydel, solar, wind, geothermal, energy storage and other alternate energy sources. Since the company was recently incorporated, it has not commenced commercial operations yet.

This renewable energy investment aligns with MRF's broader sustainability strategy as the company faces mounting pressure to reduce emissions across its 10 manufacturing facilities in India. The tyre manufacturer has already committed to achieving net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by FY2050, with an interim target of 25% reduction in emission intensity by FY2028.

Currently, renewable energy contributes 12% to MRF's overall electricity consumption through renewable power purchase agreements. The Serentica investment represents a strategic move to expand this renewable energy portfolio and ensure long-term energy cost stability for the company's manufacturing operations.

The captive power arrangement will provide MRF with direct access to clean energy under the group captive generation mechanism outlined in the Electricity Act, allowing the company to meet at least 51% of its power requirements from the jointly-owned renewable facility.

While carbon credits could provide additional revenue streams, MRF's investment appears driven by multiple strategic factors beyond carbon monetization. The primary motivation centres on energy security and cost management, as captive renewable power plants typically offer 20-25 years of predictable energy costs compared to volatile grid tariffs.

The investment also positions MRF to meet India's Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) while supporting the country's net-zero emissions target by 2070. This regulatory compliance aspect has become increasingly important as environmental norms tighten across industrial sectors.

MRF's renewable energy push follows similar moves by other major Indian tyre manufacturers. Competitor JK Tyre became India's first tyre company to join the RE100 initiative, committing to 100% renewable electricity by 2050. JK Tyre has already achieved 53% renewable energy in its operations and targets 75% within five years.

Meanwhile, Bridgestone's Pune facility achieved carbon neutrality status through a combination of solar panels, biomass-based boilers and carbon offset credits.",https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/MRF_87f6c15a81.webp,N,,2025-10-09 20:01:13.787662

As we seek to help lift people out of poverty by giving them access to better jobs, energy has become one of the critical levers for change.
We know that affordable and reliable electricity is key for firms seeking to scale operations more efficiently in the region.
In Senegal, the Energy Access and Scale-Up Project aims to bring electricity to 600 health clinics, 200 schools, 700 small and medium-sized enterprises, and 200,000 households.
This expansion is creating jobs through installation, maintenance, and electrification supply chains while improving productivity in education, health care, and small businesses.","Over the past 150 years, leaps in energy technology and availability around the world have made numerous jobs easier, faster, or even obsolete. Think of laundromats replacing laundresses, automation and robots taking the place of workers in assembly lines, and now artificial intelligence-assisted chatbots replacing customer service agents.

The same is true in Africa, but the shift is happening at a much slower pace. In a region where roughly 600 million people still lack access to electricity and many industries are being held back by unreliable or unaffordable electricity, access to energy holds the power to transform economies, increase incomes, and reshape the employment environment for the better.

That is good news for Africa, as the job landscape urgently needs to be disrupted. Across the region, informal and subsistence work still employs the majority of working-age Africans, leaving too many families vulnerable to poverty. Most earn a living through self-employment or micro-businesses, which offer limited scope for investment and growth. Only a small share of workers have access to formal, wage-paying jobs.

Many conditions are necessary for firms to grow and hire better skilled workers, from a conducive business environment to regulatory stability and access to large, attractive markets. But infrastructure, especially access to energy, is a strikingly important ingredient.

It’s no accident that the World Bank Group has made Mission 300, our initiative to provide electricity to 300 million people in Africa by 2030, so central to our work. As we seek to help lift people out of poverty by giving them access to better jobs, energy has become one of the critical levers for change.

We know that affordable and reliable electricity is key for firms seeking to scale operations more efficiently in the region. High electricity costs undermine the competitiveness of private sector firms, often forcing them to rely on manual processes instead of adopting high productivity technologies that require more energy. Unreliable power also remains a major challenge, with blackouts causing major disruptions to business activity and reducing employment rates by an estimated 5 to 14 percentage points.

Firms operating in sectors such as agribusiness, light manufacturing, mining, housing and construction, health care, and tourism could greatly boost productivity through more intensive energy use. (You can find deep dives into the job potential of each of these sectors in the October 2025 edition of Africa’s Pulse.) In health care, for instance, rapid advances in imaging and monitoring require reliable energy and skilled labor to use these technologies. Similarly, tourism depends heavily on modern amenities, including readily available phone charging, Wi-Fi access, and air conditioning. When it comes to temperature control, the largest projected economic impact from climate change on the region—even greater than flooding and droughts—is expected to come from heat stress on workers, making cooling systems essential for employers.

Given how critical energy access is to job creation in the region, the World Bank has committed to leveraging $30 billion in resources from our International Development Association (IDA) over the next five years in support of Mission 300. This represents roughly 20 percent of our current funding for the region.

This level of commitment is matched by governments themselves, who are driving reforms, setting bold targets, and creating the conditions needed to transform their energy sectors through National Energy Compacts. These compacts set ambitious, time-bound goals to expand energy infrastructure at competitive costs, harness the benefits of regional power integration, encourage greater private sector participation to unlock additional resources, and strengthen utilities.

In rural or remote settings, distributed renewable energy is filling critical infrastructure gaps by powering both households and small businesses. For example, in Sierra Leone, demand-driven mini-grids are proving that rural electrification can be commercially viable when linked directly to productive uses like milling, cold storage, and digital services.

On the grid side, we’re bringing electricity to schools, health centers, and other public services to help build a stronger, healthier, and more skilled future workforce. In Ethiopia, energy initiatives are creating jobs across sectors, providing sustainable incomes. One project has already connected more than 8 million people and over 19,000 schools, clinics, and government facilities across Ethiopia.

To date, Tanzania’s Rural Electrification Expansion Program has connected more than 16,000 rural businesses to the electricity grid, from food processing and fish farms to construction and mining, boosting their productivity and enabling growth. In Senegal, the Energy Access and Scale-Up Project aims to bring electricity to 600 health clinics, 200 schools, 700 small and medium-sized enterprises, and 200,000 households. This expansion is creating jobs through installation, maintenance, and electrification supply chains while improving productivity in education, health care, and small businesses.

These engagements reflect broader efforts across the region to transform the energy landscape, with a focus on practical solutions that do more than just turn on the lights—they also create jobs at scale.",https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/wbcollab/mission-300-africa-electricity-1140x500?qlt=90&hei=630&wid=1200&fit=hfit,N,,2025-10-09 17:02:25.182271

We told you so. For months, CleanTechnica has been chronicling the Republican war on offshore wind farms in the US. All of the threatened projects come under the umbrella of blue states with Democratic governors, which is not a shocker. Except, there is one exception, the massive 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project. As CleanTechnica pointed out back April and several times since then (most recently on September 23), Virginia’s Republican Governor, Glenn Youngkin, is a big fan of CVOW and the project appears safe — for now, that is.

Virginia Is For (Offshore Wind) Lovers

Now that the general media is finally paying attention to the Glenn Youngkin connection, let’s take another look at CVOW. The offshore wind project has made regular appearances on the pages of CleanTechnica since the wind-friendly days of the Obama administration, which saw the Interior Department’s newly formed Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issue a series of leases for offshore wind development along the Atlantic coast including CVOW’s parcel of 112,799 acres off the coast of Virginia. BOEM issued the lease to the project developer, the leading US utility Dominion Energy, in 2013.

As with many other offshore wind projects, CVOW somehow managed to keep moving through the development pipeline on up to the last weeks of the first Trump administration. Dominion submitted construction plans to BOEM in December of 2020, which were ultimately approved in January 2024 during President Biden’s term in office.

CVOW & The Jones Act Connection

Despite the long years between 2013 and now, the timeline worked out in Dominion’s favor. Offshore turbine technology has improved over the past 12 years, and Dominion can now take advantage of the efficiencies provided by specialized offshore wind construction ships, too.

Special operations vessels (SOVs) were not available in the US during the early years of offshore wind development, due to a lack of ships compliant with a complex 1920s-era piece of US maritime law called the Jones Act, which is another thing that has been surfacing on the CleanTechnica radar.

Among other provisions, the Jones Act restricts foreign-built and owned ships from transporting goods and services from one US port of call to another. The main idea is to keep a lid on foreign interference with domestic shipping, especially in case of war breaking out.

Stakeholders in the offshore wind industry did manage to figure out some workarounds to set the wheels in motion, but a more effective solution would be for US shipyards to begin building the specialized SOVs (service operations vessels) needed to optimize the offshore workflow.

That finally began to happen in May of 2024, when the Louisiana ship builder Edison Chouest Offshore proudly introduced its new ECO Edison SOV (Service Operations Vessel), billed as the “first-ever American-built, owned, and crewed offshore wind service operations vessel.”

While Edison Chouest was celebrating, Dominion was also building a US-built, flagged, and crewed offshore wind ship, the Charybdis, at the Seatrium AmFELS shipyard in Brownsville, Texas. A key milestone occurred in April of 2024 when the ship reached the launch-into-water phase. In February of this year Dominion reported that Charybdis was 96% complete and undergoing sea trials in Texas. By late August the ship was on its way to Virginia, and by mid-September it was reportedly docked and ready for action at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Virginia, just in time to help speed completion of the CVOW project toward 2026, which is just around the corner.

Rocky Seas Ahead For US Offshore Wind Industry

As pointed out by Canary Media earlier today, Governor Youngkin is not the only Virginia Republican to champion the CVOW project. US Representative Jen Kiggans is also a fan, partly on account of the $500 million grid upgrade to be received by Naval Air Station Oceana.

So, much of the work already done and completion just months away, it looks like smooth sailing for the CVOW project — or not, as the case may be. Governor Youngkin is term-limited. Unless something extraordinary happens, the Democratic contender for the office, Abigail Spanberger is on track to prevail against the Republican candidate and current Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Earle-Sears on Election Day in November.

A Spanberger victory would put Virginia and CVOW squarely in the crosshairs of President Trump’s chopping block. Since the beginning of this year, the President has suspended new offshore lease activity, recalled permitted projects for additional review, and ordered construction to stop on projects already under way.

Without Youngkin’s support, CVOW will lose its special status. If Spanberger does win, though, perhaps she can take a page out of the book of New York Governor Kathy Hochul. When Trump stopped work on the Empire Wind project in New York state earlier this year, Governor Hochul reportedly negotiated a quid pro quo with Trump in person, and Empire was quickly back on track.

Spanberger better get her ducks in the water because it already looks like the Trump administration is already prepping for a Democrat to occupy the office of Virginia Governor after Election Day. At a conference in Italy last month, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reportedly confirmed that his agency is reviewing five offshore wind projects already under construction, including the CVOW project.

In an interesting turn of events, Empire Wind is also on the list along with another New York project, Sunrise Wind. Governor Hochul may have to pull another card from her sleeve to keep both of those projects in motion.

Make America Lose Again

For the record, rounding Burgum’s hit list is Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Vineyard Wind 1 in Massachusetts.

While all this is going on, the global offshore wind industry is already leveling up to the next phase of growth. Instead of relying on conventional monopile construction methods that apply to relatively shallow waters, the industry is gearing up for the widespread use of floating turbine platforms that can be tethered in deep water, opening up whole new areas for wind development.

Another offshore wind industry trend to keep an eye on is multi-use, in which offshore wind farms host floating solar arrays and wave energy converters. The aquaculture industry is also eyeballing opportunities to piggyback on offshore wind infrastructure, as well.

Too bad the US is missing out on all these new opportunities. What with the economy circling the drain and AI taking over the work that humans used to do, it sure would be nice to have more jobs for people available in construction, ship-building, manufacturing and the like.

The U.S. high-voltage transmission network is vast but aging. 70% of the U.S. transmission lines and transformers have been in service for more than 25 years, a legacy of the mid-20th-century grid buildout. Much of this infrastructure is now strained by new, bidirectional power flows and dynamic loads, unlike the one-way flows it was built for. Much of this infrastructure was originally designed for predictable, one-way power flows from centralized power plants to end users. Today, however, it faces an entirely new set of challenges. The grid must now accommodate dynamic, bidirectional flows from an increasing number of distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop solar, community energy projects, electric vehicles, and battery storage systems.

These changes are creating significant stress on a system designed for a different era. Transmission congestion, bottlenecks, and reliability concerns are becoming more common, with some regions experiencing severe delays in interconnecting new generation projects. According to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) analysis, meeting near-term electricity demand and clean energy goals will require an estimated 60% increase in transmission capacity by 2030. Without major upgrades, the lack of adequate transmission infrastructure threatens to slow the clean energy transition and increase costs for consumers.

Similarly, ASCE’s 2025 Infrastructure Report Card gave the nation’s energy sector a D+, citing underinvestment and a growing mismatch between grid capability and needs. A surge in large-scale load growth, driven not only by industrial expansions but also by the rapid development of data centers, semiconductor fabrication plants, and hydrogen production facilities, has put tremendous pressure on transmission infrastructure. In short, the existing high-voltage (HV) network often lacks the capacity and modern controls needed to handle today’s explosive load growth without major upgrades.

Data centers: Gigawatt-scale loads

Data centers have become a new super-sized load on the grid. A single large data center can consume as much power as ~80,000 homes, and demand for such facilities is rising at a rate of roughly 10% per year.

In regions like Northern Virginia, the impact is dramatic. For example, the Virginia Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission recently reported that PJM’s forecast for the Dominion zone (Virginia) projects about 5.5% annual load growth through 2030, driven almost entirely by new data center load. Additionally, Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley” (located in Ashburn, VA) already hosts over 200 facilities and consumes roughly the same amount of electricity as the city of Boston.

AEP likewise projects that more than 13 GW of new data center load will come online by 2029, making these “AI-driven” centers the most significant component of its retail load growth. In short, individual data centers (or clusters) can impose loads comparable to those of mid-sized cities. This unprecedented growth, especially when situated in one region, far exceeds what the system was built to absorb without upgrades.

Interconnection queues and grid bottlenecks

Planners now face huge uncertainty on both ends of the system. On the generation side, nearly 2,600 GW of power and storage projects are stuck in U.S. interconnection queues, more than double the entire existing U.S. generation fleet. Most of these queued projects (solar, wind, batteries) face long study timelines and frequent withdrawals, underscoring a persistent bottleneck. Meanwhile, on the demand side, speculative “phantom” loads are flooding the queues. Data-center loads add another layer of uncertainty. In PJM, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has now recognized the “co-location” of data centers with generation (often gas plants co-owned by data center developers) as a novel issue requiring review. In 2025, FERC launched a proceeding noting that co-location entails “huge ramifications for grid reliability and consumer costs”. In practice, every speculative interconnection, whether a phantom data center or a stalled solar farm, ties up study resources and permits, slowing upgrades to both supply and network infrastructure.

This uncertainty has tangible consequences for reliability. In July 2024, a near-catastrophic incident in Virginia’s Data Center Alley illustrated the risk. A single surge protector failure on a 230 kV transmission line triggered dozens of data centers to disconnect and switch to backup generators. The sudden loss of load caused a significant voltage spike, forcing PJM and Dominion Energy to throttle their generation to avoid cascading outages. This event demonstrates that large loads can cause the system to trip. The traditional grid was built to handle predictable plant outages, not the abrupt, distributed shutdowns of gigawatt-scale data facilities. All this strain comes as new transmission capacity has lagged far behind the need. All this strain comes as new transmission capacity has lagged far behind need, and interconnection studies remain backlogged. Without reforms to streamline queues, coordinate load and supply planning, and invest in flexible grid infrastructure, the risks to grid stability and consumer affordability will only grow.

High-voltage GRID buildout trails need

Despite these stresses, new high-voltage transmission has barely kept up. According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2024 National Transmission Needs Study, approximately 5,000 miles of new high-capacity transmission must be added annually to support a high-renewables future. However, FERC data for 2024 shows that while over 5,000 circuit-miles of transmission were added, only around 22% of that total was at 230 kV or above, highlighting a continued focus on lower-voltage, local reliability upgrades rather than long-haul, high-voltage lines needed to connect remote renewable resources.

Even in Texas, one of the few regions aggressively expanding transmission, progress has been modest relative to demand. ERCOT recently approved its first 765 kV lines to accommodate extreme load growth in the Permian Basin and along the Gulf Coast. AEP Texas is currently constructing a 300-mile, 765 kV Solstice-to-Howard transmission line to move power from West Texas to San Antonio. Still, such examples remain the exception. Overall, the lack of high-voltage corridor expansion has left the grid vulnerable to overload from concentrated new loads (data centers, EV-charging parks, industrial complexes). Decades of deferred HV investment have created an under-built backbone just as demand is skyrocketing.

Planning reforms and solutions

DOE’s new Transmission Interconnection Roadmap explicitly calls for improving transparency and data in the queue process. For instance, “Solution 1.1” is to “improve the scope, accessibility, quality, and standardization of data on projects already in interconnection queues”, including project specifications, costs, and development status. Without such visibility, planners cannot distinguish firm projects from speculative ones. NERC has similarly emphasized that transmission planning must adapt to new loads. Its 2024 reliability assessment stresses the need to “expand the transmission network to deliver supplies from new resources and locations to serve changing loads”, specifically citing the influence of data centers (and EV/hydrogen) on future demand profiles.

Several policy ideas are on the table:

Robust regional planning – FERC’s Order 1000 requires multi-value, multi-region transmission planning. States and RTOs must coordinate long-term scenarios of both load growth, including big data centers and EV fleets, and clean generation. Enforcing these rules can identify the interregional corridors needed.

Cost-sharing across regions – New HV lines often cross states. Proposals include expanded cost-allocation mechanisms that allow benefits, such as reliability and access to renewables, to be shared among multiple beneficiaries.

Grid-enhancing technologies – Utilities are deploying GETs to boost capacity on existing lines. Examples include dynamic line ratings (adjusting limits in real time to weather conditions), STATCOMs/phase-shifting transformers (improving voltage control), and advanced conductor materials. These can increase throughput without the need to build new towers. Dominion Energy in Virginia has upgraded or reconductored over 800 miles of lines with advanced materials, boosting capacity by up to 50%. They are also piloting dynamic line ratings across Northern Virginia to accommodate fluctuating data center loads.

Stronger interconnection requirements – States are also beginning to push back on speculative DC builds. In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission (PUCO) recently approved a new tariff under which large data center operators must pay for at least 85% of their contracted energy usage, regardless of actual consumption. Virginia has moved toward stricter interconnection studies and infrastructure upgrade requirements to prevent overload on local grids. Similarly, Texas has begun requiring larger deposits and staged commitments before interconnection approval, ensuring developers demonstrate financial seriousness. The goal is to make developers commit before clogging the queue.

Federal funding alignment – Infrastructure funds (IIJA, IRA) provide billions for transmission, but these should be targeted at the high-voltage backbone, not just local upgrades.

Bridging the gap

The U.S. faces an acute mismatch: soaring load growth from data centers, electrified transportation, and industrial decarbonization against an aging, underbuilt HV transmission network. The consequences are increasingly visible: higher market prices, strained reliability margins, and near-miss outage events. Solving this challenge will require a paradigm shift. Instead of reacting to load additions after they emerge, planners should forecast the emergence of gigawatt-scale data centers and electrified industrial clusters years in advance. High-voltage corridors at 345 kV, 500 kV, and 765 kV should be proactively planned and built well ahead of demand. The DOE’s annual 5,000-mile transmission target must become a baseline.

Simultaneously, utilities should maximize existing infrastructure by accelerating the deployment of GETs and reconductoring projects. Finally, transparency and data-sharing should become non-negotiable: developers and utilities should jointly provide project specifications, timelines, and load profiles so that system planners can properly prepare. Equally important, some of this information should be made publicly accessible, enabling communities, consumers, and local governments to understand emerging needs and champion solutions before crises occur. In most industries, sharing forward-looking developments with the public is standard practice. The power sector, financed largely by ratepayers, should also embrace this transparency if it hopes to foster lasting trust and build support for critical investments.

The U.S. grid is at a critical inflection point. Whether it evolves to meet the demands of the digital and decarbonized era will depend on bold action, sustained investment, and unprecedented collaboration across regulators, utilities, developers, and consumers.

This has led to widespread confusion without offering solutions to the energy affordability issues facing Maine families every day.

One favorite target for these false claims is offshore wind. The Gulf of Maine has some of the strongest and most consistent winds in the world, making it the most abundant and promising clean energy resource available to us.

In this blog, we won’t restate all the false claims being made by opponents of clean energy, but we will set the record straight on what you should know about offshore wind in Maine.

Offshore Wind Reduces Energy Prices Across New England

Offshore wind is expected to put downward pressure on wholesale market prices in New England, which will be passed through to Maine electricity customers. One way it does this is by replacing expensive oil-fueled power plants that are fired up during periods of high demand. A study released in September 2025 showed that offshore wind power would generate massive savings during high-demand periods, lowering New England electricity prices by 11% and delivering $400 million in wholesale market savings in just three winter months.

In fact, stalling progress on offshore wind will actually lead to higher electricity prices. For example, the State of Connecticut estimated that the Trump Administration’s plan to cancel Revolution Wind, which is already 80% completed, could cost electricity customers across New England, including Maine, $500 million per year in higher supply costs.

Offshore Wind Will Bring Enormous Economic Benefits to Maine

Responsibly developed offshore wind would be a big boost to Maine’s economy and local communities and aligns with Maine’s more than 400-year maritime and shipbuilding heritage.

An independent study released in 2025 showed that an offshore wind port in Maine would support more than 6,000 jobs during construction, an average of nearly 1,000 jobs annually through 2050, and deliver total economic benefits of $6.6 billion.

That’s why support for a new offshore wind industry spans from the Maine State Chamber of Commerce to Maine’s labor unions.

Offshore Wind Projects Can Be Sited to Avoid Conflict with Maine’s Fishing Industry

Everyone involved in advocating for offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine has made clear that understanding potential impacts to Maine’s fishing industry is essential, so any emerging impacts can be first avoided, then minimized or mitigated.

The best way to avoid impacts is by making sure turbines aren’t located in prime fishing grounds. That’s why NRCM and our partners worked to pass Maine’s 2023 offshore wind bill, which required that projects not be placed in federal Lobster Management Area 1 (LMA1), where nearly all of the Maine-based lobster fleet fish.

The provisions in the bill, plus bipartisan support from Maine’s Congressional delegation and the Mills Administration led to the federal government excluding LMA1 from commercial offshore wind leasing, a big step toward allowing both clean energy and a vibrant fishing industry to exist in the Gulf of Maine at the same time.

Offshore Wind Will Not Be Visible from the Mainland

Commercial offshore wind lease areas in the Gulf of Maine are more than 50 miles from the mainland at their nearest point, will not be visible from shore, and will have no impact on property values.

Offshore Wind Turbines Don’t Harm Whales

There is no scientific evidence linking offshore wind and whale deaths. In fact, the greatest risks whales face are vessel strikes, shifting food species due to climate change, and entanglement with fishing gear.

There is, however, clear evidence linking anti-offshore wind groups that frequently claim a connection between whale deaths and offshore wind to fossil fuel-funded think tanks.

The 2024 Federal Lease Sale was a Vote of Confidence in the Long-term Promise of Offshore Wind in the Gulf of Maine

In October 2024, four commercial floating offshore wind leases were sold in the Gulf of Maine. This exceeded expectations and served as a vote of confidence from developers in the long-term viability and promise of offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine, despite political uncertainty, as the lease sale took place days before the 2024 Presidential elections. The four leases make clear that industry is interested in investing in offshore wind if given the chance.

Fossil Fuel Power Generation Has Far Higher Emissions than Offshore Wind, Even Including Materials and Construction

Studies have shown that clean energy like solar and wind have substantially lower lifetime greenhouse gas emissions than other fossil fuels. Including materials, construction, fuel, and decommissioning, wind power (including offshore wind) emits 37 times less greenhouse gases per unit of power generated than natural gas, and 77 times less than coal.

All sources of energy have an impact. The question should be what sources have the lowest. The damaging impacts of our existing fossil fuel system on our health and climate are colossal compared to other clean energy sources that have much lower impacts.

Offshore Wind Can Be Responsibly Developed to Protect Wildlife

Climate change is the greatest threat facing the more than 3,000 marine species and birds in the Gulf of Maine. Replacing polluting fossil fuels with cleaner energy sources like wind is our best opportunity to protect wildlife.

Using the best data and scientific research available, offshore wind projects in the Gulf of Maine will be held to the highest standards for siting and operations to protect ocean wildlife and ecosystems. Developers will be required to include strong protections for wildlife and the ocean environment for both construction and operations.

It’s crucial that Mainers seek out information from trusted sources. Disinformation is easily spread via social media and should be treated skeptically. NRCM and our partner organizations will continue to educate our supporters and the public using the best information available from scientists and other experts.

We can’t keep relying on expensive fossil fuels to power our homes and businesses. Not only does it drive up electricity prices, it fuels climate change, which is making the storms and flooding harming our communities worse. Responsibly developing offshore wind will generate the large amounts of reliable domestic energy we need to power the future and help keep energy costs affordable.

Base Power, an Austin-based energy technology company, has secured $1 billion in Series C funding to accelerate the deployment of home battery systems across the United States. The round was led by Addition, with participation from leading investors including Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, Elad Gil, and several new backers such as Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

The company, co-founded and led by Zach Dell, is on a mission to modernise America’s ageing power grid through a decentralised network of smart batteries. These home-installed systems allow users to store energy, access backup power, and sell excess electricity back to the grid.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” said Dell. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.”

This massive funding round positions Base Power as one of the most well-capitalised startups in the renewable energy and battery infrastructure space, signalling strong investor confidence in distributed energy solutions.

Base Power Funding Expands Domestic Energy Manufacturing

A major portion of the $1 billion raised will go toward domestic manufacturing and large-scale deployment of Base Power’s energy storage technology. The company is constructing its first energy storage and power electronics factory in downtown Austin, Texas, at the site of the former Austin American-Statesman printing press.

This facility will serve as the foundation for Base Power’s broader industrial expansion, with plans already in motion for a second U.S. manufacturing site.

“We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid,” said Lopas, an executive at Base Power. “The only way to add capacity to the grid is by physically deploying hardware, and we need to make that here in the U.S., ourselves.”

Base Power’s model aligns with the broader reindustrialisation movement sweeping across the U.S., as companies bring high-tech manufacturing closer to home to strengthen supply chains and energy independence. The Austin plant represents a major step toward building a self-sustaining ecosystem for renewable energy hardware.

Base Power Funding Supports Grid Stability Through Distributed Storage

At the heart of Base Power’s model is its home battery leasing system, which offers affordable upfront and monthly costs to homeowners. Each installed battery provides backup power during outages and enables users to participate in local energy markets by selling excess electricity back to the grid.

By aggregating thousands of these batteries nationwide, Base Power creates a distributed energy network that can stabilise local grids, reduce peak demand, and prevent blackouts during extreme weather events.

The company recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) programme, which allows distributed batteries to sell electricity directly into the grid. This not only enhances grid reliability but also gives homeowners new revenue streams, creating an economic incentive to adopt clean energy technologies.

“The ADER qualification represents a breakthrough moment,” Dell added. “It’s proof that distributed energy can serve both households and the grid efficiently, sustainably, and profitably.”

How Base Power’s Funding Redefines Energy Distribution

Base Power’s $1 billion Series C comes amid a global push to decentralise energy production and build resilient grid systems capable of handling renewable integration. The company’s battery infrastructure effectively turns homes into micro power plants, creating a two-way energy flow between consumers and utilities.

This distributed model addresses a persistent challenge in the American energy system — the strain on ageing infrastructure. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, outages caused by grid instability have risen over the past decade due to increasing demand and severe weather events. Base Power’s technology offers a scalable path to reduce grid congestion and carbon emissions while empowering homeowners to control their own energy future.

By combining cutting-edge hardware with AI-driven energy management software, Base Power aims to optimise how electricity is stored, distributed, and consumed. This integrated approach represents a shift from centralised power generation to networked energy ecosystems, where communities collectively contribute to energy security.

Base Power’s Vision for a Reindustrialised and Renewable America

Beyond product innovation, Base Power’s strategy emphasises domestic manufacturing and workforce development. The company’s leadership views the construction of its Austin factory as part of a broader national effort to “reindustrialise America.” By revitalising high-tech production capacity within the country, it achieves its purpose.

Lopas explained that the company is not just producing batteries. It is building the infrastructure, systems, tools, and software needed to reinvent the U.S. energy grid from the ground up.

This holistic approach mirrors a growing consensus among policymakers and investors. One where renewable energy transformation requires physical deployment at scale, not just software innovation.

As Base Power expands production, it plans to collaborate with local governments, energy regulators, and technology partners. It seeks to ensure its distributed energy systems integrate seamlessly with regional utilities.

If successful, Base Power could become a cornerstone of America’s clean energy transition. This feat will demonstrate how venture-backed manufacturing and distributed storage can deliver tangible progress.

A New Era for Energy and Infrastructure

Base Power’s $1 billion funding round is not only a milestone for the company but also a sign of renewed confidence in hard-tech innovation and energy infrastructure startups. With leading venture firms betting on its mission, Base Power is positioned to shape the future of how electricity is produced, stored, and shared across the country.

The company’s upcoming Austin factory, growing team, and expanding grid partnerships all underscore its commitment to building a more resilient, decentralised, and sustainable power system for generations to come.",https://ventureburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Create-a-futuristic-neon-lit-poster-for-an-artic…-20.png,N,,2025-10-09 18:04:06.764602

In a stunning policy reversal, the Conservative Party announced that, if elected, it will repeal net-zero climate policies—like the Climate Change Act 2008—to help lower energy bills. Shadow Energy Minister Claire Coutinho echoed her party’s embrace of energy abundance, promising it’ll lower bills by 20%. She added, “We will put cheap, reliable, abundant energy first. And we will do that unashamedly.”

Former Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the chorus and now appears to regret going “far too fast” on net-zero—a policy he previously supported. Even former Labour PM Tony Blair conceded net-zero is “doomed to fail,” writing on his organization’s website back in spring:

Despite the past 15 years seeing an explosion in renewable energy and despite electric vehicles becoming the fastest-growing sector of the vehicle market, with China leading the way in both, production of fossil fuels and demand for them has risen, not fallen, and is set to rise further up to 2030.

Despite the current Labour Net-Zero Secretary, Ed Miliband, suggesting energy bills will decrease by £300 ($401 U.S. dollars) by 2030, energy bills have significantly spiked in the United Kingdom. In fact, residents of Great Britain pay the highest electricity prices of any developed country today. Residents blame Miliband’s net-zero agenda–especially green levies on subsidies for carbon capture technology and wind farms—for their nation’s current energy crisis.

Between 2019 and 2024, industrial UK electricity prices soared by 124%—four times greater than the U.S., which had a 21% increase, across the same period. The Telegraph also noted, “Britain is also the second-most expensive country in the world for household electricity, with billpayers paying twice as much as those in the U.S.”

It was also reported that household U.K. energy bills will increase by £100 ($134.02 U.S.) by April 2026. As of October 2025, the average British household pays £1,754 ($2,341.04 U.S.) annually—or £146 ($195.68 U.S.) monthly—for electricity and gas.

There is no transition to 100% renewables occurring in any developed nation—including Great Britain.

Various tools measuring Great Britain’s energy mix show fossil fuels still dominating. One chart shows at least 50% combined from natural gas, coal, and oil, while another shows natural gas being the top electricity-generating source at 40%.

As we’ve learned in the U.S., net-zero isn’t an economically or environmentally sustainable policy. It’ll cost $215 trillion to globally transition to a 100% renewables economy by 2400 at the earliest. And at what cost? Only to lower global emissions by 0.2 °C–not 1.5 °C—by 2100.

It’s encouraging to see our allies adopting an energy abundance posture.

Discussions covered energy governance, circular economy development, and the move away from coal, while SEI also welcomed new partners to the project.

SEI’s Executive Director, Måns Nilsson, joined a panel on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (BiH) power sector, drawing on Sweden’s experience with carbon taxation. He explained that Sweden’s carbon tax in the 1990s was not a standalone climate measure, but part of a broader tax reform.

“The key was to design something simple and easy to implement, with exemptions that could be gradually phased out. Far from being a burden, this approach actually helped industry adapt – rapidly reducing fossil fuel use and accelerating the shift toward renewables,” Nilsson said.

SEI insights on recycling and just transition

SEI contributed lessons from research and practice to discussions on recycling and just transition. SEI Senior Expert Tomas Thernström spoke on waste management and circular economy, stressing that recycling must be simple if it is to succeed – though achieving simplicity often requires significant investment.

“Successful recycling cannot rest on the shoulders of a single actor: municipalities, state institutions, producer responsibility organizations, utility companies and property owners need to work together, as they all share responsibility in making recycling accessible and appealing,” Thernström underscored.

At a separate panel on achieving a just transition in coal regions, SEI Team Leader and BiH SuTra Project Manager Saša Solujić highlighted a broader perspective that goes beyond mine closures and decarbonization to include water management, agriculture, nature protection and biodiversity. Agriculture, in particular, emerged as a dynamic area, opening new opportunities and bringing people together.

Solujić stressed the importance of open dialogue with local communities to ensure people can express their concerns, hopes and ideas.

“If we include all relevant actors – especially young people – while keeping long-term community needs in focus, [this] fosters stronger support and deeper understanding of transition as an inclusive, collective process,” she noted.

Both panels demonstrated that cross-sectoral cooperation, local engagement, knowledge exchange and international support are vital for a fair and sustainable transition.

As more local partners are joining the BiH SuTra project, change is increasingly happening with the communities, not just to them. Many mayors and local representatives shared how BiH SuTra helped open their eyes to new opportunities, foster collaboration and demonstrate that “going green” does not mean losing jobs or lowering living standards.

“Breza is a mining community and closing the mine has been resented among the people, until BiH SuTra came and started the transition process. Thanks to the engagement with citizens, they now understand better that transition and sustainability mean a better future at all levels of the local life, and not necessarily that standards of life would be reduced and jobs lost. Only this is a key result,” said Vedad Jusić, Mayor of Breza Municipality.

“If there is any community interested in this type of project it is Kakanj, being one of the most polluted communities in BiH. We are in favour of the overall approach and very interested in finding new ways and new solutions, and we look forward to have our partners support us,” commented Mirnes Bajtarević, Mayor of Kakanj Municipality, one of three local self-government units to sign a memorandum of understanding with SEI at the event, along with Gacko Municipality and the City of Gradiška.

“Iowa has worn the crown,” Shaw says. “We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years. Last week, we got knocked off.""

Iowa biofuels and corn experts are congratulating Nebraska for its first shipments of carbon dioxide on the Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline, but say the development means Iowa is no longer king at turning corn into ethanol.

Monte Shaw, the executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and an advocate of CO2 pipelines, said now that Nebraska has a functioning one, ethanol plants in that state can take advantage of lucrative tax credits from the federal government and sell into the ultra-low carbon ethanol market.

“Iowa has worn the crown,” Shaw said at a news conference Wednesday, Oct. 8. “We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years. Last week, we got knocked off.”

Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline, which is slated to stretch several hundred miles and transport CO2 from ethanol plants in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming to an underground storage site in Wyoming, had its first CO2 shipment Oct. 3.

Ames-based Summit Carbon Solutions plans a similar pipeline for Iowa and surrounding states, but it has encountered significant opposition, including a continued push in Iowa to outlaw use of eminent domain to obtain land-use rights from reluctant property owners,

The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead carry liquified carbon dioxide to the Wyoming sequestration site.

By sequestering the carbon dioxide created in the process of turning corn into ethanol, the plants are able to lower the effective greenhouse gas emissions of the fuel below a certain level, set by the U.S. Department of Energy, that makes the fuel eligible for a per-gallon tax credit.

These credits, known as 45z, were initiated under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. While the IRA was mostly dismantled by the Trump administration, 45z credits were extended under the Republican-led One Big Beautiful Bill tax-cut law.

Shaw said the credits can add about 66 cents per gallon for producers of ethanol, which is a lot for an industry that “usually tries to make a penny or two.”

CO2 pipelines key to strong Iowa economy, renewable fuels director says

According to the IRFA, Iowa produces about 4.7 billion gallons of ethanol annually. Shaw said if each of those gallons could take advantage of the credits and add 66 cents per gallon, it would equate to more than $3 billion in added value to the industry annually.

“If Iowa wants to maintain low taxes, if we want to do further property tax reform and things of that nature, then the state needs a strong ag economy,” Shaw said. “Ethanol producers need access to the tools in this state to remain competitive with the plants around us that are moving forward.”

Steve Kuiper, vice president of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the boost to Iowa ethanol would directly impact corn farmers by increasing demand and potential price for corn, but would also “trickle down” to the state’s economy.

Farmers have faced several years in a row of high interest rates, high input costs, and low market prices for their crops. Trade wars between the U.S. and the countries where it sells ag commodities and purchases inputs also have added stress to farmers. According to a September survey from the National Corn Growers Association, nearly 50% of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis.

“The Iowa agriculture economy is in tough shape,” Kuiper said. “Farmers are farming at a loss. Lenders are very, very anxious right now.”

Dave Miller, the chief economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said that as corn yields continue to grow, farmers need a market that accounts for an extra 150 million bushels a year through 2050.

Miller said the low-carbon ethanol market facilitated by carbon sequestration could create the potential for an additional 12 million gallons of ethanol, which he said could be fulfilled by the current farming yield increases.

“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said. “So there’s a real competitive advantage that’s going to open up for Nebraska farmers compared to Iowa farmers.”

Seth Harder, CEO of two ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa, said he has seen the things in the industry that Iowa does “really great” but he also sees that the states he operates in are on the edge of a “paradigm shift.”

“As Nebraska sees this influx of funds, we hear plants are talking about not only expanding, but doubling,” Harder said.

He said the demand for ethanol appears to be on the rise with the recent decision from California allowing the sale of a higher blend of ethanol fuel, E-15, and the prospect of more states joining in on the trend.

Will the center of ethanol production shift to Nebraska?

Shaw said he believes Iowa is on the cusp of a “fairly substantial farm crisis.”

“Nothing will solve this problem until we grow demand or reduce production, and reducing production would be devastating to the economy of Iowa in the Midwest,” he said.

Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. Debate on the topic caused splits among GOP lawmakers during the legislative session and has continued to be a divisive issue in the party.

The Trailblazer pipeline had fewer roadblocks than those that have popped up in Iowa. This is in part because Nebraska does not require state approval for CO2 pipelines, and because much of the pipeline was already built as the natural gas line.

Landowners and environmental groups, including the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, that are opposed to CO2 sequestration pipelines call the Summit project a “boondoggle.” Opponents worry about property values and the safety of carbon sequestration pipelines. They also have said sequestering carbon should not qualify as a public use, which a project must have in order to use eminent domain.

Shaw said it doesn’t matter what someone thinks about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and why it should or shouldn’t be sequestered, because for renewable fuel members, this is a “business decision.”

The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is the most well-known carbon sequestration project in Iowa, but Shaw said there are other companies and facilities looking for places in Iowa to sequester carbon, or to otherwise build carbon sequestration pipelines.

On the nearest horizon, Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE, located near Council Bluffs, is slated to connect to the Trailblazer pipeline and potentially begin sequestering carbon at the plant in late 2026.

The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline cannot begin construction in Iowa until it secures permits for storage in North Dakota and for passage through South Dakota, which has become challenging due to the enactment of a restrictive vlaw in South Dakota.

The company filed to change its permit with the Iowa Utilities Commission to remove the Dakota-specific language, in the event it is able to secure a “​​better solution” for storage and passage.

Shaw said the “economic consequences” of the development in Nebraska could be a “bump in the road” for Iowa if the state adapts and brings its own carbon sequestration practices online, or it could lead to “production and demand flow from places like Iowa to places like Nebraska.”

“We’re asking the Iowa Legislature to support President Trump’s energy leadership and to help avert what I personally feel is a pending farm crisis, and to help put Iowa’s economy back on stable ground,” Shaw said.","https://www.desmoinesregister.com/gcdn/presto/2021/03/31/PDEM/4d1b40d5-12b0-4bdc-b142-87fabd7896e5-0331-Renewable-Fuel-008.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y0&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-09 17:03:07.076704

I never wanted to study climate change. For 15 years I studied the effects of different kinds of pollution, from pesticides to personal care products to industrial fertilizers. I documented quantitative evidence that man-made pollutants could do bad things to sea life, and by proxy ourselves. My early work was also in a lab, far away from the realities and complexities of our natural environment. Nowhere in these studies was there a consideration for climate change.

It wasn’t until I started working on coral reefs in 2005 that I began to see, at an objectively scientific level, that climate change was always the primary driving force behind patterns in our data, even if we didn’t mean to study it. Without intention, then, my research, and the research of hundreds of other scientists, has found that the real issue is globally increasing temperatures driven by a less tangible pollutant. In truth, “climate change” is just a poorly marketed term for pollution of another variety — the carbon kind.

For two decades now, my devoted team and I have conducted short-term (hours to days) and long-term (months to years) experiments on the effects of pollution on the reefs of Hawaii, Florida, Australia and the South Pacific. Some of these experiments have run more than seven years.

We found that in many cases, pollution like fertilizer runoff can cause disease and death of corals, the animals that build the foundation of tropical reefs. And yet every result we have collected, in every one of these well intentioned and carefully designed experiments, was waylaid by the increasingly frequent and severe heat waves that have arisen in the last decades. Either the effects of our pollution treatments were overwhelmed by high water temperatures driven by climate change or worse, climate change killed our whole experiment.

There have been 11 recorded major coral bleaching events associated with marine heatwaves, or periods of time where sea surface temperatures are dramatically elevated compared to their typical seasonal means. Bleaching, when corals lose their primary symbionts and their critically provided food, can be followed by mass mortality events, or these heatwaves can cause direct immediate death where corals are literally cooked onsite due to dramatically high water temperatures outside coral’s normal tolerance.

I used to work on Florida Keys reefs, but our research there has been stalled indefinitely because there simply aren’t enough animals to work with since three back-to-back heatwaves that caused mass die off events, killing thousands of the already depleted wild corals and about 80 percent of the corals being raised for restoration.

Out of necessity, most of my research moved from Florida to the French South Pacific. But even there — almost 4,000 miles from the nearest continental coast — we can’t escape the heat. We have recorded four heat waves in the last 10 years that together have transformed these normally bountiful reefs from habitats where there was once 60 percent of the seafloor covered with healthy corals to barren plains with less than 1 percent live coral.

These numbers aren’t fictional “con jobs” — they are scientific facts you can see with your own eyes. These reefs are graveyards devoid of most life except algae. The situation is so dire that the French and local government has placed a ban on coral collections in these areas, even for restoration or scientific purposes.

It’s hard to do experiments on pollution when each reef you investigate is completely dead.

Sewage and other forms of pollution such as plastic waste are optically clear issues, visually and sometimes viscerally tangible. Images of clogged and slimy green waterways are easy for the public to connect with because they personally experience it themselves. But carbon pollution from carbon dioxide and methane emissions are invisible, abstract and notoriously controversial.

I am not drinking some liberal pro-environment ivory tower Kool-aid about climate change. Rather, my own experiments, which were never focused on climate change, told me repeatedly that the Earth’s biggest pollution problem is increased temperatures.

There is a concerted effort by the Trump administration to curtail, censor and even eliminate funding for climate change and environmental science research. Scientists need to remain steadfast and continue to conduct objective experiments, collect long-term data on climate effects and how they interact with other local factors, and write manuscripts that describe their results no matter if they disagree with this aministration’s false doctrine.

Scientists don’t necessarily want to be political. But when the facts we collect and repeatedly confirm are disregarded as a “con,” we have to set the facts straight.

CASTLE ROCK, CO, UNITED STATES, October 8, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Solar Side Up, a leading provider of solar energy solutions, is encouraging Castle Rock homeowners to consider installing solar systems before the federal solar tax credit expires at the end of 2025. The Residential Clean Energy Credit currently offers a 30% tax credit on the total cost of solar installations, but residential projects will no longer be eligible for this incentive starting January 1, 2026. This makes 2025 the final opportunity for homeowners to secure significant federal savings.

Colorado also provides a sales tax exemption on solar equipment, lowering the upfront investment, as well as a property tax exemption so that adding solar panels does not increase a home’s assessed value. Additionally, net metering programs enable homeowners to receive credit for excess electricity generated by their system, potentially reducing monthly energy bills.

The average cost of a 5 kW solar installation in Castle Rock is approximately $12,460 after applying the federal tax credit. This size system can save homeowners around $16,605 over 20 years, with an estimated payback period of about nine years. Installing solar in 2025 ensures that homeowners can capture all available incentives while reducing long-term energy costs and increasing property value. Solar Side Up works with residents to navigate the installation process, maximize available savings, and transition to clean, renewable energy with confidence.

Rising electricity rates in Colorado have made solar energy an increasingly attractive option for homeowners seeking to control energy costs. By producing their own electricity, residents can reduce reliance on traditional utilities and protect themselves against future rate increases. Solar energy also contributes to environmental sustainability, reducing carbon emissions and supporting the state’s renewable energy goals.

In addition to financial and environmental benefits, solar installations in Castle Rock can enhance property appeal. Homes equipped with solar systems are often more attractive to prospective buyers, adding to resale value and marketability. With a growing number of environmentally conscious homebuyers, solar energy is becoming a sought-after feature in Castle Rock and surrounding communities.

Acting before the end of 2025 allows homeowners to fully take advantage of current federal and state incentives while positioning themselves for long-term energy savings. Solar Side Up provides a full range of services, from system design and permitting to installation and ongoing support, helping residents transition to solar efficiently and with confidence.

This expansion further strengthens the transportation infrastructure and takeaway capacity out of the Uinta Basin and unlocks greater market access for FourPoint to meet the growing demand for this high-quality American crude.

The terminal expansion will feature a newly constructed continuous loop track to streamline rail logistics and a railcar load rack capable of loading 140,000 barrels of oil per day. Terminal enhancements will also include nine new rail loading arms, four additional truck offload lanes, and upgraded pump capacity to accelerate and improve truck offloading operations. The project will also add a new heated storage tank with approximately 140,000 barrels of shell capacity and two additional 6,000-foot storage unit tracks, significantly improving storage capacity at the terminal. ""With the expansion expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2026, subject to receipt of necessary third party and government approvals, FourPoint will secure capacity totaling 50,000 barrels of oil per day at the Price River Terminal,"" said Tripp Kerr, Vice President of Marketing at FourPoint. ""Energy Transfer is an exceptional midstream company and their commitment to this project and reliable flow assurance will be critical to our growth strategy in the basin.""

This expansion comes alongside the official launch and rebranding of the crude previously known as Uinta Wax or Yellow Wax. Going forward, FourPoint will market the crude as American Premium Uinta (APU) — a name that reflects the quality of this unique resource with one of the highest paraffinic contents among crude oil produced in the United States. APU is a premium, light grade, paraffinic crude oil with low impurities like sulfur and metals, making it a cleaner, more efficient feedstock for refiners. Its unique refining characteristics allow it to be processed more cost-effectively than many other crudes, while also producing high-grade base oil products for lubricants. ""We're focused on developing a robust and consistent production base in the Uinta Basin coupled with supporting logistics that enable us to move significant, reliable volumes of American Premium Uinta to both traditional markets in Salt Lake City and new markets beyond the basin,"" said George Solich, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of FourPoint. ""As volatility continues to disrupt foreign crude imports, APU offers American refineries a premium, domestic alternative. This terminal expansion strengthens our ability to deliver that product consistently and at scale – supporting energy independence and fueling the production of American-made goods with American crude.""

As the energy landscape continues to shift, the Uinta Basin has emerged as one of the few regions in the Lower 48 positioned for meaningful production growth. Unlike other major U.S. basins facing declining output, the Uinta Basin is a uniquely resource-rich region with a long runway of remaining tier-one drilling locations. Eric Eichler, Chief Operating Officer of FourPoint said, ""The Uinta Basin offers exceptional development potential, with strong well performance, multiple stacked horizontal targets, and competitive well costs – characteristics comparable to what we see in the Permian. With a deep, high-quality inventory base and expansion into new markets, the Uinta is primed for meaningful production growth."" The basin also holds significant potential for natural gas development, further enhancing its role as a strategic contributor to America's energy future.

This agreement between FourPoint and Energy Transfer represents a major strategic step forward in building the infrastructure needed to meet the increasing demand and emerging market opportunities for American Premium Uinta. By expanding terminal capacity and optimizing logistics across the supply chain, both companies are better positioned to serve refiners across the country and support the next phase of growth in the Uinta Basin.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association, spearheading a multi-state clean hydrogen economy, abruptly lost $1 billion in federal support after the White House announced sweeping energy project cuts. Elected officials in Washington and Oregon warned that this loss would freeze job creation and hobble regional clean energy ambitions, directly undermining thousands of SMART union jobs. More about this at GeekWire and Washington State Standard.

California’s ARCHES: A $1.2 Billion Blow

California’s ARCHES — a hydrogen production and distribution network — had its entire $1.2 billion federal grant rescinded. Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Alex Padilla condemned the decision, warning that it jeopardizes more than 220,000 projected clean energy jobs across the state. Read the full analysis at California Energy Transition and the official statement at Padilla Press Release. For sheet metal contractors, these hubs represented a pipeline of high-value, long-term work — now vanished overnight.

Union Reaction: “Dysfunction in Washington”

SMART General President Michael Coleman issued a stark warning in response to the cuts: “This week, Washington politicians chose political games over working people, cancelling good, high-paying American jobs. ... These cancellations undermine America’s energy and national security. Working people should not pay the price for dysfunction in Washington. Our industries and our nation cannot operate under this kind of chaos.”

Coleman’s words echo frustrations from the first wave of cancellations earlier this year, when sheet metal jobs tied to steel, semiconductor, and data center projects evaporated almost overnight. In the original Megaproject Meltdown story, we chronicled the effect of policy volatility on local unions, contractors, and the broader HVAC supply chain. This latest reversal only deepens the uncertainty — especially for workers who were counting on hydrogen infrastructure as a next-generation growth engine.

A Broader Pattern: Megaprojects in Retreat

These are not isolated incidents. Of the seven hydrogen hubs originally selected for federal funding, at least five now face full termination, with over $20 billion in clean energy awards on the chopping block across the country. See more at Hydrogen Insight. In total, more than 138,000 construction jobs — many under project labor agreements — were at stake with these hydrogen hubs alone. State and union leaders are calling for immediate congressional action to restore funding and stabilize policy, before more capacity is shuttered and workforce investments are lost.

States have responded with their own policy moves to protect advanced manufacturing jobs and clean energy investment, as covered in States Race to Protect EV Manufacturing as Political Winds Shift.

What’s Next for the Sheet Metal Industry?

For SMART members and contractors, the message is clear: volatile federal policy is now the number one threat to future megaproject work. Where once the American boom in clean tech and advanced manufacturing drove record demand for sheet metal, HVAC, and ductwork, the new reality is one of delays, layoffs, and uncertainty. The industry is again urging Congress and the administration to restore key tax credits and federal support for the projects that underpin America’s industrial future.

As the dust settles on this latest round of cancellations, one thing is certain: the fate of American megaprojects — and the union jobs they support — will hinge on what happens in Washington in the months ahead.",https://www.achrnews.com/ext/resources/2025/04-April/SMART-Rally-2-4-10-25.jpg?height=635&t=1760031464&width=1200,N,,2025-10-09 15:03:30.340507

President Donald Trump has vowed to revive coal leasing on federal lands so coal can fuel more of the nation's soaring electricity demand tied to artificial intelligence.","(Reuters) -The Trump administration has postponed a scheduled sale of coal leases on federal lands in Wyoming two days after a disappointing auction in Montana, an Interior Department spokesperson said on Wednesday.

The Bureau of Land Management, a division of Interior that manages 245 million acres of federal lands, had been expected to keep processing permits and leases for oil, gas and coal operations during the government shutdown, according to contingency plans published last week.

A sale of 3,508 acres of federal coal reserves in Wyoming's Campbell and Converse counties had been scheduled for Wednesday morning. The lease area contains 365 million tons of recoverable coal. Interior said it would post a new date for the sale but did not give a reason for the postponement.

BLM held a lease sale for 1,262 acres in Big Horn County, Montana on Monday that attracted one bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Company, which operates the nearby Spring Creek Mine.

The bid of $186,000 for a lease with an estimated 167.5 million tons of recoverable coal equates to less than a penny per ton. The Interior Department blamed the administrations of former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, both Democrats, for the weak industry interest.

""While we would have liked to see stronger participation, this sale reflects the lingering impact from Obama and Biden’s decades long war on coal which aggressively sought to end all domestic coal production and erode confidence in the U.S. coal industry,"" the Interior Department said in a statement.

""Fortunately, President Trump and his Administration are rebuilding trust between industry and government as part of our broader effort to restore American Energy Dominance.""

Obama and Biden had toughened environmental regulations on coal to reduce pollution and climate impact, and encourage a transition to renewable energy sources.

BLM has not yet accepted the NTEC bid because under the leasing process it first must determine whether it represents fair market value.

NTEC had argued in sale documents that the fair market value of the coal should be close to the minimum bid of $100 per acre required by law. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

President Donald Trump has vowed to revive coal leasing on federal lands so coal can fuel more of the nation's soaring electricity demand tied to artificial intelligence.

Base Power said this week it has raised $1 billion in funding at a roughly $3 billion valuation. The series C round was led by a who's who of venture capital such as Joshua Kushner's Thrive Capital. Let's more uh let's dive more into this business with Base Power co-founder and CEO Zachary Dell. Uh Zachary, good to see you here. Uh congrats on your news this week. Very interesting business. For those not familiar with it, take us through what it is and and what you're hoping to achieve.

Yeah, thanks for having me on Brian. So Base is an energy technology company working to bring affordable and reliable power to America. So, if you've lived basically anywhere in the country over the last decade, your power has gotten more expensive and less reliable and we started the company to change that. So we install batteries on single family homes. When the grid's up and running, we use that battery to support the grid. When the grid goes down, the homeowner gets that battery to back up their home. and we're able to save our our customers on the order of 10 to 20% a month on their electricity bill. So our mission is to make your bill go down and your lights stay on.

That is a good mission. Uh for sure. all of our electric bills have gone through the roof. Where did you where did you get inspired to come up with a business like this?

Well, I was fortunate to spend a couple years in the investment world studying the energy infrastructure space and seeing all the progress being made in the battery space in particular. And really saw an opportunity to drive down the cost of electricity for consumers by developing battery storage technology, particularly in a way that's enabled by software to manage supply and demand and load on the grid and really drive down price. And, you know, we've gotten off to a great start over the last two years, but there's a lot of work to do to make our grid here in America more affordable and more reliable. So we're on off to the races and and working to really rebuild the future of American power.

What what type of pressures uh are we are you seeing on the grid because of this AI infrastructure roll out that look, I'm talking about every single day. Every day there's a new development. Open AI signing a new partnership for power. Uh it's it's just advancing at a at a really really fast pace.

Yeah, Brian, we're in an era of unprecedented electricity demand. We've really never seen demand growth like this in the category. And it's really a a supply demand problem. We have a ton of demand coming and we don't have enough supply. So we need better technology to bring more supply onto the system so that we can absorb all this new demand that's coming. And, you know, the electricity cost function plays a role in every new technology. As the cost of electricity goes down, we're able to build more, do more, innovate more. And so that's really the role that we're playing is bringing more supply online so we can continue to absorb that that increased demand and keep prices low.

Are you worried that like the grid just may frazzle out. I mean I can't think of a better word for it because of all the stress we're putting on it because of AI.

The grid is certainly under stress and we're we're here to help resolve some of that stress. And, you know, we need more technology, more capacity, more flexible capacity in the form of battery storage to make sure things like that don't happen.

So, how many folks or or households are using base power?

We've got thousands of members across Texas on the order of 5,000 and and and growing every day. We're doing, you know, roughly 30 40 of these installs a day. That's up from 20 installs a day, you know, only a couple months ago. So we've doubled the business in a short amount of time. and we plan to keep growing at a really fast clip. I I think, you know, it's been covered widely uh the the launch and the announcement of our first factory uh down in Austin. So we're going to be bringing supply uh to Texas and manufacturing these systems ourselves is is going to allow us to install much much more batteries, many more systems across the state of Texas and then we'll be announcing our expansion across the country soon entering some new states and bringing affordable reliable reliable power, hopefully to every household in America soon enough.",https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/4fa92d80-a51c-11f0-bbce-1e79f8cb997b,N,,2025-10-09 16:03:26.090969

— Office of Oregon Governor Tina Kotek","SALEM, Ore. — Governor Tina Kotek signed Executive Order 25-25 to accelerate the pace of renewable wind and solar project development in the state of Oregon before the clock runs out on critical federal clean energy tax credits.

The Order directs relevant state agencies, boards, and commissions to take all steps necessary and authorized by existing statutes to accelerate and prioritize siting and permitting reviews, approvals, and processes necessary to expedite the permitting and development of solar and wind energy projects in Oregon that seek to qualify for federal clean energy tax credits requiring construction to commence by July 4, 2026.

“With the elimination of promised incentives by the Trump Administration, states must step up as the last line of defense against climate catastrophe. We have to get renewable energy infrastructure built, and quickly,” Governor Kotek said. “We cannot afford to lose this critical window; every wind and solar project we help complete now directly fights the irreversible climate damage we’re racing to prevent.”

Many renewable energy developers face a critical July 4, 2026 deadline to begin construction on commercial projects to qualify for the Investment Tax Credit (ICT) and the Production Tax Credit (PTC), with recent guidance narrowing qualification requirements and requiring project completion within four years to capture the full federal incentive. Projects that fail to meet the July 4 construction deadline must enter into service by December 31, 2027 to qualify for federal tax credits.

“Oregonians are already feeling the strain of rising energy costs and worsening climate impacts, yet Congress and the Trump administration have launched an all-out assault on affordable clean energy and our safe climate future,” Nora Apter, Oregon Director for Climate Solution said. “By moving swiftly to get as many wind and solar projects across the finish line as possible before the loss of federal tax credits, Governor Kotek is defending Oregon families, family-wage jobs, and energy resilience against these senseless attacks. Today’s action will help ensure that renewable energy projects can capture critical federal incentives before they disappear – keeping Oregon competitive and able to power our state’s growing energy demands with clean, affordable electricity.”

This was discussed previously between the commissioners and County Planner Rob Quint and at the time Quint said he felt the current 14-day period is too short.

The county commissioners, during a business meeting on Tuesday, discussed the idea of putting a moratorium in place until they get revised regulations in place and new regulations adopted and the fees revised. Logan County's Planning and Zoning Commission is already working on regulations for battery storage and while wind turbine and solar regulations were last adopted by the county in 2023, Commissioner Jim Santomaso suggested there are some changes that could be made to them and also asked that the county come up with regulations for data centers.

One of the things that would change in the wind and solar regulations is the amount of time between when the notice of the permit application is given to neighboring landowners and when the hearing date is set. This was discussed previously between the commissioners and County Planner Rob Quint and at the time Quint said he felt the current 14-day period is too short. At that same time, there was a discussion about increasing Logan County's permit fees to be more in line with neighboring counties and to cover the cost of having an outside third-party review the permits. There was also discussion about increasing fees for larger projects.

At Tuesday's meeting, Quint said wind and solar regulations and battery storage regulations should be completed quickly, but regulations for data centers may take more time because he hasn't found any Colorado regulations that address that. He plans to reach out to see if Laramie County has any regulations, as Cheyenne, Wyo., will be the site of one of the largest data center hubs in the future.

All regulations will go through the Planning and Zoning Commission, which will make recommendations to the Board of County Commissioners. The commissioners will then hold a public hearing before adopting the regulations. Planning and Zoning will also give input on fees.

Commissioner Mike Brownell asked Quint if he thought a three-month moratorium would be too long.

""I don't want to foul up a good chance of some economic development, but I also don't want to go into it not feeling like we've covered all our bases,"" he said.

Quint didn't think that would be too long; however, County Attorney Alan Samber suggested making it six months and if it takes less time than that to complete the regulations and fee revisions, the moratorium can be lifted sooner.

The commissioners directed Samber to put together a resolution declaring a moratorium to be approved at their next business meeting on Oct. 21.

During a work session, the commissioners heard from Andrew Frtizler, chairman of Sterling Urban Renewal Authority, and Trae Miller, executive director of the Logan County Economic Development Corporation and SURA board member, about SURA's plans for a new West Main Street Urban Renewal Area. The two also spoke at an RE-1 Valley School Board meeting on Monday and will be going to the Sterling City Council, Lower South Platte Water Conservancy District and Northern Water Conservancy District.

The primary mission of SURA is to encourage development in downtown blighted areas. They are able to do this by getting tax dollars incrementally and reinvesting them in their various districts.

Right now, there are three existing plan areas within the SURA district — Gateway, which includes Walgreens, Bank of Colorado and Family Food Market, Downtown, and the Excel, which is the area where Sterling Ethanol and Trinidad Benham are located, and all of their Tax Increment Financing (TIF) expires in the next five years.

""The Downtown is where we've been able to do a lot of work with some of the small property owners, small businesses and things and help get those improvements done in those buildings, which is extremely costly in those old structures, old infrastructures,"" Miller said.

They have also helped with sidewalk work.

Now, SURA is planning to add a new area, the West Main Street Urban Renewal Area, which stretches all the way down W. Main Street and a block north and south. Walmart is not included in the designated area, but the Pioneer Park softball fields are, due to conversations that have happened in the past about potential needs at that site.

""This one is so important for our ability to attract more retail development,"" Miller said.

Under state law, SURA must negotiate an intergovernmental agreement with the county, city, school district and water districts concerning the sharing of incremental property tax revenue and the impacts of the plan on those entities' services. The IGAs must be completed by Dec. 29.

In other business, Marilee Johnson, a member of Logan County's America 250 — Colorado 150 committee, brought a suggestion from the committee to paint a mural on part of the west side of the grandstands at the Logan County Fairgrounds to commemorate the occasion. The commissioners liked the idea but said they want to have final approval of the artwork.

Additionally, the commissioners approved an application for a subdivision exemption on behalf of Donald W. and Mary Jane Fritzler to create a 2.85-acre parcel from a 160-acre parcel in an Environmental Protection (EP) Zone district for use as a residence; an application for a subdivision exemption on behalf of John P. and Carol L. Lambrecht to create a 22.53-acre parcel from an 81-acre parcel in an Agriculture (A) Zone district for use as a residence; and a subdivision exemption on behalf of Kerry Michael Welch to create a 7.313-acre parcel from a 70.663-acre parcel in an Environmental Protection (EP) zone district for use as a residence. They also approved an agreement between Logan County and Pivot Energy Development, LLC, and issued a right of way permit for the use of the county right of way along Iris Drive for driveway access.

Buildings are one of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions in New York State.","Manufacturers and Vendors Can Now Apply to Qualify and Demonstrate Packaged Window Heat Pumps in Multifamily Buildings Across the State

Governor Kathy Hochul today announced $10 million is now available to increase the adoption of advanced clean heating and cooling solutions in New York through the new statewide Clean Heat for All: Window Heat Pump Demonstration program. Starting today, manufacturers and vendors can now apply to qualify and demonstrate the performance of packaged window heat pumps (PWHPs) in multifamily buildings across the state, which aim to increase consumer confidence in this emerging heat pump technology. This new statewide program builds on the success and lessons learned from the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) Clean Heat for All Pilot and will make it more affordable for the industry to advance these cost-effective, plug-and-play retrofit solutions, which can improve comfort and temperature control for New York households without the need for extensive building infrastructure upgrades.

“Making clean energy more affordable is key to ensuring every New Yorker can benefit from our transition to a greener future,” Governor Hochul said. “Clean Heat for All demonstrates how strong partnerships and proven solutions can accelerate that transition, helping families save energy costs, improving comfort in their homes and reducing harmful emissions across the state.”

The statewide Window Heat Pump Demonstration program , administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), offers incentives to qualified manufacturers and vendors to install PWHPs for demonstration and performance monitoring in select multifamily buildings with more than five units.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “The success of the Clean Heat for All program brought ground-breaking technology into the homes of New Yorkers to experience the benefits of clean, efficient heating and cooling. Through these demonstration projects, more residents and building owners will be able to experience greater comfort, control, and air quality from heat pump technology and feel confident in the switch to these low emission solutions.”

The open enrollment opportunity consists of two concurrent phases. Starting today, under Phase One, manufacturers and vendors of PWHPs that meet a rigorous set of technical and performance criteria can now apply to qualify their clean heating and cooling products through the program. Once qualified under Phase One, they will be eligible to apply to Phase Two incentives to install and demonstrate their performance of their PWHPs in multifamily buildings. Selected projects in market rate demonstration sites will receive incentives covering 50 percent of costs up to $1,500 per PWHP. Incentives for low- and moderate-income demonstration sites will cover 75 percent of costs up to $2,250 per PWHP.

An application for Phase One can be submitted via email to PWHPdemonstration@nyserda.ny.gov. Once NYSERDA reviews and accepts Phase One applications, applicants will become qualified participants and NYSERDA will grant access to a dedicated SharePoint site for Phase Two applications. The deadline to qualify PWHPs is January 30, 2026. The deadline to apply for incentives is June 30, 2027. More information about Phase One of the program can be found here and Phase Two can be found here .

From the Phase Two demonstrations, NYSERDA will collect PWHP performance data in order to provide metrics and actionable insights to building owners, operators, tenants, and utilities, both in New York State and other jurisdictions with significant multifamily housing stock and cold climates. This data will be used to assess the viability of PWHPs as a cost-effective, durable space heating electrification retrofit solution.

The Window Heat Pump Demonstration program joins NYSERDA's Clean Heat for All portfolio, alongside the Clean Heat for All: Packaged Terminal Heat Pump program, to bring efficient heating and cooling solutions to buildings across New York State. It also builds on the success and positive results of the NYCHA Clean Heat for All Pilot, a partnership between the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), New York Power Authority (NYPA), and NYSERDA to develop and test a cold-climate window heat pump that can better serve the heating and cooling needs of existing multifamily buildings. This new demonstration program aims to enable installation and monitoring of more PWHPs and provide additional performance data, which will complement data gleaned from the previous NYCHA Pilot.

New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “Through the Power Authority’s strategic partnership with NYCHA and NYSERDA, the Clean Heat for All program led to the development of energy-efficient heat pumps that can be easily installed in multifamily buildings. The continued investment in this innovative technology will make it more affordable to implement, improving comfort and climate control for New York residents.”

New York State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, “Expanding access to clean, efficient heating and cooling is essential to improving the quality of life for residents across New York, including those who live in affordable multifamily developments. The $10 million Clean Heat for All Pilot program supports HCR’s mission to preserve and improve our existing housing stock, and ensure safe, sustainable, affordable homes for all New Yorkers. By embracing and funding innovative technologies like packaged window heat pumps, we’re helping to build a healthier, more resilient housing stock for the future.”

New York City Housing Authority Chief Executive Officer Lisa Bova-Hiatt said, “NYCHA is proud to have been the catalyst and proving ground for this innovative program. The success of the initial Clean Heat for All pilot, which was met with very positive feedback from NYCHA residents, demonstrates the viability of these window heat pumps as a key solution for providing reliable heating and cooling while improving energy efficiency. We are thrilled to be involved in driving a market transformation that will serve to benefit not only NYCHA residents, but New Yorkers statewide.”

Urban Green Council Chief Executive Officer John Mandyck said, “We applaud NYSERDA's new Window Heat Pump Demonstration program. It will expedite technologies that will fill important gaps in the industry and provide affordable electrification solutions for more New Yorkers.”

For more 50 years, NYSERDA has been a trusted and objective resource for New Yorkers, taking on the critical role of energy planning and policy analysis, along with making investments that drive New York toward a more sustainable future. Buildings are one of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions in New York State. Through NYSERDA and utility programs, more than $5.6 billion has been invested to decarbonize buildings and support high-efficiency all-electric heating and cooling technologies. Room heat pumps, such as PWHPs, are an important tool in the transition to a clean energy economy and have the potential to enable rapid, affordable electrification of space heating in multifamily buildings.

This initiative is funded by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

New York State's Climate Agenda

New York State's climate agenda calls for an affordable and just transition to a clean energy economy that creates family-sustaining jobs, promotes economic growth through green investments, and directs a minimum of 35 percent of the benefits to disadvantaged communities. New York is advancing a suite of efforts to achieve an emissions-free economy by 2050, including in the energy, buildings, transportation, and waste sectors.",https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Assets/Common/Images/favicons/nyserda/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-09 16:02:32.088076
,Clean Energy ,2025-10-09 18:03:07+00:00,www.nytimes.com,Opinion | The Trump Bump on Your Energy Bills - The New York Times,"The Editorial Board, www.nytimes.com, the-editorial-board",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/opinion/trump-energy-bills-prices.html,"You do not have to care about climate change to believe that clean energy is an important and strategic resource.
Rather than trying to put oil companies out of business, Mr. Trump is going after clean energy, and Americans will face higher bills as a result.
Mr. Trump ran for president promising to reduce the cost of living and of energy prices in particular.
Yet the Trump energy policies are not helping — and will soon make matters worse.
Energy prices are likely to rise the most in states that have not prioritized clean energy, including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma, experts say.","You do not have to care about climate change to believe that clean energy is an important and strategic resource. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal in many places and sometimes cheaper than oil and gas. Clean energy sources help both hold down costs for Americans and prevent the United States from having to import so much foreign oil from countries hostile to our interests.

These advantages help explain why the right energy policy for the United States is an all-of-the-above strategy. The country should continue using fossil fuels like natural gas while shifting toward cleaner energy that does less damage to the planet. The combination can help Americans struggling with slow-growing incomes while also addressing climate change.

President Trump, however, has rejected the all-of-the-above approach in his second term. He is instead waging a war on solar and wind power. It is a mirror image of the strategy that conservatives criticize the fringes of the environmental movement for favoring. Rather than trying to put oil companies out of business, Mr. Trump is going after clean energy, and Americans will face higher bills as a result.

Mr. Trump signed a law in July that repealed the clean energy tax credits enacted by former President Joe Biden, eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars of investment into wind, solar and electric vehicles. Mr. Trump has also directed his administration to enact new regulations on clean energy and start specious investigations into its use, including one looking into bird deaths caused by wind turbines. His administration is trying to cancel wind projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, Maryland and Rhode Island, which would provide enough electricity to power more than a million homes. “Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them,” Mr. Trump recently said. Even some oil executives have criticized these moves as shortsighted.

Mr. Trump ran for president promising to reduce the cost of living and of energy prices in particular. He has failed so far. Inflation remains near 3 percent a year even as economic growth and job growth have slowed. Electricity prices are almost 10 percent higher than they were a year earlier, according to the most recent numbers. The main reasons for the electricity price surge have little to do with Mr. Trump and instead involve demand from A.I. data centers and supply constraints from the war in Ukraine. Yet the Trump energy policies are not helping — and will soon make matters worse.

Energy prices are likely to rise the most in states that have not prioritized clean energy, including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma, experts say. The repeal of the tax credits alone may push electricity prices almost 10 percent higher than they would be otherwise by 2029, according to National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm. Gas prices will also increase over the next decade, according to Rhodium Group, a think tank, as consumers who would otherwise have driven electric cars continue using vehicles that burn fossil fuels.

Mr. Trump’s approach to wind and solar is part of a larger story. It is, along with his tariffs, extreme immigration policies and attempt to take over the Federal Reserve, one more example of prioritizing ideology over the interests of American families.

Mr. Trump’s energy policy also weakens America’s global standing by giving a competitive edge to the country’s chief geopolitical rival, China. For years China has meticulously grown its clean energy industry with government subsidies and other policies. Chinese companies now produce 60 percent of the world’s wind turbines and 80 percent of solar panels.

Mr. Biden’s clean energy tax credits were meant to counter China’s moves. He understood that wind and solar would play an important role in the economy of the future, and that the United States should not let China control the global market. Mr. Biden’s approach was working, creating incentives for the private sector to build big clean-energy projects, including Toyota’s E.V. battery production facility in Liberty, N.C., and a Qcells solar panel manufacturing facility in Cartersville, Ga.

Low energy prices are also good for economic growth. If prices are higher here than in other countries, companies will invest less in America. Consider artificial intelligence: Technology companies are building data centers to power their bots’ processing abilities. These data centers use a lot of electricity. If energy supply cannot keep up with demand, America’s A.I. build-out will lag — again to the benefit of China.

The Trump administration argues that wind and solar are not reliable, and that has some truth to it. If the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, power cannot be generated. But this objection is mostly a canard. Advances in battery technology will allow the country to use wind and solar energy during off-hours. Wind and solar also do not have to generate electricity at all times. We have other forms of energy — nuclear, hydro, geothermal and, yes, fossil fuels — to handle the moments that wind and solar cannot. When a country is pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy, varying sources of energy complement one another. They increase overall supply and hold down prices for everybody.

We understand why the political right has sometimes been frustrated by the left’s skepticism of energy abundance. In both Europe and the United States, environmentalists who are rightly worried about the costs and dangers of climate change have at times imagined that the transition could happen more quickly than is realistic. In truth, oil and gas will be necessary to keep prices low and power the economy for years to come. But the political left is not the problem today. The Democratic Party under Mr. Biden expanded domestic oil and gas production while making major investments in clean energy.

The Republican Party has long denied the severe risks that climate change presents and stood in the way of sensible policies to address the extreme storms, flooding and heat that are already happening. Under Mr. Trump, Republicans have gone even further. They have become the party that stands in the way of lower energy prices for American households.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/opinion/09cleanenergy-editorial-image/09cleanenergy-editorial-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 16:02:38.251089

But type of energy Trump is working to expand is nuclear, which emits no greenhouse gases.

Spectrum News recently visited the McGuire Nuclear Power Station in Huntersville, North Carolina, which has been around for four decades.

The sprawling campus outside Charlotte sits behind a thick wall of fencing, watch towers and other security measures.

""Before I came in the industry, pre-9/11, I don’t think we saw the security the same level we do now,"" said McGuire operations manager John Banse.

The plant can produce enough power for more than a million and a half homes.

Inside, nuclear fission of uranium creates heat that turns water into steam, driving the turbines and generators that produce electricity. The steam is cooled and reused by water from Lake Norman next door, flowing through metal tubes.

Nuclear power plants are a common sight in the region, generating 36% of the electricity in North Carolina and 60% in South Carolina.

And soon nuclear energy could be expanding its reach to more parts of the country.

In May, Trump signed executive orders aimed to spur the nuclear power industry by speeding up reactor testing and licensing, and using reactors for artificial intelligence data centers and military bases.

The president’s embrace of nuclear is in stark contrast to his opposition to other forms of clean energy like wind and solar.

“Nuclear energy is one subject that neither Democrats nor Republicans object to,” said George Washington University physics professor Andrei Alexandru.

Provisions of the bipartisan infrastructure law signed by Biden in 2021 also sought to increase nuclear power generation. And two years later the U.S. joined more than 20 other countries in pledging to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050.

With memories of nuclear accidents at Fukushima and Three Mile Island, safety is often the biggest concern around nuclear power and that could pose a hurdle for nuclear expansion in some states.

Duke Energy Vice President of New Nuclear Generation Rounette Nader said the plants are safe and the benefits are widespread.

“The plants run 95% of the time, it’s carbon-free generation, it’s affordable, reliable. So it ticks all the boxes,” Rounette said.

The expansion of nuclear energy continues in North Carolina, where Duke Energy hopes to transform a coal and natural gas plant called Belews Creek into nuclear energy.

“We’ve done some analysis to look at how the workforce at a coal station can be transitioned to a nuclear station and we think we can be very successful with that,” Nader said.

This is the first month both power sources have ever generated that much energy, according to the Associated Press.
In August 2025, Brazil's solar and wind power generated a combined 19 TWh of electricity, or 34% of Brazil's electricity.
Improving air quality and creating good-paying jobs are two great benefits of increasing solar and wind energy sources.
Investing in solar energy is one way individuals can contribute to cleaner energy.","Solar and wind power generated a third of Brazil's electricity in August 2025. This is the first month both power sources have ever generated that much energy, according to the Associated Press.

The previous high for both sources of energy was 18.6 terawatt-hours (TWh) in September 2024, per Ember Energy. In August 2025, Brazil's solar and wind power generated a combined 19 TWh of electricity, or 34% of Brazil's electricity. That is enough to power 119 million Brazilian homes for a month.

""Brazil shows how a rapidly growing economy can meet its rising need for electricity with solar and wind,"" said Raul Miranda, Ember's global program director, per the AP. ""Solar and wind are a perfect match for Brazil's hydropower resources, taking the pressure off in drought years. A diversified mix is a fundamental strategy for tackling risks related to climate change.""

The remaining electricity generated in Brazil in August included 48% from hydropower and just 14% from fossil fuels like natural gas, coal, and oil.

To put this into perspective, the U.S. Energy Information Administration stated that fossil fuels account for 60% of generated electricity in the U.S.

Wind and solar power are affordable and clean energy sources. They can help mitigate the harmful effects of fossil fuels, which contribute to air pollution, Earth's overheating, and increased natural disasters.

Improving air quality and creating good-paying jobs are two great benefits of increasing solar and wind energy sources. And as Ember Energy stated, wind and solar's prices fell by 55% and 85% respectively in the decade before 2020.

Solar and wind continue to grow in Brazil.

In 2024, those sources accounted for 24% of Brazil's electricity generated. According to Ember Energy, the increase in wind and solar energy outpaces the increase in electricity demand across the country. These clean and renewable energies helped decrease fossil fuel use by 45%.

""It is undoubtedly symbolic, and you see these sources contributing a significant fraction of electricity at a given moment and showing that they are important,"" said Ricardo Baitelo, project coordinator at Brazil's Institute for Energy and the Environment, per AP News. ""They are not alternative sources, they are already a well-represented part of Brazil's electricity mix.""

According to Brazil's Institute for Energy and the Environment, the country is the only G20 nation on track to meet its goal of increasing renewable sources by 2030.

""This is the big warning and a yellow light that could turn red,"" Baitelo said. ""And Brazil needs to take urgent measures to avoid losing this condition and this good example of wind and solar deployment.""

On Wednesday, the environment department submitted the rules to the independent Environmental Improvement Board.
Public comments have already been opened, and the state environment department will host a virtual public meeting on Oct. 22 to provide an overview of the rules and answer questions.
The environment department included two examples in a news release, but said neither are final.
“House Bill 212 represents an important step forward to protect New Mexicans from toxic PFAS chemicals,” state Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) said in a statement.","The state health department on Wednesday put forward proposed rules that will be used to implement a new law regulating the use of so-called “forever chemicals” in consumer productions.

House Bill 212—the PFAS Protection Act—passed by New Mexico lawmakers in the regular 2025 legislative session, institutes the gradual phasing out of intentionally added per-and-polyfluouroalkyl substances—PFAS— in everyday items.

“These rules will prevent toxic PFAS chemicals from unknowingly entering the places where we live, work and play,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. “From cookware and food packaging, to furniture and cleaning supplies, to adult hygiene products and baby clothes and toys—these rules will protect the health of New Mexicans and our environment from toxic forever chemicals.”

New Mexico is the third state to enshrine a ban in state laws to address the use of PFAS in consumer products, joining Maine and Minnesota.

As detailed in a news release from the environment, the law phases out and then prohibits consumer products that contain intentionally added PFAS, which “can cause a range of adverse health issues including thyroid disease, liver or kidney damage, birth defects, certain types of cancers, and increase the risk of reproductive issues like decreased fertility, low birth weight, or developmental delays.”

Specifically, state law prohibits in 2027 the sale of certain products with intentionally added PFAS in items like cookware food packaging and juvenile products; cosmetics, furniture and carpets will be prohibited in 2028; and, in 2032, state law prohibits selling all non-exempt products —such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals, electronics and cars— with intentionally added PFAS in New Mexico.

On Wednesday, the environment department submitted the rules to the independent Environmental Improvement Board. If passed after the rulemaking process they will take effect in July of 2026. Public comments have already been opened, and the state environment department will host a virtual public meeting on Oct. 22 to provide an overview of the rules and answer questions.

“With the passage of House Bill 212, we had one clear objective – to safeguard New Mexicans from dangerous added toxins, PFAS, in everyday products,” State Rep. and Majority Whip Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque) said in a statement. “Today’s Environmental Improvement Board filing brings us one critical step closer in removing harmful chemicals from our homes, and to provide peace of mind to our communities.”

The act also requires manufacturers to label products that include intentionally added PFAS. The environment department included two examples in a news release, but said neither are final.

“House Bill 212 represents an important step forward to protect New Mexicans from toxic PFAS chemicals,” state Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) said in a statement. “Data has shown that these dangerous cancer-causing chemicals persist in the human body and in the environment for a very long time, and we must do all we can to prevent New Mexican’s exposure to them.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-93/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/draft-pfas-label-2-1024x4451760030584.jpg?h=e0e716f0&itok=Vpa1S7mJ,N,,2025-10-09 15:05:40.672468

Clean energy has dethroned coal — a triumph of science over pollution.","For the first time in history, renewables have generated more electricity than coal globally. But as science powers this breakthrough, it’s come under attack — and in a twist few saw coming, the Vatican is defending it.

Clean energy has just made history — generating more electricity than coal for the first time ever. According to Ember’s Global Electricity Mid-Year Insights 2025, renewables supplied 34.3 percent of global electricity in the first half of 2025, overtaking coal’s 33.1 percent share — a moment that marks the beginning of the end for the fossil-fuel era.

But even as science achieves what once seemed impossible, political forces are moving to undermine it, waging a new war not on technology — but on truth itself. And in a twist few could have predicted, the Vatican has emerged as one of science’s strongest defenders — rallying global faith and moral authority behind the facts that denial seeks to erase.

A Historic Turning Point for Clean Power

The world has crossed a historic threshold;

Solar output jumped 31 percent (+306 TWh) in early 2025, meeting 83 percent of global demand growth.

Wind generation rose 7.7 percent (+97 TWh).

Fossil generation declined 0.3 percent, even as overall demand increased 2.6 percent.

China met its entire electricity demand growth with clean sources, cutting emissions 1.7 percent (–46 Mt CO₂). India’s surge in solar and wind reduced emissions 3.6 percent (–24 Mt CO₂).

In the European Union, renewables surpassed all fossil fuels combined for electricity generation last year — a world first. In the United States, an extraordinary 96 percent of new power capacity added in 2024 was fossil-free.

Meanwhile, clean technologies are scaling at eye-watering speed. According to the IEA, global EV sales were up 35% year-on-year in the first three months of 2025, marking another exponential leap toward a fossil-free transport system. Battery energy storage systems are also booming: in the U.S. alone, planned additions in 2024 could nearly double capacity, and global deployments grew 53 % over the prior year. Within a decade, many new vehicles and power grids may largely bypass fossil fuels — instead drawing directly from wind, solar, and storage.

“Clean power is now growing fast enough to meet the world’s appetite for electricity,... This marks the beginning of a structural transition.”

Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, lead analyst at Ember.

The Science Worked. The Backlash Began.

Yet as the data delivers hope, science itself is under assault.

The Union of Concerned Scientists report from July 2025 documented 402 attacks on science during the Trump administration’s first six months back in power — the fastest erosion of federal scientific capacity in U.S. history.

Within weeks, the administration launched an all-out assault on climate research: NASA’s CO₂-monitoring satellites were ordered by the White House to terminated, the Mauna Loa Observatory is under threat to be shut down, and the EPA’s endangerment finding — its legal basis for regulating emissions — is about to be revoked. NOAA’s climate division was dismantled, USDA climate data erased, 1,100 EPA scientist positions cut, and plans are underway to cancel the $7 billion Solar for All program.

“You can’t manage what you can’t measure,” one NASA scientist told Reuters. “Eliminating the data eliminates accountability.”

The Anti-Science Movement Goes Global

And it’s spreading.

In Sweden, Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson went on national television to claim that Sweden has “the world’s lowest carbon footprint.” Scientists quickly pointed out the opposite: while most EU nations are cutting emissions, Sweden’s are rising faster than any other. The European Commission has now referred Sweden to the EU Court of Justice for failing to implement new renewable-energy permitting rules — a breach that could trigger financial penalties. When governments ignore evidence, lie about the facts and delay clean-energy progress, it’s not just climate policy at risk — it’s science itself.

In Germany, the AfD — now polling as the country’s largest party — has pledged to tear down wind turbines and roll back clean-energy goals.

In the United Kingdom, the Conservative opposition is trying to win the election by scrapping the country’s science-based climate targets.

Globally, the five largest oil majors have spent over $1 billion since the Paris Agreement on lobbying and branding that undermine international climate goals.

Across continents, populist movements are reframing climate action as elitist ideology — the same playbook once used against vaccines and public health. Their goal is simple: protect fossil profits by eroding public trust in science.

But truth has a strange resilience — the harder it’s attacked, the stronger it often becomes.

Signs of Hope and Resilience

Even amid the backlash, progress continues to accelerate across the world. From California and New York to capitals across the European Union, governments are doubling down on 100 percent clean-power mandates. China and India are pouring record investments into solar, battery storage, and electric mobility — reshaping the world’s industrial backbone in real time. Corporate appetite is soaring too: companies signed more than 90 gigawatts of clean power purchase agreements in 2024, the highest ever recorded. And according to the International Energy Agency, global clean-energy investment will reach $2 trillion in 2025, outpacing fossil fuels by a factor of two to one.

For investors, this is not ideology — it’s market momentum. Renewables are outperforming the S&P 500, and clean-tech equities are driving a new industrial wave built on electrons, not oil.

When Faith Defended Science

As political attacks on science intensify, an unlikely defender has stepped forward: the Vatican.

In October, Pope Leo XIV—widely viewed as more conservative than his predecessor, Pope Francis—surprised the world by inviting scientists, activists, and political leaders to his private summer residence at Castel Gandolfo. I was there and his message was unmistakable: faith and science are not enemies, but allies in truth.

At the Raising Hope for Climate Justice gathering, the Pope called on global citizens to reject the manipulation of facts and to stand firm behind evidence and reason.

“Some have chosen to deride the increasingly evident signs of climate change, to ridicule those who speak of global warming, and even to blame the poor for the very thing that affects them the most,... There is no room for indifference or resignation.”

Pope Leo XIV

One of his first actions as the new Pope was to ensure that the Vatican becomes one of the world’s first states powered entirely by clean energy — expanding the solar transition begun under Francis with a vast new solar farm at Santa Maria Galeria, designed to meet all of the Holy See’s electricity needs.

Two headlines told the story of our divided times:

📰 Reuters: “Schwarzenegger at Vatican in mission to terminate fossil fuels.”

🗞️ Daily Mail: “Woke American Pope blesses a block of ice in bizarre climate change stunt.”

But inside Castel Gandolfo, the focus was clear: to defend the very foundation of truth. In an age when denial has become political currency, the Pope used his global platform to call for courage — to protect not just creation, but the credibility of knowledge itself.

And standing on the same stage was Arnold Schwarzenegger — a Republican, a lifelong conservative, and former governor of California — echoing the Pope’s message word for word.

“It’s time to say hasta la vista to the special interests standing in the way of climate action”

Arnold Schwarzenegger, former republican Governor of California

Together, they embodied what the world needs most: unity across old divisions — faith and reason, left and right — coming together to defend science itself.

With 1.3 billion members and 400,000 priests worldwide, the Catholic Church may now be the most powerful ally science has.

Below is a brief summary highlighting key moments from the Raising Hope for Climate Justice conference, which I attended and documented firsthand.

The Outlook: Clean Energy Is Unstoppable — But Delay Is Deadly

As the world moves toward COP30 in Belém, Brazil, one truth stands above the noise: the clean energy revolution rests on decades of public science, open data, and transparency. These institutions of truth are the quiet engines behind every solar breakthrough, every emissions target, every policy that works. If they erode, progress itself can still be undone.

Defending that infrastructure is no longer the job of scientists alone. It is an economic, moral, and civic imperative.

Leaders across business and government can help secure the transition by embracing science-based governance, channeling capital into climate solutions, and standing up for facts in the public sphere.

Clean energy has dethroned coal — a triumph of science over pollution.

That single milestone proves what once seemed impossible: the green transition is real, accelerating, and unstoppable.

But delay is deadly. Each year of hesitation locks in decades of damage — from melting ice sheets to collapsing ecosystems and rising human costs. The data shows hope, but the physics demands urgency. At COP30, world leaders hold the power to act — or the burden of failure.

In the third quarter of this year, demand for battery electric vehicles rose 29% compared to the same quarter in 2024, Urban Science found.
While they may now be scaling back that pace of investment, automakers aren’t going to abandon electric vehicles, Kondrat said.
To be sure, the Denver area has “the right demographics” for BEV sales, Kondrat said.
But the BEV market is definitely not falling off a cliff just because federal tax credits ended.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Yes, the $7,500 federal tax credit for an electric vehicle purchase has ended and yes, EV sales are slowing. But demand won’t collapse, according to Urban Science.

Several pillars of support for the EV market aren’t going away, and those will create a floor to any sales slowdown, Tom Kondrat, global lead for advanced analytics at Urban Science, told Wards Auto. The five pillars Kondrat named include:

Current BEV owners like their vehicles and will continue to buy electric vehicles

More market entries at lower price points

Rising consideration of BEVs as consumers see more on the road

Continued manufacturer purchase incentives

Expanding public charging infrastructure

“We don’t see battery electric (vehicle) demand collapsing,” he said in an interview. “While the fourth quarter may be rocky, in the next 12 to 24 months we see stability in demand.”

Longer term, Urban Science projects demand for electric vehicles to grow gradually, Kondrat added.

In the third quarter of this year, demand for battery electric vehicles rose 29% compared to the same quarter in 2024, Urban Science found. BEV sales accounted for 11.7% of all retail sales.

That surge in demand was largely driven by the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for a BEV purchase on Sept. 30, Kondrat said. “What we had in the third quarter was a ton of shopper hype,” he said. “The incentive going away pushed (sales) up.”

But over the next 12 months, Urban Science expects BEV sales to stabilize at between nine and 10 percent of the market, Kondrat said.

Dive deeper into the five factors continuing to support BEV demand, below.

1. BEV owners will buy another BEV

Experian found there were more than 4.69 million battery-electric vehicles on the road in the United States as of the second quarter of 2025, a spokesperson said in an email to WardsAuto.

And many are happy with their purchase, Kondrat said.

“A lot of people who drive and own an EV like that experience,” he said.

Many of those BEV drivers have also invested in home charging, Kondrat added, and they are likely to acquire another electrified vehicle. “That will maintain a certain pace” of BEV sales in the future, he said.

2. More affordable choices

Not so long ago, Tesla was the only real competitor in the BEV market and its most inexpensive model started at above $42,000. It recently announced two lower-priced, but deeply de-contented, models.

Meanwhile, many more models at similar or lower price points than Tesla’s are entering the market, Kondrat said. That will maintain BEV demand.

“Affordability is key,” he said.

Consider some of the options: the new Nissan Leaf starts at just under $30,000. Volkswagen, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Kia offer BEVs starting around $40,000 or less. And the Rivian R2 is set to arrive in 2026 with an entry-level price of around $45,000.

“If you look at the landscape, there is more movement in the middle market,” Kondrat said.

That will help build a floor under the demand slowdown, he said.

3. Familiarity with BEVs boosts consideration

As BEV adoption moves into the mainstream, more consumers will know a BEV owner, and have more experience with BEVs. As with any new technology, increased knowledge and experience with BEVs will boost demand, Kondrat said.

“Adoption is a social process,” he said.

And since the majority of BEVs sold are leased, “every year now we have more consumers being introduced to BEVs via the used market,” Kondrat said.

4. Manufacturer incentives will continue

Automakers have invested hundreds of millions to build electric vehicle production infrastructure. While they may now be scaling back that pace of investment, automakers aren’t going to abandon electric vehicles, Kondrat said.

They seek a return on that investment, which means manufacturer incentives will take the place of federal tax incentives, which will also help maintain BEV demand, he said.

“Many manufacturers are releasing their own incentives,” Kondrat said.

Ford and Hyundai, for example, are offering BEV purchase incentives to offset the loss of the federal tax credit.

Going forward, Kondrat expects manufacturers to reduce content on their BEV offerings to keep the price low, and to find other ways to align supply and demand for electric vehicles.

Meanwhile, the price of EV technology, including the battery, is already coming down, he said. That will increase EV consideration over time.

5. Charging infrastructure is expanding

According to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, the number of DC fast charging ports in the United States rose by more than 80% in the previous two years to more than 60,300 at the end of August.

Read More in Automakers

Having more, and more visible, fast charging networks also fast charges EV adoption, Kondrat said. BEVs have over 35% of the market in Boulder, Colorado for example, and “the Denver area has a very robust charging infrastructure,” Kondrat said.

To be sure, the Denver area has “the right demographics” for BEV sales, Kondrat said. But areas that might not seem as obviously BEV friendly also are seeing healthy growth, he added.

BEV sales in Florida, for example, rose 52% compared to the same quarter in 2024, Kondrat said. “Florida has been above average in demand for BEVs on a market share basis.”

A 2024 study by The Harris Poll and Urban Science found that while only 26% of consumers would be ready for “EV only options” by 2025, that is expected to double to 50% by 2035.

To be sure, reaching that level will require targeted and sustained marketing by automakers and dealers as well as continued growth of charging infrastructure. But the BEV market is definitely not falling off a cliff just because federal tax credits ended.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/HWSGG4CL2m43DLf4ojc0-zyjKvsogT9hiQBrz3r8YxE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzIwMjUtMDgtMDZfYXRfMS41My41NlBNLnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-09 15:04:04.172219

Zavala cited data from the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute, which found that low-income families spend about 12% of their income on electric bills.
""We want affordable bills, reliable power, and we want to keep our families safe.""","Energy experts speaking at a virtual Reliable Grid Project media briefing Wednesday said renewable power sources are needed to keep up with Texas’ growing demand for electricity.

Panelists also emphasized the importance of power storage using batteries.

""Renewables are absolutely bringing affordability to the grid in Texas, but they're also bringing reliability in a state that really needs it,"" said Matt Boms, the executive director for the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance.

Boms expressed optimism about the grid's reliability this winter, noting how power sources like wind and solar, along with energy storage, can help fulfill the state's demand.

""We are heading into the winter with more flexible, reliable power than ever before,” he said. “Clean energy is driving ERCOT's reliability.”

As more data centers come to Texas, the state will also have to contend with an increased demand for energy.

Stoic Energy Consulting founder Doug Lewin said increased electricity use can drive down costs, if managed correctly.

""That can be, with the right mix of policies around it, actually good for consumers, because you're actually spreading the cost of the system out among more use,"" he said.

Lewin said the state should create a demand response program for data centers to help avoid peaks in electricity use during extreme weather.

""To have a reliable grid, we need data centers to actually create funds to deal with this problem,"" he said.

Patricia Zavala, the executive director of nonprofit PowerHouse Texas, also emphasized the importance of renewable energy sources.

""The numbers really speak for themselves, and renewables and batteries are playing a really critical role in lowering costs,"" she said.

Zavala cited data from the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute, which found that low-income families spend about 12% of their income on electric bills. Meanwhile, households with the highest incomes spend about 1% of their income on energy expenses.

""Texans really just want the same thing,"" Zavala said. ""We want affordable bills, reliable power, and we want to keep our families safe.""",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/11212609/solar5-1500x1125.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:04:13.751342

Cuts could also wipe out $50 million in funding for an investment by Mitsubishi Electric to repurpose a manufacturing plant in Maysville, and nearly $24 million for several energy-related projects under the University of Kentucky Research Foundation.

The list of potential cuts was reported by Semafor and numerous other news outlets this week. The Department of Energy was ""unable to verify"" the list, spokesperson Olivia Tinari said in an Oct. 7 email to The Courier Journal, and ""continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.""

If enacted, the reported cuts could be a death blow to the Ascend Elements project, which previously involved plans to invest nearly $1 billion in battery recycling and production and create hundreds of jobs. The company already agreed to cancel $164 million in federal funding earlier this year, and was recently entangled in litigation over alleged refusal to pay contractors.

Ascend Elements did not respond to The Courier Journal's request for comment, nor did Mitsubishi Electric. As of Oct. 8, the University of Kentucky had not received notice of funding changes, according to spokesperson Whitney Siddiqi.

""Cutting promised funding for businesses and organizations is short-sighted and harmful ― not just for Kentucky, but for our entire country,"" said Scottie Ellis, a spokesperson for Gov. Andy Beshear's office, in a statement. As of Oct. 8, the governor's office had not heard confirmation of the cuts from the federal government, Ellis said, but was ""reaching out to the companies reportedly affected to learn more.""

The list circulating this week matches a pattern of funding cancelations to clean energy and decarbonization efforts. The Trump administration, at odds with decades of climate science, has questioned the merit of reducing carbon emissions and painted efforts to do so as a ""scam.""

Earlier this month, at the onset of a tense government shutdown, the Trump administration announced funding cancelations of more than $7 billion for 223 energy projects, which it said ""did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.""

Most of that round of cuts targeted projects in blue states. Democrats lambasted those cuts as partisan, and said the decision would ""harm American jobs, drive private capital out of our country, weaken our power grid, and give China a strategic edge.""

In May, the Trump administration yanked federal funding from another tranche of projects, including two in Kentucky: $72 million for a carbon capture pilot project at LG&E's Cane Run power plant in Louisville, and up to $75 million to the international spirits company Diageo to decarbonize its operations in Shelbyville, Kentucky, and Plainfield, Illinois.

Notably, the new list of reported project cuts would acutely affect red states and red districts. Billions of dollars for regional hydrogen hubs, including one in Appalachia, would be slashed. Carbon capture projects along the Gulf Coast, which the fossil fuel industry has generally supported, would also take a hit.

In recent years, deep-red Kentucky has embraced a slew of economic development projects related to clean energy, and especially the electric vehicle supply chain, boosted by Biden-era subsidies. The Kentucky legislature approved state incentives for the projects ― some of which could now collapse under a reversal in federal support. Thousands of Kentucky jobs hang in the balance.

The Ascend Elements plant lies a few miles outside Hopkinsville, in Kentucky's 1st Congressional District. A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. James Comer did not respond to a request for comment on the potential cuts, nor did staff of the Christian County Chamber of Commerce.

Other major electric vehicle investments sited in Kentucky in recent years include the sprawling BlueOval SK plant in Hardin County and EV expansions by Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Manufacturing.

In addition to slashed federal awards, the EV industry is facing whiplash in federal policy. The Trump administration has dismantled Biden-era policies meant to support the growing U.S. EV industry, including consumer-side tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, which ended Sept. 30. Industry analysts expect EV sales to slow as a result, which in turn could hinder growth in Kentucky's burgeoning battery sector.","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/09/PLOU/84122214007-apex-1-aerial-view-308012024-sm-31024-x-683.jpg?crop=1022,575,x0,y58&width=1022&height=575&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-09 14:04:12.285375

The nations of the world are embroiled in a constant state of finding balance in the energy sector. Indonesia has taken a step towards reaching the lofty ambitions that the world has set for the energy sector. The floating solar plant in West Java could accelerate the transition to the renewable energy sector.

Indonesia’s state-owned electricity company, PLN, has reported that construction has begun

The nation’s state-owned electricity utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, has reported that it has initiated construction on a huge 92-megawatt-peak floating solar power facility at the Saguling reservoir in West Java.

The state-owned operator reports that the site is hoping to come online by November 2026. Indonesia has big plans for its energy sector. The nation has stated that by 2034, it plans to add 42.6 GW (GigaWatt) of renewables to its grid, with solar contributing 17.1 GW of new capacity.

Aligning with that goal of adding a significant amount of energy to the grid from solar power, the country’s leaders have reported that the plant at the Saguling reservoir in West Java is expected to generate more than 130 GWh (GigaWatt-hour) annually, which would help Indonesia avoid roughly 104,000 tons of CO₂ emissions each year.

Indonesia is working with several key stakeholders to foster change in the energy sector

For any nation that aims to transition away from conventional energy generation processes in favor of the renewable energy sector, cooperation with relevant stakeholders who can accelerate the transition is vital to ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted transition.

While the exact cost of the massive 92 MW floating solar plant in West Java has not been revealed by Indonesia, the project can take solace in the fact that the nation’s state-owned energy utility is fostering cooperative relationships with relevant stakeholders in the energy sector.

The Saguling project, located roughly 111 miles away from the nation’s capital, Jakarta, has huge potential to fast-track the nation’s attempt to integrate large-scale solar projects into the grid. The project comes off the back of a cooperative project that was developed by PLN Nusantara, a division of Mubadala Investment Company, and the United Arab Emirates renewables energy company Masdar.

Solar power remains an untapped energy resource that the world has yet to fully explore, and several Asian nations have added new solar projects to the grid in recent years. Even the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, sees the untapped potential that solar power presents to the world.

“A utility can handle up to 20 per cent of production from solar and that helps the grid because it produces electricity when needed. Solar power peaks in the middle of the day and that’s also when air conditioning is running and businesses are operating, so power production matches usage.” – Elon Musk

Solar power capacity will become the most dominant energy generation process if the current trend continues",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1-Credits-GCN.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:04:08.210978

GM has canceled its program to provide a $7,500 incentive for EVs after the federal tax credit expired.

The program aimed to help dealers move 20,000 EVs but was halted due to regulatory concerns.

There are approximately 135,000–140,000 EVs still unsold nationwide, and demand is expected to drop sharply in the coming months.

General Motors is abandoning its plans to continue offering consumers a $7,500 incentive for EVs in place of the federal tax credit that expired on Sept. 30, according to an exclusive report from Reuters. The initiative was designed to mitigate the impact of the credit’s expiration and enable dealers to continue selling EV inventory.

At the end of September, GM planned to use its in-house financing arm to make a down payment on approximately 20,000 EVs in dealers’ inventories. The company would apply for the federal tax credit on those vehicles and roll it into leases for customers through the end of the year.

GM Financial began making down payments on the vehicles before Sept. 30. However, the plan was halted after Senator Bernie Moreno, a former car dealer, raised concerns about the program. GM confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday that the plan was scrapped, but declined to provide further insight into the decision.

The program aimed to help car dealers move EV inventory, a challenge made more difficult by the expiration of the federal tax credit. Currently, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) estimates that approximately 135,000 to 140,000 electric vehicles remain unsold on dealer lots across the nation.

GM executives developed the program quickly, shortly before the subsidy expired. They were also tipped off that their rival, Ford, was planning a similar initiative.

Despite a surge of purchasing activity that drove record EV sales in September, industry experts and dealers expect a sharp decline in EV demand in the coming months.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10092025-GM-Abandons-7500-EV-Program-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:03:24.821669

This September, Foley Hoag team members from across the United States participated in dozens of events at ClimateWeekNYC, Colorado Climate Week, and Houston Energy + Climate Startup Week. Our team left buzzing with energy and optimism. In New York, the momentum, collaboration, and shared purpose at the world’s largest annual climate gathering were truly inspiring. In Colorado and Texas, we saw the forefront of new technologies and new ideas about energy and climate that are impacting consumers, developers and policymakers across the country.

New York was rainy and humid, but our team trekked hundreds of miles across the city to engage in discussions across a wide range of topics. Gone is the frothiness of post-Inflation Reduction Act initiatives and we saw fewer pledges of ambitious decarbonization goals. Instead, many of the conversations focused on real-world immediate issues like load growth from data centers, strained grid systems, critical minerals supply, adaptation and resiliency, affordability of energy, and navigating a world with less federal support (or downright opposition).

In Colorado, our team facilitated discussions on the role of government relations and legal strategy in climatetech.

In Houston, we joined our friends at Greentown Labs and Activate in multiple days of demos and workshops focusing on new technologies for the energy transition.

Attorneys at Foley Hoag have been at the forefront of navigating the new climate landscape. As we head into another week of a government shut down, we’re working with private and public companies, nonprofits, and state and local agencies to work through new solutions to the problems of the day.

At this year’s New York Climate Week, our conversations focused on bringing people together to brainstorm practical solutions, and to connect the founders and funders that will build the energy infrastructure of the next several decades. Together with our colleagues and partners at Planeteer Capital, Earthshot Ventures, Activate, Molecule Group, Node Climate, Impact Capital Managers, Tailwind Futures, Resilience Company, Resilience Investments, Cleantech Leaders Climate Forum and the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition Institute, we dove into meaningful conversations on adaptation and resilience, clean fuels and corporate sustainability, FOAK technologies, and climate finance and investing—and even got an exciting preview of breakthrough green technologies poised to shape what’s next.",https://foleyhoag.com/getmedia/f2115ae7-c84f-4da1-aca8-9783f64f7359/Climate-Law-Matters_wind_insight_689x388.png?width=689&height=388&ext=.png,N,,2025-10-09 15:04:18.049955

Appropriations Showdown

The Federal government shutdown is continuing with no end in sight. The main sticking points are whether the funding bill should include the expiring increased tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums enacted during Covid, reverse health policy changes enacted in the OBBBA, and prevent President Trump from using his statutory rescissions authority to eliminate spending previously agreed to under bipartisan spending deals.

The IRS announced on October 8 that the agency would begin an IRS-wide furlough for everyone except already-identified excepted and exempt employees. Bloomberg Tax reported that the IRS is furloughing nearly half of its workforce beginning Wednesday, October 8, 2025. The IRS is retaining employees working on the multi-trillion dollar tax law implementation, filing season, and IT.

In the days prior to the shutdown, Treasury and the IRS issued the 2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan, and several pieces of tax guidance.

2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan

On September 30, Treasury and the IRS issued the 2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan. More specifically, the guidance was issued in a joint statement by Ken Kies, in his capacities as Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy and Acting IRS Chief Counsel, and Scott Bessent, in his capacity as Acting Commissioner of the IRS.

The plan lists 105 items, compared to the prior plan, which contained 231 items. As previewed by Deputy Assistant Secretary Kevn Salinger, the list is pared down to contain only items actually expected to be released this year, instead of the prior practice of including more aspirational items.

The plan is organized around Trump administration priorities: “OBBBA Implementation,” “Deregulation and Burden Reduction,” “Section 501(c)(3) Issues,” “Tribal Tax Issues,” “Digital Assets,” and “Secure 2.0 Act and Other Guidance.” Priority guidance plans under the Biden administration were organized by subject area, such as “Consolidated Returns,” “Corporations and Their Shareholders,” “Employee Benefits,” etc. During the first Trump administration, the plans contained both elements, with the opening sections organized around administration priorities, followed by a section called “General Guidance” organized by subject area.

“OBBBA Implementation” has 40 items: “Deregulation and Burden Reduction” contains 46 items. Of note, the two 501(c)(3) Issues are (1) “application of the fundamental public policy against racial discrimination, including consideration of recent caselaw, in determining the eligibility of private schools for recognition of tax-exempt status under §501(c)(3)” and (2) the Johnson Amendment. More details on the Johnson Amendment are provided in Sullivan & Cromwell’s memo “Revisiting the Johnson Amendment – ‘Electoral Politics Viewed Through the Lens of Religious Faith’.”

IRS Comments on Tips and Overtime

The IRS said employers that make a good faith effort to report tips and overtime pay for 2025 will not be subject to penalties even if the reporting is imperfect under guidance that the government is currently writing. This is according to Paul Ferrell, Senior Adviser to the IRS Director of National Public Liaison, speaking on a monthly call with the payroll industry on October 2. As noted in this S&C memo, the government released proposed regulations listing occupations that qualify for the OBBBA provision on qualified tips. The IRS previously announced that it would not update the W-2 for tax year 2025 to take into account OBBBA changes. Draft forms for tax year 2026 have contained changes to reflect the OBBBA. The two OBBBA provisions are included in the 2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan released on September 30, 2025.

Spin-offs and Reorganizations

On September 29, 2025, Treasury and the IRS withdrew prior guidance on certain aspects of corporate spin-offs and other reorganizations. The September 29 withdrawal removed twosets of proposed regulations published on January 16, 2025. Relatedly, the same day the government also released Revenue Procedure 2025-30, which supersedes Rev. Proc. 2024-24, modifies Rev. Proc. 2025-1 and Rev. Proc. 2017-52, and revokes Notice 2024-38.

More details on the September 29 guidance are provided in Sullivan & Cromwell’s memo “IRS Withdraws Proposed Regulations on Spin-Off Transactions and Reorganizations.” The prior guidance was described in S&C’s memo, “IRS Issues Proposed Regulations on Spin-Off Transactions and Reorganizations.”

CAMT Guidance

On September 30, Treasury and the IRS issued Notice 2025-46 and Notice 2025-49, two pieces of guidance on the corporate alternative minimum book tax (“CAMT”) enacted as Section 10101 of the Inflation Reduction Act. A more detailed discussion on such guidance is provided in Sullivan & Cromwell’s memo, “IRS Issues Interim Guidance on Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax.”

Final Regulations on Interest Capitalization Rules

On October 2, Treasury and the IRS released final regulations on the interest capitalization rules.

The regulations remove the associated property rule and similar rules regarding the requirements for improvements that constitute designated property. The regulations also modify the definition of “improvement” and modify other rules to take into account the removal of the associated property rule.

The regulations largely adopt proposed regulations issued on May 15, 2025, with only minor, clarifying changes.

The regulations are effective October 2, 2025, the day they were published in the Federal Register.

Senate Finance Committee Hearing on Digital Assets

The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing, “Examining the Taxation of Digital Assets,” on October 1, 2025. The Committee hosted a panel of four witnesses: two industry representatives, Jason Somensatto, Director of Policy at Coin Center, and Lawrence Zlatkin, Vice President, Tax, of Coinbase; a tax lawyer, Andrea S. Kramer, Founding Member of ASKramer Law LLC; and a CPA, Annette Nellen, Chair, Digital Assets Tax Task Force, AICPA. The panel urged Congress to provide greater clarity on the tax treatment of digital assets, and generally focused on three issues.

First, whether there should be a de minimis exception from gain or loss recognition when using digital currency to make purchases. Proponents of a de minimis exception call this: “you shouldn’t need a tax accountant to buy a cup of coffee.” Under current rules, when the holder of a digital asset uses the asset to make a purchase, they are deemed to sell the asset, which triggers recognition of gain or loss. Treating small-dollar transactions as sales for tax purposes can be a considerable recordkeeping and reporting burden. For this reason, some of the witnesses generally endorsed a de minimis exception. However, Ms. Kramer noted that taxpayers would still have to track transactions to know whether they are below the de minimis level. The witnesses compared the de minimis exception to the existing exception under section 988(e), which addresses transactions in foreign currencies.

Second, the tax treatment of staking rewards (also called block rewards or mining awards). Some blockchain currencies rely on parties to stake (or lock up) some amount of cryptocurrency to validate transactions. This process helps prevent fraud and supports the decentralized nature of the blockchain. In exchange, “stakers” receive new crypto from each transaction validated, called a staking reward. The IRS has published guidance under Rev. Rul. 2023-14, which treats staking rewards as income upon receipt. Staking usually involves “locking up” some amount of cryptocurrency to validate transactions. Thus, stakers may not have the ability to sell their newly acquired asset. Critics of the IRS rule state that this creates “dry income” and might encourage stakers to move to more tax-friendly jurisdictions. Some witnesses called for the reversal of Rev. Rul. 2023-14 and capital gains treatment for block rewards, with gain recognition triggered only upon disposition of the asset. Ms. Kramer argued that the block rewards constitute compensation from a third party that should be treated as taxable income.

Third, the reporting requirements for digital asset transactions of more than $10,000 in value. The Infrastructure and Jobs Act of 2021 applied the section 6050I rule for reporting transactions of cash in excess of $10,000 to digital assets. Some witnesses argued that because cryptocurrency is a decentralized financial system where counterparties may have limited to no access to the identity of the payor, the reporting rules should not apply or at least should apply at a higher threshold.

There was a general bipartisan consensus at the hearing on the need to develop appropriate legislation for the taxation of digital assets, but disagreement as to what that means. Republican Senators generally agreed that new taxpayer-friendly tax legislation would lead to increased innovation, while Democratic Senators criticized these proposals as providing advantageous tax treatment and circumventing rules in place to detect money laundering.

Chairman Mike Crapo (R - ID) asked Mr. Zlatkin about parity of legal treatment between crypto and traditional finance. Mr. Zlatkin stated that crypto currency must be placed on an even playing field with traditional finance and the most durable way to accomplish that is through legislation, not agency guidance.

In response to a question from Senator Daines (R - MT), Mr. Somensatto said the tax treatment of staking rewards is the most problematic aspect of current law. Mr. Zlatkin stated that sourcing rules for staking rewards also encourage foreign investors to remain overseas. Senator Todd Young (R - IN) confirmed with Mr. Somensatto his position that the IRS should rescind the guidance in Rev. Rul. 2023-14. Senator Young also confirmed with Mr. Zlatkin his position that the retraction of Rev. Rul. 2023-14 would attract mining activity to the United States. Senator Bill Cassidy (R - LA) sought the witnesses’ opinions on addressing the usage of the blockchain to monetize patients’ health data.

Democratic Senators expressed skepticism about the changes proposed by the witnesses. Ranking Member Ron Wyden’s (D - OR) questions to Ms. Kramer indicated skepticism towards the de minimis exception and the character of staking rewards. De minimis exceptions, it seemed to him, would require the same amount of recordkeeping as the current regime requires to prove taxpayers complied with the exception. Ms. Kramer agreed.

Senator Elizabeth Warren (D - MA) criticized digital asset lobbyists for seeking special favorable tax treatment not applicable to other types of assets. Senator Warren stated that the de minimis exception proposal would cost the government $5.8 billion, and the staking reward proposal would cost $4.3 billion. Furthermore, she stated there is no good reason to exempt the digital assets industry from reporting requirements for transactions in excess of $10,000. Senators Maggie Hassan (D - NH) and Tina Smith (D - MN) echoed Senator Warren’s concerns. Senator Whitehouse (D - RI) criticized the digital asset industry for placing higher demands on energy grids, increasing energy costs for average Americans, expanding the use of fossil fuels, and supporting President Trump’s efforts to eliminate tax incentives for green energy. Senator Wyden associated himself with those remarks.

Some of the witnesses advocated on behalf of provisions in S. 2207 (introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R - WY)), which would, amongst other provisions, create a $300 threshold under which any gain or loss from the sale of digital assets would be excluded from gross income up to an annual $5,000 cap, and also exclude staking rewards from income until sale or disposition.

On the House side, Rep. Max Miller (R - OH) is working on a bill addressing the taxation of digital assets, with highlights listed in this S&C memo. The Oversight Subcommittee of the Committee on Ways and Means held a hearing on “Making America the Crypto Capital of the World: Ensuring Digital Asset Policy Built for the 21st Century” on July 16.

The US government has withdrawn both domestically and globally from climate and clean energy engagement, marked by a dismantling of foreign development assistance, proposed rollbacks of the Inflation Reduction Act, and aggressive tariffs – all of which undermine the possibility of bilateral clean energy and climate collaboration with Southeast Asian nations.

Southeast Asian countries must now reassess external partnerships, as US policy reversals threaten climate financing and access to US markets, where previously Southeast Asian companies may have had easier access to pursue business opportunities in keeping with US’s climate and clean energy goals.

China’s historic climate-related finance in the region has far outpaced that of the US, particularly in infrastructure-heavy projects. Therefore, the loss of US climate finance may not be detrimental in the near-term but does undermine the region’s support of environmental governance, and civil society and institutional capacity to pursue its climate efforts.

Alternative avenues for cooperation are emerging, including potentially strengthened ties with the European Union, subnational partnerships, and private sector engagement – particularly from US tech giants whose rising data centre investments could drive demand for regional clean energy generation.

Despite US disengagement, the future of US-Southeast Asia climate cooperation may lie in non-traditional channels. The possibility for future collaboration between US and Southeast Asian counterparts is not completely dead, but will require more creative ways in order to find overlapping interests and avenues for financing.

INTRODUCTION

In the months since Trump’s inauguration, what began as a sharp departure from prior norms has settled into a broader realignment of US engagement with the world, and with Southeast Asia in particular. From the dismantling of USAID[1] to the imposition of sweeping tariffs[2] across the region, recent actions reflect a diminished US commitment to climate and clean energy cooperation, as well as to broader frameworks of international support. For countries in Southeast Asia, this moment calls for recalibration. While the long-term geopolitical consequences remain uncertain, one thing is increasingly clear: the United States can no longer be relied upon as a stable or sustained partner in advancing regional climate and clean energy goals.

At one point, prior to the 2024 US presidential election, there was cautious optimism that Southeast Asian clean energy and technology firms could serve as strategic partners in helping the United States meet its decarbonisation goals under its bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure legislation.[3] Southeast Asian firms were seen as potential middle-ground suppliers of clean technologies—positioned to profit from US consumer demand while supporting American decarbonisation targets under the IRA and infrastructure legislation. This prospect now looks increasingly tenuous, as the Trump administration has moved aggressively to dismantle federal climate initiatives, including clean energy tax credits[4] for wind, solar, battery storage and EVs.[5] The ripple effects are already being felt: Vietnamese automaker VinFast, once poised to capitalise on these policies and the implicit growth in US consumer demand for cheaper EVs, has postponed its North Carolina factory until 2028, citing uncertain demand among broader questions about the impacts of proposed tariffs on production costs.[6]

These dynamics underscore a broader shift already underway: Southeast Asia is being forced to reconsider the reliability and strategic value of its external partners in the clean energy transition. As the US swings back towards expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure and trade hostility, what is becoming clear is that the demand for foreign-produced clean energy technologies will inevitably shrink. Unfortunately, Southeast Asia’s clean energy firms are caught in this crossfire. Proposed US tariffs, for example those targeting solar equipment and photovoltaics manufactured in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, were proposed to be as high as 3,521% in some cases, based on allegations of Chinese firms circumventing trade restrictions by routing manufacturing through Southeast Asia.[7] The US-Vietnam trade deal signed in early July,[8] however, signals a willingness amongst some Southeast Asian countries to negotiate with the US to ease the burden of these high tariffs. The upshot, even with a 20% tariff for Vietnam exports to the US, could mean that Vietnam remains a cheaper import source for US clean energy technology needs, leaving the door open for future collaboration.

Beyond the immediate loss of economic opportunity, another consequence of Trump’s abrupt policy shifts is the loss of US foreign aid, which had served, albeit modestly, as a counterweight to China’s growing influence in Southeast Asia. The region must now reassess its broader architecture of climate finance and international cooperation, particularly considering that nearly all have declared a net-zero climate pledge[9] that will require the massive adoption of clean energy technologies and fossil-free power infrastructure. The Asian Development Bank estimates US$210 billion is needed annually through 2030 in climate investment and will require a mix of financing to meet, due to the insufficiency of government funding in the region.[10] In this Perspective, we examine how the landscape of climate investment in Southeast Asia is shifting, beginning with a comparison of US and Chinese financing flows. While the US national government may be retreating from international cooperation at the federal level, opportunities may exist for the private sector and subnational governments to potentially fill the void left by the US federal government. We examine these prospects and potential challenges for these collaborations as well.

US VS. CHINA CLIMATE INVESTMENTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA

What kind of climate partnership have China and the United States actually offered Southeast Asia? A closer look at the patterns of climate-related financing reveals stark differences in both scale and focus. China has provided the lion’s share of climate finance in the region, far surpassing US contributions. According to the Lowy Institute’s Southeast Asia Aid Map,[11] China spent approximately US$11.62 billion in climate-related financing between 2008 and 2025 (Figure 1). Although this represents less than 20% of China’s total investment in the region, 97% of those climate-related funds were directed toward large-scale infrastructure projects, primarily hydropower and energy transmission. In contrast, US climate-related financing has been far smaller in volume (Figure 2) and has largely prioritised soft infrastructure: supporting governance reforms, institutional capacity, environmental safeguards, and civil society engagement.

Yet while China’s investments increasingly dominate the region’s hard infrastructure landscape, the US has historically played a critical, if less tangible role in supporting Southeast Asia’s institutional foundations for climate action. US climate financing spent between 2008-2025 has totalled less than US$1 billion (current USD), with spending on human development (19%) and infrastructure (25%). The remaining 60% of climate-related spending primarily went to support general environmental protection and government and civil society support. This focus on “soft infrastructure” aligns with broader US commitments to capacity building and governance support[12] – areas where the US had pledged or spent US$7.24 billion. Considering foreign assistance cuts alone, we identified a total of 2,121 ongoing 2025 fiscal year climate-related awards[13] for ASEAN countries that have already been eliminated or may be at risk, totalling more than US$124 million (Table 1). There are additional grants beyond fiscal year 2025, as well as areas of cooperation not covered here, that may also be at risk of cancellation. This could include multi-year initiatives such as the US–ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership (USASCP),[14] launched in 2018, among others.

Table 1. US foreign assistance of climate-related funding at risk of elimination

(Data source: USAspending.gov, 2025).[15]

The current US administration’s proposed FY2026 budget, which eliminates climate funding, would not only halt bilateral climate finance but also slash US contributions to multilateral development banks (MDBs) and mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund[16] and the coal-to-clean-energy Just Energy Transition Partnership[17] that included Indonesia and Vietnam (Table 2). These US funding withdrawals would immediately shrink the pool of grants, concessional loans, and risk-sharing tools, such as ADB’s Innovative Finance Facility for Climate (IF-CAP) mechanism, that ASEAN countries rely on to fund clean energy and infrastructure projects. It would also impact US influence within institutions like the World Bank, IMF, IFC, and ADB, where voting power is tied to financial contributions. As of December 2023, the US and Japan were the largest ADB shareholders. With the US pulling back, there is a growing risk that MDB priorities could shift[18] toward less climate-aligned agendas, compounding financing challenges for Southeast Asia’s energy transition.

(Data: Lowy Institute, 2024; Figure: produced by the authors)

CAN CHINA FILL THE DEVELOPMENT FINANCING GAP WITHOUT UNDERMINING REGIONAL AUTONOMY?

With the scaling back of US financing, China is rapidly positioning itself to fill the gap. China has steadily expanded its presence in Southeast Asia, not only through infrastructure investment but also through humanitarian aid and political signalling.[31] President Xi Jinping’s April 2025 Southeast Asia tour was accompanied by new agreements covering trade, infrastructure, digital economy and green development, among other largely symbolic areas of cooperation with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia.[32] Even before these new agreements, the Lowy Institute showed that China was already surpassing the United States as the world’s largest bilateral development financier by commitment volume.[33] The number of countries where China’s Official Development Finance (ODF)[34] exceeds that of the US has nearly doubled, from 44 to 84, while America’s lead has shrunk from 98 to just 52 countries.

In this context, Southeast Asian governments are increasingly confronting what a long-term shift in aid and growing ties with China, given US withdrawal, might mean. As others have argued,[35] the loss of US aid is not necessarily insurmountable, but it raises critical questions about rising dependency on China. With the US no longer acting as a consistent or reliable partner, opinion has wavered between China and the US as the prevailing partner of choice.[36] Of particular salience is what a growing interdependence with China to meet climate and decarbonisation goals might mean, given that China committed approximately US$3 billion for renewable energy projects between 2019 and 2030, with much of the funding directed toward hydropower initiatives along the Mekong River in Laos and Vietnam, alongside significant investments in EV battery production in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.[37]

While China could fill the gap in some of the green capacity-building aspects left by the US, providing Southeast Asia with much needed expertise[38] for building out renewable energy power systems, grid infrastructure, and public-private partnerships to grow financing for climate-related projects, this deepening reliance also carries strategic risks. Chief among them is the concern that Chinese dominance in clean tech sectors might crowd out the ability of Southeast Asian firms to build their own capacity and for governments to shape and implement their own green industrial strategies. This dynamic is already present in the EV sector, where Chinese firms like BYD have rapidly secured a strong foothold in Thailand and is expanding in Vietnam, raising concerns about the long-term viability of decarbonisation strategies focused on domestic green industrial policies throughout Southeast Asia.[39] This complexity and potential dependency is one reason—in addition to the fact that US foreign direct investment into ASEAN represented a sizeable percentage at 32.4% of the region’s total FDI flows in 2023[40]—why Southeast Asian countries have not yet closed the door to the US and are still seeking ways to continue to partner.

OPENING THE DOOR TO OTHER PARTNERSHIPS

Given the strategic risks of deepening dependence on China with respect to climate and clean energy cooperation,[41] where else could Southeast Asian countries explore alternative avenues for financing and collaboration? Certainly, America’s retreat has created an opportunity for the region to diversify its alliances, with the European Union (EU) emerging as a promising partner. Negotiations for bilateral free trade agreements between the EU and Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia,[42] the Philippines, and Indonesia, which had stalled for nearly a decade, signal a renewed interest in strengthening economic ties. For the EU, the US’s retreat creates an opportunity to position itself as a more attractive partner for Southeast Asia. Malaysia has gained momentum as a regional leader in green hydrogen projects,[43] while Indonesia’s abundant reserves of nickel and other rare earth elements are essential for green technologies, including solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. Since Indonesia banned nickel exports in 2020,[44] any near-term EU “secure access” will likely depend on Chinese-built or partnered facilities, as Chinese firms currently control about 75% of Indonesia’s refining capacity.[45] In the longer term, however, the EU–Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)—if implemented as announced—could strengthen critical-minerals supply chains based on “responsible supply” and “local value creation.”[46] Early corporate initiatives, such as the INA/Danantara–Eramet memorandum of understanding to develop upstream-to-downstream projects with financing and technical expertise, signal intent to support Indonesia’s downstream ambitions.[47] These opportunities give Indonesia leverage to negotiate a trade deal that enhances its domestic refining capacity.

Another promising avenue for cooperation lies at the subnational level. The UN Climate Secretariat has recorded more than 40,000 companies, private investors, and subnational governments pursuing their own climate efforts.[48] These actors and networks create subnational linkages that could birth new opportunities for collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and partnerships with Southeast Asian subnational counterparts. This decentralised approach offers a pathway for advancing clean energy and climate collaboration without the need to navigate challenging, broader geopolitics. The US’s experience with innovative financing models, such as municipal green bonds and state-level green banks, provides valuable frameworks that Southeast Asian cities could adapt to accelerate their own climate action. For instance, Connecticut’s pioneering green bank model demonstrates how public-private financing mechanisms can be localised to mobilise investment in clean energy and climate resilience across the region, particularly for small businesses.[49] In Southeast Asia, US subnational counterparts have much to learn, from Singapore’s urban heat management strategies to region-wide nature-based climate solutions like mangrove restoration, and ASEAN’s efforts to enhance renewable energy adoption through grid interconnectivity.[50]

But what is the appetite among US subnational actors to collaborate with Southeast Asian counterparts? The US-ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership offers a promising example. In October 2024, the initiative launched the Smart Cities Business Innovation Fund 2.0, which is aimed at supporting net-zero urban innovation projects and low-carbon solutions for SMEs across ASEAN countries. As of February 2025, the fund, totalling US$3 million, was still actively seeking proposals, signalling ongoing interest and potential for subnational engagement beyond federal-level diplomacy. Subnational governments in both the US and ASEAN face similar climate-related challenges, from urban heat to natural hazard risks to the need to identify nature-based solutions. With US subnational governments impacted by federal budget cuts, particularly through proposed cuts to the IRA, cities are searching far and wide for innovative and creative ways to advance and implement climate actions while juggling budget deficits and other competing priorities.

POTENTIAL EXPANDED ROLE FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR?

Outside of subnational governments, the next few years could see growing influence of private US companies playing a role in Southeast Asia’s clean energy sector and decarbonisation efforts. Tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, are all looking to expand operations in Southeast Asia as demand for data centres and cloud computing services increases with the rapid development and expansion of AI technologies. Thailand has already approved three data centre projects totalling US$2.7 billion in cost.[51] The surging energy demand to power these data centres is also driving new investments in clean power. From rooftop solar PPAs in Singapore[52] to a 210 MW solar deal in Indonesia,[53] these firms are seeking to offset the growth in electricity demand through investments in renewables. However, with ASEAN’s data centre capacity expected to nearly triple by 2030,[54] current corporate clean energy deals only cover about 15% of the 2.9 GW projected demand.[55] This gap highlights that, while there is certainly scope for private companies, particularly major technology firms, to play a new and growing role in Southeast Asia’s decarbonisation, significant expansion in clean energy procurement, grid modernisation, and enabling policy frameworks will be necessary to ensure that the region’s digital growth aligns with its climate goals.

MOVING FORWARD – IS THERE A SILVER LINING?

One silver lining of President Trump’s second term so far is the clarity it provides for Southeast Asia’s path forward: the once-competitive landscape now lacks half of the equation. While this shift represents a significant loss for the United States and a broader setback for global climate progress, especially given its disproportionate share of greenhouse gas emissions, it also removes some of the geopolitical ambiguity that has long complicated regional decision-making. In many ways, this moment merely formalises a reality that has existed for years: the US has never been a dominant clean energy or climate actor in Southeast Asia. Its engagement has historically been limited, fragmented, and highly dependent on shifting administrations.

Yet this does not mean that US-Southeast Asia collaboration is without a future. In fact, stepping outside the bilateral clean energy frame may reveal new opportunities. Subnational partnerships, technology co-development, nature-based climate solutions, digital infrastructure, and academic and private-sector innovation are all domains where shared interests remain strong. Collaboration in mutually-defined priorities, of which there are many when it comes to climate change and clean energy, can endure despite shifting political headwinds. In particular, Southeast Asia’s rapid digital transformation and the rise of data centre–driven energy demand present a unique opening for US companies, institutions, and cities to partner on decarbonisation, climate resilience, and sustainable urban development. In this new chapter of US-Southeast Asia relations, redefining climate cooperation around these adjacent spaces, rather than competing head-to-head with China, may prove more pragmatic, and ultimately, more productive.

From the September / October 2025 Issue

We’ve been proud to be named CNBC’s Top State for Business for three of the last four years, and one of the reasons for that is North Carolina’s strength in providing companies an educated and well-prepared workforce, thanks to our nationally recognized universities, community colleges, and workforce development programs. From reliable infrastructure to a politically stable business climate, North Carolina offers companies the practical advantages to compete and grow in the long haul.

BF: What are the leading industries in North Carolina?

Chung: North Carolina’s economy is anchored by a diverse mix of thriving industries, with significant momentum in several targeted growth sectors in 2025.

North Carolina’s life sciences sector continues to expand, powered by a strong research ecosystem, world-class universities, and a skilled workforce. Global companies like Genentech are deepening their presence, including a recent $700 million investment to build a new manufacturing plant. This facility reinforces the state’s reputation as a leader in biotechnology, precision medicine, and advanced manufacturing while creating significant jobs for the local community.

The aerospace industry is taking flight in North Carolina, fueled by its strategic location, deep manufacturing expertise, and robust supply chain. Pratt & Whitney’s advanced manufacturing operations exemplify the state’s competitive edge in producing next-generation jet engines and aerospace components. Notably, the company recently expanded its Asheville plant with a $285 million investment, creating new high-tech jobs and strengthening the region’s aerospace ecosystem.

Most recently, JetZero’s historic announcement of 14,000+ new jobs in the central part of the state, at the Piedmont Triad International Airport, cements Greensboro and the airport as a hub for aerospace innovation and advanced manufacturing.

With the global transition to sustainable power accelerating, North Carolina has emerged as a hub for clean energy innovation and manufacturing. Industry leaders such as Toyota are making major commitments, including a $13.9 billion investment in a battery manufacturing facility that will create more than 5,000 new jobs. These projects position North Carolina at the forefront of advanced battery production, electric vehicle technology, and renewable energy infrastructure.

Looking ahead, these industries will remain central to North Carolina’s economic development strategy, with continued focus on innovation, workforce development, and infrastructure investments to support growth.

While life sciences, aerospace, and clean energy are leading drivers, North Carolina’s portfolio continues to broaden. Financial services and fintech are expanding, with the city of Charlotte anchoring the sector as the nation’s second largest banking center. Citigroup Technology’s $16 million investment, creating more than 500 jobs, is a recent announcement that underscores the region’s importance as an office and headquarters hub post-pandemic.

By leveraging its talent and technology assets, and remaining adaptable to emerging trends, we hope to keep North Carolina well-positioned to attract more diverse investments, grow its economy, and create even more high-quality jobs for North Carolinians.

BF: What are recent developments site selection teams should know about when it comes to the business climate?

Chung: North Carolina’s business climate remains highly attractive, no matter the political or policy season. Since taking office in January, Governor Stein has announced business expansions and new projects totaling nearly $17 billion in capital investment, even in a year with major federal policy shifts and some uncertainty related to tariffs and FDI commitments. These initiatives are expected to create more than 20,000 well-paying jobs, underscoring the state’s strong economic momentum and pro-business environment. Site selection teams should note North Carolina’s competitive incentives, skilled workforce, and strategic location, all of which continue to draw major companies and drive sustained growth.

BF: What is a recent project relocation or expansion you’d like to share?

Chung: This past June JetZero, a California-based commercial aviation innovator, chose Greensboro, North Carolina, for its first U.S. manufacturing facility. The company is making a $4.7 billion investment at Piedmont Triad International Airport, creating over 14,000 jobs, the largest job announcement in the state’s history.

The facility will produce JetZero’s innovative Z4 aircraft, blended-wing commercial plane designed to be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional jets. The groundbreaking is planned for the first half of 2026, with production slated to begin in the early 2030s.

This project underscores North Carolina’s growing prominence in advanced manufacturing, aerospace, and clean energy innovation, and serves as a perfect example of how North Carolina’s local, regional, and statewide economic development teams; university, community college and workforce development programs; and governmental officials, from the local level all the way to the state legislature and Governor’s office, work together to bring great jobs to the state.

BF: What is a quality of life highlight to be found in North Carolina?

Chung: North Carolina offers an exceptional quality of life, blending affordability, natural beauty, and vibrant communities. With a cost of living that is 5% below the national average and ranking as the nation’s #4 fastest-growing state, it’s easy to see why people are drawn here. Residents enjoy scenic mountains, bustling city skylines, and 300 miles of beautiful beaches.

Having personally relocated to North Carolina from the midwest nearly a decade ago, I’ve found North Carolina to be an outstanding place to raise a family, with so many opportunities to enjoy the outdoors, see historic sites, and (my favorite) spend time off in the beautiful Outer Banks.

BF: What does the future hold?

Chung: North Carolina’s future continues to be bright, with continued growth across diverse industries and emerging sectors anticipated. The state is one that consistently leads the pack in innovation and opportunity, and North Carolina’s skilled workforce, pro-business climate, and strategic location will continue to support new investments, job creation, and economic diversification. North Carolina has a strong track record of attracting overseas companies, with international projects consistently making up more than 40% of the state’s pipeline.

As North Carolina’s role in the global economy continues to grow, we remain equally committed to supporting the expansion of homegrown companies and fueling the entrepreneurial ventures drawn here by our strong economy and highly skilled workforce. This balanced approach ensures that North Carolina continues to thrive as both a global investment destination and a hub for local innovation.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nc-christopher-chung-headshot-web.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 13:09:12.463289

From September 12–14, 2025, we participated in the 2025 N.C. Plant Science Initiative (PSI) Hackathon at NC State University. The annual event gives undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars the chance to demonstrate their skills in a competition to solve ag tech-related challenges. With the goal to accelerate agricultural research using data analytics, machine learning, and hardware fabrication, the Hackathon has multiple tracks and is inclusive to participants with various levels of experience.

Our project asked a straightforward question: Which crops are best suited for North Carolina when climate and soil are considered together? We set out to connect climate history, soil information, and crop records to produce practical, data-driven insights.

Our team was intentionally interdisciplinary: Titilayo and I are Ph.D. students in Geospatial Analytics, Kashish Grover is a Ph.D. student in Horticultural Science program, and Jerry Yu is a graduate student in Statistics. This mix shaped every decision we made throughout the Hackathon. While we focused on data integration, mapping, and spatial reasoning, Kashish grounded our choices in agronomic realities, and Jerry guided the extraction of soil metrics. We jointly make decisions about modelling, evaluation, and predictions while structuring our presentation to reflect the insights gained from the data, the challenges encountered, and what we would have done differently if given more time.

The work unfolded in three steps. First, we conducted careful exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns, gaps, and inconsistencies. Second, we built AI/ML baselines to relate climate and soil factors to crop yields, and we reviewed historical records to highlight major crop failure events. Finally, we used those relationships to forecast top candidate crops for North Carolina’s conditions. The goal was not just prediction, but clarity—what factors matter most, where, and why.

A key lesson for both of us was balance. In short time frames, it is tempting to favor modeling over understanding. We found the opposite is true: strong modeling depends on first knowing the data well, its scales, spatial context, quality, and missingness. Going forward, we plan to devote proportionally more time to EDA while reserving enough time for modeling.

The experience was also a bridge across fields. We each learned outside our comfort zones: we deepened our understanding of agricultural constraints, and our teammates engaged with geospatial structure and uncertainty. This exchange gave the project direction and helped us present results that could be useful to stakeholders, not just technically sound.

We participated in the Advanced Level track, “Grow Thy Crop.” Participants hacked climate data to identify the top five crops best suited for North Carolina. They developed AI/ML models to analyze crop yields using historical and current climate data, while also identifying major crop failure events in history.

We are grateful that our work was recognized with first place in the Advanced Track, but the most important outcomes were the skills we built and the connections we made. Thank you to the Plant Sciences Initiative (PSI) as well as all the funding organizations for creating an environment where collaboration across disciplines is possible and encouraged. We look forward to applying these lessons to future research and outreach.",https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/10/IMG_5685-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 16:03:35.290342

The bill would give Ohio control over Class VI injection wells, used to store carbon dioxide underground, shifting permitting and oversight from the federal government to the state.

“Today’s vote is a major step toward ensuring Ohio is in charge of how this emerging technology is managed within our borders,” said Rep. Robb Bladel. “By establishing a state-based regulatory framework, we can make sure these projects are done by Ohioans, for Ohioans—safely, efficiently, and in a way that benefits our communities.”

Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial sources and safely storing the CO2 deep underground in naturally occurring rock formations. Currently, companies seeking to build these projects must go through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for permits, a process that can take years and discourage investment.

“Federal red tape has held back innovation and job creation in this space for too long,” said Rep. Peterson. “House Bill 170 will streamline the process, promote energy security, environmental protection, and ensure Ohio has the tools to attract new projects, jobs, and investment.”

Once sunsetted, applicants for Section 211 transmission services will no longer be bound by this notice requirement.
These requirements are set forth in Section 36.1(b)(2) of FERC’s regulations and are not changing.
§ 366.7 – EWG and FUCO Filings Section 366.7 of FERC’s regulations outlines procedures for obtaining EWG or FUCO status.
913 provides a measure of “regulatory housekeeping,” removing certain obsolete or duplicative provisions and seeking to make the regulations more consistent with current FERC practice.","In short, not much.

On October 1, 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) issued Order No. 913 (the “Order”) as a Direct Final Rule implementing Executive Order 14270, “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy.”

The Order targets 53 outdated, “seldomly used,” or duplicative regulations, inserting conditional sunset provisions that will phase them out one year after the rule’s effective date—unless FERC extends the deadline by up to five years after soliciting and considering public comments on the costs and benefits of the regulations. The Order takes effect 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Two changes in particular apply to (1) certain transmission service applicants and (2) entities seeking to self-certify their exempt wholesale generator (“EWG”) or foreign utility company (“FUCO”) status. These changes will not impact any substantive requirements for these entities but will slightly relax the filing process by eliminating language regarding providing a form of notice of such filings.

18 C.F.R. § 36.1(b)(1) – Transmission Service Application Notices

Section 36.1(b)(1) of FERC’s regulations currently requires an applicant seeking transmission service under Section 211 of the Federal Power Act to include with its application a form of notice of the application suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the requirements of Section 385.203(d) of FERC’s regulations. That section, in turn, requires a “draft notice in accordance with the form of notice specifications prescribed by the Secretary and posted on the Commission’s website under Filing Procedures.”

Change:

This subsection will automatically sunset one year after the effective date of the Order unless extended. Once sunsetted, applicants for Section 211 transmission services will no longer be bound by this notice requirement.

Impact:

Applications under Section 211 require a notice containing information about the transmission service requested and the facilities involved be provided to the parties potentially affected by the request, such as the transmission facilities owner, the relevant ISO/RTO, the interconnecting utility, and the state’s public utility commission. These requirements are set forth in Section 36.1(b)(2) of FERC’s regulations and are not changing. However, eliminating the form of notice requirement under Section 36.1(b)(1) will streamline the application process and relieve the filers from the requirement to follow an older notice format.

18 C.F.R. § 366.7 – EWG and FUCO Filings

Section 366.7 of FERC’s regulations outlines procedures for obtaining EWG or FUCO status. Similarly to Section 36.1(b), Sections 366.7(a) and (b) require entities seeking to obtain EWG or FUCO status – either through a notice of self-certification or a petition for a declaratory order – to include a form of notice suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the specifications of Section 385.203(d) of FERC’s regulations.

Change:

These mandatory Federal Register form of notice provisions in Sections 366.7(a) and (b) will automatically sunset one year after the effective date of the rule unless extended.

Impact:

This change has limited practical significance. FERC previously provided guidance that, at least in connection with a notice of self-certification of EWG or FUCO status, a form of notice is no longer required, stating that “[a]lthough the Commission’s regulations specify that a notice of self-certification should include a form of notice of the filing suitable for publication in the Federal Register, 18 C.F.R. § 366.7(a), it is no longer necessary to submit this form of notice.” However, removing this requirement from the regulations will align them with FERC’s current practice and will reduce confusion among filers.

Bottom Line:

A response to a broader deregulatory push by the current administration to reduce unnecessary compliance burdens, Order No. 913 provides a measure of “regulatory housekeeping,” removing certain obsolete or duplicative provisions and seeking to make the regulations more consistent with current FERC practice. With respect to Section 211 transmission service requests and EWG and FUCO filings, the Order does not change any of the substantive requirements for such filings, but removes the form of notice requirement from FERC’s regulations, thus simplifying and modernizing the regulations and, perhaps in some cases, streamlining the filing process.

,Congress,2025-10-09 16:41:35+00:00,Yale News,Yale brings climate solutions to the global stage at Climate Week - YaleNews,Madeleine Simon,,,,,https://news.yale.edu/2025/10/09/yale-brings-climate-solutions-global-stage-climate-week,"“The conversations we convene at Climate Week move ideas faster — from lab to market, from imagination to action,” said Julie Zimmerman, vice provost for planetary solutions.
“Yale Planetary Solutions is helping connect disciplines and partners so that the solutions we need most are developed, tested, and scaled in time to make a difference.” During Climate Week NYC, Yale alumni and community members also made their mark beyond The Yale Club.
In a private session during Climate Week, Yale experts also worked directly with the three winners, offering coaching from YPS, Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale (Tsai CITY) , the Yale Center for Business and the Environment, and Yale School of the Environment.
Beyond Yale at Climate Week For Yale, Climate Week represented one integral element of a broader initiative focused on building scalable solutions to planetary challenges.
By bringing together expertise from across disciplines and professions, Yale is helping shape the collaborative frameworks that lasting climate solutions demand, said Sara Smiley Smith, the assistant provost for planetary solutions.","Hundreds of Yale scholars, students, and alumni joined policymakers, business leaders, artists, and researchers from around the country and world last month for Yale at Climate Week, the university’s second annual summit in New York City convening diverse voices to shape scalable solutions to climate challenges.

During a two-day event (Sept. 24-25), the Yale Club of New York City was transformed into a hub of action and collaboration during Climate Week NYC, the largest climate event of its kind. Over more than 20 sessions, Yale Planetary Solutions (YPS) – the university’s campuswide initiative uniting leaders across disciplines to catalyze solutions to the greatest threats facing people and planet – brought together changemakers from across the political spectrum and society to participate in events that spanned law, economics, engineering, medicine, public health, policy, and the humanities.

“For a few days every fall, thousands come from across the country and around the globe to discuss, debate, and drive real progress toward a sustainable future. And Yale is proud to be part of it,” Yale President Maurie McInnis said during her opening remarks. “We know the national climate conversation can feel divided. But even as conversations change, our shared goals remain the same: healthier communities; stronger economies; a better world for our children. That’s the common ground upon which we can build a sustainable future.”

A bipartisan commitment to progress

The call for common ground framed the conversation over the next two days. The summit’s opening night featured a bipartisan panel of current and former members of Congress on “Rebuilding Bipartisanship in the U.S. Environmental Movement.”

Anthony Leiserowitz, the JoshAni-TomKat Professor of Climate Communication at Yale School of the Environment and director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, led a conversation with U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman ’01 M.F., an Arkansas Republican, former U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, and former U.S. representatives Carlos Curbelo (a Florida Republican) and Stephanie Murphy (a Florida Democrat), about the opportunity for bipartisan cooperation in enacting enduring climate policies.

Westerman, who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources (and says he’s the only forester in the current Congress), discussed forest management as one such example.

“A healthy forest has benefits for everyone,” he said. “You can clean air; you can clean water; you get better wildlife habitat; you get better recreation opportunities. I often tell people there are no downsides to having a healthy forest.”

Building a bipartisan initiative to support healthy forests, he added, can serve as a model for cooperation in other critical areas.

Leiserowitz also noted data showing broad consensus among Americans on various climate solutions, including support for investing in clean energy research, helping farmers store carbon in soils, implementing a carbon-based tax on imports, and expanding tree planting initiatives. Panelists agreed that environmental challenges — from extreme weather to air and water pollution — are affecting communities nationwide, creating shared incentives for action.

“My hope is that representatives see that this isn’t a geographic issue. It’s happening within red states and blue states,” said Murphy. “My hope is that it lights a fire under us to actually do something about it because we feel it in local communities.”

Climate action, the panelists stressed, cannot be the domain of one party or one discipline — a consistent theme that other panelists, attendees, and members of the Yale community returned to over the course of the Yale Club events.

Turning research into real-world impact

From rethinking decarbonization strategies to examining how climate change affects human health and psychology, sessions showcased how Yale research is driving change across industries.

Led by the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture (YCNCC), panelists described how Yale scientists are teaming up with companies that buy carbon credits to ensure the projects they support provide research-quality data that helps strengthen development across industries. Scientists can analyze insights from these real-world deployments to better understand what works and how to scale carbon removal projects, bridging a major gap between industry and research.

Another session highlighted Yale’s Map of Life platform, developed by the Yale Center for Biodiversity and Global Change and Yale Ventures, which translates complex biodiversity and climate data into actionable insights for industry leaders. In “Imagining a Healthier Planet,” artists and public health experts explored how creative outlets like visual art and music can improve physical and psychological well-being and inspire action in ways that policy alone cannot.

Confronting challenges, charting new paths

Panels also took an unflinching look at what’s working — and what isn’t — In today’s policies, practices, and emerging technologies, spotlighting both obstacles and opportunities for climate progress.

Another session, “The Bad Science Behind Biofuels — and How to Fix the Climate Food Crisis,” unpacked how biofuel policies have reshaped land use, food security, and emissions, and pointed to reforms for a more sustainable and equitable future. Down the hall, Daniel Esty, the Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law and Policy and director of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy, joined panelists representing industry, academia, energy systems, climate justice, and policy to debate how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to accelerate climate innovation, while addressing the risks it poses on local communities and sustainable development.

And at “Resilient Cities, Reimagining Health,” Yale researchers and partners across industry and government released a landmark report showing how rising temperatures and extreme weather patterns are changing public health needs and outlining practical steps cities can take to reduce costs, cut emissions, increase access to health care, and strengthen local economies.

Preparing the next generation

Much of the focus of the summit was on preparing the next generation to lead the climate transition. Students and alumni packed into career panels where industry leaders, policy professionals, and entrepreneurs offered candid advice on navigating their careers. In panels like “How can Industry and Academia Work Together to Solve Planetary Challenges?” Yale scholars and leaders from across sectors amplified the important collaboration between universities’ deep research enterprise and industry’s capacity to implement ambitious innovations.

“The conversations we convene at Climate Week move ideas faster — from lab to market, from imagination to action,” said Julie Zimmerman, vice provost for planetary solutions. “Yale Planetary Solutions is helping connect disciplines and partners so that the solutions we need most are developed, tested, and scaled in time to make a difference.”

During Climate Week NYC, Yale alumni and community members also made their mark beyond The Yale Club. Jinali Mody ’23 M.E.M. was named one of three entrepreneurs to win a 2025 Young Champions of the Earth award from the UN Environment Programme and American cleantech CEO Chris Kemper for her company Banofi Leather, which turns banana crop waste into a plant-based alternative to animal leather.

Award recipients will receive seed funding, mentoring, communications support, and a global platform to showcase and scale their solutions. Winners also received a $20,000 prize during Climate Week NYC and competed in the first-ever Planet A pitch competition for a business growth grant of $100,000 and a possible seed investment of $1 million committed to a future fundraising round. Kemper, founder and CEO of the U.S. climate tech company Palmetto, this year co-founded Planet A, a YouTube channel that drives environmental awareness and action.

In a private session during Climate Week, Yale experts also worked directly with the three winners, offering coaching from YPS, Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale (Tsai CITY) , the Yale Center for Business and the Environment, and Yale School of the Environment.

Beyond Yale at Climate Week

For Yale, Climate Week represented one integral element of a broader initiative focused on building scalable solutions to planetary challenges. Earlier this week, the university hosted an event celebrating the opening of the Living Village at Yale Divinity School, a residential complex designed to give more back to the environment than it takes. A five-year report on the impact of Yale Planetary Solutions will be released later this semester; efforts are underway to gather feedback to inform the next round of institutional climate and sustainability planning and goal-setting for the university; and members of the Yale community will play a role in November’s UN Climate Change Conference in Belém, Pará, Brazil.

By bringing together expertise from across disciplines and professions, Yale is helping shape the collaborative frameworks that lasting climate solutions demand, said Sara Smiley Smith, the assistant provost for planetary solutions.

“It’s inspiring to amplify and celebrate the great work taking place across Yale’s campus and to help provide pathways to move ideas into action ever faster,” Smiley Smith said. “Each year we have thought about what more we can do to use our ‘Yale at Climate Week’ events to drive impact, and I’m excited by this year’s efforts to lean into collaborations with many different partners.

“We can do so much more when we seek these synergies and remain open and curious about new potentials for action.”",https://news.yale.edu/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph_image/public/2025-10/2025_09_24_16-12-35_R5B_4714-YN.jpg?h=03155992&itok=qyHto4pf,N,,2025-10-09 13:08:36.519885

Climate change ‘signal’ Pielke told E&E News that the IPCC has traditionally “played it pretty straight” when it comes to establishing links between climate change and extreme weather.

Pielke has for years argued that climate activists exaggerate the IPCC’s findings on the links between climate change and long-term trends in extreme weather.","Critics of mainstream climate science and allies of the fossil fuel industry are taking aim at a prominent expert who’s helping coordinate the next United Nations review of global climate research, arguing that her work aims to bolster multibillion-dollar lawsuits against oil and gas companies.

In an August New York Post op-ed, Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, raised concerns about the appointment of Friederike Otto as a coordinating lead author for the seventh assessment report of the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The criticism is aimed at extreme weather attribution, a popular field of research that studies whether and to what degree human-caused global warming has made an extreme weather event, such as a heat wave or heavy rain, more severe or likely to occur. Otto co-founded World Weather Attribution, which develops analyses showing climate’s role in extreme weather events.

Attribution science has been cited in congressional hearings and included in legislation to highlight the links between extreme weather events and climate change. The findings have also been included in lawsuits that seek to hold fossil fuel producers liable for the costs of dealing with climate change — and have drawn the scrutiny of the Trump administration.

Pielke said that Otto’s inclusion in the IPCC report could harm the international scientific body’s reputation.

By putting Otto — a climate science professor at Imperial College London — and her “fellow travelers in charge of the IPCC’s chapter on extreme events,” he wrote, “the IPCC is signaling that media hits, climate litigation, and energy advocacy trump rigorous science.”

Energy in Depth (EID), the advocacy arm of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, amplified Pielke’s call last week, saying Otto’s involvement raises concern the IPCC’s “traditionally neutral assessments could be hijacked by climate litigation supporters.”

Otto said Pielke’s argument that event attribution was inspired by litigation against the oil industry drew on comments he’d taken out of context. She told POLITICO’s E&E News that Pielke was referring to a comment she made about a 2003 paper by Myles Allen, a climate expert at Oxford University, that raised the idea of suing polluters for damages related to global warming. But it “obviously doesn’t mean that everything subsequently has been done for litigation,” Otto said.

“As an author on IPCC, I will be assessing peer-reviewed science,” she added. “And there are many, many peer-reviewed studies that show how climate change has affected extreme weather events.”

The criticism comes as the Trump administration is working to discredit established climate science, in part by producing its own reports that mainstream climate researchers say cherry-pick studies to provide an incomplete picture of how the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities are warming the planet.

A task force whose members were selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright took aim at the IPCC in a July report that has been criticized by climate scientists as disinformation. Some researchers said their work was misrepresented in the report.

The DOE report argued that the world is on track for less warming than the IPCC’s worst-case scenarios predicted and that its “studies have led the public to believe that climate change is more harmful than it actually is.”

The IPCC’s worst-case scenario assumes world leaders will take no additional steps to address climate change in the coming decade, leading to as much as 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming by the end of the century. While this scenario is unlikely to occur, the latest IPCC report said rising temperatures are already having catastrophic effects.

The IPCC publishes its report every five to seven years, providing a foundational assessment of the latest climate science by hundreds of experts who evaluate thousands of research papers.

Otto will co-coordinate the chapter on changes in regional climate and extreme weather.

Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group that has supported climate litigation, called the criticism against Otto a “deliberate mischaracterization” of her research and the broader IPCC undertaking.

“This is not a process that individual scientists hijack and use for their own purposes,” Cleetus said.

The IPCC does not conduct new research. It relies on hundreds of scientists to synthesize thousands of peer-reviewed studies, and its work is based on consensus so that no single author controls the process. The IPCC also has no role in determining whether the science it assesses is used in lawsuits, Cleetus said.

“But it is a very, very important way in which the world, the public, policymakers, can understand what the latest state of the climate science is,” Cleetus said of the IPCC assessments. “And there’s a whole industry of people, many of them with fossil fuel ties, who are trying to deny those scientific realities.”

The fossil fuel industry and the Trump administration have recently escalated efforts to quash a raft of climate litigation that could leave oil companies on the hook for billions. Since 2017, more than three dozen lawsuits have been filed by cities, counties, states and tribes accusing the oil and gas industry of knowing about the dangers of burning fossil fuels — but failing to warn the public.

The Trump administration has taken two states to court in an effort to prevent them from filing climate liability lawsuits and has asked the Supreme Court for relief.

Otto’s extreme event attribution work has been cited in a number of the climate lawsuits against the oil industry, EID noted. That includes a $51 billion lawsuit filed by Multnomah County, Oregon, accusing Exxon Mobil, the American Petroleum Institute and hundreds of other defendants of contributing to a deadly 2021 heat wave.

“Placing an advocate of litigation-driven science at the helm of the IPCC’s extreme weather chapter risks turning the world’s most trusted climate referee into an arm of climate litigation,” EID wrote last week.

EID, which frequently critiques climate litigation efforts by governments and tracks groups that support those efforts, has long questioned attribution science as politically motivated, arguing that the authors of studies aren’t impartial scientists but climate activists who are biased against the fossil fuel industry.

‘Nothing to do with litigation’

Jakob Zscheischler, an earth system scientist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany and an author of the upcoming chapter with Otto, said he had “absolutely no concerns” about her appointment as a coordinating lead author or the legitimacy of extreme event attribution.

“It helps us [disentangle] which aspects of specific types of extreme weather events are changed by anthropogenic climate change and which aspects are not, with a level of detail that was not possible before,” Zscheischler said in an email.

He and Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, noted that the impact of a single author on the IPCC is limited by having other lead authors on the same chapter and several rounds of external reviews.

Dessler said there is a cadre of critics ready to dispute the connection between extreme events and climate change — even in a report that is still years away from release. The IPCC has not yet confirmed a timeline for the seventh assessment, but it’s expected to be completed around 2029.

The IPCC defended the author selection process, pointing to a fact sheet that says lead authors are nominated by experts, IPCC member governments and observer organizations.

A “balanced assessment of the full range of scientific views, protected from the influence of special interests, is supported through the method of author team selection, multiple rounds of review of each report” and the group’s conflict of interest policy, the IPCC added.

The IPCC reports are organized in three working groups, and each group has a series of chapters. Otto will serve as one of three coordinating lead authors for Chapter 3 of Working Group I on current climate impacts on a regional scale. That includes extreme weather events.

Otto said coordinating authors are expected to make sure the chapter is delivered according to the outline agreed to by global governments, adding that her work with the IPCC has “absolutely nothing to do with litigation.”

The correlation between individual weather events and rising temperatures has been used in some climate liability lawsuits, Otto noted. But she said her critics have sought to combine various statements she has made over the past 10 years and used them out of context.

Otto was previously an author on part of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report published in 2021 and the accompanying synthesis report published in 2023.

Climate change ‘signal’

Pielke told E&E News that the IPCC has traditionally “played it pretty straight” when it comes to establishing links between climate change and extreme weather. But he said extreme event attribution is a departure from the IPCC’s traditional framework for detection and attribution.

That approach refers to the influence of global warming on long-term, large-scale trends in weather or other climate impacts, rather than individual weather events. It’s a strategy that predates extreme weather event attribution and is separate from that field.

Pielke has for years argued that climate activists exaggerate the IPCC’s findings on the links between climate change and long-term trends in extreme weather. And in his recent op-ed, he argued that extreme event attribution is “a cottage industry of promotional studies” designed to replace the IPCC’s conventional methods.

But most climate scientists say extreme event attribution complements — and agrees with — long-term detection and attribution studies. In its most recent assessment report, the IPCC’s chapter on extreme events found that climate change has influenced a variety of weather events.

Pielke, alongside other researchers who are skeptical of mainstream climate science, has in the past sought to back up his claims with an IPCC chart that indicates many forms of extreme weather have no “emergence of a signal” linking them to climate change. It’s an argument the DOE’s climate report used as well.

Many climate scientists say that’s a misleading argument. They have noted that an emerging signal refers to a specific kind of statistical pattern in extreme weather — a trend that has grown so large that it has moved outside the range of being possible without climate change. The absence of this signal doesn’t mean that events aren’t worsening or that climate change isn’t influencing them, researchers say.

‘Fundamental science’

World Weather Attribution was founded to provide scientific evidence in the aftermath of an extreme weather event, Otto said, adding that the methodology it uses and many of its studies have been peer reviewed.

“The numbers have never changed through the peer-review process,” Otto said. “Everything we do is super transparent, so all the data is freely available. It is very fundamental science.”

World Weather Attribution publishes papers that show climate change does play a role in extreme weather events — but also that it sometimes does not play a role, or that the data isn’t conclusive, Otto said.

“The aim with World Weather Attribution is to understand how climate change impacts people today, and that is what we do,” she added.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2f/f7/6ad58657419e9b24d97ca805b27c/4cb79544afec4b96b0574f2fca668c32.jpeg,N,,2025-10-09 15:04:28.247523

In September, the Trump administration released a memo that lays out its federal R&D priorities for fiscal year 2027. Although it will not directly influence federal spending, it outlines the administration’s science goals, which include boosting economic growth, strengthening national security, and promoting US leadership in key technology areas.

The memo is authored by Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Michael Kratsios, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. They criticize years of “unfocused Federal investments weighed down by woke ideology and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives”—a stark contrast to a memo, also with Vought as coauthor and published during the first Trump administration, that called for federal agencies to prioritize “activities that advance innovation in STEM education and increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM.”

Key R&D priorities outlined by Vought and Kratsios include advancing critical and emerging technologies, such as AI, quantum science, semiconductors, and advanced manufacturing. They emphasize achieving “American energy dominance” through support for fossil fuels, nuclear technologies, geothermal energy, and hydropower. They also call for increased private-sector involvement in later-stage energy R&D while maintaining federal support for foundational research infrastructure.

National and economic security are also central themes, for which Vought and Kratsios urge support for increased military capabilities, strengthened cybersecurity capabilities, and President Trump’s Golden Dome missile defense system. They also prioritize safeguarding US health and biotechnology by focusing on the most urgent health challenges, boosting biosafety, and building domestic biomanufacturing capabilities.

Maintaining global space leadership is another priority. The authors express support for crewed missions to the Moon and Mars and for basic and applied research into such areas as novel sensing modalities and radiation-belt remediation.

Vought and Kratsios urge agencies to “prioritize research and associated research infrastructure investments that enhance America’s ability to observe, understand, and predict the physical, biological, geologic, and socioeconomic processes and interacting systems of the Arctic to protect and advance American interests and ensure prosperity of America’s Arctic residents.”

Scientific societies protest grant-making executive order

More than 50 scientific and medical organizations are urging Congress to block key elements of the grant-making executive order (EO) that President Trump issued in August (see the October 2025 FYI science policy brief “Trump gives political appointees final say on grants”). The groups argue that the order will increase politicization of federally funded research and add inefficiencies to the grant-making process. “The EO does not advance the Administration’s goal of implementing Gold Standard Science,” reads their 24 September letter. (Several member societies of the American Institute of Physics, which publishes Physics Today, signed the letter.)

The EO requires agencies to launch new grant-review processes that are overseen by political appointees. In their letter, the groups say that such processes will slow down the awarding of grants and increase the administrative burden on researchers.

The signatories “urge Congress to ensure that independent peer review remains the cornerstone of the scientific grantmaking process, such that the most meritorious proposals are funded in this and all future administrations.” Trump’s order states that agencies may use peer-review methods for grant making on an advisory basis but places ultimate decision authority in the hands of political appointees. But, the organizations write, “shifting final authority to political appointees will significantly undermine the grant review and award system and could distort federal research priorities based on ideological or partisan agendas, stifle innovation, and erode public confidence in research.”

The organizations also ask Congress to reject the EO’s requirement that science agencies permit “termination for convenience” for all grants. The groups warn of a “chilling effect” on any research that could be perceived as controversial. In its efforts to reduce federal research spending, the Trump administration appears to have found it easier to void grants and contracts with termination-for-convenience clauses than those without them. The administration has cited misalignment with agency priorities as the reason for terminating thousands of grants without those clauses.",https://aipp.silverchair-cdn.com/aipp/content_public/cms/online/44822/fyi-logo.jpg?Expires=2147483647&Signature=ASWS7JjAkwjzqED-m5Wm-9a3tEFNnP32cL-z8IsFEqx5kbAiT5DcF8-wBtr6qG0WsA8qXVXKKsUbRcJPutupPZ3LlLfsLIJLiiwIEzoCbKXfIG~cdfIFHO56fIBM9U4vmzqL88tT~bW7NVsgO~l2GT~4zjh4tJYH6vnsTvdOE9-ZXzUUKOIH2Pm5Fe5w1YleFTZZKz7RLXWPhqcPEk1~GN0qJR44iN20Ryu19lmnSb-jV0uBM3Aa7tjf9xKC00NxgqZgztztIkMSfwNyOJOWXf-I1y1eUV9cJpHKbeMb6M6ZkSdXycCU8PvL508-rQksM2N2lvFFH1iDwg591mPVmQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA,N,,2025-10-09 15:05:46.134144

This week, I was honored to accept the Battery Innovation of the Year award on behalf of General Motors. This award, given at the 15th annual Battery Show North America in Detroit, recognizes groundbreaking advancement in battery technology. GM and LG Energy Solution were named this year’s winner in recognition of our pioneering work on lithium-manganese-rich battery cells, or LMR.

I’ve been in the battery business for more than 30 years. It’s remarkable to see how far we’ve come. What’s even more important, though, is the opportunity to innovate, to advance our technology and our industry into the next era.

At General Motors, we’re building state-of-the-art facilities, deep technical expertise, and world-class technology. GM’s vehicles aren’t just competitive in the EV landscape; they’re helping lead the way. We have some of the fastest-charging, longest-range EV trucks in the market – the 2026 Chevrolet Silverado EV Max Range Work Truck delivers an EPA-estimated 493 miles of range on a full charge1 – and the Chevy Equinox EV, the most affordable EV on the U.S. market with more than 315 miles of driving range2. We’re expanding our leadership in affordable EVs with the return of the Chevy Bolt in 2027, and in the luxury EV market, Cadillac was the number one brand by sales in Q3 of this year. GM is now number two in EV market share, doubling since last year, and nearly twice as big as our nearest competitor. Q3 was our best quarter ever for EV sales.

What’s Next

The global EV market is growing, and foreign countries and companies are investing heavily in this space. At the same time, the U.S. policy and regulatory environment is shifting. Amid all this change, GM remains focused on our North Star: Building a profitable EV future.

To get there, my team and I spend every day focused on three clear goals: Driving down battery costs, improving battery performance, and building an independent battery supply chain rooted in North America. These aren’t just technical goals – they’re strategic imperatives to position GM to lead in innovation, resilience, and competitiveness.

Innovation in Michigan

We’re building an electrification powerhouse at GM. We’ve got world-class R&D facilities and some of the best engineers in the business, all focused on our zero-emission vision.

It starts in Warren, Michigan, where we research, test, and prototype the future of battery technology. Right down the road, at our Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, we’re prototyping the next generation of battery cell and pushing the boundaries of energy density, performance, and manufacturability. Next door to Wallace, we’re building our new Battery Cell Development Center, where we’ll refine and validate new cell concepts, enabling our manufacturing partners to scale up production faster and deliver high-quality cells right here in the U.S.

Beyond our labs and prototyping facilities, GM has one of the most advanced computational and virtual engineering capabilities in the industry. We can model changes in battery chemistry and near-instantly understand the impact on safety, performance, and cost. What used to take months to validate, we can now accomplish in days. These AI tools allow us to accelerate material validation, confirm battery performance, and fast-track the development of a U.S.-based supplier network. All of this work is happening right here in our Michigan labs, where digital meets physical to drive real-world innovation.

Next-generation chemistry

Battery cell chemistry is a critical aspect of battery innovation, and GM is helping lead here, too. We’re adopting flexible chemistries to strike the right balance of range, performance, and affordability. That’s why I’m incredibly excited about our upcoming commercialization of LMR in partnership with LG Energy Solutions.

LMR is a game-changing chemistry, unlocking premium range and performance at a more affordable cost. We’ve been working on LMR for over a decade, and we aim to be the first automaker to deploy it in 2028. It’s a perfect example of how our battery strategy is coming to life: Lowering costs, improving performance, and localizing our supply chain. This isn’t just an incremental improvement – it’s the kind of chemistry innovation that makes electrification more accessible.

At GM, we launched our EV platform with flexibility and scale in mind. We use a common cell and module architecture across more than a dozen EVs, allowing us to achieve economies of scale that drive down battery costs. With high-nickel chemistries providing maximum performance and long-distance driving, LFP delivering affordability and durability at the entry-level, and LMR offering premium performance at a low cost, we can choose the right chemistry for the right vehicle, building an EV portfolio that meets the needs of every customer.

Batteries beyond EVs

Batteries can do incredible things far beyond EVs. GM battery packs help power the largest second-life battery development in the world, a microgrid built by Redwood Materials in Sparks, Nevada, supporting the AI infrastructure company Crusoe. And our EVs can help support the energy grid in real time. In California, we’re working with utilities like PG&E to pilot vehicle-to-grid technology, where energy stored in EV batteries can be sent to the grid during peak demand, reducing grid stress and stabilizing the system with distributed energy.

Competing globally in EVs means building more than just great vehicles. We need to build the industry infrastructure – securing the materials, technologies, and manufacturing capacity behind the battery systems that power every one of our EVs. That’s why we’re moving quickly to localize our battery supply chain, establishing U.S.-based manufacturing for battery cells. And we’re working to bring production of critical minerals like lithium, manganese, nickel and graphite, closer to home. By 2028, we aim to increase the North American content of our battery supply chain by a factor of eight.

In my career, I’ve learned that battery innovation rarely comes down to a single breakthrough. Rather, it’s the result of steady, deliberate progress across every aspect of the value chain. This week’s recognition of our decade-long work on LMR exemplifies this dynamic. By advancing our battery technology, driving innovation, and onshoring our supply chain, we’re building a stronger, more resilient U.S. battery industry.

Moreno told Reuters in an interview he was happy with GM’s decision to scrap the EV tax-credit plan.
GM officials had caught wind of a similar program that Ford was putting in place for its dealers, the sources said.
Auto executives, dealers and analysts have said they expect EV sales to plummet in the wake of the tax credit’s disappearance.","GENERAL Motors is scrapping a program aimed at allowing its dealers to continue offering a $7,500 tax credit for several months on electric-vehicle leases following the Sept. 30 expiration of the federal subsidy, the company said on Wednesday.

Toward the end of last month, GM devised a plan to have its in-house lending arm initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The company planned to apply for the federal $7,500 credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers through the end of the year.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday, declining to elaborate on the reason for its decision.

Moreno told Reuters in an interview he was happy with GM’s decision to scrap the EV tax-credit plan. “The EV subsidies ended September 30, and I’m happy that every car company” is going to abide by that. “I look forward to working with GM,” he said. “We’re putting a lot of policies in place to protect our domestic auto industry.”

The idea behind the program was to ease the impact of the expiration of the tax credit on dealers, who worried they would be stuck with EVs that would be tough to sell. GM had planned to apply for the credit on tens of thousands of EVs in dealer stocks, according to people familiar with the plan.

Ford rolled out a similar program ahead of the tax-credit expiration. It is unclear if Ford is continuing its program. A spokesperson declined to comment.

GM had planned to claim the credit on roughly 20,000 EVs that were on dealership lots or being shipped to stores, people familiar with the matter said. Its finance arm, GM Financial, began making down payments on those vehicles before the deadline to qualify for the subsidy on each of those cars, the sources said.

In its statement on Wednesday, the company said it would “fund the incentive lease terms” through the end of October.

The formula for determining the down payments that GM Financial paid to dealers on those EVs was 5 percent of the maximum price for each car. For example, GM Financial would have made a down payment of about $6,300 for two Chevrolet Blazer EVs, which top out in the mid-$60,000s, according to documents GM provided to dealers outlining the terms.

GM scrambled to put together the program just a few days before the Sept. 30 tax-credit expiration, and outlined the details on a call with dealers on Sept. 29, three sources said.

GM officials had caught wind of a similar program that Ford was putting in place for its dealers, the sources said.

Commonwealth LNG has requested a four-year extension to finish construction and bring into service an export facility in Cameron Parish, citing circumstances beyond its control that include regulatory delays during the Biden Administration and legal challenges by environmental groups, according to the company’s filing at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

In November 2022, the five-member commission voted unanimously to give final approval to Commonwealth to build and operate a 9.5 million-tons-per-year LNG export facility on the west side of the Calcasieu Ship Channel, the company said in the petition for an extension.

Although approved by FERC to operate the LNG export facility in 2022, Commonwealth said it experienced “historic, unprecedented delays” during the Biden presidency for Department of Energy approval that would allow it to sell gas to companies that do not have a free trade agreement with the United States. Commonwealth’s application to trade with countries with no free trade agreement remained pending with DOE for far longer than any other U.S. LNG terminal developer, the company said in the filing

In October 2019, Commonwealth received Department of Energy approval to trade with countries that have free trade agreements with the United States, the company said in the filing. It was not until February 2025 that the export facility received Department of Energy approval to trade with countries without free trade agreements with the United States.

“This conditional authorization from the Department of Energy is a major step toward restoring U.S. regulatory certainty and marks a return to regular order in LNG project approvals,” Charlie Riedl, executive director of the Center for LNG, said when the free trade agreement was approved.

Additionally, Commonwealth said its application was subsumed under DOE’s formal pause in reviewing export applications while it updated its economic and environmental analyses, the company said in the extension request.

Commonwealth cited legal challenges as one of the reasons “good cause” exists for the proposed extension.

For acquisitions, Dominion said it is seeking “non-residential rooftop and carport solar projects, including mechanically complete projects, specifically on commercial, industrial, and government-owned structures. The company is particularly seeking rooftop and carport solar projects in Virginia’s urban centers to reduce the load on the electric grid.”

For PPAs, Dominion seeks “both utility-scale projects that are greater than 3 MW, as well as distributed projects that are 3 MW or less” which are located in Virginia or North Carolina. “For distributed projects that are 3 MW or less, the facilities must be located within [Dominion Energy Virginia or [Dominion Energy North Carolina] service territory where there are location grid benefits to Dominion Energy customers.”

“The company also encourages the submission of PPAs from solar, onshore wind and energy storage projects on previously developed sites, such as former landfills or industrial uses,” Dominion said.

Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said the company is seeking these PPAs as part of its “‘all of the above’ strategy to serve growing power demand in Virginia.”

According to sources, the reversal follows concerns raised by Ohio's Republican Senator Bernie Moreno.

General Motors (GM) has reversed its decision to pursue a scheme that would have enabled its dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on leases of electric vehicles (EVs).

The move after the scheduled end of the federal subsidy on 30 September, reported Reuters, citing sources.

According to sources, the reversal follows concerns raised by Ohio's Republican Senator Bernie Moreno, who has a background in car dealership and is involved in automotive policy discussions.

GM initially proposed a plan in which its financing division, GM Financial, would purchase EVs from dealer inventories to qualify for the federal tax credit.

The credit would then be incorporated into lease agreements for customers until the end of the year.

However, aEURoeafter further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,aEUR GM told the news agency, without providing further details.

Senator Moreno expressed in an interview with Reuters that aEURoehe was happy with GM's decision to scrap the EV tax-credit plan.aEUR

Moreno said: aEURoeI look forward to working with GM. We're putting a lot of policies in place to protect our domestic auto industry.aEUR

The programme was designed to mitigate the impact of the tax credit's expiration on dealers, who feared difficulty in selling EVs without the incentive.

Sources said that GM had intended to claim the credit on approximately 20,000 EVs that were either in dealership lots or en route to stores.

GM Financial had even started making down payments on these vehicles prior to the deadline to secure the subsidy for each car, sourced added.

The news agency said that down payments made by GM Financial to dealers for the EVs were calculated at 5% of each vehicle's maximum price.

The plan was hastily assembled just days before the tax credit was set to expire, with GM outlining the details to dealers on a call on 29 September.

Last month, GM announced that it would be scaling back production at one of its key EV manufacturing plants, a move attributed to reduced federal support for EVs during the tenure of former US President Donald Trump.

The document, circulated on Capitol Hill, was first reported by The Detroit News and reportedly includes more than $800 million in Michigan projects. Other Michigan-based recipients on the list include Ford Motor Company and Dow Chemical Company.

The proposed cancellations come after Trump administration officials last week defended the decision to cancel federal projects in regions of the country that have voted for Democrats, insisting it was in an effort to reduce the size and scope of government during the ongoing shutdown of the federal government. Democrats, however, said the cancellations further eroded Congress’ constitutional authority over spending by unilaterally canceling funding that lawmakers approved on a bipartisan basis.

The U.S. Dept. of Energy said they are unable to verify the lists they’ve seen so far in the press.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” Press Secretary & Chief Spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement emailed to Michigan Advance. “As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration. Rest assured, the Department is hard at work to deliver on President Trump’s promise to restore affordable, reliable, and secure energy to the American people.”

The GM grant in Lansing has become a political flashpoint in Michigan. The plant currently builds Cadillac CT4 and CT5 sedans and previously assembled the Chevrolet Camaro. In awarding the grant, the Biden administration said transitioning the plant to EV production would preserve 650 jobs and create 50 new positions.

U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), whose district includes the plant, said he’s in contact with both GM and the administration.

“While no final decision has been made, my top priority will always be standing with the auto workers and ensuring tax dollars are spent effectively as we unwind the Biden EV mandates that tied the hands of our auto industry and stifled our manufacturing economy,” he said in a statement emailed to the Advance.

That sentiment is in line with other Republicans who have criticized the grants as benefiting foreign industries. At an October 2024 campaign event, then-vice presidential nominee JD Vance warned the money could help China’s auto sector.

“[W]hen we write massive checks on American taxpayer expense to these companies, a lot of times what we’re doing is selling American middle class jobs to the Communist Chinese, and we ought to be doing exactly the opposite,” Vance said.

GOP Senate candidate Mike Rogers also railed against the GM grant while campaigning last year against Democrat Elissa Slotkin.

“I think if the federal government’s going to spend money they ought to spend on something that builds, something that people want to buy,” Rogers said following a 2024 debate with Slotkin.

Slotkin, who defeated Rogers last November, slammed the proposal to cancel the grant.

Since 2000, US manufacturers have shed another 4.5 million jobs despite manufacturing employment growing worldwide by 71 million.","Introduction

The announcement of new tariffs this year has reignited the discussion of whether the United States can expand its manufacturing employment by millions of workers. Reversing decades of manufacturing job losses is one explicit goal of the new higher tariffs. This District Data Brief presents measures of employment and demographics as context around the current and potential employment in US manufacturing. Raising manufacturing employment by 4 to 6 million workers would constitute a large increase relative to current levels. However, an increase of this scale would not be large relative to the global growth of manufacturing employment in recent decades, the current US labor force size, or the number of US adults not engaged in high-paying work.

With different priorities and approaches, policymakers have spent much of the past decade addressing issues related to the loss or absence of manufacturing in the United States. For example, America’s dependence on imported manufactured goods was highlighted at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as supply chain disruptions led to shortages of medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, microchips, and other products. The CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act featured tax breaks and subsidies to expand US manufacturing capacity for semiconductors, electric vehicles, and renewable energy equipment.

At the same time, economists have been documenting the loss of work opportunities and earning power by workers without college degrees as manufacturing employment has declined. In 2013, David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson published a study that estimated the labor market impacts resulting from increased trade competition following China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization, an effect often referred to as the “China shock.” Dozens of studies have since used the regional variation in job and income losses caused by the China shock to measure the adverse impacts of job displacement on family structures, crime, health, and other social indicators. Some supporters of industrial subsidies and higher tariffs have expressed the hope that these dynamics can be put into reverse.

How Many Manufacturing Jobs Went Away and How Many Remain?

The discussion of whether reshoring is possible needs to begin with a basic question: How many workers would this include? In the United States today, approximately 12.8 million people work in manufacturing, representing 8.1 percent of all nonfarm payroll employment. As shown in Figure 1, manufacturing employment accounted for more than 30 percent of all nonfarm employment from 1939 until 1957, peaking at 38 percent during World War II. Manufacturing employment peaked in absolute numbers in 1979 at 19.4 million.

Figure 1. US Manufacturing Employment, 1939 to 2024

US manufacturing employment fluctuated around 17 million workers through the late 1990s and did not keep pace with population and labor force growth. Steep drops in factory jobs during the 2001 recession and the Great Recession were never fully reversed. From 1979 to 2025, employment in the United States grew by 68 million, while manufacturing employment fell by 6.6 million. During this period, manufacturing jobs for people without college degrees declined by roughly 7.9 million. However, these losses were partially offset by jobs created in the sector for workers with college degrees. These include workers at goods-producing firms that do engineering, design, marketing, and other professional work in the United States but contract out all their production overseas. Although roughly one-third of manufacturing jobs are currently filled by workers with college degrees, this District Data Brief focuses on workers without degrees because the production work that may be reshored holds much more opportunity for non-college graduates than for graduates.

A reindustrialization effort in the United States that added back all 6.6 million manufacturing jobs that were lost would represent a 52 percent increase over the current number of workers in the sector nationwide. In today’s much larger economy, manufacturing’s employment share would reach only 12.3 percent (compared to, for example, 22 percent in 1979) if all 6.6 million of these workers switched to manufacturing from other sectors. Getting manufacturing back up to its 1979 share of 22 percent would require increasing the sector’s employment to 34.7 million.

Is There Growth in Manufacturing Employment Globally?

A frequently cited challenge to substantively increasing manufacturing employment is that improved automation means that factories do not need as many people as they used to. However, it is also the case that population growth and economic development around the world have increased demand for manufactured products so that, on net, factory employment is up by 71 million globally since 2000. As shown in Figure 2, China has added just over 40 million people to its manufacturing workforce over this period, while India and Vietnam have added 9.2 million and 6.8 million, respectively. Currently, manufacturing employment in China is reported to be more than 85 million, six and a half times higher than that of the United States (see Figure A1). For context, the population of China is only four times higher than that of the United States.

Figure 2. Change in Manufacturing Employment, 2000 to 2022

When firms operate factories in high-wages countries, they have a financial incentive to invest in the best automation available to achieve enough production to cover the high wages of their workers. When factories are moved to low-wage countries, additional labor can be less expensive than additional machinery, so more workers are hired. In recent decades, firms have found it more profitable to either operate less-automated factories in low-wage countries or even combine automation with low-wage workers to realize additional cost savings. Governments can intervene through tariffs or subsidies to try to offset the cost advantages of low-wage production and motivate firms to place their factories in high-wage countries.

Since 2000, US manufacturing employment has declined by 4.5 million, equivalent to around 6 percent of net global growth of 71 million during the same period. However, if production had not been shifted away from the United States and other high-wage countries like the United Kingdom and Japan, global growth in manufacturing employment (represented by the green bars in Figure 2 and occurring almost entirely in low-wage countries) very likely would have been lower in this period. For example, manufacturing workers in the United States produce approximately three to four times as much per hour, measured by the value of the products when sold, as workers in low-wage countries. Assuming US manufacturing workers would have been assisted by additional productivity-enhancing equipment and produced as much as three or four of the low-wage workers, retaining 4.5 million workers in the United States during this period would have caused manufacturing employment growth to be 16 or 21 percent lower, respectively, in the rest of the world, though growth still would have been positive.

Where Are US Workers Facing Trade Competition?

Before identifying geographic regions within the United States where manufacturers might expand, we need to consider which types of products the United States is currently producing and which product markets are dominated by foreign producers. Linking trade data to regional employment data enables us to identify industry clusters that have more potential to expand employment by increasing their US market share. Table 1 shows the dollar value of imports and exports in the 30 product categories with the highest total flows (imports plus exports). In categories where imports are much higher than exports, such as apparel, foreign production has cost much less than US production for many years. On one hand, this means that US employment in that type of production is low and that regaining domestic markets would involve large increases in employment. On the other hand, growth opportunities in these subsectors are limited to domestic markets. It is unlikely that the United States would be able to export in these industries because tariffs would not close the gap in costs (especially labor costs) between US and foreign production. In categories where exports are much higher than imports, such as aircraft, US production is already competitive globally, and US producers already meet most domestic demand. Capturing additional domestic market share with tariffs in these industries would involve smaller proportional increases in employment relative to the US labor force that is presently supplying global markets.

Table 1. US Exports and Imports of Manufactured Goods, 2023

Table 2 presents estimated counts of manufacturing workers without college degrees, split by whether the United States is a net exporter or net importer in the product category. The counts are shown for major Fourth District metro areas and for metro areas across the nation with the highest populations of these workers. All other regions of the country are included in the aggregate categories. Not surprisingly, the metro areas with the largest populations, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, also have the largest number of workers without college degrees working in manufacturing and facing trade competition. As such, those metro areas stand to gain the most from expanded manufacturing employment. However, the large regions that still have high counts of workers in manufacturing tend to also have diversified economies, so manufacturing employment is usually a below-average (<6.5 percent) share of their total employment. This means any manufacturing gains would generally be less consequential in these regions than in smaller regions more reliant on the industry such as Cleveland and Cincinnati.

Longstanding economic literature has documented the countervailing forces of “agglomeration” and “dispersion” in manufacturing activity. The concept of agglomeration indicates that firms in a product category benefit from clustering in specific regions, using the same suppliers and infrastructure, and hiring skilled workers from competitors. On the other hand, the concept of dispersion indicates that there are cost savings from moving production out of congested areas to regions with inexpensive land and labor. The former suggests regions with existing production clusters would benefit more from manufacturing employment growth, while the latter suggests gains would be widely spread across low-cost regions. In Table 2, the number of production clusters is reported for each region, with a cluster defined as having 5,000 workers without college degrees in one product category. The specific clusters are listed by region and product category in Table A1. Because the major metro areas have larger scale, more of their factory categories have enough workers to be considered clusters. However, in the national aggregate, only 20 percent of manufacturing workers are in clusters, while most manufacturing production in the United States is dispersed.

Table 2. Locations of Manufacturing Workers Without College Degrees by Trade Competition and Clustering

Where Are Potential Factory Workers Geographically?

Having looked at where factory employment is located, and where it has expanded recently, we can turn attention to regional differences in the populations of potential factory workers, including the unemployed, workers with low earnings, and working-age adults not in the labor force. The US unemployment rate was near historical lows in the three years before the pandemic and has been near these lows in the three years since the pandemic ended. Considering only the approximately 7 million people currently unemployed, it would seem that manufacturers would have to hire a vast majority of them to reverse manufacturing’s declines. If manufacturers actually did hire most of the people looking for work, the labor market would tighten to an unsustainable degree. Alternatively, unemployed workers could be hired into factories in combination with new entrants to the labor force and workers hired away from other sectors. Which industries might experience declining employment shares—or absolute declines in employment—if manufacturers successfully attract workers to switch into their sector?

When workers are well compensated in other industries, this signals that they have in-demand skills, that they are adding value at least as high as their wages, and that manufacturers would need to outbid a high wage to recruit them. However, there are 10 million people across the United States who are employed but whose household income is still low (below 150 percent of the federal poverty line). Some portion of this population could be attracted into manufacturing positions if the wages offered were appreciably above their current wages and compensated them for any important differences in the work environment.

Additionally, there are 7.2 million working-age adults who are neither working nor looking for work, not in school, and whose household income is below 150 percent of the federal poverty line. With these low household incomes, it is unlikely that those working-age adults are out of the labor force because they are comfortably supported by a spouse or partner or by investment income. Rather, these are likely people who might be drawn into the labor market if new opportunities enable them to overcome barriers to employment such as affording reliable transportation and childcare.

Substantial numbers of these low-income workers and potential workers can be found in most regions of the United States. Table 4 lists estimates of the largest populations of these individuals nationally and in the Fourth District. The largest metro areas of the country by themselves have 4.7 million of these individuals, while there are another 1.1 million in the Fourth District and another 13.2 million in the remainder of the country. While some labor markets would tighten if a major expansion of manufacturing got underway, it appears that workers would likely be widely available in many areas. The location of establishments could be determined based on the nonlabor costs mentioned above (land, utilities, taxes, and regulation).

Table 4. Adults Without College Degrees in Low-Income Households, in and out of the Labor Force by Region

What Sectors Do Manufacturers Hire People Away From?

A large expansion of manufacturing employment would change the US economy along many dimensions, and it would be difficult to predict how wages would evolve in each sector. We can, however, observe the flows of people into and out of manufacturing in the recent past. Using the last five years of Current Population Survey data, I identify every worker without a college degree that reports entering or exiting the manufacturing sector. I then calculate the industry shares of those flows. Table 5 displays the flows by sector (flows by individual industry can be found in Table A1) along with the median wage of the workers when they are in the non-manufacturing positions. The largest flows are with the retail sector, particularly restaurants and bars, grocery stores, and department stores. The typical wages are substantially lower (approximately $17 per hour versus $20 in manufacturing), suggesting manufacturers should be able to draw workers out of the retail sector. Similarly, manufacturing may pull workers out of the agriculture and personal services sectors. By contrast, the construction and mining sectors appear to be paying wages that are as high or higher than wages in manufacturing. Construction provides the second-largest flow of people into manufacturing despite this frequently involving a step-down in wages. The red shading in Table 5 indicates that the median wages earned in the other industries were lower than the median wages earned in manufacturing by the transitioning workers.

Table 5. Worker Flows to and from Manufacturing by Sector

Where Do Young People Who Could Start Careers in Manufacturing Live?

The figures in the preceding sections reflect the population that could potentially join the manufacturing workforce at present, but investments in manufacturing facilities will likely be directed where firms can expect to hire workers over the next decade or longer. A recent update of the Autor, Dorn, and Hanson analysis showed that the transition away from manufacturing was fueled mostly by young people’s starting their careers in other sectors. Thus, reversing this trend by attracting recent high school graduates to manufacturing might be necessary to rebuild the manufacturing workforce. It is possible to observe where future workers—young people aged 10 to 18—live today, but some assumptions are needed to translate this into estimates of future worker numbers. Table 6 shows the counts of young people in various regions. In the third column, the count of young people without college degrees set to enter the labor force is calculated by multiplying the current youth counts by the ratio of non-degree-holding young workers (ages 20–28) in the region in 2023 to the count of young people (ages 10–18) in the region in 2013. This ratio reflects the share of these youth that remained in the region and did not complete college. To account for flows out of the labor force that occur along with inflows, the fourth column provides the count of non-degree-holding current workers aged 60 to 68, who are likely to retire in the next 10 years.

The major metro areas in which young workers without college degrees might outnumber retirees without college degrees in the next decade are mostly places that saw strong population growth in the early 2000s such as Seattle, Atlanta, Orlando, and Tampa. Although Fourth District metro areas including Cleveland, Dayton, Toledo, and Erie are seeing flat or declining populations, it still appears that the number of labor market entrants without college degrees will exceed the number of retirees without college degrees in these metro areas over the next decade.

Table 6. Estimates of Regional Changes in Non-Degree-Holding Workforce

Conclusion

Manufacturing employment in the United States fell by 2.1 million workers from 1979 to 2000. Since 2000, US manufacturers have shed another 4.5 million jobs despite manufacturing employment growing worldwide by 71 million. Given the current size of the US labor force, increasing manufacturing employment by 6.6 million would involve reallocating just under 4 percent of US workers.

Based on a combination of trade, employment, and demographic data, this District Data Brief uncovers a variety of patterns relevant to the evolution of the manufacturing sector. Most manufacturing employment is in categories where the United States imports more (by value) than it exports, so employment could grow if US producers gain domestic market share. Manufacturing production in the United States appears to be widely dispersed across many regions, but there are clusters of employment in the largest metro areas and in legacy manufacturing centers. Regions that have added manufacturing employment recently are mostly in the South and Mountain West. Metro areas that saw strong population growth 20 years ago, such as Atlanta and Las Vegas, have relatively large pools of young people who will be reaching working age soon. Alternatively, workers and working-age adults who are low-income and might be drawn to higher-paying opportunities in manufacturing are present in substantial numbers in most regions of the country. The relative importance of clustering versus finding the lowest-cost location—and having a growing labor force versus low labor costs—will determine which regions benefit most from any upcoming growth in manufacturing.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/-/media/project/clevelandfedtenant/clevelandfedsite/favicon/android-chrome-512x512.png?extension=webp,N,,2025-10-09 12:12:04.400516

The agency, in a federal filing, said in July it had “serious concerns” that facilities using coke ovens would not be able to quickly comply with the Biden-era rules. After hearing from industry groups, however, the agency reversed that stance, saying facilities would not “face significant immediate compliance challenges.”

Environmental advocates, including community organizations in Northwest Indiana, sued the EPA over its extension of deadlines. An attorney representing the groups called this new ruling good news.

“Communities living near these facilities waited many years for these rules to be finalized by the EPA in 2024 and putting them into action now is vital for reducing hazardous air pollution and protecting people living near these plants,” Haley Lewis, attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project, said in an Oct. 6 news release.

“We are tired of defending out fundamental right to breathe and live a health life in northwest Indiana,” Williams said. “(Just Transition) is relieved that EPA heard our rally cry and withdrew this dangerous proposal.”

“President Trump told Big Oil donors that if they cut a $1 billion check to his campaign, he’d give them everything they want on day one of his presidency.
“It turns out Trump himself is the energy emergency — energy prices are through the roof and hundreds of thousands of good-paying clean energy jobs are in serious jeopardy because of federal funding he yanked,” he added.
The White House criticized the Democrats’ effort.
“President Trump is restoring American energy dominance to fuel economic prosperity and lower costs for all Americans.","Senate Republicans on Wednesday voted down an effort from their Democratic colleagues to overturn President Trump’s energy emergency declaration.

The resolution was unlikely to ever become law, but came as a messaging tool for Democrats who oppose the Trump administration’s energy agenda, which has largely consisted of bolstering fossil fuels and nuclear energy while blocking renewable energy.

“President Trump told Big Oil donors that if they cut a $1 billion check to his campaign, he’d give them everything they want on day one of his presidency. Then, within hours of his inauguration, he declared a sham ‘energy emergency’ to put his thumb on the scale for those donors and hamstring other affordable energy sources,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) in a written statement, referring to Trump’s request that the industry give $1 billion to his campaign and a report that he told them it would be a “deal” to do so.

“It turns out Trump himself is the energy emergency — energy prices are through the roof and hundreds of thousands of good-paying clean energy jobs are in serious jeopardy because of federal funding he yanked,” he added.

The White House criticized the Democrats’ effort.

“President Trump is restoring American energy dominance to fuel economic prosperity and lower costs for all Americans. Only the radical Democrats could oppose this commonsense policy effort,” spokesperson Liz Huston said in an email.

On his first day in office, Trump declared a national emergency in regards to energy as part of an effort to unlock additional tools to jump-start energy production.

Since that time, he has sought to use emergency powers to approve more power stations for artificial intelligence, fast-track fossil fuels and mining on public lands and expedite hundreds of projects.

However, the administration has also taken steps to hamper renewable energy development.

It was originally supposed to be up and running by 2027 is expected to take until 2031 in order to be completed. The company behind the Commonwealth LNG Facility in Louisiana has warned in a request for an extension to its deadline.

Additionally, company blamed the temporary ban on new liquefied natural gas capacity that the the former US president Biden administration imposed. The administration imposed the ban on the industry in its final year. This followed a report that was drafted by an environmentalist that claimed LNG to more harmful than coal for the atmosphere.

Commonwealth LNG Facility in Louisiana Factsheet

Project owner: Commonwealth LNG

Location: West bank of the Calcasieu Ship Channel, near Cameron Parish, Louisiana, U.S. Gulf Coast.

Capacity: approximately 9.5 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) of LNG.

Estimated cost: Approximately $4 billion.

Key partners: Technip Energies (EPC Contractor), Baker Hughes (Refrigerant Compressors), Kimmeridge, Mubadala Energy (Equity Stake).

However, the Trump administration canceled the ban this year but that was not soon enough for Commonwealth LNG. The company said this in its letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Challenges the Project Faced

“These delays on the LNG project were beyond the control of Commonwealth. Also, they unavoidably affected Commonwealth’s ability to advance the Project on the schedule that was contemplated when its application was filed,” the company stated, as quoted by Reuters.

The Commonwealth LNG facility is located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. Furthermore, it will have an annual capacity of 9.5 million tons of liquefied gas. The construction of the first phase of the project is expected to cost $11 billion. This is according to Commonwealth LNG and generate annual export revenues of approximately $3.5 billion.

However, the company has yet to make the final investment decision on the project. This was revealed by the company in September after it secured its export license from the Department of Energy.

Companies that will be Supplied with LNG from the Facility

Additionally, in September, Commonwealth LNG secured a long-term supply deal with EQT for 1 million tons of LNG from its future Louisiana plant. This brings the total volume committed to future deliveries to 5 million tons under deals with Japan’s JERA, Malaysian Petronas, and Glencore, in addition to EQT. Therefore, this leaves 4.5 million tons yet to be contracted to secure the viability of the project unless project developer Kimmeridge sticks to its commitment to offtake 2 million tons of LNG annually from the facility.

Key Points

The $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles may have ended, but automakers continue to offer strong incentives on EV leases.

Hyundai, Stellantis, GM and Ford have also discounted lease deals.

It’s not too late to get a good lease deal on select electric vehicles. Even though the $7,500 federal tax credit expired Sept. 30, automakers and dealers are still motivated to move EVs, especially the BMW iX and Honda Prologue SUVs. Below, we cover some of the best lease deals through the end of October. Not included on our list but worth checking out are unique EV lease deals from some automakers, including Ford, Stellantis, Hyundai and GM.

The following deals are available nationally, though some regional markets may offer better incentives; always check with the dealer to ensure the deal is offered, however, as it can vary by state and some dealers may not advertise it. A lease also has an acquisition fee due at signing, typically ranging from $295 to about $1,000, which is not included here.

2025 Subaru Solterra

Down payment: $1,999

Monthly payment: $299

Due at signing: $2,298

Subaru’s lone EV, a sibling of the Toyota bZ4X (now rebranded simply the bZ), has a good deal now before the 2026 Solterra arrives. The 2025 Solterra has a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system and a 72.8-kilowatt-hour battery good for an EPA-estimated range of up to 227 miles. The Solterra Premium has a $7,500 incentive and can be had for just $299 a month for 36 months through Oct. 31. Like Toyota, Subaru updated its EV for 2026, making it more powerful and with quicker charging and greater range.

2025 Honda Prologue

Introduction

The Trump administration has moved to cancel nearly $8 billion in clean-energy projects, a decision that overwhelmingly affects states that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. The cuts (which span hydrogen hubs, solar deployments, and grid modernization efforts) were announced this week as part of a sweeping rollback of climate initiatives, and they fall almost entirely on blue states such as California, New York, and Minnesota. Critics have branded the move political retribution, arguing that the administration is punishing regions aligned with Trump’s former opponent while jeopardizing thousands of jobs and billions in private investment.

The cancellations were spearheaded by Trump budget chief Russ Vought, who framed the action as cutting “wasteful green subsidies.” But the numbers tell a different story: the bulk of the halted projects were already underway, and many had secured state and private-sector matching funds. Local officials warn that the sudden withdrawals will devastate clean-tech industries that have become economic anchors in their communities.

The decision has sparked immediate backlash. Governors in the affected states are threatening lawsuits, pointing to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which limits a president’s power to withhold congressionally appropriated funds. Legal scholars say the selective targeting of opposition states raises serious constitutional questions. Meanwhile, energy companies and investors caution that the uncertainty will chill innovation and push America further behind global competitors in the race for renewable energy.

What emerges is not just a debate over energy policy, but a test of whether federal resources can be deployed as a political weapon and whether the courts will step in to draw the line.

The Facts and Numbers

The scope of the cuts is staggering. The Trump administration’s decision eliminated 223 clean-energy projects across 16 states, wiping out nearly $7.6 billion in federal support. In California alone, the ARCHES hydrogen hub lost $1.2 billion, money that had been earmarked to accelerate development of renewable hydrogen as a fuel source. Other projects, ranging from large-scale solar installations in Arizona to grid resilience upgrades in New York, were also abruptly halted.

While the cuts were justified by Trump budget chief Russ Vought as eliminating “non-viable” or “wasteful” spending, the pattern reveals a starkly partisan edge. All of the states hit hardest voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. The only exceptions were small crosscurrents: in California’s Republican-leaning Central Valley, some local communities will also lose projects tied to grid modernization, showing that even red enclaves inside blue states are caught in the crossfire.

In Connecticut, CT Insider detailed how 12 projects worth $52.9 million were suddenly cut, including work at the University of Connecticut and FuelCell Energy, both of which were deep into their research and deployment phases. “This is not just a line item; these are jobs and ongoing commitments,” one state official told the outlet.

The geographic selectivity of the cancellations has drawn particular scrutiny. Every major hydrogen hub in Harris-won states (California, New York, Minnesota, and Illinois) saw their federal funding pulled. In total, the administration’s cuts struck at some of the nation’s most ambitious clean-energy pipelines, from battery storage in New Jersey to offshore wind projects on the East Coast.

Even the private sector has taken note. Shell executives warned the cancellations of fully permitted offshore wind projects would undermine investor confidence, sending a chilling signal to companies weighing whether to continue backing U.S.-based clean-energy ventures.

“Petty Politics” or Governance Logic?

The timing and targeting of the cuts have left many observers skeptical that this was merely an exercise in fiscal prudence. On paper, the Trump administration claims the projects were eliminated because they lacked “economic viability” or failed to align with national priorities. As Russ Vought put it, these were simply examples of “green pork” that the federal government had no business funding.

But the political optics are unmistakable. Virtually every state that saw projects gutted was one carried by Kamala Harris in 2024. That alignment has prompted governors and lawmakers to call the move what they believe it is: retribution. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong called it “a blatant act of political punishment” that abandons communities striving for energy independence. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz warned that the cancellations were “targeting people not for what they’ve done but for how they voted.”

The consequences extend far beyond symbolism. These cuts threaten tens of thousands of jobs and billions in private-sector matching funds that had been committed under federal grant agreements. Several projects were already breaking ground, meaning workers and local governments had staked real resources on promises of federal support. For cities and rural communities alike, the rug has been pulled out from under them.

There’s also an irony in the impact. In California’s Central Valley, a Republican stronghold, local districts are set to lose out on grid modernization funds, even though they supported Trump at the ballot box. That collateral damage underscores the scattershot nature of using federal policy as a political cudgel: even Trump’s own voters may find themselves harmed when blue states are the target.

Yet defenders of the move insist that the outrage is overstated. Vought has cast the cuts as part of Trump’s broader promise to dismantle what he calls the “Green New Scam,” redirecting resources toward fossil fuels and nuclear power instead. Supporters argue that the federal government should not “pick winners” in energy markets, and that states or private investors should take the risk of developing unproven technologies.

Still, the unmistakable alignment between states hit hardest and the electoral map of 2024 has fueled accusations of pettiness and political spite. As one energy analyst told E&E News, “Even if the administration insists it’s about policy, the pattern looks like punishment.”

Legal Challenges and Constitutional Questions

The immediate question raised by Trump’s cuts is whether they are even legal. Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, presidents are barred from unilaterally withholding or canceling funds that Congress has already appropriated, except under narrow conditions. That statute was written in response to Richard Nixon’s attempts to withhold federal money for programs he opposed. Legal scholars now argue that Trump’s action may fall into the same prohibited category. “Congress decides where the money goes, not the White House,” constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe told E&E News.

Several states are already gearing up for lawsuits. A coalition led by Democratic attorneys general is preparing to challenge the cancellations in federal court, asserting that the administration’s rationale is a thinly veiled excuse for political retaliation. The legal argument hinges on the claim that the administration cannot selectively target projects based on political geography while leaving similarly structured projects untouched in red states.

There is also the matter of contractual obligations. Many of the affected grants were already signed, with states and private partners investing millions based on federal commitments. In Connecticut, for example, FuelCell Energy and the University of Connecticut had already launched projects with the expectation of federal support. Canceling funds at this stage, legal experts say, could expose the administration to breach-of-contract claims.

Beyond statutory and contractual concerns, some argue the cuts may violate the Equal Protection Clause by punishing states for their electoral choices. That claim will be harder to prove, courts typically require evidence of discriminatory intent, not just disparate impact. Still, the near-perfect alignment between Harris-won states and canceled projects strengthens the perception that political motives drove the decision.

The Trump administration has already faced pushback in court for similar maneuvers. Earlier in 2025, a federal judge in Washington blocked efforts to freeze $14 billion in EPA climate grants, ruling the freeze was “arbitrary and capricious” under the Administrative Procedure Act. That precedent could prove pivotal as states and recipients seek to block the latest wave of cancellations.

Still, the administration has defenses. It may argue that the Impoundment Control Act doesn’t apply to grants still in negotiation or those contingent on performance benchmarks, and that agencies have discretion to terminate projects deemed out of compliance. Whether courts accept those arguments will determine not only the fate of these clean-energy projects but the scope of presidential power over federal spending.

Case Studies: States and Communities in the Crossfire

California: Hydrogen Dreams Deferred

No state took a bigger hit than California. The ARCHES hydrogen hub, a flagship initiative designed to create a renewable hydrogen economy, saw $1.2 billion in federal funding vanish overnight. State officials had already launched partnerships with universities, utilities, and international energy companies to scale the project. Now, that ambitious plan has been brought to a halt. “This isn’t just about California; this is about America’s place in the global clean-energy race,” Governor Gavin Newsom warned after the announcement. Even Trump-supporting counties in the Central Valley, slated to benefit from grid upgrades tied to the project, will now feel the economic pain.

Connecticut: Fuel Cells and Broken Promises

In Connecticut, the cancellations hit smaller but vital projects. 12 projects worth $52.9 million were eliminated, including work at the University of Connecticut on solar and energy storage, as well as contracts with FuelCell Energy, a company with decades of experience in renewable technologies. Company executives said they were blindsided by the decision, noting that jobs and research investments are now hanging by a thread. “The rules changed in the middle of the game,” one official said, underscoring the sense of betrayal among communities that had counted on federal support.

Minnesota: Rural Innovation Stalled

In Minnesota, clean-energy initiatives in small towns were gutted, undermining local economies that had been moving toward renewables as a source of both jobs and resilience. MPR News highlighted the case of Morris, a town investing heavily in renewable energy to power farms and municipal buildings.

Now, federal dollars that were supposed to sustain that transition have evaporated. Governor Tim Walz called the decision “reckless and punitive,” warning that rural communities, many of them in Republican districts, will be among the biggest losers.

Offshore Wind and Investor Confidence

The fallout isn’t confined to state budgets. The private sector is also spooked. Shell executives criticized the administration’s cancellation of fully permitted offshore wind projects, arguing that it sends a dangerous signal to investors. “When projects can be scrapped for political reasons, even after permits and contracts are in place, why would international firms bet on the U.S. market?” one executive asked. This chilling effect could ripple far beyond the canceled projects, slowing future investment in American clean energy.

Implications and Wider Context

Undermining U.S. Climate Goals

The clean-energy funding cuts strike at the core of America’s climate commitments. Many of the canceled projects were tied to targets set under the Inflation Reduction Act, including hydrogen production, grid modernization, and large-scale renewable deployment. Without those investments, experts warn the United States will fall behind in meeting emissions reduction goals, and potentially cede technological leadership to Europe and Asia, where governments are doubling down on green subsidies. The decision effectively pulls the plug on some of the most ambitious pipelines for renewable growth.

Investor Confidence and the Risk Premium

Perhaps the most immediate consequence is the blow to investor confidence. Clean-energy projects depend on a delicate balance of federal support, state backing, and private capital. When the federal side of that equation becomes unpredictable, the private sector recalibrates its risk. Reuters reported Shell’s warning that U.S. offshore wind investment could dry up if companies cannot trust federal commitments. That chilling effect could spill over into batteries, solar, and hydrogen, slowing the pace of innovation across the board.

Federalism and Political Retaliation

The selective nature of the cuts raises deeper concerns about federalism. By targeting states that supported Kamala Harris in 2024, the Trump administration has blurred the line between policy disagreement and political punishment. Governors have warned that if clean-energy grants can be revoked on partisan grounds, nothing stops future administrations from weaponizing other types of federal funding, from infrastructure to healthcare. This precedent risks transforming the federal purse into a partisan tool, destabilizing the cooperative balance between Washington and the states.

Political Fallout and Electoral Ramifications

Politically, the decision could cut both ways. Trump’s supporters may see the cuts as fulfilling his pledge to dismantle what he calls the “Green New Scam” and prioritize fossil fuel industries. But the backlash could be fierce in states where projects were already creating jobs and revenue, including pockets of Republican strongholds inadvertently caught in the fallout. Rural towns in Minnesota and California’s Central Valley, communities Trump counted on in 2024, now face the loss of anticipated economic lifelines. That contradiction could test the durability of his coalition in the midterms.

Global Standing and Competitiveness

Finally, the cuts send a message abroad: that the U.S. may not be a reliable partner in the clean-energy transition. While China and the EU are plowing billions into hydrogen, solar, and battery technologies, the United States appears to be retreating from the race. Analysts caution that this could have lasting effects on trade, innovation, and America’s ability to shape international climate agreements.

What to Watch: Open Questions Ahead

Will the Courts Step In?

The most immediate unknown is how quickly the courts will act on challenges from states and project developers. Federal judges have already shown a willingness to block similar attempts to freeze climate funds earlier this year, but whether they will enjoin these broader, more targeted cuts remains unclear. If lawsuits succeed, projects could be reinstated. If not, billions in potential development may remain stranded.

Congressional Oversight and Pushback

Lawmakers in both chambers are preparing oversight hearings. Democrats are framing the cancellations as an abuse of power, while some moderate Republicans, particularly those from districts where local projects were scrapped, may face pressure to break ranks. The big question is whether Congress will attempt to restore the funds through supplemental appropriations, or whether the partisan divide will freeze any legislative remedy.

How Will States and Cities Adapt?

Governors in California, Minnesota, New York, and Connecticut have already signaled they will explore state-level funding to salvage critical projects. But most lack the fiscal capacity to replace billions in lost federal support. Municipalities, too, may be forced to scale down or delay renewable initiatives, leading to ripple effects in local economies. Whether states can coordinate alternative funding coalitions, through regional compacts or partnerships with private investors, remains an open question.

Investor Behavior and the Market Signal

Energy companies are watching closely to see if the cancellations are a one-off or the beginning of a sustained rollback. If investors believe political instability is the “new normal” for federal climate policy, U.S. clean-energy financing could face a long-term contraction. That uncertainty may push capital toward Europe or Asia, where government backing is more consistent.

Expanding the Weaponization of Federal Funds

The precedent set here may not stop with clean energy. If courts allow it, future administrations could condition federal support for infrastructure, public health, or disaster relief on political alignment. That possibility has alarmed constitutional scholars, who warn of a future where funding decisions are wielded as tools of electoral punishment rather than national interest.

Electoral Fallout

Finally, the political gamble. Will Trump’s base applaud the move as another strike against “green elites,” or will disillusioned communities in Republican-leaning districts feel betrayed by the collateral damage? The answer may shape the dynamics of the 2026 midterms, when energy policy, local economies, and partisan divides will all be on the ballot.

Conclusion

The Trump administration’s decision to slash billions in clean-energy funding is more than a policy dispute; it is a stress test for the balance between politics, law, and governance. By targeting projects concentrated in states that voted for Kamala Harris, the cuts have exposed a volatile mix of partisanship and policymaking, one that critics warn weaponizes the federal purse in ways not seen since Nixon’s impoundments of the 1970s.

The consequences are immediate and tangible: shuttered hydrogen hubs in California, stalled research in Connecticut, small towns in Minnesota left scrambling, and multinational companies questioning whether the U.S. remains a reliable partner in the clean-energy race. Jobs have been put at risk, billions in private investment destabilized, and America’s credibility in climate leadership shaken.

Legally, the battle is just beginning. Courts will decide whether the administration has overstepped statutory and constitutional limits. Politically, the gamble is even larger: if voters in red districts feel betrayed by collateral damage, the retribution could backfire. If not, Trump may succeed in cementing his energy agenda as both fiscal conservatism and political dominance.

What is clear is that this fight is not just about solar panels, hydrogen hubs, or offshore wind. It is about whether federal resources can be manipulated as a partisan weapon, and whether institutions, from courts to Congress, will step in to stop it. The outcome will help define not only America’s energy future but also the limits of presidential power in a deeply divided nation.

Well, had. Just before it expired, General Motors announced that it managed to find a clever way to preserve the discounts to customers who lease EVs after Sept. 30: Put the cars into service by making a down payment to the dealerships themselves.

But it turns out some of America's elected officials don't take too kindly to workarounds, so now that plan is off the table.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and tech in the automotive space. Also on deck: Ford will pull back on Lightning production, and the federal government threatens to pull back over a billion dollars in EV manufacturing grants from GM and Stellantis. Let's jump in.

30%: Ford Expected To Idle F-150 Lightning Production

Photo by: Ford

The Rouge Electric Vehicle Center (REVC) will idle F-150 Lightning production for at least a week, according to a memo sent to workers shared with Reuters. And while demand for electric vehicles is expected to drop this week, it's not the reason Ford is scaling back production.

A late-night fire tore through part of the Novelis aluminum plant in Oswego, New York, last month. The damage was so extensive that a large portion of the plant is expected to remain out of commission into 2026, which means that many automakers—Ford included—are expected to face a supply crunch over the next few months. And because Ford makes its F-Series pickup bodies from aluminum (and because those pickups are one of America's best-selling vehicles), it must now choose what production to scale back in order to keep cranking out high-margin products at volume.

Unfortunately, the F-150 Lightning will fall victim to the supply crunch, at least until Ford can work out how to mitigate the problem.

The Wall Street Journal covered just how impactful the fire is expected to be for Ford:

Ford is the biggest user of the plant. Its F-150 pickup, the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. and the automaker’s main profit driver, is one of the industry’s biggest users of aluminum. The setback is severe enough that Ford will likely flag potential implications to investors when it discloses quarterly financial results later this month, according to people familiar with the matter.

Ford shares sank in morning trading by more than 7% on news of the potential disruption.

“This represents a serious question for the production of F-150 because that’s the aluminum that comes out of Oswego,” said Kaustubh Chandorkar, an aluminum-industry analyst. Ford switched the F-150’s exterior to aluminum from steel a decade ago.

Confirmation of Ford's production line shutdown next week was made by Reuters, which viewed a memo written by Dearborn Truck UAW Chairman Nick Kottalis. The memo stated that REVC will be off next week, related to the Novelis fire, but did not address the total anticipated impact on production.

Ford isn't alone in its reliance on the metal supplier. General Motors, Stellantis, Toyota, and more are all customers. In fact, Novelis supplies nearly half of all sheet metal used by U.S. car makers. However, industry analysts expect that Ford will be hit the hardest out of any automaker with a U.S. production line and is estimated to lose up to a whopping $1 billion from its bottom line.

“We believe this is largely a Ford issue,"" wrote Chris McNally, Head of Global Auto and Mobility Research at Evercore ISI, in a note on the matter. McNally went on to estimate that the firm expects Ford to take an earnings hit of between $500 million and $1 billion over the supply issue.

Admittedly, if Ford had to choose between cutting down on the F-150 Lightning and gas models, it makes sense to ramp down on the electric model. Ford's ICE truck has significantly more sales than its battery-powered variant, not to mention that the sale of EVs are expected to take a dip with the EV tax credit going away.

It's not clear if the shutdown will extend past a week, nor what Ford expects its total production impact to be. ""Novelis is one of several aluminum suppliers to Ford,"" said a Ford spokesperson in a statement to the Detroit Free Press. ""Since the fire [on Sept. 16th], Ford has been working closely with Novelis, and a full team is dedicated to addressing the situation and exploring all possible alternatives to minimize any potential disruptions.""

60%: GM Backtracks On EV Tax Credit Extension

2027 Chevy Bolt EV

GM has officially changed course on its EV tax credit leasing plan, according to a report from Reuters. The automaker will no longer make good on its plan to pass on the discount to consumers until the end of the year and will instead only foot the bill over the next few weeks.

U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, a man who managed to build a luxury car dealership empire in Ohio, penned a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent condemning ""certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer."" Here's a snippet from the letter penned by Moreno:

The intent of [the Big Beautiful Bill] is clear—no credits allowed after September 30, 2025.

To implement this law, on August 21, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance which provided clarification on the availability of the EV subsidies for taxpayers who enter into a written binding contract and make a downpayment on an eligible “clean vehicle.” This guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer.

It has come to our attention that certain car companies are gaming this guidance by instructing their captive financial entities to enter into written binding agreements with dealers for electric vehicles, paying a nominal downpayment, to secure the credits on vehicles that may not be leased to the end user for months.

Given this concerning information, we write to request your assistance to close this loophole and address the total violation of Congressional intent by these nefarious actors

In a statement to Reuters, GM confirmed that it would not claim the tax credit after all. Instead, it will self-fund the lease incentives until the end of the month. “GM worked on an extended offer for the benefit of our customers and dealers. After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” said GM. “GM will fund the incentive lease terms through the end of October.”

InsideEVs reached out to Ford to see if it would follow in GM's footsteps, but Ford did not respond to our request for comment.

While this, uh, creative measure technically aligned with federal guidance, it's clear that lawmakers weren't having any of it (politically-charged or otherwise). At least GM's heart was in the right place. The EV market is expected to slow significantly this quarter and the brand warned that consumers shouldn't expect ""irrational"" discounts after the tax credit ended. At least they can still score some decent lease discounts until the end of the month.

90%: U.S. Could Claw Back $1.1 Billion In EV Grants From GM and Stellantis

Photo by: Chevrolet

Nearly $1.1 billion in federal grant funding awarded to General Motors and Stellantis by the U.S. Department of Energy could soon be clawed back by the feds. Both automakers were set to use the funds as a means to retool their factories to support the production of electric vehicles. But now, that money could be ripped away as part of a game of political chess.

According to a report from Automotive News, the rescinding of the grant is part of a larger cancellation of Congressionally-mandated funding set aside for energy and manufacturing projects. In total, $12 billion in grants could be affected on top of an already-announced cancellation of $8 billion for various clean energy-related needs.

Automotive News explains:

The projects are among a list of $12 billion in awards that could be canceled as the partial government shutdown persists.

Among those grants: $500 million awarded to GM to convert Lansing Grand River Assembly in Michigan to build electric vehicles; $335 million for Stellantis to convert the shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to make midsize electric pickups; and $250 million for Stellantis to convert its Indiana Transmission Plant in Kokomo to produce EV components.

The possible cancellations come a week after the Energy Department announced plans to cancel $7.56 billion in financing for hundreds of energy projects that it said would not provide sufficient returns to taxpayers.

For GM, that includes $500 million earmarked to be used at its Lansing Grand River plant. The funds were to be used as part of the factory's retooling to build EVs, something GM pledged a total of $1.25 billion to in 2024.

Then there's Stellantis. It planned to allocate $334.8 million to revive its idled Belvidere plant as part of a $1.5 billion cash infusion. Another $250 million was to be committed to an Indiana transmission plant that would be repurposed to build EV drivetrains.

No final decision has been made so far, but the money on the line threatens a combined estimated 2,900 direct jobs and supports more than 15,000 other workers across the U.S. auto industry.

100%: We've Got Some Cheap(ish) EVs Now. Which Are You Choosing?

With the release of the new Chevy Bolt, the lower-cost Nissan Leaf, and Tesla's Standard models, there are now a number of EVs creeping into what many see as ""affordable"" territory. If nothing else, at least well below the average transaction price of $49,088 for new cars (and $57,245 for EVs in mid-Q3, according to Cox Automotive.)

The 2026 Nissan Leaf starts at $29,990 with 303 miles of range, a base-trimmed Chevy Bolt LT was announced yesterday for $28,995 with 255 miles of range. Plus, Tesla's new Model 3 Standard is $36,990 and will offer 321 miles of range. Let's not forget some other already-established players like the Hyundai Kona (200 miles for $34,470), Chevy Equinox (319 miles for $34,995) and Toyota bZ (236 miles for $34,900).

My point is that our cups runneth over with EVs under $40,000—sure, that's not cheap, cheap. But it's a pretty darn different place than we were a decade ago.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is opening a 30-day public comment period on its 2024 final risk management rule for carbon tetrachloride (CTC) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). This is the first step in EPA’s efforts to reconsider and, if appropriate, revise the final risk management rule.

The agency has since determined that the CTC final rule should be reconsidered through further rulemaking. Feedback received during this comment period will help inform next steps in this reconsideration.

EPA invites public comment on all aspects of the CTC final rule, including but not limited to any existing or anticipated implementation issues associated with the final rule requirements, experiences with the CTC final rule since it went into effect, and whether the agency should consider additional or alternative measures or approaches to address the unreasonable risk presented by CTC under the conditions of use.

He has also underscored the administration’s notion that expanding the coal industry is necessary to meet increasing electricity demand, mostly driven by artificial intelligence and other computational facilities.","Federal officials indefinitely postponed a Wyoming coal lease sale scheduled for Wednesday, apparently in response to what many observers consider a lowball bid on another federal coal lease on Monday in Montana.

Navajo Transitional Energy Company, the only bidder, stunned coal market watchers with an offer of $186,000 for 167 million tons of federal coal associated with its Spring Creek mine in southeast Montana — a fraction of a penny per ton and woefully low compared to past federal coal lease sales in the region. The last such major sale in the region, in 2012, netted $793 million for 721 million tons, or about $1.10 per ton, according to federal data.

Navajo Transitional was also in the queue to bid on the 441 million-ton West Antelope III federal coal lease associated with its Antelope coal mine spanning Campbell and Converse counties in Wyoming.

Bureau of Land Management and Interior Department officials are still reviewing the Spring Creek bid, and those close to the process expect that another date will be set for the West Antelope III coal lease sale.

“While we would have liked to see stronger participation, this sale reflects the lingering impact from Obama and Biden’s decades long war on coal which aggressively sought to end all domestic coal production and erode confidence in the U.S. coal industry,” the Interior wrote in an email responding to a WyoFile inquiry. “Fortunately, President [Donald] Trump and his administration are rebuilding trust between industry and government as part of our broader effort to restore American Energy Dominance.”

But others say market forces — including cheap natural gas and increasingly efficient wind and solar energy — are bigger factors.

Others note that the coal industry itself sees the writing on the wall. If a fraction-of-a-penny bid is any indication, some critics say, the thermal coal industry — which relies on U.S. coal-burning power plants — isn’t yet confident that Trump’s policies will turn around years of market decline.

“It tells you that there’s no competition for that coal in the ground, and it’s not worth very much money,” Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis Energy Data Analyst Seth Feaster told WyoFile on Wednesday. “It points to the fundamental, structural decline the coal industry is facing — for thermal coal — and that story hasn’t been reversed, despite all the things that they’re talking about.”

The postponement in Wyoming and lackluster offer in Montana come just days after the Trump administration touted sweeping regulatory rollbacks and $625 million in federal spending to revitalize “clean, beautiful coal.”

Navajo Transitional tried to set expectations regarding Powder River Basin coal’s market value back in September, urging the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to set its minimum bid requirement for the West Antelope III coal lease much lower than comparable leases in the past. Neighboring Powder River Basin coal operator, CORE Natural Resources, echoed that sentiment and told BLM officials, “the fair-market value of coal in the Powder River Basin will remain soft for the next number of years.”

Gov. Mark Gordon has said recently that Trump’s efforts to revive the coal industry will take some time to bear fruit. He has also underscored the administration’s notion that expanding the coal industry is necessary to meet increasing electricity demand, mostly driven by artificial intelligence and other computational facilities.

The Wyoming Mining Association declined to comment on Navajo Transitional’s Spring Creek coal lease bid, but acknowledged the industry still must reckon with 15 years of drastic market and policy shifts.

“As we’ve not seen a lease sale in over a decade, there may be a bit of a learning curve between the agency and industry to determine value given the current market conditions, projected demand and the shift in public policy,” Mining Association Executive Director Travis Deti said.

Regardless of what coal bidders and federal officials ultimately decide is the “fair market value” for Powder River Basin coal, Deti said, it’s vital to resume leasing new tracts of coal.

“If you don’t have the coal leased, you can’t mine it and you don’t have the jobs,” Deti said.

Conservation groups have noted that existing coal leases allow mining in the region to continue at pace through 2041.

There’s a danger in the Trump administration’s narrative around coal making a comeback, particularly for coal-reliant communities, according to Mijin Cha, who grew up in Laramie and studies energy transition and social justice strategies.

“It creates false hope and increased distrust between community members and government officials — you know, the folks that actually could help them,” said Cha, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It delays help for energy communities, and I think that what they’re doing [selling more federal coal] is so much more detrimental.”

Though the industry has seen slight upticks in demand recently, Wyoming coal production — primarily in the Powder River Basin — has shrunk by more than half since its heyday in the mid-2000s.

Drawing on the outcomes of public participatory processes on climate change, and the reform to a new generation of nine subnational climate laws, as well as international experience, this report identifies opportunities to strengthen Mexico’s key national climate governance instrument: the General Law on Climate Change. The authors analyse the provisions against key ‘climate governance functions’ that need to be addressed to enable an effective response to the climate crisis.

The report also provides insights for other countries that are revising their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and looking to strengthen the domestic legal frameworks and institutions that deliver implementation. Conclusions from this study could be of particular interest to countries with a federal structure and those seeking to strengthen subnational leadership on climate change.

The authors find that Mexico’s General Law addresses the climate governance functions to some extent, but there are opportunities to strengthen design elements of the law across the functions. Detailed recommendations for policymakers are provided.

Key recommendations for Mexico include:

Introduce a legally-binding climate neutrality target and define intermediate targets compatible with this trajectory. Strategy planning processes could be aligned with five-year cycles of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and more explicitly integrated just transition considerations.

Require, and support, all public authorities to ensure that their decisions are consistent with national targets and strategies. The mandates of the Inter-Secretarial Commission on Climate Change (CICC) and the National Climate Change System (SINACC) could also be strengthened to improve coordination and integration.

Require government to consider independent advice at key stages of the policymaking process and introduce a requirement for government to respond to such advice.

Introduce a requirement for the Government to respond to stakeholder input and ensure that Indigenous knowledge and perspectives are integral to policy development. The CICC’s mandate could be expanded to include clear requirements to conduct inclusive public participatory processes.

Introduce a requirement to develop and regularly update a financial strategy and facilitate budgetary processes for sectoral Ministries and subnational governments. Consider additional provisions to facilitate climate-related lending and technical assistance from national and international programmes, to flow towards States and municipalities.

Establish regular reporting processes by sectoral Ministers to Congress, and consider introducing annual independent assessments of progress, with clear consequences in cases of non-compliance with the law.

The service had tried to acquire the island before the Scout mitigation effort surfaced, a spokesman said.","South Carolina’s successful effort to lure Scout Motors to Blythewood will cost the public about $60 million to make up for the environmental damage left by the massive economic development project.

That’s believed to be a record amount of spending by the state Department of Commerce on what’s known as mitigation, the required practice of saving land or restoring wetlands in some places to offset the losses at construction sites in other places.

But the costs to the public could rise higher, as a result of the effort to compensate for wetlands and streams smothered by the work at Scout.

After a disagreement over how much land needed to be protected and how much restoration work was needed to offset Scout’s environmental impact, the Commerce Department beefed up a mitigation package as it raced to get a much-needed wetlands permit for the electric vehicle project, according to records reviewed by The State newspaper.

The more robust mitigation package, which involves fixing degraded creeks in a national forest, has added at least $18 million to the state’s mitigation costs, the newspaper found.

Expected costs of the entire creek restoration effort, however, have not been released and are expected to rise by millions of dollars, those familiar with the project said.

The creek restoration costs are in addition to $41 million the Commerce Department said it is spending on other pieces of the package to offset wetlands and stream losses from the Scout project in Blythewood, according to emails from the department.

That includes $27 million to purchase 5,000 acres in lower Richland County and more than $800,000 for an island in Fairfield County. In both cases, the land was bought for two to three times the value of the property listed in the Richland and Fairfield county assessor’s office records.

Overall, the nearly $60 million for wetlands mitigation exceeds the amount spent to compensate for wetlands losses at sites cleared for other high profile industrial development projects in the past 15 years.

Those include the Volvo automobile manufacturing plant in Berkeley County and the Boeing aircraft manufacturing plant expansion in Charleston County. Mitigation costs for each of those projects were under $20 million, according to public records, information from environmental groups and news accounts.

“The Scout mitigation effort is the largest mitigation effort S.C. Commerce has taken part in to date,’’ the department said in an email.

Another major mitigation package – which was not paid for by taxpayers – involved the Haile Gold Mine, a huge operation that has stripped the landscape in Lancaster County.

Offsetting the wetland and stream losses at Haile cost $27 million. But unlike Scout, the wetlands mitigation costs for the gold mine were paid by the mine’s owner, according to OceanaGold, which is digging up billions of dollars worth of the precious metal near the town of Kershaw. (OceanaGold separately agreed to pay cleanup costs for other environmental damage at the site.)

Boeing also paid for its mitigation costs, the company said.

The nearly $60 million known to have been committed to pay wetlands mitigation has again brought attention to South Carolina’s financial stake in the Scout project.

Legislators agreed in 2023 on a $1.3 billion financial package for Scout that includes money for multiple expenses, including compensation for wetlands and stream damage caused by clearing land at the project site.

The General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the package because Scout promises to create 4,000 jobs and invest billions of dollars in South Carolina. But a handful of lawmakers questioned whether the state had spent too much when the Legislature approved the $1.3 billion for Scout.

Now, records reviewed by The State newspaper detail the amount South Carolina is spending on the wetlands and stream mitigation part of the Scout financial package.

Information about the Scout mitigation costs comes from public documents and emails from the S.C. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Forest Service and the S.C. Department of Natural Resources, as well as interviews with sources familiar with the mitigation package. The State newspaper reviewed thousands of pages of documents obtained from government agencies under South Carolina’s open records law.

Scout supporter Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic state senator, said he would like to have known about the wetlands mitigation costs at the time the Legislature discussed the project.

“If I would have known it was $60 million or more dollars for mitigation, I probably would have wanted to talk about that,’’ the Columbia lawyer said, noting that the mitigation cost “is not an insignificant expenditure.’’

Harpootlian urged legislators to look into the matter, possibly through a Legislative Audit Council review of the mitigation.

“This isn’t Scout’s fault,’’ he said. “This is the failure of somebody, whether it is at the Department of Commerce, or whether it’s some other state agency or entity.’’

In addition to mitigation costs, the $1.3 billion taxpayer-funded incentives package includes money for bridge and rail spur construction and water and sewer improvements.

State Rep. Bruce Bannister, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, said he’d rather not spend money on incentives, or on wetlands mitigation, but that was the price tag for bringing Scout to South Carolina.

“The economic returns we will get over the life of the Scout project are well worth it,’’ the Greenville Republican said, likening the Scout decision to German automaker BMW’s decision to locate in South Carolina more than 30 years ago.

Bannister indicated that the Commerce Department was under pressure to bring in Scout as it competed with other states, meaning it needed to get the mitigation dispute resolved so it could move on.

When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Natural Resources pushed to add the national forest stream work to the original mitigation package, the state had little choice but to comply, he said. (The agencies in 2023 had also expressed concern at how quickly the Scout project site was being cleared.)

“At the end of the day, you were just kind of at the mercy of the EPA,’’ Bannister said. “We don’t need to scuttle the deal arguing over $10 million or $15 million in additional mitigation.’’

“We could challenge, but then still had to pay’’ the extra mitigation costs, he continued.

How successful the Scout project ultimately is will determine whether the expenditure was worthwhile, said Don Weaver, a Richland County councilman known for years as an outspoken taxpayer advocate.

The cost “is a little high, but I’m glad the project (is) in South Carolina,’’ instead of Georgia or North Carolina, Weaver said. “Sometimes you have to spend money to make money, and clearly that’s what we’re doing with the Scout plant.’’

Despite the expense, many agree that saving land and restoring the environment in other areas to compensate for the environmental damage at Scout is a good thing.

The property protected in Lower Richland is an example of how that benefits the public and the environment, according to one official with the Open Space Institute, a national non-profit group that protects land.

“South Carolina is getting thousands of acres that become open to the public,’’ said the institute’s Nate Berry, who helped negotiate the purchase of the property in Richland County.

The property in Richland County is near Congaree National Park and is home to lush stretches of a major creek that drains toward the federal preserve.

Among the features are land long-used by the Millaree Hunt Club, a prestigious private sportsmen’s retreat well known for its scenery and clean water. The creek at Millaree is enveloped by a canopy of hardwood trees.

Work to restore degraded streams and wetlands on other parts of the land is planned before it becomes a publicly accessible preserve. The state Forestry Commission will eventually become the owner and manager of the 5,000 acres.

Those who worked on acquiring the land say trees and wetlands on the part of the property that is being restored will one day rival those of nearby Congaree National Park.

Scout issued a statement saying it appreciates the efforts of officials at the state and county levels for supporting construction of a plant that will “strengthen the Midlands economy.’’ The mitigation package will preserve “thousands of acres of natural land and streams’’ in Richland County and the Sumter National Forest, Scout’s statement said.

Economic prosperity and environmental damage

Landing Scout has been touted as one of the biggest economic development successes in state history, rivaling BMW’s arrival in the early 1990s under then-Gov. Carroll Campbell.

A division of Volkswagen, Scout plans to make SUVs and trucks at an expansive manufacturing plant off Interstate 77 at Blythewood. The company has said it would produce as many as 4,000 jobs. Its investment in South Carolina is around $2 billion.

Republican Gov. Henry McMaster has been an enthusiastic supporter, even as President Donald Trump has led efforts to roll back federal support for the electric vehicle industry. Trump’s policies, including scaling back tax cuts for electric vehicles, are forecast to slow growth of the industry. Undeterred, Scout has moved ahead with its South Carolina plant.

Environmentalists have supported manufacturing electric vehicles in South Carolina because the automobiles don’t release pollution that worsens air quality and contributes to climate change.

But work at Scout has had a massive impact on the more than 1,000 acres being developed near Blythewood. The property has been scraped clean of trees and vegetation, creeks have been filled in and wetlands have been destroyed to make room for the manufacturing facilities.

All told, Scout’s work is affecting more than 70 acres of wetlands, 38 acres of ponds and about seven miles of streams, most notably Beasley Creek in Columbia’s Broad River watershed.

As a result of the expected impacts, state and local officials had to come up with a mitigation plan to offset those losses. That’s a requirement to obtain a federal wetlands permit, which a company needs so it can work on sites studded with bogs and swamps.

Those working on the Scout site have had trouble containing sediment and mud, causing creeks off of the industrial property to turn brown with silt.

The S.C. Department of Environmental Services fined Richland County, the Scout project site’s owner, $1 million earlier this year for violating laws to control storm water. The county could pay as much as $3 million if it doesn’t resolve certain problems in coming months.

Still, the environmental violations are a separate cost from the mitigation expenses at the site. The mitigation costs are the result of a plan developed to offset the wetlands and stream losses that project supporters knew were in the project’s path.

Specifically, the mitigation costs to offset the environmental impacts at Scout break down like this:

$27 million for 5,000 acres in lower Richland County adjacent to Congaree National Park. The undeveloped property, composed of two parcels, was collectively valued by the county assessor’s office at $7 million before the sale.

$825,000 for Shelton Island in the Broad River between Fairfield and Union counties. The undeveloped, forested island, which is about 150 acres, was valued at $378,800 by the Fairfield assessor’s office before the sale.

$11.7 million to Water and Land Solutions, a company that provided a variety of services, including development of the mitigation plan in Richland and Fairfield counties. The payment includes preparation of the Richland County land to become a future state forest. Those duties include restoring streams to natural conditions and planting hardwood trees.

$1.4 million to the Open Space Institute, a national non-profit organization. The payment is for the institute’s role in helping find land and to negotiate a sale for the Richland and Fairfield properties.

$11.6 million for the stream restoration project that will occur on the federally protected Sumter National Forest in Chester County. The first of four streams being restored in Chester County is costing $2.2 million for construction. Commerce would not say how much three other streams would cost to restore. But assuming they are the same as the first stream, the expense would increase from $11.6 million to $18.2 million.

Additionally, some of the wetlands offset requirements were met through a mitigation bank in Richland County, although details of that were not available.

Expensive stream restoration plan

Bob Perry, a senior permitting strategist with Water and Land Solutions, said his company worked with the Open Space Institute to find the Richland and Fairfield properties to offset Scout’s impacts in Blythewood.

Those lands were enough to meet federal requirements to obtain the wetlands permit Scout needed for the project, he said. But he said the cost of the project has been driven up by demands from the state DNR and the U.S. EPA to add the national forest stream restoration project to the Scout mitigation package.

Money that Commerce said it committed to pay for the national forest work is only part of what that effort may ultimately cost, Perry predicted.

While The State newspaper has been able to find $18 million in costs expected for the stream project, one Forest Service report from 2014 indicates the cost could be $24 million.

The U.S. Forest Service did not provide a breakdown of the $24 million when asked by The State. The Commerce Department also has refused to provide the full projected costs of the national forest stream work.

Companies involved in the Scout mitigation effort could have found other land to protect, instead of spending millions of dollars restoring streams on already preserved land owned by the federal government, critics say.

“All they had to do was say ‘We want a substantial stream mitigation project in the lower Broad River watershed,’ ’’ Perry said. “I guarantee you, within 30 days, (the Open Space Institute) could have had property under option and we could have had a conceptual mitigation plan written that could have fit right into the permit application.

“And millions of taxpayer dollars would have been saved.’’

A criticism of the national forest work is that it will be a difficult project to complete because the effort involves restoring creeks that have stood as they are for nearly 100 years. The streams and surrounding land eroded in the early to mid-1900s as a result of cotton farming.

But vegetation and forests have grown up around the streams and they blend in with the woodlands today. Getting into heavily forested areas with heavy equipment and smoothing out the landscape will take effort, Perry said.

Critics also question why South Carolina taxpayers are spending money on an environmental restoration project that they say should be a federal taxpayer responsibility.

In fact, the U.S. Forest Service in 2014 entertained the idea of the stream project as part of a wetlands offset package for a proposed nuclear plant south of Charlotte. The plant was never built and the stream project was not done, records show.

Records show that the DNR and EPA pushed for additional Scout mitigation because they said the original package, put together by Water and Land Solutions and others, was not adequate to meet federal standards.

The plan for Scout, as initially proposed, would “barely meet’’ the amount of mitigation needed in “the best-case scenario,’’ according to a July 21, 2023, letter from the S.C. Department of Natural Resources to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which considers permits to fill wetlands.

The type of mitigation proposed by the Commerce Department and Richland County – known as permittee responsible – was riskier than other types of mitigation that could be used, meaning more work was necessary in case something went wrong, the DNR said.

The EPA offered similar comments, saying “It is unclear if the compensatory mitigation plan will sufficiently’’ take care of the federal requirements.

Perry disputed that, saying the mitigation plan put forth initially is a federally accepted way of offsetting wetlands and stream losses.

Some of the disagreement between Perry’s company and the EPA and DNR centered on whether additional wetlands and streams needed to be protected in South Carolina’s Piedmont region because part of the Scout project is in the Piedmont.

The other part of the Scout project is in the sand hills/coastal plain, and most of the wetlands and stream offset work was originally going to occur in that area with the purchase of the 5,000 acres near Congaree National Park.

Federal law favors protecting land or restoring wetlands and creeks in nearby watersheds similar to the ones where development projects are destroying wetlands and streams.

The Southern Environmental Law Center noted this in a June 29, 2023, letter to the federal government. The letter said there was a “disagreement’’ over how much of the Scout property is in the Piedmont, and therefore how much mitigation needed to be done in the Piedmont.

Ultimately, the Commerce Department consented to the extra work, despite the dispute, because it needed to move ahead, those familiar with the issue said.

Congaree Riverkeeper Bill Stangler said restoring degraded creeks in a national forest could control mud from eroding downstream to the Broad River, a source of drinking water for Columbia. The river eventually connects with the lower Saluda to form the Congaree near downtown Columbia.

“I found it interesting just how excited some of the agency folks were to see that project actually getting moving forward, because they’ve been talking about it for a while,’’ said Stangler, who was not involved in detailed discussions about the national forest stream work.

The Sumter National Forest work, in a section of the preserve roughly between Columbia and the Gaffney-Charlotte area, has been of interest to the service for years. The work will reconnect streams to old flood plains, reduce sedimentation and stabilize stream banks, while helping wildlife, the Forest Service said in Aug. 11 email to The State. All told, more than 18 miles of streams would be improved.

Scores of species of crayfish, mussels, fish, frogs and ducks will benefit from the work, Forest Service spokesman Greg Cunningham’s email said.

The company chosen to oversee the stream work is EcoSystem Planning and Restoration, which has offices in Texas, Maryland, Tennessee and North Carolina. The company, commonly referred to as EPR, has become experienced at environmental restoration projects since it was founded in 2012, according to its website. The company revived the 2014 plan to offset the impacts of the proposed nuclear plant in South Carolina.

Records show that the DNR recommended taking a second look at the 2014 proposal to restore streams in the Sumter National Forest.

Officials with EPR and the Department of Natural resources said the project will be a good one because it will help reduce the flow of silt.

“Restoration of these streams will benefit the aquatic ecosystems not only in the Sumter National Forest, but downstream into the Broad River,’’ the DNR said in a written statement.

Congaree land and Shelton Island

The sizable cost of offsetting Scout’s impacts at Blythewood isn’t confined to the national forest work, records show.

South Carolina’s decision to protect the Congaree and Shelton Island tracts involves properties not known to be in immediate danger of being turned into subdivisions or other types of development. Yet buying them cost more than the county-assessed fair market value of the land, records show.

Records in the Fairfield County Assessor’s Office show the state is paying $825,000 for the Shelton Island property that is part of the Scout mitigation package.

That’s more than twice the fair market value of the land before it was sold, records show.

Russ Brown, whose father acquired Shelton Island about 20 years ago for $200,000, said his family agreed to sell the property after being approached by the Open Space Institute, a representative of the state.

Brown and Co. Landbrokers had been advertising the island for sale before the deal was struck, according to a listing on the company’s web site.

Brown, listed as a contact for the sale of Shelton Island, said it’s difficult to compare county property records to the ultimate sales price. County records are often a baseline, founded on mass property appraisals, rather than a specific appraisal done for individual property that is to be purchased, say some real estate experts.

But Brown said the state is getting a good deal for what he described as an ecologically important island.

“This property was loaded with hardwoods, walnuts, lots of different varieties of oak trees; it had just a real variety of wildlife and vegetation out there,’’ Brown said.

Also, in contrast to what county assessor’s office records show, Shelton Island’s owners had studies done before the sale – and the value was in line with the actual purchase price, Brown said.

Despite those assurances, the Open Space Institute, which will own the property until it is turned over to the U.S. Forest Service, declined to release an appraisal showing the presale value of Shelton Island.

Questions at one point surfaced about the price being paid for Shelton Island because the U.S. Forest Service may eventually have bought the land anyway. The service had tried to acquire the island before the Scout mitigation effort surfaced, a spokesman said.

Pointing out the remote location of Shelton Island, the Southern Environmental Law Center also said threats of development “appear to be only vague possibilities, rather than an actual threat to the property,’’ according to a 2023 letter the organization sent the Army Corps of Engineers.

Shelton Island is a densely wooded land formation in the middle of the Broad River between Fairfield and Union counties. There is almost no development nearby and no bridge connects it to the mainland. The island is virtually surrounded by the Sumter National Forest.

In Richland County, the land being saved for conservation near Congaree National Park was owned formerly by members of the Boardman and Beidler families, wealthy Midwest residents with extensive landholdings in South Carolina.

Broken down, the 5,000 acres sold for the Scout mitigation in Richland County showed significant gaps between the county appraised value and the actual sales prices.

One tract, a 2,966 acre parcel, sold for $17.8 million in October 2023, or about $6,000 per acre. It was previously valued by the Richland County Assessor’s Office at $4.5 million, or about $1,517 per acre.

The other tract, a 1,912-acre property, sold for $9.3 million in October 2023, or about $4,900 per acre. It was previously valued at $2.5 million by the county, or about $1,307 per acre.

Efforts to reach representatives of the Boardmans and Beidlers for comment were unsuccessful. The Beidlers provided the original land for Congaree National Park in Richland County and for the Beidler Forest in Dorchester County.

Some real estate experts say it’s not unusual for county values to be lower than actual sales prices because the county provides basic values for tax purposes. So they say it isn’t fair to compare assessed values to actual sales prices. A parcel of land sells for what the buyer is willing to pay, they say.

Even so, the amount spent for the two rural Congaree tracts in Richland County – $4,900 and $6,000 per acre – also exceeded the per-acre-price of some other rural land the state has protected for conservation in recent years.

One recent property of comparable size to the two Richland tracts, Snow’s Island in eastern South Carolina’s Florence County, was acquired through state and federal money for about $2,780 per acre, according to the state Conservation Bank, which specializes in protecting land from development. Snow’s Island is more than 5,000 acres.

The state bought some smaller tracts in Georgetown County and Aiken County for under $3,700 per acre, bank records show.

Those comparisons are not absolute because the value of land and the sales price sometimes depend on where the property is located and what the demand is for the property. Some land acquired by the state for conservation – in development pressured areas of the mountains and the coast – cost the public $8,700 to nearly $13,000 per acre, respectively, bank records show.

Factors Richland County used in establishing values for the 5,000 acres near the Congaree River were its relatively remote location and its proximity to the Westinghouse nuclear fuel plant on Bluff Road, Richland County Assessor Fred Descy said in an interview with The State.

Descy said his office determined that “the land is not going to be developed for quite some time.’’

The nuclear fuel plant property has extensive groundwater contamination from decades of making atomic fuel rods and is the subject of state cleanup efforts, although no contamination is known to have escaped the fuel factory site. The fuel plant is on Bluff Road near the 5,000 acres the state is acquiring.

Mitigation can be expensive

The Open Space Institute’s Berry said it’s not easy negotiating a bargain basement price on land that is needed to compensate for the loss of wetlands and streams at an industrial site.

If landowners know their property is being sought to offset the impacts of a development project, it can drive up the price, he and others agreed.

Commerce said the Richland and Fairfield property owners were approached by representatives of the state about buying their property. Real estate websites show the Brown land company had been marketing Shelton Island for sale.

“None of the properties were being actively listed, but instead were sought out due to their location (in relation to the Corps mitigation service area maps) and their respective mitigation values and general desirability as mitigation sites,’’ Commerce spokeswoman Kelly Coakley said in an email.

The Commerce Department said 13 other chunks of land were considered for protection to offset the Scout impacts, but were ultimately rejected.

Those properties included land in the Crane Creek section of Richland County, an area near the Scout site that would have likely met the goal of mitigation sites being in the same watersheds as industrial sites that destroy wetlands and streams.

Stream and wetlands restoration work in the Crane Creek watershed also could have helped mollify concerns that minority communities downstream from the project site might be flooded with runoff.

The Southern Environmental Law Center’s 2023 letter to the Corps said protecting land in Crane Creek’s watershed “would provide benefits to downstream environmental justice communities.’’

But Commerce said only 309 acres were identified in the Crane Creek area as possible mitigation properties.

Other tracts of land considered by the state included Goose Pond, an 1,184-acre area in lower Richland County near Congaree National Park; Big Wateree Creek, a 6,111-acre area in Fairfield County; and the 2,139-acre Little River area of Fairfield County.

Commerce said none of them generated enough mitigation credit to offset the Scout losses. The mitigation land was chosen after talking with environmental agencies, the email said.

“The Congaree and Shelton Island properties were selected due to their locations and ability to satisfy (in large, block quantities) a significant portion of the mitigation credit needs for the project,’’ Coakley’s email said.

Perry said the owners of the Richland and Fairfield tracts knew the land would be suitable as mitigation for industrial projects and realized the land was being sought specifically to offset Scout’s wetlands and stream impacts. That drove up the price, he said.

“The Congaree and Shelton properties were valued based on the mitigation value … not merely as raw land purchases,’’ according to a statement from Commerce.

In the case of the 5,000 acres, the state “got a fair deal,’’ the Open Space Institute’s Berry said.

“Did we get a big bargain, according to our appraisal? No,’’ Berry said. “But I will tell you that we didn’t grossly overpay, or meaningfully overpay.’’

Alternative Minimum Tax Exemption Amounts. For tax year 2026, the exemption amount for unmarried individuals is $90,100 and begins to phase out at $500,000 ($140,200 for married couples filing jointly for whom the exemption begins to phase out at $1,000,000).

Estate Tax Credits. Estates of decedents who die during 2026 have a basic exclusion amount of $15,000,000, up from a total of $13,990,000 for estates of decedents who died in 2025.

Adoption Credits. The maximum credit allowed for adoptions for tax year 2026 is the amount of qualified adoption expenses up to $17,670, up from $17,280 for 2025. For tax year 2026, the amount of credit that may be refundable is $5,120.

Employer-Provided Childcare Tax Credit. For tax year 2026, the OBBB significantly enhances an important credit for employers; it increases the maximum amount of employer-provided childcare tax credit from $150,000 to $500,000 ($600,000 if the employer is an eligible small business).

Other notable items affected by indexing

Earned Income Tax Credits. The tax year 2026 maximum Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) amount is $8,231 for qualifying taxpayers who have three or more qualifying children, up from $8,046 for tax year 2025. Revenue Procedure 2025-32 contains a table providing maximum EITC amount for other categories, income thresholds and phase-outs.

For cafeteria plans that permit the carryover of unused amounts, the maximum carryover amount is $680, an increase of $20 from tax years beginning in 2025.

Medical Savings Accounts. For tax year 2026, participants who have self-only coverage in a Medical Savings Account, the plan must have an annual deductible that is not less than $2,900, up $50 from tax year 2025 – but not more than $4,400, an increase of $100 from tax year 2025. For self-only coverage, the maximum out-of-pocket expense amount is $5,850, up $150 from 2025. For tax year 2026, for family coverage, the annual deductible is not less than $5,850, up from $5,700 for 2025; however, the deductible cannot be more than $8,750, up $200 from the limit for tax year 2025. For family coverage, the out-of-pocket expense limit is $10,700 for tax year 2026, an increase of $200 from tax year 2025.

Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. For tax year 2026, the foreign earned income exclusion is $132,900 up from $130,000 for tax year 2025.

Annual Exclusion for Gifts. For tax year 2026, the annual exclusion for gifts remains at $19,000. (However, the annual exclusion for gifts to a spouse who is not a citizen of the United States increases to $194,000 for calendar year 2026, up $4,000 from calendar year 2025.)

Items unaffected by indexing

By statute, certain items that were indexed for inflation in the past are currently not adjusted.

Personal Exemptions. For tax year 2026, personal exemptions remain at 0, as in tax year 2025. The elimination of the personal exemption was a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and was made permanent by OBBB. (The personal exemption described here does not include the senior deduction added by OBBB.)

Itemized Deductions. The limitation on itemized deductions was previously eliminated for tax years 2018 - 2025. The elimination of the limitation was made permanent by OBBB, although it imposes a limitation on the tax benefit from itemized deductions for those taxpayers in the highest tax bracket (37%).

Lifetime Learning Credits. The modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) amount used to phase out the Lifetime Learning Credit has not been adjusted for inflation for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2020. The Lifetime Learning Credit is phased out for taxpayers with MAGI between $80,000 and $90,000 ($160,000 and $180,000 for joint returns).",https://www.irs.gov/themes/custom/pup_base/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-09 11:05:54.305691

They were among 223 energy-related projects cut around the country. In San Joaquin County, the job training program went to the Housing Authority and the hydrogen plant was to operate in Lodi.

The job training program was aimed at those living in affordable housing and the disadvantaged. It would have offered skills, including certifications and degrees, needed for employment in the electric vehicle industry, Peter Ragsdale, executive director of the Housing Authority of San Joaquin County, told Stocktonia.

“Investing in living-wage employment opportunities has other significant benefits, including increased self-sufficiency and meaningful economic mobility,” Ragsdale said.

He expressed regret about the funding loss, the amount of which was not immediately available.

“I’m disappointed as the programs have made profound changes in participants’ employment trajectories,” Ragsdale said.

The Lodi Energy Center Hydrogen Project was envisioned as a chance to showcase the use of the clean fuel to produce electricity while powering vehicles, port operations and research.

“It’s outrageous that the Department of Energy is pulling the plug on this vital project. Valley families desperately need cheaper energy, better air quality, and good paying jobs. This project was a win-win-win,” said U.S. Rep. Josh Harder, D-Tracy, in a statement.

Harder, who had been a strong advocate for the plant, said he is calling on the DOE to reverse the decision, though the administration’s decision appeared to have strong political overtones.

Many of the projects canceled were in states that President Donald Trump lost in the November election. NOTUS reported the administration canceled billions in hydrogen project funding in California and the Pacific Northwest, but left similar projects in states that voted for Trump — Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Ohio, South Dakota, Pennsylvania and Indiana — alone. The same was also true for other types of energy projects.

The administration said many of the canceled projects were rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration and lacked adequate documentation.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellation’s deliver on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright in a statement about the axing of projects.

In announcing it had secured federal funding in 2023, Lodi said the project would have used treated wastewater from the White Slough Pollution Control Facility to make it more sustainable. It would have added jobs and allowed a 300-watt power plant to operate with a blend of natural gas and hydrogen. In vehicles, hydrogen is emission free.

Harder said the project would not only have cut energy bills but helped clean up the air. Stockton and Sacramento, he said, have some of the worst air quality among metropolitan areas in the country.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (EEHIC) and the Residential Clean Energy Credit (RCEC) apply to a range of home improvements, from replacing windows and air conditioners to installing solar panels and geothermal heat pumps.

Instituted under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, both tax breaks were expanded under the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which pushed their expiration date to 2032. With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, however, that cut-off was moved up to Jan. 1, 2026. (The OBBA also put an end to the $7,500 EV tax credit.)

There’s a lot of money to be saved: Households that claimed the EEHIC in 2023 were able to deduct an average of $880 from their federal returns. The average deduction for the Residential Clean Energy Credit was $5,000.

Some projects will take time to complete, however, especially since you’re in competition with other homeowners facing the same deadline.

With just a few months left, Loyola University environmental policy professor Gilbert Michaud says larger projects may be too ambitious.

“Homeowners may want to focus on the smaller projects that can still capture the tax credits and cut energy bills,” Michaud told CNBC Select, pointing to window replacements, insulation, new appliances and even heat pumps.

“These types of projects can be done in a matter of weeks,” he added, “and will deliver immediate energy savings.”

How much are the home energy tax credits worth?

Both credits are worth 30% of qualified expenses. You can write off a maximum of $3,200 with the EEHIC, including up to $1,200 for energy-efficient doors, windows, skylights, A/C, and insulation. A separate deduction of up to $2,000 is available if you buy and install a heat pump, water heater or biomass stove or boiler by year's end.

Category Maximum credit Home energy audit by certified auditor$150Energy Star-certified windows, doors, skylights, insulation$1,200 (combined)HVAC, heat pump, biomass stove or boiler$2,000Electrical upgradesGo towards $1,200 limit

Except for fuel cell property (which is capped at $500 per half-kilowatt of capacity), the Residential Clean Energy Credit has no dollar limit. Based on an average cost of $27,000, a homeowner who installs solar panels could enjoy tax savings of more than $8,100.

The credits are nonrefundable, so the amount you receive can't exceed your total tax debt.

These upgrades also have long-term implications for your household expenses. In a study by the University of California’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, three-quarters of homeowners who installed rooftop solar were able to lower their electricity bills. The median annual savings came to $691.

Read: 6 tax breaks no homeowner should ignore

Energy-efficient enhancements can also be a boon when you’re ready to sell: According to Zillow, 86% of homebuyers said having at least one climate-resilient feature was an important factor in their buying decision.

Still, when these tax breaks sunset, Michaud predicts a big decline in energy-efficient home improvements.

“We know that financial incentives play a major role in adoption rates — without them, many homeowners will downsize, delay or cancel projects altogether,” he said. “While some affluent homeowners will still make investments, broader adoption is challenging without policy support.”

(Reuters) -General Motors is scrapping a program aimed at allowing its dealers to continue offering for several months a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles following the Sept. 30 expiration of the federal subsidy, the company said Wednesday.

Toward the end of last month, GM devised a plan to have its in-house lending arm initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The company planned to apply for the federal $7,500 credit on those cars hours ahead of the deadline, and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

The idea behind the program was to ease the impact of the expiration of the tax credit on dealers, who worried that they would be stuck with EVs that would be tough to sell. GM had planned to apply for the credit on tens of thousands of EVs in dealer stocks, according to people familiar with the plan.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters Wednesday. The automaker didn’t elaborate on its decision.

Ford rolled out a similar program ahead of the tax-credit expiration. It’s unclear if Ford is continuing its program. A spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

""The primary takeaway is that developing adaptive supply chain strategies is fundamental for the U.S. to be able to weather supply chain disruptions,"" Dvorkin said.
""Diversifying supply sources, creating strategic material reserves, and implementing risk management strategies all offer benefits to help the country mitigate supply chain shocks and continue providing uninterrupted energy supply for consumers nationwide,"" he added.
The team's ultimate goal is to create resilient, adaptable energy systems that can withstand supply chain fluctuations and evolve alongside growing energy demands.","Under current supply chain conditions, the United States is on track to fall significantly short of surging demand for three clean energy sources—wind, solar, and battery—due to the scarcity of critical raw materials, according to a new study from Johns Hopkins University.

This drastic shortfall could potentially be exacerbated by escalating trade wars and tariffs, and compounded by the surging demand for energy being fueled by the exponential growth of artificial intelligence. Unmet surges in energy use have the potential to cause widespread power outages, equipment damage, and increases in electricity rates.

In a new study published in npj Clean Energy, Johns Hopkins University researchers offer insight on the critical dependencies and challenges inherent in U.S. energy supply chains, and suggest how policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers can approach energy production to meet growing demand.

The report is a collaborative effort by the Johns Hopkins Ralph O'Connor Sustainable Energy Institute, the NSF Global Center EPICS, Net Zero Policy Lab, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, and the Johns Hopkins University Department of Political Science. The study finds that limited access to critical minerals and components threatens to stall the clean energy transition just as data centers fueled by AI push power demand to unprecedented levels, raising urgent concerns about climate targets and energy security.

""Even before the recent AI push, the U.S. was facing a rapidly growing demand for energy—particularly electricity—driven by an increase in electric vehicle and transportation systems, buildings, and data centers,"" said lead author Yury Dvorkin, an associate professor of civil and systems engineering. ""Our research highlights a pressing issue: While energy demand driven by AI growth and electrification is soaring, there's a stark gap between this demand and our supply capabilities.""

The researchers developed an optimization model to simulate supply chain conditions through 2050. Their analysis focuses on essential raw materials for wind, solar, and lithium-ion battery technologies, identifying bottlenecks that obstruct the nation from meeting its energy needs. The team's findings indicate that under current conditions, the country is on track to achieve just 65% of its energy goals, with several raw materials like nickel, aluminum, and silicon identified as fundamental to meeting energy demand.

""The primary takeaway is that developing adaptive supply chain strategies is fundamental for the U.S. to be able to weather supply chain disruptions.""

Yury Dvorkin

Associate professor, civil and systems engineering

The team's optimization model includes the ability to forecast material prices, estimate manufacturing capacities, and simulate geopolitical trade scenarios.

""All of these variables like pricing, regulatory constraints, material availability from either stable partners or autocratic regimes, and permitting timelines have the potential to prevent the U.S. from meeting escalating energy demands,"" Dvorkin said. ""Even when analyzing scenarios with unlimited raw materials, we found that other supply chain constraints would still prevent the country from fully meeting anticipated consumer demand.""

Despite the challenges, the researchers identified several options that could help close the gap between energy production and demand.

The team proposes enhancing domestic production and recycling capabilities for critical materials. This approach includes developing new mining projects, advancing recycling technologies, and establishing strong supply chains for secondary materials.

They suggest that policymakers consider supporting domestic material production through incentives like subsidies, tax breaks, and streamlined regulatory processes to reduce American dependence on imports.

The researchers also recommend promoting technological innovation to find alternatives for scarce materials, which could be realized through a combination of government funding and public-private partnerships as well as strengthening international collaboration to ensure a steady supply of critical materials. Strategic partnerships and trade agreements with stable and unstable trading partners could help secure more long-term access to essential resources.

""The primary takeaway is that developing adaptive supply chain strategies is fundamental for the U.S. to be able to weather supply chain disruptions,"" Dvorkin said.

""Diversifying supply sources, creating strategic material reserves, and implementing risk management strategies all offer benefits to help the country mitigate supply chain shocks and continue providing uninterrupted energy supply for consumers nationwide,"" he added.

In the near future, Dvorkin's team intends to build upon this work by exploring scenarios in which supply chains and grid capacities can be dynamically adjusted to maximize resource availability. The team's ultimate goal is to create resilient, adaptable energy systems that can withstand supply chain fluctuations and evolve alongside growing energy demands.",https://api.hub.jhu.edu/factory/sites/default/files/styles/soft_crop_1300/public/2025-10/wind-solar-battery-getty.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 11:04:28.212298

As electricity demand grows and rate pressures mount, nuclear energy is once again drawing attention in Annapolis. Long a steady source of carbon-free power, nuclear is increasingly viewed as a potential pillar of Maryland’s energy future. This deep dive reviews the state’s nuclear history, recent legislative developments, and what may lie ahead as new reactor technologies approach deployment.

A Brief History and Current Status of Nuclear Energy

Maryland’s nuclear experience centers on a single facility: the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant in Calvert County. Commissioned between 1975 and 1977, the two-reactor facility remains the state’s only nuclear station and one of its most reliable power producers. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as of mid-2025 nuclear generation ranked second statewide at roughly 1.24 million megawatt-hours (MWh)—just behind natural gas at 1.5 million MWh. Hydroelectric (263,000 MWh) and coal (242,000 MWh) trailed far behind, underscoring nuclear’s outsize contribution.

Regionally, Maryland’s reliance on nuclear power exceeds that of most neighboring states. Virginia, with two nuclear plants, generated approximately 2.6 million MWh from nuclear power compared to 6 million MWh from natural gas, while Pennsylvania produced 6.3 million MWh of nuclear power and 13.5 million MWh from natural gas. Though those states produce more electricity overall, Maryland’s share of in-state generation from nuclear ranks among the highest in the Mid-Atlantic, a distinction driven entirely by Calvert Cliffs’ consistent performance.

The Next Generation Energy Act of 2025

The 2025 legislative session—dubbed Maryland’s “Session of Energy”—brought sweeping policy updates through the Next Generation Energy Act (HB 1035/SB 937). The Act codifies that it is now state policy to encourage nuclear power development as part of Maryland’s clean-energy strategy. It directs the Maryland Energy Administration (MEA), Public Service Commission (PSC), and Department of Natural Resources to pursue cooperative cost-sharing agreements with federal and regional partners for potential new nuclear generation.

A major procedural innovation in the Act is the creation of an expedited permitting track for “dispatchable energy” projects, explicitly including nuclear reactors. Qualifying projects can seek a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) decision in roughly nine to ten months—significantly shorter than the multiyear reviews typical for large power projects. The Act also empowers the PSC to oversee competitive application rounds and consider long-term pricing mechanisms, allowing Maryland to assess nuclear as one piece of a broader reliability and decarbonization framework.

Next Generation Energy Act Fiscal Note

Small Modular Reactors: What They Are and Maryland’s Outlook

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are compact, factory-fabricated nuclear systems—typically under 300 megawatts—that can be assembled on-site and scaled to local demand. Their modularity promises lower construction risk, and many employ passive safety systems that automatically shut down and cool without external power. The Next Generation Energy Act tasks MEA with exploring SMR siting on or near federal properties, such as military installations, that could host reactors serving both base and grid needs.

Nationally, early SMR projects—such as those proposed by the Tennessee Valley Authority and in Ontario, Canada—remain in the licensing phase, with estimated costs near $6 billion for a 300 MW unit. Developers expect costs to decline as designs mature and supply chains scale. For Maryland, realizing an SMR project would likely require substantial investment and coordination with federal partners, but the state’s streamlined permitting and regional planning efforts have positioned it to move quickly when the technology becomes viable.

Conclusion

Nuclear power has quietly supplied Maryland with steady, carbon-free electricity for half a century, and state leaders are now revisiting its potential role in a diversified, resilient energy portfolio. Through the Next Generation Energy Act, Maryland has laid the groundwork to evaluate next-generation nuclear options—including SMRs—without committing to specific projects. While significant technical, financial, and regulatory hurdles remain, the state’s proactive policy framework ensures that, should nuclear innovation fulfill its promise, Maryland will be ready to capture its benefits for decades to come.",https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/wp-content/uploads/10.8.2025.png,N,,2025-10-09 11:04:33.658558

Michael Bennet and the administration of Gov. Jared Polis denounced the pending elimination of 34 federal energy grants to Colorado last week, charging the cuts are politically motivated.

The $500 million-plus in grants on the chopping block funded assorted projects and studies, many involving green energy, and are among more than 300 such energy grants, totaling nearly $8 billion, that will be canceled nationwide.

Polis’ energy office issued a statement accusing the Trump administration of using the cuts to target states like Colorado that went for Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris last November. Bennet lashed out at U.S. Energy Secretary and fellow Coloradan Chris Wright — founder and former CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy — charging he let Colorado down.

Bennet claimed Wright’s priority “is to serve the political agenda of President Trump, not the interests of our state or the American West.”

Strong words, no doubt calculated to strike a chord in a state where Trump baiting has become a ritual for elected Democrats, like Bennet and Polis, who wield all the levers of power.

Political rhetoric aside, however, Coloradans won’t lose much to these cuts — which grantees still can appeal — and U.S. taxpayers, including those in our state, will gain plenty.

Permit us to add some much-needed perspective.

For starters, as reported by our news affiliate Colorado Politics, a quarter of the awards, about $3 billion, were approved between the election in November and Trump’s inauguration last January. That suggests they were handed out in a rush by the outgoing Biden administration — probably as a political reward to the same states the Trump administration is accused of targeting. In other words, politics as usual.

“On day one, the Energy Department began the critical task of reviewing billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard,” Wright said in a press statement.

As Colorado Politics also reported, some of the projects awarded to Colorado-based entities are actually in other places — including in “red” states, such as Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Wyoming and Kansas. (That’ll teach ‘em to vote for Trump!)

What really should raise eyebrows, though, are the specifics of some of the grants soon to be axed by Wright’s Energy Department. Like $50 million awarded in January, days before President Trump’s inauguration, to the Tribal Energy Consortium, a “clean” energy initiative for 20 tribes in seven states, including Colorado’s Southern Ute and Ute Mountain tribes.

According to our news affiliate in the nation’s capital, the Washington Examiner, the consortium is actually based in New Mexico, not Colorado, and the grant raised eyebrows given that the consortium’s total funding in the two previous years had never exceeded $50,000 annually.

The grant’s purpose? According to the project’s squishy description at the time the grant was awarded, it would “empower tribal communities to reduce methane emissions on tribal-owned-and-operated marginal conventional wells and at oil and gas facilities on tribal lands.”

Not all the studies and projects were so dubious, but as Wright’s Energy Department now maintains, all the canceled projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Expendable, in other words.

Sounds like Wright is serving not only the “interests of our state” but also in fact of every U.S. taxpayer — by paring a bloated federal behemoth and our nearly $38 trillion national debt.",https://gazette.com/wp-content/uploads/default-social-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:13:13.741571

The notice of funding for coal projects draws directly from that July study to justify emergency funding for coal recommissioning and modernization, and points to the executive orders declaring a national energy emergency.
This comes as ever more coal plants announce plans to retire; U.S. power companies have announced the closure or gas conversion of more than nine gigawatts of coal-fired capacity in 2025 alone.
But crucially, these plants are closing down for economic reasons: In most contexts, coal power is simply more expensive and less efficient than fossil gas or renewables.","The Department of Energy has released additional details about how it plans to allocate the $625 million in coal investments it announced last week.

The vast majority of the funds — $525 million — will be distributed via 50% cost share awards, managed by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. That office, which has been gutted over the last nine months and is now operating with a skeleton workforce, will issue up to ten awards.

Awards will target two of the topic areas outlined by DOE last week in its initial notice of the funding: projects seeking to recommission or modernize coal power plants, and coal projects providing “energy affordability, reliability, and resiliency” to rural communities.

The awards will draw from unobligated Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, DOE said. That includes the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas Program, and two of OCED’s carbon capture programs. However, the notice explains that the awards won’t require “immediate CCUS installation.” Carbon management components can be phased in at later stages, it explains.

This is a move that the administration appears to have been preparing for over the course of the last several months. In April, President Trump signed several executive orders instructing Energy Secretary Chris Wright to create a framework for keeping retiring coal plants up and running — a move which, according to some studies, could cost ratepayers $6 billion annually.

In May, DOE issued a mandate to delay the retirement of Michigan’s Campbell coal plant, and in July the agency released a dubious grid reliability study claiming that retiring coal and gas-fired power stations will lead to blackouts.

The notice of funding for coal projects draws directly from that July study to justify emergency funding for coal recommissioning and modernization, and points to the executive orders declaring a national energy emergency.

Activities to be funded include restarting, repairing, and upgrading coal units, with a particular focus on efforts to serve “critical loads” including defense installations, semiconductor factories, hyperscale data centers, and critical mineral processing plants.

This comes as ever more coal plants announce plans to retire; U.S. power companies have announced the closure or gas conversion of more than nine gigawatts of coal-fired capacity in 2025 alone.

Coal comes with high emissions, contributing significantly to human-caused climate change. It accounted for roughly 55% of total carbon dioxide emissions from the U.S. power sector in 2022, as well as harmful gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and other particulates, which cause health problems for those living near coal production.

But crucially, these plants are closing down for economic reasons: In most contexts, coal power is simply more expensive and less efficient than fossil gas or renewables. There are concerns that Trump administration efforts to keep them open would increase electricity rates without improving system reliability. Accordingly, an analysis by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis called these efforts “legally questionable.”

OCED on the chopping block

The coal generation funding notice follows news that DOE is terminating hundreds of awards issued during the Biden administration, including at least 61 OCED awards worth more than $12 billion.

As electricity demand grows, alongside wind and solar’s share in the U.S. energy mix, concerns about renewables’ reliability are being raised more frequently — including at the highest levels of the federal government.

“With the electricity grid, you have to match supply and demand in every moment in time,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said recently on Fox News. “With wind and solar, you don’t know when they’re going to be there, and you don’t know when they’re going to go away.”

Wright went on to say the development of renewables has led to an “extra distribution grid” that has raised energy prices.

But utility planners, grid operators and analysts say wind, solar and batteries are an important part of an evolving power system in which intermittent resources can be reliably scheduled and called upon using sophisticated software and other tools.

They also point to both the levelized cost of electricity for renewables and their competitiveness in automated energy markets that select the least cost units to run in each hour.

“System operators don’t decide whether resources bidding into the market are good or bad,” said Rob Gramlich, president of energy sector consultant Grid Strategies, in an interview.

“There is no central decision maker,” he said. “Markets don’t play favorites.”

With generators retiring, demand rising, and construction, financing, permitting and supply chain challenges growing, operators and analysts acknowledged concerns over the future of the U.S. power system. Many called for diversification of resources, including renewables and storage, to protect electricity reliability and affordability.

“The objective of planning is a portfolio of diverse resources at the least cost possible to avoid outsized impacts from any single one,” said Michael Eugenis, Arizona Public Service’s director of resource planning.

APS is pursuing renewables alongside more natural gas to maintain reliability in its territory, he said.

“That is not the same as a second set or a shadow set of resources,” he added.

Automated markets are selecting renewables

One of the major concerns cited by Wright and others is the intermittent nature of renewables and the impact of that on grid reliability.

One of the ways grid operators measure reliability is using a metric called effective load carrying capability, or ELCC.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

ELCC is a complex calculation based on comparing what portion of a resource’s nameplate capacity it produces on average in simulations of decades that include factors that cause it to vary, like performance, supply and demand. For fossil resources, variabilities are caused by things like maintenance outages and fuel supply issues. Weather variations impact wind and solar.

ELCCs vary by region and by each system’s portfolio makeup, but nuclear power generally has the highest ELCC, meaning on average over the years, it produces the closest percentage of its nameplate capacity.

In the PJM Interconnection, the country’s largest grid, nuclear was assigned an ELCC of 95% in its most recent auction,

Fixed-tilt solar had the lowest at 8%, and tracking solar was 11%. Onshore wind was 41%, offshore was 69%; storage was between 50% and 72%; gas was between 60% and 78%, and coal was 83%.

“System operators don’t decide whether resources bidding into the market are good or bad ... Markets don’t play favorites.”

Rob Gramlich

president of Grid Strategies

But despite their relatively low ELCCs, automated markets are consistently choosing renewables over other resources because they are cheaper at the time the grid needs them.

“The automated market mechanisms use all the relevant variables that affect load to pick the cheapest resources,” said Richard Doying, Grid Strategies vice president and a former executive vice president for market and grid strategy for the former Midcontinent Independent System Operator.

Those resources are bid out, and “then the next cheapest resources, and so on,” Doying said.

“The markets are selecting wind and solar despite their low ELCCs and low capacity values because the return justifies the investment,” he added.

When they are both generating at the same time, renewables are often cheaper than fossil fuel power.

One reason for this is that the fuel and maintenance costs for fossil-based resources are significant, continuous and volatile. Natural gas prices, for example, have nearly doubled since 2024, but are still lower than they were in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The fuels for wind and solar are cost-free, maintenance outage costs are significantly less, and the capital expenditures to build projects are typically amortized over 20 years.

“If natural gas was the cheapest option to meet the peak, the markets would select it,” said Sean Kelly, co-founder and CEO of forecast provider Amperon and a former energy analyst.

When the sun’s not shining

Kelly said today’s advanced load and weather forecasting enhances the reliability of a resource portfolio with a high renewables penetration.

While good forecasting can alleviate much of the need for backup generation, he said, rising demand for power will likely require more firm generation to fill the gaps when there is no sun or wind.

The ability to choose the cheapest available power source in real time is why grid operators say renewables are an important part of the same, increasingly flexible power system — not a separate system.

“We don’t have different systems; we have a portfolio of resources and capabilities that meet the needs of the system,” said Mark Rothleder, senior vice president and COO for the California Independent System Operator, in an interview.

California has one of the highest renewables penetrations in the United States. California also has some of the highest electricity rates. Some observers link those to things to argue that renewables drive up energy costs.

But other states with high levels of renewable power have comparatively low rates compared to the national average.

In Iowa, for example, wind turbines generated 59% of the state’s electricity in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Iowa was also in the 10 states with the lowest average electricity price that year.

While solar and wind are not always available locally when demand is high, storage penetrations are rising and some states are moving toward more regional energy markets where cheaply-produced energy from renewables can be more easily traded across state boundaries.

The New York Independent System Operator said in a recent report that although “duration-limited” generators like wind and solar require standby resources when the availability of the renewable fleet diminishes, “no generating type operates at full power, full time.”

Thinking of resources as either intermittent or backup oversimplifies the complexity of the grid, experts said.

“Wind and solar don’t have to produce 100% of the time because people aren’t consuming all available electricity 100% of the time,” said Beth Garza, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute think tank and former ERCOT market monitor CEO.

“It is easy to vilify solar and wind,” Garza said. But regardless of the resource mix, “the average electricity load is only about half the peak demand.”

When demand peaks

Power systems have long been required to have reserve margins over the highest expected peak demand, and the growth of wind and solar has not changed that, said Julia Matevosyan, an associate director and chief engineer with the Energy Systems Integration Group and a former ERCOT planning engineer.

But advancements in software and market shifts have democratized incentives for energy production, conservation and storage in ways that can smooth demand peaks and deploy resources as needed.

This flexibility can optimize wind, solar and batteries to deliver low cost electricity more reliably than “a more limited set of traditional resources,” Matevosyan said.

Over the summer, California deployed what some advocates have called the largest virtual power plant in the world when several aggregators discharged 539 MW of average output from more than 100,000 customer-sited batteries during peak demand between 7 and 9 p.m.

A Brattle Group study of the deployment commissioned by Sunrun and Tesla Energy, both of which participated in the VPP program, concluded that it could reduce the need for gas peaker plants and potentially save ratepayers $206 million between 2025 and 2028.

Ryan Hledik, one of the report’s authors, said the VPP makes better use of assets that have already been deployed.

“There are a growing number of examples of VPPs scaling faster and at a lower cost than conventional resources,” Hledik said.

Renewables continue to dominate new generation as demand rises

Demand is rising for the first time in two decades. Last year, the U.S. used more electricity than ever before, and the EIA projects demand to grow more than 2% per year until at least 2026. Farther out, the predictions vary widely and are highly dependent on the growth of data centers, electrification and manufacturing.

The vast majority of new generation resources coming online now are renewable, with solar in the lead, followed by wind. Thrugh July 2025. In the first seven months of 2025, solar accounted for over 16 GW of the 21.5 GW added to the U.S. power system. Wind accounted for almost 3.3 GW and natural gas for 2.2 GW, the September Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Infrastructure Update reported.

Federal tax credits and other incentives that are being phased out boosted renewable development. But experts say even without that support, the economics are also in renewables’ favor.

“Wind and solar don’t have to produce 100% of the time because people aren’t consuming all available electricity 100% of the time.”

Beth Garza

senior fellow at R Street Institute and former ERCOT market monitor CEO.

The levelized cost of electricity for utility-scale solar and onshore wind remain “the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation on an unsubsidized basis,” according to Lazard analysis. Calculating a technology’s LCOE involves its capital cost, fuel cost, capacity factor, and other values that vary by location and time.

Recently, renewable trade groups have warned of a slowdown in the solar industry. But alternative resources, like natural gas, face their own challenges, from lengthy planning and approval processes to rising fuel prices and years-long equipment backlogs.

“The newest, most efficient natural gas peaker plants are expensive to build and are likely to become more expensive to run because of competition for natural gas,” Garza said. “The market’s answer to load growth is still to build more wind, solar, and batteries because they are the cheaper and faster to build.”

Even if the tax credits still existed, EVs in the US still have the same four challenges they always have had:

1) not enough charging stations across the country - clumped certain areas and non-existent in others.

2) range and range anxiety (related to #1)

3) battery costs, recycling, and environmental issues

4) high initial cost to acquire EVs (which is what the tax credits were meant to address)

1, 3, and 4 are solvable. 3, however, is more difficult

It might be tempting for people to claim that the manufacturers were just pocketing the EV credit since, like the article suggests, Hyundai/Kia among others are offering reductions in price to offset the missing credit. I want to make sure everyone is aware that that 9800 dollar credit does not match the previous price reductions they offered with the credit. A lease on an Ioniq 5 SE while the credit was active could be had for 189/m 4000 down. That same deal now is 260/m. The best deal available on the website for the EV6 Light Long Range is 390/m with 4000 down, but this is more than I paid for my EV6 Wind, with nothing down.

The prices absolutely have gone up now, and it's really disappointing. EVs are the future and creating another generation of ICE vehicles will only make sure our manufacturers are completely non-competitive wards of the state into perpetuity.

The textbook excuses, what page of the oil industry guide book were they gleaned from?

1) not enough charging stations across the country - clumped certain areas and non-existent in others. This was being taken care of by Biden’s IRA Act, which has now been cut by the Trump administration. Care to direct the blame?

2) range and range anxiety (related to #1). Millions do it every day. Anxiety? See a shrink.

3) battery costs, recycling, and environmental issues. Every auto manufacturer has already Created a subsidiary or has gotten into a partnership to recycle their own batteries, thus creating a true circular economy, we’re less and less raw material will ever be needed, unlike oil. See Redwood Industries

4) high initial cost to acquire EVs (which is what the tax credits were meant to address). high initial cost for more vehicles these days. There certainly are cheap EVs out there, with more to come.

The idea that the government can’t/doesn’t pick and choose winners is one of the most cancerous things to take root in the west. If the populous thinks the government can’t help them ontologically, eventually they’ll give up on the government.

Last time this was brought up, someone threw out a proposal for blue states, encompassing the majority of car sales (that point is important) to tax ICE vehicles more to subsidize their citizen’s EVs. With the price of ICE vehicles substantially elevated, and car manufacturers sales threatened, possibly accelerating development and sales of EVs. The petroleum industry would begin the lose power as its sales began to fall. Remember, China is on the downward slope already for oil use in transportation and the EU should be there quite soon.

If I was Rivian, I'd be trying to find a way to shove a range extender under the the hood and cut down the battery, but I think they just got kneecapped. All the other US manufacturers have ICE vehicles and trucks they can fall back on, but I think Rivian just got kneecapped.

It's just so fucking stupid.

No, I think Rivian will be fine. They're the inheritors of the high end Tesla customers. They're not politically incendiary, they're professionally run, their vehicles fit the American market to a T, have great features and look futuristic. They'll fill the hole that Tesla's fiasco has opened up.

Tesla is in a very bad spot after Musk lost his Presidential friend.

Europe sales are shrinking in a growing market.

Chinese sales are down because of competition.

They're not even competitive in the US market, which bars the Chinese completely.

Forget about the consumer tax credits, it's bad but workable with good products.

More importantly, Tesla just lost their most important govt subsidies: green credit payments from other OEMs that were driving profits. They probably don't have years to get robotaxies profitable (they're currently behind), even if it pays off without first mover advantage or any unique advantage.

They needed a home run after the cybertruck fiasco.

1, 3, and 4 are solvable. 3, however, is more difficult

1) Companies are working on this, would help if the government installed them at rest stops along our highways. If we can install vending machines, then we can install chargers.

2) Solid State Batteries are almost here, give it 2-4 years and suddenly EVs will be pushing 500-600 miles per charge. Quantumscape just showed off their latest production assembly (Cobra Seperator) which scales up for mass production. They are already working with Volkswagen and just announced a deal with Corning. They dont plan on making SSBs themselves, but license out the technology.

3) The mass production of batteries will bring down the costs. Theres maybe a dozen factories being built in the USA specifically for this purpose. How much cheaper will batteries get? I dont know. Theres also a few companies that show promise in recycling old batteries. Microvast is another Solid State Battery company, and they have a battery that can handle 6,000 charge cycles, which would last the lifetime of the EV itself, so less recycling would be needed.

Environmental issues are difficult, but a problem for any manufacturing, including ICE vehicles.

4) If you live in a house and dont mind it taking 6-8 hours to fully charge your EV, then level 1 chargers are incredibly cheap and easy to install. Its the level 3 chargers that cost $15-30k and absolute require a professional install.

I am not one to tout the current charging networks as enough, Superchargers still have corridors to fill as well as the old ones needing updates for more power and support for other manufacturers charging port locations and the rest of the networks are too flaky. But even though I live in a pretty big charger hole (50 to 80 miles to the first Supercharger) and not all corridors are covered, I think the network is close enough for most road trips which means everyone that can charge at home. There is a long time to go before we need to worry about those that can’t charge at home, and there’s plenty of time to build out the charging networks. Tesla continues to do so.

You offer the usual excuses that have been addressed.

You know what was the best thing that solved our range anxiety? Buying an EV and starting to drive it. I never had any real idea of how many miles I drove in a day, because realistically, I was measuring how much more I could drive in gas car using an analog gauge that went from F to E. Even with a ""miles remaining on tank"" computer, I had no idea how many miles I drove every day.

Now with an EV, I now that on days I drive to work, I put about 60 miles on the car. Other days, 5-10 miles. Occasionally, 90 miles. Buying a small Kia EV was the best decision we ever made.

This is precisely what we did. Even if one car needs to be ICE - preferably hybrid - there is no reason for the other not to be an EV. I drive an Ioniq5 I bought used for a tick over $30k and I'm fonder of it than any other car I've owned since my first one, an XJ Cherokee. It has impaired our ability to travel, commute, and go about our lives not at all.

And before anyone gets too shirty about ""but not everyone lives in a single family residence, how dare you forget about apartment dwellers"" the EV market could grow for years, maybe a decade, just by making inroads with single-family homeowners with garages.

Of note:

See How E.V. Road Trips Went From Impossible to Easy​

Sept. 29, 2025

The Upshot used charger location data from the Department of Energy to analyze more than 1,000 single-day trips connecting major U.S. cities. A decade ago, all but a handful of those routes had gaps of more than 100 miles between fast chargers. In many cases, those charging deserts stretched over 200 miles, making many routes effectively impassable for E.V.s.

By 2025, that had flipped. The vast majority of these routes now have a fast charger at least every 100 miles; most have far more than that.

Significant private investment continues to pour in. A group of major car manufacturers has started the Ionna network, which has committed to building 30,000 charging ports across the country. Ford and Rivian have each already built more than 100 fast-charging stations. Volkswagen funded the Electrify America network with $2 billion that it was required to set aside after cheating on diesel emission tests; the network now has around 1,000 fast-charging stations.

There are also major E.V. infrastructure companies building out their networks. In total, six big networks — Tesla, ChargePoint, EVgo, Electrify America, EV Connect and Blink — have built more than two-thirds of the country’s fast-charging stations. A number of smaller operators own the rest, including power companies like Hawaiian Electric, Florida Power and Light and Iowa’s MidAmerican, which have all become major fast-charger operators in their states.

And retailers and gas stations have joined the rush: Buc-ee’s, the supersize travel stop chain, is adding E.V. chargers to its stations, and Walmart has announced it will install thousands of fast chargers at its stores.

The investment isn't coming from one place, in other words. It's coming from everywhere, at an increasing rate.

It doesn't matter what administration is running things, billions are collected from gas taxes every year (federal, state, and sometimes local). If there's ever a significant percentage of electric cars on the road and not using gas then politicians are going to want to get that money somehow. New taxes are coming it's just a question of what form they are going to take.

I'm still very skeptical, not of solid-state batteries, but that 400+ mile ranges are going to ever be a thing in high-volume EVs. Towing packages on pickups and SUVs? Sure. Luxury vehicles that want to use range as a bragging point? Quite possibly. Off-road focused SUVs that want to sell the idea of being able to go anywhere? Maybe. But unless batteries get much, much cheaper, then having more battery than almost anyone would use in one stop just doesn't seem like it makes sense to me. Especially with solid state batteries that live up to their promises (really fast charging, no problem going from 0-100%, more tolerant of extreme temperatures). So I guess I don't understand why no one's talking about using the tech to make smaller and lighter 300-400 mile range batteries, rather than everyone talking about 500+ mile ranges.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, challenges the EPA’s August decision to halt the Solar for All program.
Created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the initiative was projected to help 900,000 households install rooftop or community solar.
Plaintiffs include the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, Solar United Neighbors, the Hopi Tribal Council, the Rhode Island Center for Justice, and solar installers in Georgia and Pennsylvania.
“EPA’s termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program is a betrayal,” Blanchard said.","A coalition of labor unions, nonprofits, solar companies, and homeowners filed suit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency. The group alleges the agency unlawfully terminated $7 billion in federal grants intended to expand solar access in marginalized and low-income communities, including tribal nations.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, challenges the EPA’s August decision to halt the Solar for All program. Created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the initiative was projected to help 900,000 households install rooftop or community solar. The program included more than $500 million in commitments to Indian Country.

Plaintiffs include the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, Solar United Neighbors, the Hopi Tribal Council, the Rhode Island Center for Justice, and solar installers in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs are asking the court to vacate EPA’s action and reinstate the program.

According to a press release from legal organization Lawyers for Good Government, which is part of a legal team representing the plaintiffs, the suit argues the EPA acted unlawfully by canceling grants that had already been awarded. The organization's executive vice president for Climate Change and Environmental Justice, Jillian Blanchard, said the agency’s claim that the funds were rescinded is “patently false and legally unsupportable” in a statement.

“EPA’s termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program is a betrayal,” Blanchard said. “This administration is sending a clear message: They will make Americans pay with their savings and their health in order to benefit the fossil fuel industry.”

According to reporting from the New York Times, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in August the agency no longer had authority to administer the program, citing Trump’s domestic policy bill, which he said eliminated “billions of green slush fund dollars.”

Tribal Business News previously reported that the termination cut more than $500 million in funding earmarked for tribal energy projects. Six tribal-focused organizations had received awards, including the Midwest Tribal Energy Resources Association, which said the loss would upend plans to deliver solar to 35 member tribes across the Great Lakes region. More money was coming in state programs, such as the Washington State Department of Commerce’s Solar for All plan.

The Solar for All termination was part of a wider rescission of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion allocation under the Inflation Reduction Act that also aimed to improve access to energy financing for both Native-serving green banks and Native community development financial institutions.

The fund included the National Clean Investment Fund ($14 billion) and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator ($6 billion), which also faced legal challenges after their terminations. Federal courts were initially sympathetic, but a 3-person panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals later sided with the EPA by a 2-1 decision that the lower court lacked jurisdiction. The decision found that the suit should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims as a contract violation case, which could take years, according to legal experts. The plaintiffs in the suit have since filed for a rehearing, asking the full Circuit Court to hear the case.

ARM, an energy marketing firm, said the project benefits from a long-term agreement with Sempra for shipment of natural gas for its Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project, which recently achieved its own final investment decision.
Earlier this month, Sempra said it would sell a 45% stake in its infrastructure unit for $10 billion, and has approved a $14 billion expansion of Port Arthur LNG project in Texas.

The 236-mile pipeline will include three segments – Mustang Mainline, Cougar lateral and the Golden triangle where the mainline will connect Katy Hub to Port Arthur.","(Reuters) – ARM Energy Holdings said on Thursday it has reached a final investment decision on its $2.3 billion Mustang Express Pipeline project in Texas, along with its partner Pacific Investment Management Company.

ARM, an energy marketing firm, said the project benefits from a long-term agreement with Sempra for shipment of natural gas for its Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project, which recently achieved its own final investment decision.

Earlier this month, Sempra said it would sell a 45% stake in its infrastructure unit for $10 billion, and has approved a $14 billion expansion of Port Arthur LNG project in Texas.

The U.S. is the world’s top LNG exporter with total capacity expected to reach 115 million MTPA this year, according to the country’s Energy Information Administration.

The industry has enjoyed strong global demand and policy support from President Donald Trump, who returned to office in January promising to unleash U.S. energy. He also reversed a freeze on new export permits.

The pipelines, which will be constructed and operated by ARM, will have a total capacity of 2.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) and are expected to be completed in late 2028 or early 2029.

The 236-mile pipeline will include three segments – Mustang Mainline, Cougar lateral and the Golden triangle where the mainline will connect Katy Hub to Port Arthur.

HPCs offer a clear path to an affordable, reliable, and growing power supply for all electricity customers.","Jeff Dennis is executive director of the Electricity Customers Alliance, a coalition that advocates for customer-centric solutions to grid modernization and energy affordability challenges.

A modern economy requires modern energy solutions to meet the growing energy demand created by reshored manufacturing, increased electrification of homes, businesses, and vehicles, and — of course — data centers.

Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic house the data center capital of the Western world, and the Commonwealth is positioned to lead America’s push to win the global artificial intelligence race. Data center growth can deliver many economic benefits to communities. However, this increased electricity demand requires smartly planned power infrastructure and a focus on short- and long-term solutions to address consumers’ concerns about their power bills.

Planning and building electricity infrastructure to meet rapidly growing demand while keeping electricity affordable for all consumers will take time. However, data centers and manufacturers need power now to win the AI race and capture new economic opportunities in manufacturing and the digital economy. Virginia must capitalize on short-term opportunities to expand and maximize the use of our existing grid assets to deliver more power while setting the foundation for smart, long-term buildout of our shared electricity grid.

To address this challenge, the General Assembly passed, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed, legislation to encourage deployment of advanced transmission technologies that maximize the amount of power that can be delivered from our existing lines. Beginning in 2026, the legislation requires the State Corporation Commission to consider the use of new power line technologies called “advanced conductors” when deciding how to bring more power supply onto the grid. Many other Mid-Atlantic states have followed Virginia’s lead in encouraging adoption of these technologies to help meet our needs today while establishing a foundation for an efficient future electricity system.

That’s great news for consumers — but it’s just the first step. Regulators at the SCC must now ensure the legislation succeeds by requiring Virginia’s utilities to pursue innovation in power line technologies, rather than simply reinvesting in the technologies of the past.

The difference between one type of power line and another might seem to be just a technical issue, but it can have real-world impacts on consumers’ power bills. Not all line technologies are truly “advanced” enough to deliver the cost savings that newer, more efficient, and lighter models known as high-performance conductors can. HPCs use carbon fiber composites in place of traditional steel for better performance. These are the same materials that have dramatically improved the performance of airplanes, cars and trucks, military technology, and myriad other products. They make HPCs lighter, stronger and — most importantly — able to carry much more electricity safely and reliably.

Using HPC technologies for power lines can double their ability to move electricity, reduce power loss due to heat by up to 30%, and improve the overall efficiency of the grid — all critical to ensuring a stable and growing power supply while our regional power regulator, the PJM Interconnection, finalizes its long-term transmission plans. That means less disruption for suburban and rural communities and shortened wait times for companies looking to connect to the grid, enabling faster economic growth for the region — and at a lower cost.

There are already hundreds of HPC lines in operation across the U.S. and thousands worldwide. America’s federal and state regulators have expressed strong support for these advanced technologies, at least partly because of their cost savings. A recent report estimated that deploying HPCs on just 25% of the aging power lines across the country would save American consumers at least $140 billion. Some of the largest new power users are directly investing in HPCs to drive these consumer savings. Google, for example, recently announced a partnership to accelerate HPC deployment to increase grid capacity.

Delivering consumer savings for everyone and expanding the Commonwealth’s AI leadership through advanced power line solutions depends on leadership. Given the acute challenges the AI revolution poses for our power system, all potential solutions need fair, transparent consideration.

HPCs offer a clear path to an affordable, reliable, and growing power supply for all electricity customers. By requiring power utilities to demonstrate that they have considered deploying HPCs in all new transmission projects, the Commonwealth’s electricity regulators can reduce pressure on the existing grid footprint, drive consumer prices down, and keep Virginia at the forefront of America’s digital economy.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/SJZUNag856FhamJM4AxnLiHWA6_930Dh5v2ts4incw4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8zNjYzNjU5ODIwXzBmYzY1MjA3YTNfay5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-09 13:08:17.333838

Greenflash will be operating its project Soho in the increasingly saturated Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market.

In a guest blog for ESN Premium, Ali Karimian and Alden Phinney of GridBeyond, noted that:

“While ancillary services-focused approaches delivered solid returns in ERCOT during 2023, and basic charge low/ discharge-high strategies worked effectively in CAISO, the rapid deployment of BESS assets has created intense competition, which demands sophisticated optimisation to capture excess returns beyond market benchmarks.”

“To remain competitive, battery storage operators must transition from basic arbitrage strategies to highly optimised, integrated solutions that capture returns that outperform the benchmark when adjusted for risk (what the financial world calls alpha).”

The funding cuts, carried out by the Trump administration through the U.S. Department of Energy, will strip resources from dozens of companies, universities, and nonprofit organizations across the state.
Hochul’s office estimates the ripple effect could climb as high as $650 million in lost economic activity.
“These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress,” Hochul said.
-Urban Mining Industries and Urban Electric Power in the Mid-Hudson region will forfeit more than $43 million.","Governor Kathy Hochul is voicing sharp criticism after the federal government eliminated nearly half a billion dollars in clean energy funding for New York projects, a decision she says could erase more than 1,000 jobs and deal a major setback to the state’s clean energy ambitions.

Hochul’s office estimates the ripple effect could climb as high as $650 million in lost economic activity.

“These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress,” Hochul said. “Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are playing politics with the government shutdown, and New York’s economy and hard-working families are paying the price.”

The Department of Energy’s decision affects more than two dozen companies and institutions, halting research, development, and infrastructure projects from Western New York to New York City.

-Plug Power Inc. in Rochester and the Capital Region will lose over $147 million.

-GE Vernova and GE are facing reductions totaling more than $62 million in the Capital Region.

-IBM is losing nearly $20 million in the Mid-Hudson area.

-The American Institute of Chemical Engineers will see over $79 million cut statewide.

-Urban Mining Industries and Urban Electric Power in the Mid-Hudson region will forfeit more than $43 million.

Additionally, major universities including Cornell, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Columbia University are expected to be heavily impacted by the loss of federal support.

Empire State Development President Hope Knight condemned the move, saying the funding losses will “stifle New York’s clean energy economy while killing good-paying jobs.”

Doreen Harris, who heads the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), called the cuts “short-sighted,” noting they add “further uncertainty for organizations and businesses that need stability to plan, invest, and grow.”

The decision has drawn broad condemnation from Democratic lawmakers. Both Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand joined the governor in denouncing the move, along with nearly every Democratic member of New York’s congressional delegation.

Schumer labeled the cuts a “reckless campaign of chaos and revenge” and argued they would “raise families’ electric bills just to score petty political points.”

Hochul and state officials are now urging New York’s Republican representatives in Congress to intervene and pressure the administration to restore the funding.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a6ba08_a8fd9975174e42fe830cc2e0b346494c~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/a6ba08_a8fd9975174e42fe830cc2e0b346494c~mv2.png",N,,2025-10-09 12:11:02.431175

WASHINGTON (Oct. 9, 2025) – Last week, the Department of Energy (DOE) cancelled federal support for 321 major energy projects – including transmission grid upgrades, new hydrogen projects and methane reduction projects for the oil and gas industry – taking back more than $7.5 billion in funding that had previously been promised to American businesses. This week, the Trump Administration is considering plans to pull back an additional $12 billion in funding for projects designed to expand American-made energy.

The following is a statement from Sandra Purohit, federal advocacy director for the national nonpartisan business group E2:

“Dismantling clean energy projects across the country at a time when some Americans are seeing their electricity bills skyrocket, at twice the rate of inflation since 2020, simply makes no sense,” Purohit said. “The president has said we are facing an energy emergency. But adding obstacles to building the cheapest, fastest sources of energy, and stalling energy innovation is a confounding choice that’s antithetical to a free and open market.”

The slashing of investments in clean energy – even while solar, wind, and batteries remain the cheapest source of power we can build – also threatens to kill one of the fastest-growing employment sectors in America, according to E2.

In 2024, clean energy jobs grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy, as detailed in E2’s annual Clean Jobs America report. With more than 3.5 million workers, clean energy is the backbone of the U.S. energy sector. Last year, 82 percent of all new energy jobs were clean energy jobs.

The administration’s attempts to stop the expansion of renewable energy in America have already caused businesses to cancel more than $22 billion in clean energy projects and more than 16,000 jobs in the first half of 2024, and the DOE’s latest actions will likely cause more cancellations, according to Purohit.

And the Texas fire was just one of several disasters the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigated that year.
Since its activation in 1998, the board has conducted in-depth investigations of 102 chemical disasters in the chemical and industrial sectors – an average of about four per year.
Creation and goals of the CSB The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board was created by Congress in a 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act, in the wake of several high-profile chemical disasters around the world.
These recommendations can range from changes in procedure, the addition of safety devices or even overall facility design recommendations.","When fire erupted at the Intercontinental Terminals Co. bulk liquid petroleum storage terminal, large plumes of dark smoke billowed into the clear skies over Deer Park, Texas. Despite the efforts of site staff and local firefighters, more than 70 million gallons of petroleum products burned or were otherwise released into the environment over the following three days in March 2019.

Even while the fire was still burning, investigations began looking into what had happened and what was still happening. The Environmental Protection Agency tested air and water samples to determine how much pollution was being released – both to determine cleanup efforts and to assess fines. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reviewed what had happened, but found that with no workers injured, there was no reason to investigate further or impose fines or other penalties on the company.

A third federal agency, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, often known as the CSB, got to work figuring out what had gone wrong, without assigning legal or financial responsibility, but rather seeking to learn from this disaster how to prevent future accidents. It’s an approach much like the National Transportation Safety Board takes toward airplane crashes, train derailments and other transportation-related tragedies: document what happened and identify every opportunity to prevent or reduce the chances of it happening again.

That deep investigative process reportedly will not happen in the wake of the October 2025 explosion and fire at a Chevron refinery in El Segundo, California, because of the federal government shutdown and lack of funding for the organization.

As scholars of chemical disasters, we believe this absence – and the potential for the board to be eliminated entirely under the proposed 2026 federal budget – raises the risk of more, and more serious, chemical disasters, not just in the U.S. but around the world.

Many serious incidents

The CSB investigation of that 2019 fire that burned 15 petroleum tanks at the Intercontinental Terminals Co., near the Port of Houston, yielded key recommendations to the company, OSHA and the EPA. They included necessary updates to safety management systems, the need for flammable-gas detectors to identify leaks, and remotely operated emergency shutoff valves so workers could close tanks containing hazardous material without exposing themselves to danger. The company has addressed the first recommendation and is reportedly working on the next two.

The board also recommended to the petroleum industry that storage tanks be spaced farther apart so they would be less likely to catch each other on fire – a recommendation that is still under review.

And the Texas fire was just one of several disasters the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigated that year. Since its activation in 1998, the board has conducted in-depth investigations of 102 chemical disasters in the chemical and industrial sectors – an average of about four per year. And its reports are regularly used worldwide, including in France, South Korea and China.

Creation and goals of the CSB

The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board was created by Congress in a 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act, in the wake of several high-profile chemical disasters around the world.

Those included the 1976 dioxin release in Seveso, Italy, which caused skin lesions on over 600 people and contaminated nearly 7 square miles of land; the deaths of thousands in Bhopal, India, from the 1984 release of methyl isocyanate from a Union Carbide pesticide plant; and the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in 1986 in what was then the Soviet Union. The goal was to prevent similar accidents from occurring on U.S. soil by investigating the causes of incidents and providing recommendations for improvement.

Specifically designed to be independent of other organizations and political influence, the CSB cannot be forced to modify its findings by other agencies, branches or political parties, ensuring its impartiality.

It has no power to issue regulations, nor any authority to impose fines or other punishments for wrongdoing. Rather, it is a fact-finding, investigative body designed to learn from past disasters and issue voluntary recommendations so chemical companies can improve their equipment and processes to prevent future tragedies. The vast majority of its recommendations are adopted by the industries affected, usually by the investigated company, though sometimes recommendations become industry standards. These recommendations can range from changes in procedure, the addition of safety devices or even overall facility design recommendations.

What does the board do?

There are several kinds of events companies must report to the federal government, including deaths and releases of particular chemicals, such as chlorine, naphthalene and vinyl chloride.

The board reviews those reports and decides on its own which to investigate. When an inquiry is opened, a group of experts who work for the board travel to the incident site to gather evidence to understand not only what happened in the big picture but a detailed view of how events unfolded.

After the investigation, the board issues a report detailing what it found and recommending specific changes to the company to reduce the risk of that sequence of events happening again. The board also delivers its information to other federal agencies, such as the EPA and OSHA, which can determine whether changes would be appropriate to federal regulations that apply to all companies in an industry.

The board’s value

The board had a US$14 million annual budget for 2025, which is a tiny part of the more than $6 trillion the U.S. government spends each year.

The current administration’s justification for eliminating the CSB is that its capabilities are duplicated by agencies such as the EPA and OSHA. But the EPA focuses specifically on environmental violations and potential threats to human life. OSHA investigates regulatory violations leading to personal injury.

In fact, the CSB has helped the EPA and OSHA evaluate and improve regulations, such as for the open burning of waste explosives, and improved methods of investigating accidental chemical releases and implementing new emergency response rules.

The CSB is the only organization that looks into improving processes to prevent future accidents instead of punishing past acts. It’s the difference between investigating who robbed a bank to hold the robbers accountable and improving bank security so another robbery can’t occur.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/694944/original/file-20251007-56-d601ug.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C324%2C5272%2C2636&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-09 09:04:00.623428

He also told reporters earlier this year that during his presidency, America was ""not going to do the wind thing.""
In September, Orsted cut its full-year guidance, citing lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds across its offshore portfolio.
Orsted currently employs around 8,000 people worldwide, and said it would reduce its headcount by 500 before the end of this year, culminating in a total of 2,000 reductions.
""At the same time, we want to create a more efficient and flexible organisation and a more competitive Ørsted, ready to bid on new value-accretive offshore wind projects.""","Beleaguered wind farm operator Orsted announced Thursday that it intends to reduce its workforce by a quarter toward the end of 2027, in a bid to become more competitive and refocus its efforts on Europe.

Shares were 0.7% higher in European trade on Thursday. The stock came under pressure earlier this year amid concerted efforts from the White House to reduce renewable energy generation in the United States.

On his first day in office, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending new or renewed onshore and offshore wind leases. He also told reporters earlier this year that during his presidency, America was ""not going to do the wind thing.""

Over the summer, the Trump administration ordered Orsted to halt construction on its Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island — which was 80% complete and set to power more than 350,000 homes. A U.S. court overturned that order last month.

In September, Orsted cut its full-year guidance, citing lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds across its offshore portfolio.

""Today, we've told our employees that from now and until the end of 2027, we'll be saying goodbye to many skilled and valued colleagues who've contributed greatly to Ørsted,"" Rasmus Errboe, the company's CEO, said in a statement on Thursday.

Orsted currently employs around 8,000 people worldwide, and said it would reduce its headcount by 500 before the end of this year, culminating in a total of 2,000 reductions. The firm will trim employee numbers through natural attrition, cutting positions, divestment, outsourcing, and layoffs, it said.

The annual savings for Orsted are expected to amount to 2 billion Danish krona ($311 million) from 2028.

""This is a necessary consequence of our decision to focus our business and the fact that we'll be finalising our large construction portfolio in the coming years – which is why we'll need fewer employees,"" Errboe added on Thursday. ""At the same time, we want to create a more efficient and flexible organisation and a more competitive Ørsted, ready to bid on new value-accretive offshore wind projects.""

The incident that shook Chevron’s El Segundo refinery last week once would have prompted a federal investigation. Not anymore.

As the Trump administration moves to weaken the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, California still hasn’t said whether any agency, department or authority will take charge of a comprehensive investigation when a refinery erupts — something that’s happened twice this year.

Separately, in response to fears over higher gas prices, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers have opened the door to more drilling, and state agencies have delayed, or moved to loosen, new oversight measures.

“It does raise the issue of who’s watching the refineries,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “They’re the most dangerous manufacturing facilities we have in our communities.”

Scholars and engineers as well as local agencies and fenceline communities have seen the now-inactive chemical safety board as a vital source of information into the causes of major incidents at refineries. The independent federal agency “was the gold standard for investigations of these kinds of incidents,” said Greg Karras, an environmental advocate and independent consultant.

But the Trump administration has argued that the board “duplicates substantial responsibilities” of other agencies. In President Donald Trump’s first term, the White House proposed eliminating the board; in this second term, executive branch officials have again proposed to zero out its budget.

The California Environmental Protection Agency is not leading a broad, multi-regulatory investigation after the Oct. 2 explosion. Instead, says CalEPA spokesperson Diana Ibrahim, the agency is “ready to support” the El Segundo Fire Department, which will lead a safety review.

Other state, regional and local agencies are investigating for their own purposes — a specialized unit of the California Department of Industrial Relations for worker hazards, the South Coast Air Quality Management District for pollution and the California Energy Commission for fuel supply — while Chevron runs its own internal review.

“It’s quite siloed,” said Earthjustice attorney Oscar Espino-Padron. “It’s often difficult to point to one body that’s really helping to coordinate and compile all of the necessary information.”

Earlier this year, an explosion at the Martinez Refinery, owned by PBF Energy, injured six workers and caused a shelter-in-place order. The Martinez and El Segundo incidents are the latest in a string of nearly a dozen major refinery explosions and fires in California over the past decade.

Some lawmakers and advocates are frustrated that the state has yet to get ahead of the problem.

“A fire in El Segundo has to happen for us to … wake up?” said state Sen. Lena Gonzalez, a Democrat from Long Beach whose bill to create a statewide standard for refinery air-quality monitoring was vetoed by Newsom last year. “It’s just so ridiculous.”

Watchdogs said to struggle reining in refineries

State and local agencies that launched investigations after last week’s fire have struggled to enforce refinery rules in the past, according to observers.

In the five years leading up to the explosion, the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s inspectors issued 46 notices of violation to Chevron in El Segundo. The most recent, issued July 30, alleged that the refinery failed to properly control the burning of excess gases at a piece of equipment related to its Isomax unit, which uses hydrogen, heat and pressure to break down heavier oils into lighter fuels like jet fuel. That’s the same part of the refinery that caught fire last week.

That notice is not yet finalized, a process that can take months or years. Espino-Padron, the Earthjustice attorney, said the air district’s oversight is often opaque, with residents having no easy way to tell when or how a notice of violation is resolved. Penalties also tend to be minimal, he said.

“The reality is there isn’t enough personnel to really provide adequate oversight of these operations,” he said. “What you see is not significant, robust enforcement.”

Rainbow Yeung, a spokesperson for the South Coast air district, rejected criticisms of the district’s inspection practices, enforcement and transparency. Yeung said the district is coordinating with other agencies on possible enforcement actions “with an eye toward protecting the public going forward.”

At the Chevron facility over the last decade, CalOSHA opened 18 accident and complaint inspections, eventually issuing nearly two dozen violations. The most recent CalOSHA investigation began on Sept. 11.

Garrett Brown, a retired employee of the agency, said that the inspection teams are short staffed. The agency’s ability to investigate is “compromised,” he said, in part because of recent turnover.

Denisse Gomez, from the Department of Industrial Relations, says that Cal/OSHA “has consistently carried out its duties” in responding to refinery incidents and “continues to strengthen its specialized workforce through active recruitment and training to protect workers and uphold California’s nation-leading refinery safety program.”

Safety standards face rollbacks

California has some of the nation’s toughest refinery safety rules because of two earlier explosions – one in 2012 at Chevron’s Richmond refinery, and another in 2015 at ExxonMobil in Torrance. The rules are built around the concept of process safety, which requires refineries to identify and fix hazards before accidents occur and to involve workers directly in investigations when they do. The system is designed to prevent the kind of cascading failures that have caused refinery explosions in the past.

But after the Western States Petroleum Association sued to block the rules, calling them burdensome, CalEPA and other state agencies quietly settled the suit. Unions and advocates say revisions to two regulations prompted by that settlement could weaken key safeguards.

The agency is updating the accidental release program rule for refineries and has yet to finalize those revisions. A companion rule at the state’s workplace safety agency is unchanged, for now; regulators are proposing to update the rule next year.

WSPA spokesman Jim Stanley did not comment on the settlement or process safety regulations specifically, but he argued that California refineries follow some of the industry’s strictest rules.

“From CalOSHA to local air districts to the California EPA, refiners work closely with regulators at all levels of government and our partners in labor to minimize the risk of accidents, keep workers and communities safe, and comply with environmental standards,” he said.

But Mike Smith, chair of the United Steelworkers National Oil Bargaining Program, said that the heart of refinery safety is having experts on site who can fully understand what’s happening inside the plant.

“Obviously, any weakening of safety regulations in the refining sector is not good,” he said.

Smith said that the rules have been under threat after the union was excluded from settlement negotiations between industry and the state over those protocols.

“The foundation really is employee participation,” Smith said. “The experts in the plants playing a role.”

The debate over those revisions comes as California’s political priorities shift—from tightening refinery oversight to keeping fuel flowing.

California eases up on oil

In an effort to lower gas prices and keep up with growing energy needs, California’s Democratic leaders have softened their stance toward the oil industry this year. For years, Newsom blasted refiners for high gas prices and promised to phase out drilling. Faced with the threat of refineries closing, potentially imperiling supply and pushing up prices, he too has changed course.

In 2024, two days after signing a measure aimed at pricing and maintenance schedules, Phillips 66 announced it would shut its Los Angeles refinery by the end of 2025, citing doubts about the sustainability of California’s market. In April, Valero said it would close its Benicia refinery next year, blaming a challenging regulatory environment.

Last month Newsom signed a bill that opened the way for new wells in Kern County. At the same time, the Energy Commission slowed implementation on many of the measures Newsom had previously pushed, such as ones on fuel inventories, resupply after outages, refinery maintenance and a long-promised price-gouging penalty.

Critics argue those moves have left the state more exposed to price spikes in the wake of the El Segundo fire and without strong tools to steady supply or hold refiners accountable. That’s “very dangerous in moments like this,” said Court of Consumer Watchdog.

Stanley, the spokesman for WSPA, said the refinery rules and other measures were impractical.

Following the fire, Chevron made adjustments to its operations to ensure fuel supply to Southern California, Reuters reported. Chevron spokesman Sean Comey told CalMatters that the refinery paused the flow of outbound product pipelines from the refinery the night of the incident, but restarted them after three hours.

The Energy Commission has said it is focused on keeping fuel supplies steady and prices down. But in a key report published this summer, commissioners warned that years of under-investment and deferred maintenance have created “safety and reliability challenges” at aging refineries. The report urged the state to stabilize fuel supplies through a mix of legislative and regulatory steps — including the postponing of rules to stave off further closures.

Niki Woodard, a spokesperson for the California Energy Commission, said the El Segundo fire is expected to hit jet-fuel supplies harder than gasoline, with jet-fuel prices jumping about 30 cents Friday and and negligible changes at the pump in the wake of the incident.

Though prices at the pump have barely moved, some experts warn that the state’s effort to keep fuel affordable may be coming at the expense of safety. Environmental consultant Karras said the state should view refinery safety as an economic issue.

“The state’s refining fleet has gotten to the point where it just can’t keep blowing itself up without starting to have to import gasoline,” he said.

With the federal government furloughed and Trump’s newly passed budget moving to permanently wind down the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, Karras said state leaders could still assemble a strong independent investigation into the El Segundo fire by hiring furloughed or former chemical safety board experts.

“There’s a tremendous amount of experience and expertise to do an investigation if state leadership had the political will,” he said.",https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/100225_Chevron-Refinery-Fire_Reuters_CM_01.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:11:32.241342

Less obvious but perhaps more immediately tangible, however, are the economic benefits. Simply put, continued reliance on oil and gas is extraordinarily expensive, and the American people are footing the bill while wealthy corporations make billions. Resourcing groups to hold the industry squarely accountable for its activities will boost American prosperity by limiting damage to communities and the environment, protecting taxpayers and consumers, and paving the way for the clean energy technologies of the future.

America’s Money Pit

For more than 100 years, the federal government has provided massive subsidies to oil and gas. The 2022 budget proposal sent to Congress sought to reduce some of these subsidies, but following the recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” federal subsidies have increased from more than $5 billion to more than $12 billion per year. Some analysts estimate the total is even higher, as much as $15 billion to almost $30 billion per year.

Such preferential treatment might have made sense more than a century ago, when the oil and gas industry was a fledgling upstart and a jobs creator. Today, tax subsidies only serve to prop up—and further entrench America’s reliance on—an industry that is struggling to compete. Not surprisingly, the fossil fuel industry has spent more than $1 billion over the last 20 years lobbying for tax credits. Around half of oil and gas production in the United States is estimated to be dependent on subsidies in order to be profitable. And while the industry used to be an engine of employment growth, that is not true anymore. In the first half of 2025, US oil and gas production jobs fell by 4,700. Looking ahead, some of the nation’s biggest oil corporations are to cut up to a quarter of their workforce, leaving thousands of hardworking people in the lurch.

Oil and gas corporations also receive significant explicit subsidies at the state level. Recent analysis from Alaska’s Department of Revenue concluded that the Willow Project—one of the largest oil drilling projects ever proposed on public land—will net its operator, ConocoPhillips, more in state tax credits than it generates in state tax revenue. Even in places like Texas, where oil and gas is produced mostly on privately owned land, the industry receives massive handouts. In the Lone Star State, the tally for 2023 was at least $1.4 billion. And that is not to mention the many tax breaks from counties, towns, and other local jurisdictions.

Organizations focused on lifting up the values that unite all Americans—values deeply associated with our national public lands—are sorely needed at this moment in time.

Beyond these explicit subsidies, there are many other less obvious ways that the public pays to prop up the oil and gas industry. Take, for example, the industry’s stranglehold on national public lands, which cover hundreds of millions of acres across the country, particularly in western states. While we are all owners and the intended beneficiaries of any development on these vast and uniquely American landscapes, the current financial terms underpinning the public lands oil and gas program don’t fully reflect this reality. In fact, wealthy oil and gas corporations often lease public lands at below-market rates, giving taxpayers less than a fair rate of return. Additionally, even though the United States is actually producing a record amount of oil, Congress just lowered the royalty rate, the amount private companies pay the public for extracting oil and gas from public lands, to the same level it was in 1920. States like New Mexico and Wyoming, whose royalty rates for drilling on state lands are significantly higher than the current federal royalty rate, stand to lose billions in revenue because of this change. Developers can also sit on these leased public lands for years without drilling, hoping for market prices to rise. This waiting game discourages investment in those lands for other uses like renewable energy development, outdoor recreation, or hunting and fishing. Taken together, these policies translate to billions of dollars for private corporations drilling for oil and gas on national public lands.

Better enforcement, and in some cases, stronger rules, are also needed to ensure that the industry—not taxpayers—pays to clean-up when drilling is finished. There are approximately 3.5 million abandoned wells across the country—those that have been left behind without being cleaned-up—that can leak toxins that pollute the air, water, and land. Even according to oil and gas regulators, many of these are actually orphaned, meaning wells where the owner has gone bankrupt or cannot be identified. When this happens, taxpayers often end up footing the bill, and the cost to safely plug and prevent these wells from causing further harm to the environment and communities is enormous. In fact, in 2021, Congress created a $4.7 billion program to clean-up orphaned wells across the country. Yet even this amount is far short of the estimated $250 billion that is actually needed to clean-up all of America’s old wells. In Texas alone, the estimated cost to plug inactive wells—those that aren’t producing, haven’t been plugged, and have an active operator–is some $16 billion, and Texas statutes allow operators to delay plugging almost indefinitely. In other words, whether it’s at the national or state level, the policy framework has created an inherent subsidy for oil and gas corporations. This is a crisis, and immediate attention is required to protect taxpayers, landowners, and people who live near the old wells.

The American consumer also pays indirectly to support oil and gas corporations through higher energy costs. For example, consumers are paying the price for the industry’s decision to maximize profits by exporting oil and gas for higher prices abroad. Just this June, the Energy Information Administration said that “higher natural gas prices in 2025 and 2026 are the result of strong export growth that persistently outpaces US natural gas production.” This government agency reiterated this expectation in September, concluding that domestic gas prices will likely increase by 50 percent over the next year, due to “relatively flat natural gas production amid an increase in US liquefied natural gas exports.” Consumers’ energy bills are also expected to increase because the Trump administration is forcing utilities to keep open aging and expensive coal and gas plants that were slated for retirement, likely adding $3 billion per year to our nation’s electricity bills. The administration is simultaneously attempting to crush renewables, which are usually the cheapest source of new electricity.

That’s still not the end of costly preferences given to the industry. For example, gas and electricity ratepayers in Texas will spend the next 30 years paying down almost $7 billion plus interest in “extraordinary costs” charged by power plants and pipeline companies during 2021’s Winter Storm Uri. Gas infrastructure froze because Texas’s oil and gas regulator ignored federal recommendations to weatherize the state’s supply chain. Consumers face numerous other real costs of dealing with the effects of climate change: higher home insurance, rising public health costs, crop damage, productivity losses due to extreme heat—the list goes on and on.

Bringing About Change

It’s hard to overstate how much the oil and gas industry is holding back America’s potential for true prosperity. International calls to end subsidies for oil and gas are growing louder, but our national politics are stuck, not only prolonging direct and indirect subsidies but piling on new ones. Funders can help move the needle by investing in the many groups that are working on all angles of this problem, partnering with people of differing political persuasions at all levels of government who share a common-sense position that the oil and gas industry should have to compete on a level playing field and not be able to rig the system for their own profit at the public’s expense.

People across the political spectrum care immensely about maintaining access to public lands and ensuring there are places to hunt, fish, camp, and simply enjoy, as demonstrated by the recent failed attempt to sell off public lands in western states. Many of those same people support ending subsidies for oil and gas companies doing business on public lands. Organizations focused on lifting up the values that unite all Americans—values deeply associated with our national public lands—are sorely needed at this moment in time.

Other groups are working to inject local values into economic development decisions. In Texas, for example, Commission Shift is showing Texans they deserve better oversight from the state oil and gas agency, and that speaking out can lead to policy changes that reduce emissions and protect groundwater. The South Texas Environmental Justice Network has successfully pushed back against gas export buildout in Brownsville, not only by harnessing economic arguments, but also by reconnecting local residents to native habitats of wildlife and plants, and advocating with the Carrizo Comecrudo Nation of Texas to protect sacred lands and sites.

Finally, there are organizations like Public Citizen working to protect consumers from high electricity bills by challenging Trump’s abuse of emergency powers that force ratepayers to overpay for old and inefficient fossil fuel power plants, intervening at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to challenge market rules that expose households to unnecessary price increases, and opposing LNG export applications at the US Department of Energy because of their impact on raising prices for American families.

The economic accountability work of all of these groups complements the efforts of climate organizations focused on developing and promoting clean technologies. Investing in economic values-setting at the community and federal levels that focuses on people—especially exposing how Americans’ pocketbooks are shrinking while oil and gas industry subsidies grow—and the places they love could be a significant antidote to the climate crisis.

Dürr’s calenders are used for both wet coating and dry coating to compress the film.","Less space and energy requirements, but better performance and the highest battery cell quality – that is the approach taken by engineering companies Dürr and GROB for their new concept factory for lithium-ion battery cells. At this year’s “The Battery Show North America” trade fair in Detroit, the two partners will be showcasing the technical innovations that make this possible. Key technologies include dry coating of the electrodes, which does not require a drying process, and powerful Z-folder technology for cell assembly with integrated notching.

The two global companies Dürr and GROB have been cooperating in the field of production technology for lithium-ion batteries since 2022. The aim is to jointly establish themselves as system suppliers of battery production equipment in Europe and North America. “With our expanded portfolio of highly available machines and systems, we jointly cover almost the entire value chain for battery cell production with our own technologies,” says German Wankmiller, CEO of the GROB Group.

In addition to a classic production layout with wet coating, the partners have developed a concept factory with dry coating and the new Z-folder technology that represents the next generation of battery cell production. Thanks to powerful and innovative technologies, production requires 50 percent less space and 70 percent less energy, resulting in significantly higher space efficiency and lower operating costs.

Efficient and sustainable dry coating

Dürr’s dry coating system X.Cellify DC product family implements the so called “Activated Dry Electrode®“ process from LiCAP Technologies. Dürr has been cooperating with the U.S. coating expert specifically in the field of dry coating since 2023. The Dürr machine uses a dry-mixed active material instead of conventional slurry. This powder mixture is pressed into a free-standing film using calender machines, which is then laminated onto both sides of the collector foil. Compared to wet coating, this eliminates the drying process as well as the recovery and treatment of solvents – saving space, energy, and costs. The free-standing film also offers advantages in terms of material efficiency, as excess film material can be completely returned to the production process before lamination onto the collector foil.

The recently achieved successful proof of concept demonstrates that the Dürr machine is capable of performing the dry coating process with consistently high quality. It can be scaled up, and Dürr is actively seeking pilot partners in the industry.

High-speed cell assembly

With the new generation of Z-folders, which integrate the notching process, GROB achieves higher performance with less space. For particularly stable and reliable system technology, the separator is guided over a few deflection rollers with very even and low web tension. Thanks to a high-quality magazine buffer system for the electrodes, the system achieves 95 percent availability.

Precise electrolyte filling with high pressure

A process developed by Dürr enables battery cells to be filled in a single step without residual gas. Unlike the conventional process, the electrolyte is filled directly into the cells at up to 30 bar. The filling pressure is thus two to three times higher than the current industry standard. The process design enables precise dosing and shortens both the filling process and the subsequent penetration of the electrolyte into the active material.

Free-standing film reduces scrap

The proof-of-concept plant is located in Chassieu in southern France, in a dry room environment at Ingecal, a Dürr Group company specializing in calender technology. Calenders are machines with rollers that compress materials into an even layer. Dry coating starts with film formation: A horizontal calender forms the dry powder into a film. It is referred to as “free-standing” because it runs through the machine without a carrier foil. In the second step, additional calenders compress the film to the desired layer thickness, density, and porosity. Finally, one film is laminated onto the collector foil from each side – thus producing the electrode. “Since we don’t need a carrier foil until the final step, we can return the film to the process in its entirety if it does not meet the desired specifications. Thanks to the closed loop, no valuable active material is lost and we significantly reduce waste – an important point in battery production,” explains Bruhn.

Improved further processing

The special characteristic of X.Cellify DC lies in its web guidance: the system transports the free-standing film in a self-supporting manner and compresses the film before it is applied to the current collector. The subsequent lamination onto the current collector requires less force than calendering in the wet coating process, which means that the foil does not deform – improving its processability for the downstream process steps of notching and stacking.

Combined strengths

The new approach to dry coating combines Dürr’s expertise in electrode manufacturing and system integration, Dürr Ingecal’s high-precision calenders, and LiCAP’s patented Activated Dry Electrode® technology. “To take the next step, we are actively seeking pilot partners in the industry for gigawatt-scale projects. This will enable us to bring the technology into real production environments – whether for electric cars, stationary storage or other applications,” says Bernhard Bruhn. Dürr is thus ready to partner in the next generation of battery production – with solutions for wet and dry coating.

End-to-end digitalization

The equipment technology from Dürr and GROB is complemented by end-to-end digital mapping of the production process. Even in the planning phase before production starts, a digital twin enables simulation of the entire factory and speeds up implementation on site. The data from the simulation flows into the MES/MOM software of Dürr’s subsidiary iTAC, which can be used to control and plan all production steps in battery manufacturing. Important functions here are traceability and quality analysis to avoid errors in production. This results in high overall equipment effectiveness.

Innovations in wet coating

Dürr has also further optimized its technologies in terms of performance and energy efficiency in the classic wet coating process. One example is the automation of the coating station and the slot dies, which form a closed control loop for the layer thickness – resulting in faster production start-up and reduced scrap rate. “Adding automated slot die profile control provides our customers with the ability to not only reduce the machine startup time, but it also ensures quality throughout the production process by maintaining the coating uniformity.” explains Adam Shambeau, Senior Director of Dürr Lithium-Ion Batteries Americas, “Scrap reduction and machine up-time are critical to our customer’s success, so enhancing our products through automation or innovating our offerings with dual-side coating technology to reduce the total cost of ownership are two great examples where our products bring value to our customers.”

In the subsequent drying process, battery manufacturers can use laser dryers to achieve a 50 percent faster web speed and particularly energy-efficient drying. After drying, the electrode coating is densified using calendering machines. The machines from Dürr work with particular precision using “Dynamic Gap Control”: two sensors measure the distance between the two rollers with an accuracy of 0.5 µm. This results in a very uniform layer thickness, with no more force being applied than necessary. Dürr’s calenders are used for both wet coating and dry coating to compress the film.

At the Battery Show North America 2025 from October 6 to 9, Dürr and GROB will be presenting their concept factory as a physical 3D model at their joint booth 3822 at Detroit’s Huntington Place Convention Center.

Dürr will be introducing a new naming concept. The company is bringing together its products for electrode coating and electrolyte filling under the new name “X.Cellify.”",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PV_Ad_Press_2.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 10:00:54.890899

,North Carolina and Evs,2025-10-09 11:55:02+00:00,The Virginian-Pilot,"Energy bills in Virginia could increase $1100 annually by 2040, new report says",Eliza Noe,,,,,https://www.pilotonline.com/2025/10/09/energy-bills-virginia-increase/,"Virginians could pay upwards of $1,100 more on energy bills each year by 2040, according to a new report from the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis.
According to the report, electric and gas bills for a typical Virginia household could go up by $1,115 annually above inflation within the next 15 years.
Of the $1,115 increase for consumers, lead author Jeremy Symons said $295 comes from a decrease in renewable energy incentives, $440 comes from the increase in energy demand by data centers, and $380 comes from the cost increase for natural gas.
The report links the natural gas cost increase to an increase in the amount of U.S.-produced gas shipped overseas as liquified natural gas.
Federal policy is also having cost impacts on energy bills, the report concludes.","Virginians could pay upwards of $1,100 more on energy bills each year by 2040, according to a new report from the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis.

Researchers from the center, a nonpartisan think tank based in Virginia, used public energy forecasts and data to calculate the costs. According to the report, electric and gas bills for a typical Virginia household could go up by $1,115 annually above inflation within the next 15 years.

Researchers said the spike can be attributed to a number of factors. Of the $1,115 increase for consumers, lead author Jeremy Symons said $295 comes from a decrease in renewable energy incentives, $440 comes from the increase in energy demand by data centers, and $380 comes from the cost increase for natural gas. The report links the natural gas cost increase to an increase in the amount of U.S.-produced gas shipped overseas as liquified natural gas.

Virginia is at an “energy crossroads,” Symons said. He said Virginia leaders can choose to invest in renewable energy like solar and wind to bring costs down, or they can continue to depend on gas.

“Electricity bills are skyrocketing because Virginia has tripled its reliance on natural gas in the past decade,” said Symons, who is also president for the center. “Big oil, gas and tech companies have set their sights on Virginia in search of big profits, and that means higher energy bills for everyone from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Chesapeake waters.”

Virginia Natural Gas has been working to make upgrades to their pipelines through the Steps to Advance Virginia’s Energy initiative, the company’s effort to meet growing energy demands. Earlier this year, VNG proposed a rate hike amid that growth, and a spokesperson told The Virginia Mercury the requested rate increase is driven by the substantial investments needed to improve the operations, safety, reliability and resiliency of its system.

On the electricity side, Dominion Energy’s Integrated Resource Plan outlines the provider’s plans to meet demands, which takes an “all-of-the-above” approach. This includes the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project, a large-scale offshore wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach. The plan also details plans for more solar power, about 12,000 megawatts, and “small modular nuclear reactors” in the 2030s. About 20% of the plan’s incremental power generation will come from natural gas.

Federal policy is also having cost impacts on energy bills, the report concludes. The Trump administration has made moves to end several renewable energy tax credits. The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used electric vehicles expired Sept. 30. Other clean energy credits, such as credits that prioritize rooftop solar and other home energy improvements, expire at the end of the year.

“Virginia can make energy more affordable by avoiding over-reliance on oil and gas and instead building abundant energy resources like solar, wind and batteries in Virginia that aren’t controlled by global oil and gas companies,” the report states. “Virginia also needs to manage data center growth and ensure the demand load from new development diversifies Virginia’s energy supply, protects consumers and doesn’t add to air pollution burdens for Commonwealth communities.”

Some Virginia communities struggle more than others with unaffordable energy bills and there are a variety of assistance programs available to help residents afford utilities.

But in the near future, electricity could cost more. The State Corporation Commission is also currently reviewing a rate increase request by Dominion Energy that could raise customers’ bills by $21 a month over the next two years. In its application for the rate hike, Dominion cited rising inflation and costs of equipment and fuel, as well as the highest levels of demand growth in decades.

American Infrastructure Partners’ Broadband Funding Model Some have argued that federal responses have not kept pace with need.
American Infrastructure Partners, a firm that uses private funding to partner with communities on infrastructure development, is offering another approach.
Infrastructure as Social and Educational Foundation Bob Hellman, CEO of American Infrastructure Partners, often highlights that infrastructure deficits go far beyond roads and bridges.
The broadband “C+” grade reveals a certain level of systemic neglect of rural America’s digital and social infrastructure.","The NTIA recently reported that approximately 15% percent of American households lack access to high-speed Internet service. A digital divide persists in the U.S., even as federal broadband benchmarks have quadrupled since 2015, jumping from 25 Mbps download speeds to today’s 100 Mbps standard. While nearly all urban areas meet the new threshold, only 72% of rural communities can make the same claim. Many households remain disconnected, not only from fast internet, but in turn from full participation in modern education, healthcare, and economic opportunity. While some public funding exists, private funding from firms like American Infrastructure Partners is needed to fill the gap.

Economic, Educational, and Health Costs of Poor Connectivity

The American Society of Civil Engineers gave broadband infrastructure a “C+” grade in their 2025 Infrastructure Report Card, noting that despite $2.2 trillion in private sector investment since 1996, 10% of households remain disconnected from the digital economy. Research by Telecom Advisory Services estimates that if broadband adoption and speeds had stayed at 2010 levels, the U.S. economy would have lost $1.3 trillion in growth through 2020.

Rural counties where broadband adoption exceeds 80% show 18% higher per capita income growth, 10% higher self-employment growth, and 44% higher GDP growth compared to underserved regions, according to Center on Rural Innovation research. Meanwhile, a Purdue University study of broadband investment in the state of Indiana found that each dollar invested returned four dollars to local economies.

There are also real educational consequences of inferior internet access, with modern education increasingly relying on online homework assignments and supplemental activities.

Health impacts compound the problem. Telehealth has been a source of measurable positive mental and physical health outcomes, providing access for those with limited mobility or ease of access to in-person treatment. But it’s usefulness depends on reliable internet access, with video appointments requiring high-quality broadband service.

American Infrastructure Partners’ Broadband Funding Model

Some have argued that federal responses have not kept pace with need. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act committed $65 billion for broadband expansion (including $42 billion through the BEAD program), but this funding is spread across states and over several years, amounting to more modest annual allocations per state.

American Infrastructure Partners, a firm that uses private funding to partner with communities on infrastructure development, is offering another approach.

By deploying a hybrid wireless model through its local2u platform, American Infrastructure Partners can potentially reach underserved rural households more quickly and with lower capital burden than pure fiber builds. The company’s “airfiber” service in West Virginia is listed at about $45/month, with download speeds up to 2 Gbps and upload speeds up to 100 Mbps. Because it can lean on line-of-sight links, CBRS, and other wireless technologies, local2u can avoid some of the cost and delay of trenching fiber across remote terrain.

Infrastructure as Social and Educational Foundation

Bob Hellman, CEO of American Infrastructure Partners, often highlights that infrastructure deficits go far beyond roads and bridges. In a recent op-ed, he observes:

“Collapsing bridges and impassable highways are unfortunately only the beginning of the country’s infrastructure problem. A far less visible but equally urgent investment gap looms in social infrastructure—facilities like school and hospital buildings, affordable housing units, and community centers that sustain the American economy and workforce.”

Too many classrooms suffer from inadequate ventilation, unreliable internet connectivity … which impairs student concentration and learning,” he wrote.

Hellman estimates there is a $2.6 trillion investment shortfall in modernizing essential social infrastructure facilities in the next decade.

While AIP’s model demonstrates what is possible at smaller scale, scaling remains difficult. Many financing structures default to large projects, leaving mid-sized or local efforts without attractive capital. Regulatory requirements—such as mandating fiber even when wireless alternatives are viable—create cost and timing burdens.

To close the digital divide, policy reforms may be necessary including more streamlined permitting and better alignment of federal support with locally feasible deployment models.

The broadband “C+” grade reveals a certain level of systemic neglect of rural America’s digital and social infrastructure. But lower-cost technologies combined with creative public-private financing have the potential to deliver results quickly.

Ensuring that leadership is accountable, efficient, and focused on communities will determine whether rural America remains on the wrong side of the digital divide, or whether it finally starts to catch up.",https://aijourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-09-at-12.25.08.png,N,,2025-10-09 13:09:31.759245

The renewable energy industry is a “defining opportunity” for African countries to leverage its vast resources to re-industrialise, create dignified employment opportunities for youth and power a new wave of skills development.

This according to Deputy Minister of Electricity and Energy, Samantha Graham-Maré, who was speaking at a side event of the G20 4th Energy Transitions Working Group (ETWG) meetings. “For Africa, this is the defining challenge and the defining opportunity of our century. Our continent holds 60% of the world’s best solar resources, vast wind potential, and many of the critical minerals that underpin the global clean energy economy. But our greatest asset is our people. Young, innovative, and ready to build. “This combination gives Africa the chance to leapfrog into a new era of re-industrialisation, one that connects renewable energy to manufacturing, beneficiation, and regional value chain development,” she said. Pressing further, the Deputy Minister explained how the continent’s vast resources can be turned from resources to sources of economic growth. “It means using our solar and wind energy to manufacture green steel, electric mobility components, hydrogen derivatives and the equipment needed for the energy transition itself. “It also means designing this growth to be inclusive, creating dignified jobs for our youth, supporting small businesses and ensuring community sharing the benefits,” Graham-Maré said. She cited the Atlantis Special Economic Zone (SEZ) near Cape Town and the Coega Industrial Development Zone (IDZ), in the Eastern Cape, as models of this transformation. The Atlantis SEZ is a hub for local manufacturing of renewable energy components while Coega IDZ is positioned as a hydrogen export hub.

“These hubs represent more than clusters of factories. They are ecosystems of innovation. They bring together clean energy supply, industrial activities, research institutions, and communities in a single integration level. When done right, they can transform regional economies and demonstrate how industrial policy, energy policy, and social policy intersect.

“But we are still in the very early stage of this journey. Scaling such efforts will require coordinated investment, enabling policy frameworks, and above all, strong partnerships.

“Building green industrialisation hubs is not something any single sector can do on its own. It is about systems working together. It starts with policy coherence, aligning industrial, energy, and trade policies, so that clean energy doesn’t just power homes, it powers factories,” she said.

Co-development of technology, de-risking investment capital and public-private partnerships are also key to Africa’s renewable energy re-industrialisation. “This is how we build an industrial transition that is coordinated, inclusive and sustainable. Each of these levers, policy, skills, technology, finance, forms part of a wider system, that would determine whether Africa can industrialise sustainably and competitively. “This is where the G20 leadership is vital. G20 economies hold the policy tools, capital and markets that can help unlock a just and inclusive industrial transition in the global South. “True G20 leadership means recognising that sustainable industrialisation in Africa, is not peripheral to the global energy transition. It is central to it. It means viewing Africa not as a recipient of technology, but as a partner. We need predictable climate finance frameworks, open and fair trade for low carbon goods and platforms for…co-investment,” the Deputy Minister said. She highlighted that South Africa’s G20 Presidency is committed to creating platforms for collaboration – bringing together governments, industry and international partners to “connect clean energy, manufacturing and innovation so that each strengthens the other”.

“These efforts are part of a broader movement to build capacity, share data, and accelerate sustainable industrialisation across the global south,” she noted.

The Deputy Minister acknowledged that as the energy transition gains momentum, South Africa “will not leave behind” those industries and communities tied to coal intensive sectors. “We will bring them with us, turning former coal regions into new green industrial hubs, and giving proud workers new opportunities for the future. Colleagues, Africa’s industrial future will not be imported. It will be built with our energy, our ideas, and our partnerships. “If we get this right, Africa will not only power its own development, it will help power the world’s transition to sustainability. This is not just about out energy or industry. It’s about dignity, opportunity and agency. It’s about insurance that the transition, we are all part of, delivers prosperity for all. “Together, we can build a future where Africa’s green industrialisation is not a distant aspiration, but a living reality. One which is African in origin, global in impact and sustainable by design,” Graham-Maré concluded.

The fund, which sits within the state Conservation Bank, sets aside additional money specifically to preserve agricultural land.
Legislators put $12 million — $4 million annually plus $8 million in one time funds — in the current budget for the program.
Moore thinks the conservation easement program is a good option for anyone in agriculture theses days and has started recommending it to his neighbors.","When Platt Moore and his wife Ashley learned a residential developer had approached a neighboring farm owner about selling their land just outside the fast-growing town of Fountain Inn, the Moores worried what it would mean for their own small ranch to go from prime pastureland to a 400-home subdivision next door.

It seemed to them like the once rural towns on the outskirts of Greenville were raising more houses than beef cattle in the five years they’d been operating, so the couple asked the landowner to sell the roughly 200 acres to them instead.

They turned to a decades-old state grant program aimed at preserving archeological and natural resources in the state.

New SC law aims to preserve dwindling farmland

While perhaps better known for its protection of undeveloped forests, wetlands and historical properties, South Carolina’s Conservation Bank can and has preserved farmland. The agency has safeguarded upwards of 39,000 agricultural acres since it was established 23 years ago, according to budget and program analyst Adair Roark.

But in the last couple years, farmers have been considering it with greater frequency as the cost of farming has risen and development, driven by a growing population, has moved in.

South Carolina has lost about 1,900 farms over the past two decades, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

Forestry and farmland lost to development from 2001 to 2016 totaled more than 280,000 acres, according to a 2022 report by American Farmland Trust titled “Farms Under Threat,” which gave South Carolina the nation’s eighth-worst threat ranking.

‘Exceeded expectations’

These trends prompted the South Carolina Farm Bureau to form a working agriculture focused land trust, which leverages federal, state and local tax credits and dollars to pay farmers to put their land into protective easements, said Executive Director Gary Spires. Under the agreements, the farmers retain ownership of the land and can continue to farm but must limit all future use to agriculture.

In the past two years, the SC Farm Bureau Land Trust has closed on 24 easements statewide, awarding upwards of $9 million for the preservation of 7,400 acres. The organization has four more easements nearing completion and another 20 in consideration, Spires said.

“When we went into this, we started it from scratch,” he said. “It has exceeded expectations.”

In addition, the General Assembly passed legislation to form the Working Farmland Protection Fund, which Gov. Henry McMaster signed into law in March 2024.

The fund, which sits within the state Conservation Bank, sets aside additional money specifically to preserve agricultural land. Legislators put $12 million — $4 million annually plus $8 million in one time funds — in the current budget for the program. That’s up from $3 million in the previous year’s budget year.

To qualify, a landowner must generate at least 50% of their income from agriculture. The land also must be under threat of development, have value as a natural resource, and be located in or selling agriculture to poor, rural and minority communities.

In the last budget cycle, the program funded five easements covering about 1,770 acres across six counties. And the bank had more eligible applicants than it had available funds, said Executive Director Raleigh West. In those cases, the bank’s governing board still has the option to pull from general Conservation Bank funds.

Now, the more than 2,000-acre Lone Star Plantation near St. Matthews is in line to be the sixth to fall under the program, according to documents filed with a legislative financial oversight panel. The Conservation Bank plans to offer Larry Doyle and his family a $2 million easement.

Part of a former hunting preserve, the Doyles use a majority of the property to grow corn, soybeans, cotton and peanuts. The remainder is timber land and wildlife habitat, including 93 acres of ponds, wetlands and creeks that flow into the Congaree River and attract waterfowl, bobwhites and white-tailed deer.

Doyle retired from the Farm Credit industry four years ago and began farming full time.

“Had we not had this (Working Farmland Protection Fund) we probably could not have done this deal,” said Michael McShane, chairman of the Conservation Bank Board.

These are properties that could easily be turned into a field full of solar panels or an Amazon distribution center, McShane added.

“It would be a real loss to our state to see these lands converted over to other uses like that,” he said.

‘Able to make a living’

Spires thinks that farmers’ familiarity with the state Farm Bureau has led more people who hadn’t considered an easement before to look into it. That includes the Moores, who are in line for $1.5 million easement.

Platt Moore had experience with a conservation easement on a piece of hunting property he co-owned near the Congaree swamp, which he said came with a lot of restrictions. So when his real estate agent mentioned an agriculture easement, he was apprehensive at first.

But in working with farmers, the program allows them to carve out parts of their property in case they need it for a barn, grain bin, shop or other use in the future. That was important to the Moores, who said they may eventually add a horseback riding program or other ag-related tourism to their existing grass-fed beef and butchering operations.

Between bad weather and trade policy with China, farmers and ranchers face tight margins, Spires said.

SC Ports rallies to help soybean farmers, but future remains uncertain

“The last two growing seasons prices started tumbling while costs skyrocketed,” he said. “Now the tariff situation is making things even worse.”

“These are often multi-generational properties and people who want to farm but they have got to be able to make a living,” Spires added.

Tax deductions that conservation easements bring are important, he said, but even more so is the cash associated with these deals. Those who participate often pour that money back into their businesses.

‘Tougher every day’

Moore grew up on a 1,500 acre farm in Williamsburg County. He said back when he turned 17 he left the farm to go work in the environmental industry with no plans to return to agriculture.

Now, at age 58, he wants his four children to be able to grow up in a rural setting, prompting him and his wife to buy their small farm in the Upstate.

Moore thinks the conservation easement program is a good option for anyone in agriculture theses days and has started recommending it to his neighbors.

“Land prices are so expensive these days,” he said. “The barriers to entry are getting tougher every day.”

The family the Moores acquired their additional acres from had long moved away and leased it to a man who used it to graze cattle. Knowing they wouldn’t return to farming themselves, the family chose to sell so they’d have money to pass own to their own children and grandchildren.

The man who had been leasing the land was able to combine his herd with that of his son, who has a large cattle ranch in the Upstate.

“And we were able to expand our operations,” Moore said.

Not only do to Moores support themselves through raising cattle, they also own multiple retail stores that support 70 other local vendors, who sell items including free range chicken, pork, elderberry jam and honey.

Now, even if they end up surrounded by neighborhoods, 420 acres of the Moores’ property will remain farmland in perpetuity.

“It’s a win for us and a win for conservation at the same time,” Moore said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ampm.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 09:04:09.749381

This marks an exciting milestone for Humboldt County’s local electricity provider.

Speakers at the ribbon cutting event included RCEA Executive Director Beth Burks, Ardi Arian, Renewable America President and CEO, and Jocelyn Gwynn, RCEA Senior Power Resources Manager. Attendees included community members, local leaders, project partners, and representatives from the Arcata Chamber of Commerce, who assisted with the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Foster Clean Power is the first new-build, utility-scale solar and storage project under a power purchase agreement with RCEA to be completed in RCEA’s Humboldt County service area. Combining 7 megawatts of solar generation with a 2.5 megawatt/10 megawatt-hour battery system, the facility will provide enough renewable power for approximately 3,000 homes.

“Foster Clean Power represents a milestone for our community,” Beth Burks, RCEA Executive Director, said. “By combining solar and battery storage, we’re not only producing more clean energy locally but also ensuring that power is available when our community needs it most. This project is proof that renewable energy, environmental stewardship, and community benefit can go hand in hand.”

The project was developed and built by Renewable America. The long-term owner of the facility is Radial Power, an American distributed energy investment company.

“Renewable America is proud to partner with the Redwood Coast Energy Authority on the Foster Clean Power project,” said Ardi Arian, Renewable America President & CEO. “The project integrates solar photovoltaics with one of the safest battery technologies available—lithium iron phosphate—providing a successful clean energy project for the community.”

In addition to its clean energy benefits, Foster Clean Power features pollinator habitat to maintain agricultural value and enhance biodiversity on land formerly owned by Sun Valley Floral Farms. The project was constructed with minimal land disturbance and contributes directly to Humboldt County’s transition to clean, locally sourced power.

The project strengthens RCEA’s Community Choice Energy program portfolio, advancing long-term goals to maximize local renewable energy resources, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, and increase grid reliability.

“RCEA is really excited to have this project come online and add to our local clean power portfolio,” Richard Engel, RCEA’s Director of Power Resources, said. “People I talk to in the community are happy to know more of their power is being generated here in Humboldt County in such a low-impact way.”

The company invested more than €7 million in the project to ensure continued reliability and operational efficiency of the two plants, which together have an installed capacity of 600MW – equivalent to around 3% of Colombia’s annual energy demand.

“As one of the country’s largest generating companies, Enel Colombia reaffirms its commitment to the electricity system. Therefore, this year we are committed to updating and improving these two hydroelectric plants, which are highly important for the eastern region, to ensure their proper operation. This is achieved through a substantial investment in major maintenance work, which is performed on average every 15 years and which, given the growing energy demand, is now necessary,” said Juan Carlos Grosso, Deputy Manager of Operations and Maintenance for Enel Colombia and Central America.

The month-long shutdown required coordination across the Paraíso and La Guaca plants and the El Muña reservoir. Approximately 600 workers participated in the project, with more than 35% from nearby municipalities including El Colegio, San Antonio del Tequendama, Sibaté, and Soacha. The planned outage was managed without affecting the national grid; the Colombian electrical system met demand through the existing generation fleet.

At the Paraíso Power Plant, Enel, in coordination with Enlaza (a subsidiary of the Bogotá Energy Group), upgraded the GIS substation that connects generating units to the National Interconnected System. The upgrade makes it the most modern GIS substation in Colombia.

“Central Colombia is facing difficulties in meeting the growing demand for energy due to the challenges in executing electrical transmission projects at the expected pace, owing to opposition from a few stakeholders in some territories. Therefore, it was crucial to modernize this asset and thus contribute to the reliability of the system,” said Fredy Zuleta, General Manager of Enlaza.

Additional work at Paraíso included maintenance on the ball valves and comprehensive inspection of the odor control system associated with the Bogotá River. This system includes the stilling tank, extraction system, biofilter, and ecofilter.

At the La Guaca Power Plant, maintenance was also performed on the ball valves, while the disconnectors that synchronise the units with the National Interconnected System were replaced. The rotor winding, responsible for generating the magnetic field that induces voltage, was also replaced.

In the tunnels and conduits, internal and external inspections were carried out, and a section of the penstock feeding the La Guaca plant was cleaned and repainted. Work also took place at El Muña Reservoir, where maintenance was performed on the “Granada Tower,” a submerged structure equipped with screens to prevent sediment from entering the generation system.

“At Enel, we have taken all the necessary measures to guarantee the stability of the plants’ infrastructure, the safety of the communities surrounding the hydroelectric plants, and the people who worked on these maintenance projects,” Grosso concluded.",https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/1757362845569.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 11:05:09.257850

That means more water has to come from somewhere. But where? And who will pay for it?

Those are some of the big questions Texas water leaders debated Wednesday during a panel discussion at the Longview Community Center hosted by the Texas Tribune, a nonprofit news outlet based in Austin.

The Tribune held the event, “Running Out: Texas’ Water Crisis and the Path Forward,” as part of its extensive series of stories on the state’s water supply issues. That the meeting took place in Longview – the heart of water-rich East Texas, where debates about reservoir construction have become heated – was intentional, too.

Weak water infrastructure, such as leaky pipes and aging water treatment facilities, are becoming less reliable to deliver water to homes and businesses throughout East Texas and the state. Meanwhile, population growth in drier parts of Texas have sent water development leaders looking to draw water from East Texas, potentially through construction of a reservoir and other controversial projects.

The discussion comes one month before Texas voters will head to the polls to decide whether the state should spend $1 billion annually to improve water supplies. That measure, Proposition 4, is one of 17 constitutional amendments that will be on the Nov. 4 ballot. The measure is not a tax increase.

Numerous East Texas water rights activists, state and local elected officials and everyday residents attended the hour-long talk and learned that solving the state’s water crisis won’t be fast, easy or cheap. But it is necessary, and progress to that end has been made.

Aging infrastructure

It’s a statewide problem: Decades-old water pipes that supply water to people’s homes and businesses are leaking, rusting and breaking. But in East Texas, it’s worse.

Throughout East Texas, 76% of public water systems – city water systems and rural water systems alike – have issued one or more boil water notices in the past month, a higher rate than elsewhere in Texas, according to data from the Environmental Policy Innovation Center. Boil water notices are issued when water becomes unsafe to drink, often because of a leak that can cause water to be contaminated, said Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy for Texas 2036, a public policy think-tank.

A little ways south of Longview in the Neches River Valley, roughly 80 or 90 water delivery systems are in some state of failure, said Kelley Holcomb, general manager of the Angelina & Neches River Authority. That figure amounts to roughly 20% of the water supply systems in his district, meaning people’s water supply is at risk.

The state’s water struggles garnered considerable legislative attention this year, and lawmakers passed a bill that will put Proposition 4 on the ballot in November.

Texas Tribune environmental reporter Alejandra Martinez posed the question to Holcomb: Will the amount of money the proposition raises, if passed, be enough?

“I could use the first half a billion myself, just in East Texas alone … to deal with the infrastructure side, not water supply, for East Texas, for the Neches River Basin,” Holcomb said. “The problem is, if you gave me a half a billion dollars today, it’d take me 25 years to fix it all.”

Mazur said his organization estimates Texas needs to invest at least $154 billion within the next 50 years to expand water supplies and fix dilapidated water systems. This year, Texas lawmakers appropriated $2.5 billion toward water infrastructure, and if passed, Proposition 4 would allocate $1 billion per year to that cause.

“It’s a noble start, and I think the Legislature deserves commendation for setting up this dedicated funding stream,” Mazur said. “Will it cover $154 billion over the next 50 years? Probably not, but it’s going to make a mighty dent in what’s been a growing problem.”

Water shortages

The Tribune’s reporting has chronicled another growing problem: If Texas faced a record-setting drought, its existing water supplies – lakes, groundwater and more – wouldn’t be able to provide enough water.

Various solutions have been proposed to provide new water sources for the state, ranging from the construction of large water reservoirs and recycling wastewater to desalination of saltwater and drilling for more groundwater.

Many of the solutions proposed for solving water shortages in other parts of Texas are relying on water-wealthy East Texas.

Janice Bezanson, senior policy director for the Texas Conservation Alliance, noted that water development leaders in the Dallas area have proposed building the 66,000-acre Marvin Nichols Reservoir in Northeast Texas, a project that is widely unpopular among area residents. The proposal would use eminent domain to requisition land for the reservoir in Titus, Franklin and Red River counties. An estimated 200,000 acres also would be requisitioned to provide new wildlife habitats as part of federal regulation.

Bezanson noted that Dallas-area water development leaders have discussed drawing water from Lake O’ the Pines, a water source for the city of Longview and additional cities, and other lakes in the area. She also referred to a proposal by investor Kyle Bass to draw massive amounts of water out of the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer in East Texas.

All of those proposals would have an “enormous” impact on East Texas, Bezanson said. Not only could the use of large amounts of groundwater deplete the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer, but the proposal to build Marvin Nichols would decrease farmland and harm the timber industry.

“This is creating a huge controversy and a huge rift between the demands of urban areas,” Bezanson said. “All the resources for urban areas are coming from rural areas that have no choice in the matter.”

Texas legislators debated legislation to stop Bass’ project and the Marvin Nichols project this year, but those measures failed. Urban legislators, who outnumber rural legislators, largely voted to allow those projects to proceed.

Bezanson said water conservation measures in the Dallas area are lacking, as the region has a higher per-capita, per-day water usage rate than other Texas cities.

Holcomb said he’s opposed to moving large amounts of groundwater out of the region because the impact of such an endeavor won’t be known until it’s too late.

Mazur said he expects more legislative debate and action regarding groundwater.

“There’s this tension that’s been building for several years,” he said. “I think it’s coming to a head right now.”

Permitting problems

Holcomb said he believes Texas leaders need to look at every possible option for increasing the state’s water supply.

Bezanson disagreed, saying some water projects aren’t properly vetted before being approved by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Projects should be assessed for their necessity, their environmental and economic impacts and how they’ll disrupt people’s lives. Bezanson referenced a May 2024 decision by the agency to award a permit for a reservoir project in Wichita Falls, though an administrative law judge months earlier recommended the agency not do so.

Mazur said state leaders shouldn’t build their plans for future water supplies on projects that aren’t likely to happen.

“We need to really look at this planning process so we can identify what projects can be delivered when and on time and how much water will actually be delivered,” Mazur said.

On a separate issue, a question from a member of the audience asked how water leaders will address the shortage of water system operators. By 2027, 70% of water system operators will be “aging out” of the system, Holcomb said. The only solution is to offer better pay.

“It means that y’all’s water bill is going up,” he said. “There’s no way around it, and I know nobody wants to hear it.”

Getting involved

State Rep. Daniel Alders, R-Tyler, attended Wednesday’s panel discussion and said he hopes more East Texans get engaged in the state’s water issues.

“It’s important that we preserve the water we have and, I think, have a responsible conversation about what part we play in helping water move west,” he said.

Among state lawmakers, “there is a collegial understanding that we need to resolve this, rather than just the urban cities take from the rural,” he said. “We need to make sure we have better science. We need to make sure that we’re not putting East Texas in a bind by taking too much water.”

Holcomb said the state’s water future will be up to young people who choose to get involved. On Wednesday, he got part of his wish. Four students from White Oak High School attended the meeting to get extra-credit points for their dual-enrollment course in government at Kilgore College. But after attending, they said they’re more likely to stay apprised of water-related issues.

“It’s super interesting, and it’s way more important than I thought it was,” said Kaleb Glenn. “And honestly, I’m probably going to start messaging senators already and congressmen about it, because this is a very big, important issue.”",https://marshallnewsmessenger.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/10/100925-WATER1-e1759981142346.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:12:17.959532

(A negative real growth rate in Iowa means that the residential electricity prices in the state were growing slower than inflation.)

While U.S. national retail electricity prices saw a fast increase in the first half of 2025 at a 10-percent nominal growth rate, they have generally grown at a more moderate pace historically – with nominal prices staying relatively flat at a 0.7-percent growth rate from 2013–2020, 5.5 percent from 2020–2022, and are projected to grow at 4.5 percent from 2022–2026.

Various factors affect electricity prices, including the costs associated with utilities’ generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity on the supply side of the electric system; the projection of future power demand from different end customers, weather conditions, and related regulations.

This insight provides an overview of U.S. electricity prices’ recent and historical trends at the national and state levels and across different customer sectors. It also analyzes the main factors that drive electricity price changes.

Introduction

Fast-rising electricity prices are frequently making news headlines and have become a topic of political contention at the national and state levels. Democrats and Republicans are now pointing fingers at each other to explain the increases in the utility bills. Some criticize President Trump and the One Big Beautiful Bill’s repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy subsidies. Others blame Democrats’ disfavoring of fossil fuels.

Are electricity prices truly dictated by high-level political events, however? Or is the answer to the rise in utility bills much more nuanced, driven by supply, demand, and other large-scale factors?

While U.S. national retail electricity prices saw a fast increase in the first half of 2025 at a 10-percent nominal growth rate, they have grown at a more moderate pace over the past decade. Nominal prices were relatively flat at a 0.7-percent growth rate from 2013–2020, 5.5 percent from 2020–2022 and are projected to grow at 4.5 percent from 2022–2026.

Various factors affect electricity prices, including the costs associated with utilities’ generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity on the supply side of the electric system; the projection of future power demand from different end customers, weather conditions, and related regulations.

Although commercial and industrial sector’s electricity demand is expected to outpace the residential sector’s due to the power demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and increasing manufacturing activities, residential electricity prices continue to be relatively higher and grow at a faster pace. This trend is determined by the residential sector’s smaller volume of power demand, less predictability of power usage, and the high cost of relying on the local distribution system.

This insight provides an overview of U.S. electricity prices’ recent and historical trends at the national and state levels and across different customer sectors. It also analyzes the main factors that drive electricity price changes.

Electricity Price Trends

There are three major sectors of end customers in the U.S. electricity market: residential, commercial, and industrial. In 2023, electricity consumption in the residential sector accounted for about 38 percent of the total electricity consumption, followed by the commercial sector (36 percent) and the industrial sector (27 percent). The transportation sector accounted for less than 1 percent of the total electricity consumption.

National-level price trends

The recent discussion of fast-rising U.S. electricity prices has been focused on the changes in the first half of 2025. Indeed, the increase in electricity prices so far this year has been striking. As shown in Figure 1, all-sector average electricity retail prices increased from 13.11 cents/kWh in January to 14.38 cents/kWh in July at a 10-percent nominal growth rate, much faster than inflation during this seven-month period, which hovered around 2 percent. This dramatic increase stands in contrast to the nominal growth rates of U.S. all-sector electricity prices over the same period in 2023 and 2024: 3 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that electricity prices will continue to outpace inflation through 2026.

Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration

This significant growth trend is muted when considering year-over-year electricity prices data, however. Figure 2 depicts electricity prices from 2013 to 2026. (The average monthly data from January to July 2025 is used as a proxy for the 2025 annual average electricity price; 2026 data is EIA’s forecast.) U.S. nominal all-sector average retail prices are expected to increase from 10.07 cents/kWh in 2013 to 13.79 cents/kWh in 2026 at an average annual growth rate of 2.5 percent. Nominal prices stayed relatively flat at a 0.7-percent growth rate from 2013 to 2020, 5.5 percent between 2020 and 2022, and 4.5 percent between 2022 and 2026. In real terms, as shown in Figure 2, the growth of electricity prices has been steady from 2013 to 2024 and is expected to have a slight uptick from 2024 to 2026.

As shown in Figure 3, overall U.S. electricity price trends across residential, commercial, and industrial customer sectors align with the all-sector price trends: Nominal prices of all three sectors started growing in 2020 and are expected to continue growing at a lower rate from 2022 to 2026.

U.S. residential electricity nominal prices tracked inflation closely from 2015 to 2021 but have outpaced inflation since 2022. The residential sector stands out with its higher prices (projected to be close to 18 cents/kWh in 2026) and a more elevated nominal growth rate from 2023 to 2026. The commercial and industrial sectors will continue to see lower electricity prices (projected to be 13.5 cents/kWh and 8.54 cents/kWh, respectively, in 2026) compared to the residential sector.

State-level price trends

Changes in electricity prices varied significantly across states over the past year. From July 2024 to July 2025, some states saw bigger increases in nominal retail electricity prices compared to the national average of a 5-percent increase. For example, the District of Columbia, Maine, and New Jersey saw the largest percent increases of 24.5 percent, 22.9 percent, and 21.6 percent, respectively. Some states, such as Hawaii and Nevada, saw a decrease of 7.8 percent and 7.3 percent, respectively, in their residential electricity prices.

Over the past five years, from 2020–2025, residential electricity prices also saw varying percentage changes, albeit in smaller magnitude. As shown on the map below, in nominal prices, the residential electricity prices in Maine had the highest average nominal annual growth rate at 11.5 percent, followed by the District of Columbia (10.7 percent), and California (9.7 percent). In contrast, Iowa had the lowest average nominal annual growth rate of 1.7 percent, followed by South Dakota at 1.9 percent.

In real terms, residential electricity prices at the state level grew as fast as 6.6 percent annually on average from 2020–2025 in Maine and as slow as -2.5 percent in Iowa. (A negative real growth rate in Iowa means that the residential electricity prices in the state were growing slower than inflation.) About 40 percent of the states saw their residential electricity prices growing slower than inflation on average.

Factors That Drive Increases in Electricity Prices

Supply and demand

The supply and demand market principle applies to the electricity market. High demand for electricity during a peak period (e.g., hot weather) or sharply reduced supply (e.g., an unexpected shutdown of a major power plant) would drive up retail prices of electricity.

As shown in Figure 5, U.S. demand for electricity started to rise drastically from 2023, driven by demand in the commercial and industrial sectors. The commercial sector is estimated to have a 3.2-percent increase in consumption of electricity from 2020 to 2026, mostly due to the enormous amount of power demand from AI data centers. EIA estimates that the industrial sector will see a 2.2-percent increase in electricity consumption over the same period as a result of more manufacturing activities.

Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration

Total electricity supply is estimated to increase from 4,202.2 billion kWhs in 2023 to 4,544.6 billion kWhs in 2026, a steep increase compared to the past decade (Figure 6). Of the new electric generating capacity that will be added to the grid in 2025, EIA estimated that more than half will come from solar energy. Other major sources for new generation capacity are battery storage and wind power. The One Big Beautiful Bill’s (OBBB) rollback of the tax subsidies for clean energy and the administration’s disfavoring of solar and wind energy will eventually reduce the new capacity to be added to the grid, which would reduce the total supply of electricity. Nevertheless, the recent electricity prices increase is not driven by the overhaul of the energy subsidies in the OBBB, as some have claimed: Many of these energy tax credits will not phase out until after 2027.v

Generation, transmission, and distribution, weather conditions, and regulations

There are three major cost components of electricity prices: generation, transmission, and distribution. These variables influence the supply side of the electricity market – the costs utilities incur to produce and deliver electricity to customers. Generation refers to electricity production from various energy sources such as natural gas or solar power. Transmission is the process of transferring electricity from generation sites to local substations via long-distance, high-voltage power lines. Distribution is the final step of delivering electricity to residential customers from local substations via a low-voltage power line network. It’s much cheaper and more efficient to transfer electricity through high-voltage transmission lines than through low-voltage power lines in the local distribution system.

Costs associated with generating electricity include fuel prices (such as natural gas and petroleum fuels) and power plants’ financing, construction, and operating costs. Transmission- and distribution-related costs include construction, operation, maintenance, repairs, and upgrade of transmission and distribution power lines.

Additionally, weather conditions affect the costs associated with generation, transmission, and distribution. For example, extremely hot or cold weather would drive up electricity demand for air conditioning or heating. Abundant sun or wind can help bring more power to the grid, which could lower electricity prices.

Regulations also play an important role in determining a region’s electricity prices. The electricity industry, and in particular the electricity rate, is heavily regulated through a complex process. A utility is required to propose electricity rates based on its costs and profits considerations and get approval from the state’s utility regulator. There are also many other regulations that can affect electricity prices – for example, state-level regulations such as the renewable portfolio standard that mandate a state’s utilities to generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources. The costs the utilities incur to meet these standards are passed on to customers as part of the electricity bill.

Generation costs make up about 60 percent of average electricity prices nationwide, with the remaining 40 percent of costs coming from transmission and distribution. As shown in Figure 8, U.S. average nominal prices of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution have been increasing since 2021. In real terms, both generation and transmission costs started to trend upward from early 2023, while distribution costs of retail electricity sales have stayed relatively flat. Utilities’ rising spending on transmission and distribution is driven by the capital investment requirement to upgrade the aging U.S. transmission and distribution infrastructure.

Differences between residential, commercial, and industrial sectors

Although the commercial and industrial sectors’ electricity demand is expected to outpace the demand from the residential sector (Figure 6), residential electricity prices have been historically much higher than the prices for the commercial and industrial sectors (Figure 3). This is mostly due to how the electricity market works and the different volumes of electricity these sectors consume.

The key to a functional electric system is to match demand for electricity and generation and delivery of electricity in real time. As a result, the volume of power demand, predictability of power usage, and cost of delivering the electricity to customers generally dictate that residential electricity prices are much higher than prices for the commercial and industrial sectors. Compared to the residential sector, the commercial and industrial sectors use significantly more power at a much more predictable schedule and pattern. Additionally, commercial and industrial sectors can connect to high-voltage transmission lines to receive electricity, whereas residential customers rely exclusively on the local distribution system, which is costly to maintain and upgrade.

Residential electricity prices are also increasing faster than the prices for the commercial and industrial sectors (Figure 3). This is mainly driven by the ballooning costs of repairing, maintaining, and upgrading the local distribution systems. Major utilities’ spending on local distribution systems has increased from $4.2 billion in 2013 to $6.4 billion in 2023 (Figure 8). While generation accounts for the majority of utilities’ expenditures, its associated costs are allocated across all sectors. In contrast, the residential sector bears most of the costs of the local distribution system, which explains the higher growth rate in residential electricity prices.

As a major producer of domestic energy, Pennsylvania companies should not be stymied by burdensome, outdated laws and frivolous litigation that prevent us from building. That’s why it’s critical for our Representatives in Congress to take decisive action on permitting reform to secure our American energy future and avoid yielding to adversaries.

As a result of arcane and restrictive laws and regulations that stifle energy projects, U.S. power generation has stagnated for over a decade – holding back energy production at the worst possible time. By 2030, U.S. energy demand is projected to rise 25 percent as AI and advanced industries expand. At the same time, China now possesses more than double the generation capacity of the U.S., having increased its capacity by 600 percent since 2000. When we can’t build, Americans pay the price beyond just higher utility bills. Lagging behind China and others presents an immense national security threat, especially in the ever-expanding race to power AI superiority.

As Chair of the Pennsylvania Artificial Intelligence Opportunity Task Force and having introduced a package of legislation that would allow Pennsylvania to flourish as a leader in AI by reducing overregulation and barriers to innovation, I’m committed to addressing the national security risks of AI dependence on adversaries. Congress must share that same passion, as these converging forces are a recipe for disaster without permitting reform.

Perpetual delays in the permitting system and roadblocks at every step of review are restricting investment in new projects, restricting new job growth, and restricting new energy production. Much of the issue lies in well-intentioned legislation that is too outdated to adequately meet the unprecedented energy demands of today, too vague to prevent abusive lawsuits and stall tactics, or both.

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a prime example of this. Enacted more than five decades ago, its vague language has led to more lawsuits than any other environmental law. While intended to ensure that environmental factors of major federal projects were properly considered, in practice, the law has been weaponized beyond its original intent, resulting in slow reviews and prolonged litigation by third-parties who often don’t even live in the state where these projects are developed. To curb that problem, Congress must enact reforms that bring commonsense to agency reviews and end the lawfare that delays and kills critical energy and infrastructure projects.

Congress should also clarify the meaning of the Clean Air Act (CWA) by simplifying its scope and requiring enforceable certification timelines for energy projects. Currently, the CWA can be exploited through a narrow section of the law that allows states to certify that federally licensed projects comply with state water quality standards. States have been known to weaponize the process by denying certification not out of concern for actual water standards, but instead over unrelated ideological differences, infusing partisan politics into a process meant to protect water.

Decades-old laws and bureaucratic red tape have gone unaddressed for too long. Amending these laws and regulations through permitting reform to better allow for timely and necessary energy production need not come at the environment’s expense. Eliminating inefficiencies and partisan abuse while maintaining essential environmental protections would pave the way for American energy dominance and in turn an economic boom for working-class Americans.

Fixing the federal permitting process must be a bipartisan priority. The current system is broken, with outdated laws exposing Pennsylvania to costly litigation and red tape. Durable congressional action from our delegation from Pennsylvania is necessary to provide clarity and stability for developers and federal agencies alike. Doing so would result in a safer, more affordable, and energy-secure Commonwealth, all without compromising environmental protections.

Two sites are available for lease, including a 95-acre parcel and up to 150 acres at the East Tennessee Technology Park.

Companies must also propose how they will power the energy-intensive data centers, either by building a new power plant or partnering with one.

This initiative is part of the Trump administration's goal to accelerate the development of data center infrastructure on federal land.

Private companies can now compete to build AI data centers and power plants on federal land in Oak Ridge.

The U.S. Department of Energy announced earlier this year that Oak Ridge was one of four sites selected to move forward with AI data centers, which offer storage for networked computer servers that process and manage massive amounts of information.

The energy department is now asking companies to get specific, and began requesting proposals Sept. 30, allowing interested parties to share their ideas for data centers − and for how they would be powered. The project also might support a core goal of President Donald Trump’s administration: “unleashing American energy.”

Trump has issued a series of executive orders in his second term intended to make the United States a leader in the construction of data centers for artificial intelligence. A July order specifically aimed to speed up the review of permits for data centers planned on federal land while reducing the regulations needed to build them.

What could companies do with data centers in Oak Ridge?

Whichever company – or companies – the government selects will lease land for the projects from the federal government. The lease terms would be negotiable, a Department of Energy spokesperson told Knox News via email.

Companies have until Dec. 1 to tell the energy department about their plans for two pieces of land. One covers about 95 acres in Oak Ridge − north of the intersection of Bethel Valley Road and Tennessee Highway 95 − and the other spans up to 150 acres in the East Tennessee Technology Park that housed Manhattan Project sites.

The Department of Energy's request lists options for each piece of land. The 95-acre site should accomodate a data center, while the Heritage Center could be used for another center, a power plant to support the center or both.

Data centers need a lot of power. The industry’s yearly energy use amounted to about 4.4% of the total energy used in the United States in 2024, according to a report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The energy department is asking companies to offer plans that show some way of meeting that demand, either through building a new power producer or through partnering with a separate, new energy-generating venture in the region.

The Oak Ridge area’s proximity to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s grid is listed in the request as a regional strength for East Tennessee.

The National Nuclear Security Administration also published a request for proposals for its Savannah River Site in South Carolina on Sept. 30. Like Oak Ridge, the Savannah River Reservation houses a national lab. It also produces tritium, a key component of nuclear weapons.

How long will it take to build the data center?

Knox News reported earlier this year the Trump administration hopes some data centers on federal property could start operating in 2027.

The timeframe the Department of Energy outlined in the request it published in September asks companies to show they can spend up to 18 months with site development and up to two years building facilities.

And if a company wants to build its own power producer, it should prove the technology behind whatever’s generating electricity will be usable and available by the time the data center starts working, energy department staffers said in their request.

Companies will be judged to determine whether their proposals are financially and technologically feasible, according to a Department of Energy news release. The government also wants to know how any interested parties plan to handle regulations and permitting.","https://www.knoxnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/04/PKNS/82886154007-ornl-wright-sy-0969.jpg?crop=6052,3404,x0,y315&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-09 05:57:54.215839

EV prices and sales after tax credit expiration

The sudden surge in EV purchases, as customers rushed to take advantage of the incentives before they expired, has pushed up the prices of used EVs, and they’re starting to creep closer to the prices of ICE vehicles. Despite this, they’re still a more affordable buy, as EVs typically depreciate by roughly 30% in the first year, significantly more than gas vehicles.

New vehicle sales are hovering around a SAAR of 16 million, with battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) representing roughly 8% of that total year-to-date. About half of that share is Tesla. With the federal incentives now gone, EV sales could be cut roughly in half.

Hybrids are easing the customer transition to electric

Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have effectively helped customers transition to electric. The $7,500 incentive often persuaded customers to lease a PHEV, and many returned to the store satisfied with their vehicle. Approximately half of those customers stick with EVs for their next lease or purchase.

The federal tax incentive made it easier to sell EVs. However, with it now being gone, salespeople need to start getting more hands-on experience with the vehicles. Sellers who drive an EV as their personal vehicle often have an easier time selling them. Dealership staff who invest time in learning more about EVs and feel confident discussing their benefits and features will find it easier to sell their inventory in the future.

Impact of tariffs on affordability and ownership trends

Early pent-up demand in response to President Donald Trump’s auto tariffs temporarily accelerates sales. However, the full impact on 2025 vehicles was muted with no significant price increases. For the 2026 model year, prices have risen about 3% on average and could increase up to 15%. This increase will impact manufacturers, dealers and consumers alike.

Affordability remains a significant concern, with new vehicle prices averaging around $50,000. The pressure is pushing the average ownership cycle to 13 years, impacting new-vehicle sales, used-vehicle inventory and fleet turnover.

What’s next for the EV market?

As EV technology improves to provide extended range and the nation’s public charging infrastructure expands, Aiosa believes that consumers will adopt EVs more readily. While it will take longer than initially expected, the future for EVs remains promising.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10.09.25-Jeff-Aiosa-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 05:57:50.119998

On October 7, the company reduced the sticker prices of Model Y and Model 3 by $5,000 each, aiming to offset the $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric-vehicle purchases that expired on September 30. The cheaper models first unveiled in the U.S. won’t include some premium features, including autosteer, touchscreens, and heated rear seats.

The price reduction — also slated for Europe this year and China the next — comes as Tesla tries to claw back market share outside the U.S. from China’s BYDiBYDBYD Auto is a Chinese carmaker that became the world’s leading EV manufacturer in 2023, competing with Tesla for market share and global attention.READ MORE, which has outsold it globally since the final quarter of last year.

Even at the new price point, however, BYD’s mass-market vehicles remain more than $10,000 cheaper than Tesla in several markets, according to industry analysts.

“Lowering costs is one of the levers that Tesla can pull in order to stimulate growth in vehicle sales, particularly amid the backdrop of the company’s poor performance so far this year,” Sammy Chan, manager of automotive sales forecasts at GlobalData, told Rest of World. “Each region has its own dynamics at play, but what is clear is that Tesla is not keeping up with the overall growth in the BEV market for passenger vehicle sales.”

Long-time Tesla investor Ross Gerber said another price drop is imminent, and suggested opting for a used Tesla in the meantime.

BYD, which started off as a battery maker three decades ago, now sells in more than 80 countries. It aims to almost double its international sales to 800,000 units from 417,204 last year.

Last year, Tesla dropped its goal of delivering 20 million EVs by 2030 from public purview. The company’s Model Y, however, remains the best-selling electric car in the world. The lower price point is likely to make it even more attractive.

“Elon and investors are looking at the share price and know that to keep [it] that high, they have to show some results along with their promises of an autonomous and robotic future,” Tu Le, founder and managing director of Detroit-based Sino Auto Insights, told Rest of World.

Winning on price alone, if Tesla can pull it off at all, will prove short-lived as China controls the global EV supply chain, industry experts said.

“Chinese EV manufacturers not only frequently release a variety of new models but also employ a sub-brand strategy, targeting distinct consumer segments with greater specificity,” Dmitriy Pozdnyakov, analyst at Freedom Capital Markets, told Rest of World.

Besides pricing, Tesla is trying to innovate and compete on design. In August, it introduced a China-exclusive six-seater Model Y L, which became an instant hit despite being priced 30% higher than Model Y. Given that affordability is the biggest concern for potential buyers, these pricier vehicles won’t crack mass adoption.

Musk scrapped plans for an all-new $25,000 EV in early 2024 and turned to budget-friendly variants for existing models.

“We’ll be running with the more affordable models available for everyone in Q4,” Musk said during Tesla’s July 2025 earnings call.

While the stripped-down models may attract some buyers, the gains will be modest, Vivek Vaidya, a partner covering mobility at consultancy Frost & Sullivan, told Rest of World.

It owns and operates Drax Power Station, which is the UK’s largest single source of renewable power. In 2024, the site generated over 5% of the country’s electricity using biomass pellets primarily sourced from North America.

The new agreement highlights the progress Drax is making on the commitments the company set in its Sustainability Framework, including delivering evidence on forest carbon stocks in all its principal biomass feedstock sourcing areas by the end of 2026.

Miguel Veiga-Pestana, Drax Group Chief Sustainability Officer, said: “We are proud to launch this new partnership with NGIS. This agreement will help us deliver on the commitments we set in our Sustainability Framework including taking action, with our supply chain, to being deforestation, degradation and conversion free.

“We hope this new data of the carbon stock of our sourcing areas can help increase global confidence in biomass as a sustainable resource. It will help inform our work with our suppliers and help us to deliver on our sustainable biomass commitments.

“Sustainable biomass is a secure renewable energy source that can be used to generate electricity for millions of people. Drax sources from forests that are managed for the high-grade lumber used in a range of applications, from construction materials to furniture-making. Processing of trees in forests and at sawmills generates a huge volume of residual wood with few other commercial uses such as defective logs, branches, sawdust, chips and bark. We process these into biomass pellets which we then use to help the UK keep the lights on.”

NGIS is a Google Premier Partner that specialises in Geospatial solutions that use satellite imagery to monitor global supply chains. Under the new partnership, NGIS will use a range of Earth Observation data, combined with Google AI and machine-learning tools to model and monitor the carbon sequestered in forests that Drax sources from. It will also track other indicators of forest health, including tree cover and condition.

The information is presented to Drax on an accessible digital platform through which users can, for example, see satellite imagery with overlays of historical images of where trees have been harvested on one date and then on another later date where regrowth and reforestation have started.

Nathan Eaton, NGIS Executive Director said: “This partnership is a great showcase for the use of innovative Geospatial capability to address Drax’s significant commitments to help meet the world’s increasing demand for secure energy, sustainably.”

Drax is already using the new data in discussions with its supply chain to help tailor initiatives that support forest health, biodiversity and assessing the impact of events such as floods, diseases, fires and hurricanes on forests too.

The project would have helped Connecticut towns switch to solar energy and battery storage during power outages caused by extreme weather.
The project is one of more than 200 affected by the federal funding cuts, with many of the funding clawbacks happening in Democrat-leaning states.
But on Oct. 2, the university received formal notification from the Department of Energy, canceling the grant.
“There will be funds that are withdrawn from constituencies that the administration is not terribly inclined to.","The University of Connecticut is confirming it lost funding for a green energy project, as part of a recent $7.56 billion funding rollback by the Trump administration.

The project would have helped Connecticut towns switch to solar energy and battery storage during power outages caused by extreme weather.

“Through the program, a more affluent town like West Hartford, with considerable amounts of solar and energy storage systems, could provide a surplus of power to a neighboring municipality, such as Hartford,” Jumbo Zhao, the project’s director, told UConn Today back in 2022.

The project is one of more than 200 affected by the federal funding cuts, with many of the funding clawbacks happening in Democrat-leaning states.

The Department of Energy, in a press release announcing the grant cancellations, wrote “DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

UConn received just over half of the $2.2 million grant, which was expected to be paid in installments between 2023 and 2027, according to a UConn spokesperson. But on Oct. 2, the university received formal notification from the Department of Energy, canceling the grant. The spokesperson could not confirm whether the university would appeal the termination.

The program at UConn was part of a partnership with the utility Eversource. A spokesperson for Eversource wrote, “while the DOE grant termination affects federal funding associated with specific research endeavors, Eversource remains actively involved and financially committed to the center’s overarching mission and projects.”

The UConn project is one of 12 in Connecticut affected by the federal cuts, totaling more than $52 million in cancelled grants.

""The federal government’s decision to slash energy investments at this scale is short-sighted and dangerous,” said Mayor Roberto Alves of Danbury, where federal records show two projects were cut – one headed by FuelCell, the other by Linde – totaling $12.5 million in canceled grants.

“At a time when communities are working to build a clean energy future and create good-paying jobs, pulling millions from a major project here in Danbury doesn’t just threaten innovation, it undermines economic growth and local workers. We need leadership that doubles down on climate solutions, not backs away from them,” Alves, who also serves as the state Democratic chair, said in a statement.

Connecticut’s Attorney General did not confirm whether his office would take legal action over the cuts.

“Once again, Trump is unlawfully seizing federal funds to exact political revenge, and taxpayers are left to suffer,” said Attorney General William Tong in a statement. “We are watching this issue closely and will not hesitate to defend Connecticut’s interest and funding.”

Jack Greenberg, a political science professor at Trinity College, said he expects to see the Trump administration continue to cut funding along political lines.

“I think there will be a continued effort on the part of this administration to, where it sees expenditures it doesn't like, it's going to refuse to distribute them, or it's going to distribute them in highly politically-targeted ways,” Greenberg said.

“There will be funds that are withdrawn from constituencies that the administration is not terribly inclined to. It could be the case that if an individual member of Congress frustrates the administration, at some point they will see projects withheld from them.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/21ea921/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+342/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F87%2F54%2F80c3117942808a97f71451c78599%2F240111-uconnquantum-0225.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 07:05:44.362981

It's part of a bigger attack - WVPE",Julia Simon,,,,,https://www.wvpe.org/npr-news/2025-10-08/after-spains-blackout-critics-blamed-renewable-energy-its-part-of-a-bigger-attack,"In the hours after the outage The Daily Mail published the headline ""Could renewable energy be to blame for huge Spain blackout?""
Newell says the immediate accusations against renewable energy didn't surprise many people who study attacks on climate solutions.
Renewable critics said blackout was caused by lack of ""inertia"" - it wasn't When critics of renewable energy pointed the finger at solar or wind for causing the blackout, many used one word: inertia.
But critics of renewable energy blamed solar and wind, says Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University.
""In 2021, again, there was uncertainty on what caused it, but immediately there were attacks on renewable energy,"" Roberts says. ""","Last spring, tens of millions of people lost electricity across Spain, Portugal and part of France. Trains stopped in their tracks, and people were stuck in elevators, as southwestern Europe went without power for — in some cases — more than ten hours.

Immediately, the finger-pointing began. Many people blamed solar and wind energy. Spain, one of Europe's front runners in renewable energy, gets about 46% of its power from solar and wind, according to the think tank Ember— sometimes more than 70%.

In the hours after the outage The Daily Mail published the headline ""Could renewable energy be to blame for huge Spain blackout?""

And on the day of the outage U.S. energy secretary and former fracking executive Chris Wright went on CNBC to talk about the outage and criticized solar and wind. ""When you hitch your wagon to the weather,"" Wright said, ""it's just a risky endeavor.""

The idea that solar and wind are inherently risky and unreliable is a common talking point for critics of renewable energy, often repeated by groups with ties to the fossil fuel industry. It's false. When renewable energy is paired with large batteries or other forms of grid management, it's proven to be reliable.

Now a new report from an expert panel of European grid operators details what happened. The report finds that for the first time in Europe, a voltage surge caused the massive outage. Voltage needs to remain within limits for an electrical grid to work. While many things went wrong, the problem was not a power grid with too much wind or solar, says Chris Rosslowe, a senior energy analyst at Ember who was not involved in drafting the report.

""It contradicts the numerous claims that we've seen that an overreliance on renewables was the cause,"" Rosslowe says. ""That is clearly not true.""

But the misinformation about solar and wind energy causing the outage has had an impact. A new survey found that a majority of Spanish respondents believe at least one false narrative about the blackout, and the most common was that too much reliance on renewable energy was to blame.

Countries around the world are using renewable energy to move away from polluting fossil fuels. That's why it's so important to counter false narratives about solar and wind, says Philip Newell, communications co-chair of the Climate Action Against Disinformation, a coalition of nonprofits.

""This content makes it seem more normal and feel more normal to hate on renewables,"" Newell says. ""Even though they're a solution to climate change.""

What did happen before the outage

The new report from the European grid operators' expert panel found multiple triggers shortly before the blackout.

First, oscillations, or sudden swings in power flow, hit the grid. It's still unclear what caused them. Spain's main grid operator took steps to control the oscillations, including sending less power to France. While these actions helped dampen the oscillations, they caused the voltage to surge upwards.

Voltage is like pressure in a water system. Just like it's key to have a certain amount of pressure for water to flow, there needs to be a certain amount of voltage to push electrons through a circuit. But voltage can't be too high, or it can cause short circuits or even fires.

When the voltage surged, transformers and power plants shut down. Antonio Gómez-Expósito, electrical engineering professor at University of Seville, says the outage shows that Spain needs more regulations around controlling voltage.

The expert panel report, like other recent analyses from Spain's government and main grid operator, does not indicate that reliance on solar or wind power led to the outage. The panel will issue a final report next year.

Newell says the immediate accusations against renewable energy didn't surprise many people who study attacks on climate solutions. ""We've known this has been a recurring issue,"" Newell says. ""The big frame is that 'renewables are bad and we can't trust them'.""

Renewable critics said blackout was caused by lack of ""inertia"" - it wasn't

When critics of renewable energy pointed the finger at solar or wind for causing the blackout, many used one word: inertia.

Michael Shellenberger, a longtime critic of renewable energy and proponent of nuclear power with 1.4 million followers on X, said in a post the day of the blackout, ""Renewables don't risk blackouts, said the media. But they did and they do… it's clear that too little 'inertia' due to excess solar resulted in system collapse.""

Inertia is important to the electrical grid because it can help stabilize sudden fluctuations in a grid's frequency. Power plants that run on gas, coal or nuclear use large spinning turbines that create electricity and have inertia. More modern power resources, like wind, solar, and batteries, don't involve inertia, because they are digitally controlled. ""Wind and solar plants either have no inertia or very little,"" Gómez-Expósito says, ""but in return, they have infinitely greater response speeds.""

There is no indication that a lack of inertia was the cause of the outage, Gómez-Expósito says. Spain's main grid operator, Red Eléctrica, released a report about the outage this summer. ""The incident was not caused by an inertia problem,"" it said in a press release.

Renewable misinformation has an impact

False claims that too much reliance on solar and wind caused the blackout in Spain and Portugal fit into broader attacks on renewable energy.

In winter 2021, a massive power outage hit Texas. Investigations ultimately found that the outage's cause was gas and coal plants that were forced offline because of freezing temperatures. But critics of renewable energy blamed solar and wind, says Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University.

""In 2021, again, there was uncertainty on what caused it, but immediately there were attacks on renewable energy,"" Roberts says. "" Sort of exploiting, taking advantage of a crisis to make unfounded accusations.""

Shortly after the power went out in Spain, Newell and his team from the Climate Action Against Disinformation Coalition decided to do a survey about false narratives in the blackout's wake. They surveyed 1,200 people in Spain and 1,200 in the United Kingdom – because many in the U.K. were also paying attention to the outage.

They found seven in ten in Spain and six in ten in the U.K. fell for at least one false narrative about the blackout causes. The most commonly believed false narrative was that the reliance on renewables was at fault.

Newell says while most of the survey respondents acknowledge the reality of climate change, misinformation led many to question the reliability of renewable energy.

Renewable energy plus batteries proving to be reliable in warming world

Solar and wind resources are already proving to be part of a reliable grid, says Elliot Mainzer, chief executive of the California Independent System Operator, which assures the reliability of California's grid. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available.

Mainzer says the key is pairing solar and wind energy with massive batteries. Batteries are especially important with solar, as they absorb excess solar energy during the day, and send it back into the grid after the sun sets and evening demand stays high, Mainzer says.

Mainzer says older power sources have their own problems. California faces a loss of hydropower during droughts. And Mainzer says, gas power plants have some reliability challenges, too.

"" During the kind of heat waves we've seen in recent years, the natural gas plants can come under some significant strain,"" Mainzer says. ""They have to run harder, they mechanically get challenged, and we tend to see a higher outage rate amongst the gas fleet when the temperatures are really, really hot.""

Mainzer says the use of solar plus batteries helped prevent blackouts in California in 2022 when there was a heatwave hitting much of the state and gas plants were under performing. Texas' main grid operator, ERCOT, has also said that an increase in solar and battery storage has helped the state avoid power outages — especially as the state sees unexpected outages with coal plants.

As the planet sees longer and more intense heat waves with global warming, primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels, Mainzer says solar combined with batteries, both of which perform well in the heat, will be important to keep the lights on.

Brighton Supervisor William Moehle said losing nearly $5 million in research funding threatens innovation in clean energy.
Schenectady Mayor Gary McCarthy said the cuts could derail clean energy progress at GE Vernova.","Governor Kathy Hochul is sounding the alarm after the federal government slashed nearly $500 million in clean energy funding for dozens of New York businesses and institutions — a move she says puts more than 1,000 jobs at risk and threatens the state’s growing clean energy economy.

The sweeping cuts, initiated by the Trump administration through the U.S. Department of Energy, target approved grants supporting projects across the state, from Buffalo to Brooklyn. Hochul says the fallout could total a $650 million blow to New York’s economy.

“These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress,” Hochul said. “Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are playing politics with the government shutdown, and New York’s economy and hard-working families are paying the price.”

Who’s impacted?

More than two dozen organizations and companies were listed among the affected, including:

Plug Power Inc. (Rochester and Capital Region) — over $147 million cut

GE Vernova and GE — more than $62 million cut in the Capital Region

IBM — nearly $20 million cut in the Mid-Hudson region

American Institute of Chemical Engineers — more than $79 million cut statewide

Urban Mining Industries and Urban Electric Power — over $43 million cut in the Mid-Hudson region

Universities and research institutions like Cornell, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Columbia University are also impacted.

Local leaders react

Empire State Development President Hope Knight said the cuts will “stifle New York’s clean energy economy while killing good-paying jobs.”

Doreen Harris, head of NYSERDA, called the move “short-sighted,” adding that it creates “further uncertainty for organizations and businesses that need stability to plan, invest, and grow.”

Political fallout

A wave of elected officials joined Hochul in condemning the decision — including Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand and nearly every Democratic member of New York’s congressional delegation.

Senator Schumer called it a “reckless campaign of chaos and revenge” that will “raise families’ electric bills just to score petty political points.”

Locally, town supervisors and mayors say the damage is personal.

Henrietta Supervisor Steve Schultz warned that local companies like Plug Power will suffer.

Brighton Supervisor William Moehle said losing nearly $5 million in research funding threatens innovation in clean energy.

Schenectady Mayor Gary McCarthy said the cuts could derail clean energy progress at GE Vernova.

What’s next?

Governor Hochul and state leaders are calling on New York’s Republican members of Congress to pressure the Trump administration to reverse the cuts.

“These aren’t Democratic or Republican projects,” said Rep. Paul Tonko. “These are cutting-edge programs working to drive innovation and bring energy costs down for everyone.”

The N.C. Utilities Commission will hold hearings on Duke's plan next year before issuing an order before the end of 2026.
But, Neal said, earlier versions of Duke's resource plan would already come close to violating those rules if enacted.
Curry, of the Sierra Club, mentioned pollution as a cost of Duke Energy's decision to delay coal plant retirements.
Instead of holding onto coal, Curry suggested that Duke turn to more emissions-free technologies to help those communities.","Proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulatory rollbacks are key to Duke Energy's plan to delay the retirement of three power plants that partially run on coal.

The Biden Administration's EPA proposed a stringent emissions rule that would have effectively required coal plants planning to remain online after 2032 to co-fire with at least 40% natural gas by 2030. That rule also said plants operating after 2038 would need to capture and sequester at least 90% of their carbon dioxide.

Earlier this year, the Trump Administration EPA proposed rolling back that rule entirely, arguing it would save customers nationwide more than $1 billion annually.

In a resource plan filed last week, Duke officials pointed to that rollback and other Trump Administration coal-friendly policies as key to its decision to keep three North Carolina coal plants online longer than previously intended.

""Stringent environmental regulations on air emissions and wastewater discharges have put significant pressure on the viability of aging coal units to remain both cost-effective and compliant over time. However, policies related to coal-fired generation are shifting under the current federal administration,"" Duke Energy wrote in an appendix to its recent Carolinas Resource Plan.

Duke Energy also warned that future administrations could shift policies again to re-enact more stringent policies.

Critics of Duke's intention to delay coal plant retirements contend that it means the utility will be keeping a dirty, outdated fuel source online at a time when carbon-free resources are widely available. Mikaela Curry, a campaign manager for the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign,

""Coal is not the most economic choice, and it's expensive,"" Curry said.

In its filing, Duke Energy acknowledges that declining demand for coal could mean rising costs as the coal mining industry consolidates over the coming decade or so. The decreased demand for coal could also, the company said, shrink the mining workforce and make it difficult for remaining producers to ramp up supply when necessary.

Curry expressed specific concern about the longest delay, at Duke's Belews Creek plant, where a co-fired coal and natural gas plant will be allowed to stay online through 2039 to allow more time for the development of a small modular nuclear facility that Duke is proposing for the site.

""They're being delayed because of Duke's insistence to pursue unproven technology that's not available, and to see that happening at the same time that we're seeing Duke fail to bring on proven available technology like solar and battery storage at the pace and scale that we need, it's really frustrating,"" Curry said.

What is Duke's plan?

For years, Duke Energy has said that it intended to retire all of its North Carolina coal-fired power plants by 2035.

That is changing, though, with demand for electricity rising and Duke scrambling to meet demand for new manufacturing facilities, data centers and residents across the Carolinas.

The three plants where Duke is considering delaying retirements are all capable of burning a combination of coal and natural gas. They include:

Belews Creek Steam Station in Stokes County, which could run as late as Jan. 1, 2040. The plant was originally set to retire at the end of 2035. By delaying the retirement through 2039, Duke officials said they could replace it with small modular nuclear reactors that are not yet commercially available. It is important for the company's grid, Duke said, that a significant electric generator remain online at that specific point in the system.

Cliffside Unit 5 in Cleveland and Rutherford Counties, which could operate through 2032 instead of the 2030 data proposed in Duke's previous resource plan.

Marshall Units 3 and 4 in Catawba County, which could operate through 2033 instead of 2031 as proposed in previous plans.

""This limited extension of retirement dates for these units allows the system more time to integrate incremental new resources by providing additional capacity for a limited period of time while taking on some incremental risk to reliability from the continued operations of these coal units in the interest of supporting the incremental economic development growth assumed by the Advancing Development Load Forecast,"" Duke Energy wrote in its resource plan.

Basically, delaying coal retirements will give Duke more time to develop nuclear plants, add battery storage and build solar panels. Duke officials believe that will let them meet growing electricity demand for electricity, even if maintaining fuel lines and keeping aging power plants operating adds some different risks.

""These plants are run usually during just periods of very high demand and (for) a limited number of hours throughout the year, but having that flexibility to defer just a couple of the units helps ensure near-term reliability,"" Glen Snider, Duke Energy's managing director of integrated resource planning, said in an interview.

The N.C. Utilities Commission will hold hearings on Duke's plan next year before issuing an order before the end of 2026. Typically, those orders have directed Duke Energy to take a number of actions over the coming two years based on the direction the utility wants to head in, leaving open the possibility for changes in regulations or technology.

Critiques of Duke's plan

Even if the EPA moves forward with its plan to roll back the Clean Air Act rules, there will likely be lengthy lawsuits around it, David Neal, a Southern Environmental Law Center senior attorney, said in an interview.

The N.C. Utilities Commission finalized Duke's most recent resource plan before the Biden-era EPA finalized the Clean Air Act rules. But, Neal said, earlier versions of Duke's resource plan would already come close to violating those rules if enacted.

""The prior coal retirement schedule in the last approved Carbon Plan was already butting up against some of those 111 rule requirements, but what Duke's put forward now would completely violate those rules,"" Neal said.

Neal also expressed concern that the delay in retiring coal coincides with Duke Energy's intention to also delay the development of both onshore and offshore wind, as well as the construction of a new hydro pumped storage station.

Put together, he said, that inaction in both directions could mean Duke Energy's state-mandated net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 are already in peril.

""Duke isn't deploying the fuel-free, carbon-free resources it needs to be on track,"" Neal said.

Other EPA rollbacks

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA has also proposed a repeal of the agency's Biden-era Mercury and Air Toxic Standards for power plants fired by coal and oil.

The proposal would rescind changes made in 2024. Changes would return the rule to previously allowed higher levels of particulate matter emissions, rescinding a requirement that power plants continuously monitor for emissions.

In a news release announcing the rollback, the EPA pointed to North Carolina as one of a dozen states whose coal plants were impacted by the Biden-era rule. EPA officials have said they intend to finalize the new rule by December.

Curry, of the Sierra Club, mentioned pollution as a cost of Duke Energy's decision to delay coal plant retirements.

""There's the cost of these communities and the people who live next to these plants and who are breathing the air or dealing with contaminated water,"" Curry said.

Instead of holding onto coal, Curry suggested that Duke turn to more emissions-free technologies to help those communities.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b75537/2147483647/strip/true/crop/460x242+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F20%2Ffd%2Fa83aa761481abd9af0b69d2f61eb%2Fbelewscreekaerialduke.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 10:01:18.537169

For example, in June 2025, Meta and Constellation announced a 20-year power purchase agreement whereby Meta will purchase the clean energy attributes of Constellation’s 1,092-megawatt Clinton Clean Energy Center in central Illinois.","At a Glance

States are working to solve energy resource adequacy considerations as demand increases; but in many states, supply is being reduced either by policy developments or market considerations.

Legislatures in multiple states are considering or enacting mandates that require data centers to source a significant portion — or even all — of their electricity from renewable sources.

There is a growing trend towards clean-firm technologies — including enhanced geothermal, long-duration storage technologies and next-generation nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors. Data centers are also exploring unique arrangements, collocating natural-gas turbines, solar and storage technologies to diversify their energy supply and enhance reliability.

Successful advocacy in this context involves early outreach to municipal leaders, residents and regional planning agencies, along with transparent communication about energy sourcing, sustainability measures and community benefits. Building coalitions with organized labor, business interests and advocacy organizations is essential.

Reliable, scalable and sustainable energy is the lifeblood of the data center industry. With the rapid growth of cloud adoption, artificial intelligence and next-generation connectivity, data centers are driving unprecedented demand for electricity. This surge in demand has elevated power supply and energy policy as top priorities for developers, operators and state policymakers. Recent activity at public utility commissions (PUCs) and state legislatures is reshaping the energy landscape, creating both challenges and opportunities for industry stakeholders.

Data Centers’ Growing Energy Needs

Data centers now account for some of the largest electricity loads in many regions, leading utilities and PUCs to review and update large-load tariff structures. In several states, utilities are exploring new grid interconnection frameworks to accommodate the rapid expansion of data center campuses. Investments in transmission upgrades and grid modernization are underway, as utilities seek to balance reliable service with cost control and ensure that new data center loads do not strain existing infrastructure. States are working to solve for resource adequacy considerations as demand increases; but in many states, supply is being reduced either by policy developments or market considerations. These developments require careful legal review and advocacy to ensure that data center projects are not delayed by regulatory barriers or insufficient grid capacity.

Trends Towards Renewable Power

Environmental concerns and corporate commitments to ESG goals are also driving a shift toward renewable energy procurement in the data center sector. According to S&P Global, the technology and web services industry was responsible for 84% of the tracked U.S. clean energy procurement from February 2025 through July 2025. In 2024, data centers accounted for roughly half of the clean energy procurements nationally. Legislatures in multiple states are considering or enacting mandates that require data centers to source a significant portion — or even all — of their electricity from renewable sources. Utilities are responding by developing green and large-load tariffs and programs that allow direct access to wind, solar and battery storage projects. Data center operators are increasingly entering into power purchase agreements for renewable energy, navigating the complexities of interconnection queues and grid balancing. Public utility commissions are actively crafting policies to facilitate these transitions, with new regulations designed to encourage both sustainability and grid reliability, while ensuring continued economic development opportunities.

The energy generation and transmission issues faced by the data center industry varies considerably between states that have established ambitious clean energy goals compared to states that have not. For example, in Illinois, renewable energy and nuclear power have garnered more attention given the planned fossil fuel plant retirements as established under the Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, whereas natural gas continues to be a key generation source in states that have not established such ambitious clean energy targets.

Trends Towards Nuclear Power

At the same time, the data center industry is leaning into nuclear power generation as evidenced by a number of power purchase agreements between data center companies and nuclear energy generators. Nuclear power generates nearly 20% of U.S. electricity, over 50% of Illinois’ power and nearly 55% of America’s emissions-free power generation — more than all other clean energy sources combined. Data center companies are adding nuclear to their energy portfolios because it’s carbon-free, scalable, safe and provides reliable baseload power.

For example, in June 2025, Meta and Constellation announced a 20-year power purchase agreement whereby Meta will purchase the clean energy attributes of Constellation’s 1,092-megawatt Clinton Clean Energy Center in central Illinois. This agreement supports the relicensing of over one gigawatt of carbon-free power and an additional 30 megawatts of power at the Clinton Clean Energy Center, enabling continued operation of the facility without increasing costs to ratepayers. Other hyperscalers have taken similar actions. Increasingly, agreements with existing nuclear facilities include efforts to uprate their capacity, extend their operating life and provide more financial stability, contributing to both sustainability and grid reliability.

Trends Towards Reliable, Diverse & Clean-Firm Power

Alongside these developments, there is a growing trend towards clean-firm technologies — including enhanced geothermal, long-duration storage technologies and next-generation nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs). Data centers are also exploring unique arrangements, collocating natural-gas turbines, solar and storage technologies to diversify their energy supply and enhance reliability.

Regulatory Advocacy & Coalition-Building

Evolving state and local energy regulations present both hurdles and opportunities for strategic engagement. Data center stakeholders are actively lobbying for streamlined permitting for new grid connections and substations, as well as incentives for on-site generation, microgrids and energy storage solutions. The legal landscape is dynamic, requiring skills in securing regulatory approvals and structuring compliant development agreements. Stakeholders and their counsel need to anticipate regulatory shifts, advocate for favorable policies and unlock new opportunities as the industry continues to grow.

Large energy projects face heightened scrutiny from local governments, environmental groups and community stakeholders. Successful advocacy in this context involves early outreach to municipal leaders, residents and regional planning agencies, along with transparent communication about energy sourcing, sustainability measures and community benefits. Building coalitions with organized labor, business interests and advocacy organizations is essential to support legislative and regulatory priorities and to help ensure that data center projects receive broad-based support.

Looking Ahead

As power and energy issues take center stage in data center development, proactive legal and advocacy strategies are increasingly critical to help anticipate regulatory changes, shape policy outcomes and achieve goals in a rapidly evolving environment.

In Queensland, wholesale prices dropped 40% in 2023-24, with increased solar and wind energy in the grid playing a key role.","The Queensland Government is expected to release its new Energy Roadmap on October 10. Previous comments from Energy Minister David Janetzki suggest that the plan may promote polluting and expensive coal-fired power for longer, weakening efforts to roll out renewable power and cut climate pollution.

This briefing paper outlines the context behind the energy roadmap, and what this means for Queenslanders and Australia.

What’s the Energy Roadmap?

The Energy Roadmap is intended to provide a five-year plan for Queensland’s energy sector. The plan is expected to reflect previous announcements, including a pledge to scrap Queensland’s legislated renewable power targets, the cancellation of renewable power and storage developments, and delays to the closure of coal-fired power stations. The roadmap is also expected to outline new, smaller pumped hydro projects to replace the cancelled Pioneer-Burdekin project.

Coal and gas fired power stations pollute – and that harms all Australians

Extending or expanding coal and gas power stations will lock in more harmful climate pollution for longer, driving more frequent and extreme weather events.

Queensland is already bearing the brunt of more frequent and severe storms, fires and heatwaves, and the Great Barrier Reef has been severely damaged by a series of marine heatwaves; experiencing six mass bleaching events in the last decade.

If polluting coal power is relied upon for longer, it’s not clear how the Crisafulli Government can meet its election commitment to retain Queensland’s legislated 2035 climate pollution target, of a 75% cut on 2005 levels.

Queensland’s coal-fired power stations are breaking down, and need to be replaced

Like most Australian states, Queensland is facing the need to replace its ageing and increasingly unreliable coal-fired power stations. While some of Queensland’s coal plants are younger than others in Australia, this does not overcome the significant commercial, environmental or engineering challenges the state is facing:

About two-thirds of Queensland’s coal-fired power capacity is at least 30 years old.

Almost half (47%) of Queensland’s coal capacity can be expected to close in the next six years, based on the average closure age for previous Australian coal-fired power stations (42 years).

Even Queensland’s younger stations are struggling to keep up. For example, this summer, Millmeran’s coal units broke down a collective seven times, and one unit faced a week-long unplanned outage.

The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) most recent system plan expects all of Queensland’s coal-fired power stations to close within the next decade, because these costly generators can not compete with cheaper renewable power and storage – like the rooftop solar on more than half of Queensland’s houses. This is already playing out on the ground, with the coal-fired Gladstone Power Station bringing its potential closure date forward six years to 2029.

How might delaying coal closures impact Queensland?

Slowing the development of renewable power and storage and delaying coal-fired power station closures would only hold Queensland back from a more reliable, affordable and clean electricity system. Relying on coal-fired power for longer means:

Higher costs and power bills

Modelling commissioned by the Clean Energy Council shows that if we delay the expected roll out of renewables and continue our reliance on coal and gas nationally, power bills could increase by $449 a year for households, and $877 for a small business this decade. In QLD, this is also costing taxpayers, with the Queensland Government having to invest $1.6 billion in simply maintaining existing coal power stations.

Australia’s independent science agency, CSIRO, has found that building solar and wind power backed by storage is the lowest-cost way to meet our electricity needs. Meanwhile, unplanned outages at ageing coal plants have contributed to four of Australia’s most severe price spikes in the last seven years.

Lost jobs and investment

By sticking with outdated coal infrastructure instead of scaling up renewables and storage, Queensland risks losing out on billions in clean energy investment and thousands of regional jobs, which would be more likely to flow to other states with clear plans to switch to cleaner, cheaper energy.

Modelling undertaken under the previous Queensland Government indicated that achieving a 70% renewable power target by 2032 could create 64,000 jobs and unlock $25.7 billion in economic growth, while reducing power prices. In contrast, continuing to fund ageing coal-fired power stations is not likely to be an effective use of taxpayer funds that could be better spent elsewhere to benefit Queenslanders.

Less reliable power

Australia’s coal-fired power is increasingly unreliable, and is prone to unplanned outages, especially during extreme weather. Therefore, extending dependence on coal can make the power system more unstable. A modern, flexible system that runs on renewables, storage and limited peaking capacity is reliable, and does not rely on only a handful of large generators to keep the lights on.

Analysis of the grid over recent years has revealed that both planned and unplanned coal outages have been a primary driver of power outage risk. The majority of recent power outage risk conditions have occurred in New South Wales and Queensland – the states most dependent on coal generators. During periods with the highest power outage risk, coal availability has been 10-20% lower than is typical.

The Crisafulli Government has cancelled three major renewable energy and storage projects

Since coming to power in October 2024, the Crisafulli Government has taken the unusual step of blocking two previously approved wind farms – Forest Wind Farm and Moonlight Range Wind Farm – citing community opposition. These projects could have powered up to 750,000 homes. In addition, the nationally significant Pioneer-Burdekin pumped hydro project was cancelled.

Renewables backed by storage is the best option for the sunshine state

All around Australia, the data shows that more renewable power in the grid puts downward pressure on power prices. In Queensland, wholesale prices dropped 40% in 2023-24, with increased solar and wind energy in the grid playing a key role. Increasing solar and wind generation, backed up with storage like batteries, can keep power prices in check, improve the reliability of our power system and keep Queenslanders safer from worsening climate change.

Households, businesses, investors and governments all around the world are embracing renewable energy because it’s affordable, clean and can be rolled out fast – the Queensland Government should do the same.",https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/QueenslandEnergy-Roadmap.png,N,,2025-10-09 07:06:04.379173

From the September / October 2025 Issue

The biotech and pharmaceutical sectors stand at the brink of innovation and strategic transformation. Market momentum continues to build, with the global biotechnology market valued at around $2 trillion in 2024, projected to surge to $6 trillion by 2032 with the forecasted compound annual growth rate of nearly 15%, according to a report from SkyQuest Technology Consulting.

The significant theme for 2025 has been the extraordinary integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into drug discovery, R&D, and manufacturing. Industry reports indicate that nearly 93% of life sciences executives intend to increase investments in AI and digital strategies in 2025, recognizing AI’s potential to contribute up to $410 billion in annual value and boost revenue by as much as 11%.

Regulatory shifts also shaped strategic priorities in 2025. In April, a bipartisan effort resulted in the introduction of the National Biotechnology Initiative Act, establishing a new coordination office in the White House to streamline biotech regulation and bolster U.S. competitiveness. The act has been brought to introduction and is awaiting being passed by the House and Senate. This builds on recommendations from the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology, which called for $15 billion in federal investment over five years to safeguard American leadership in biotech.

According to Investopedia, the biotech market is expected to grow from $1.74 trillion in 2025 to $5.04 trillion by 2034, with an annual growth rate of 12.5%. A “biotech boom” has started to take place due to the rapid scientific innovation, surging capital inflows, and growing demand for medical and agricultural breakthroughs.

There have been breakthroughs in gene editing, mRNA vaccines, and AI-driven drug discovery accelerating biotech innovation. Venture capital and public market investments in biotech have surged, with global funding exceeding $48 billion in the past few years.

Regulatory shifts, including faster drug approvals and global policy harmonization, enable faster biotech product commercialization. The expansion of the biotech industry has created jobs, lowered long-term health care costs, and influenced other sectors like manufacturing and energy.

Franklin County, North Carolina: The New Bio-Industrial Nexus

Located just north of Raleigh, Franklin County, North Carolina is quickly establishing itself as a premier bio-industrial hub within the Research Triangle Region. With a population of more than 80,000 and direct access to both the Research Triangle Park (RTP) and the Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU), Franklin County offers a powerful combination of competitive business operating costs, expedited permitting and inspections, a skilled workforce, and an exceptional quality of life.

Franklin County already benefits from strong industry anchors in the bio-solutions and bio tech industry sectors.

The project, known as the Chula Vista Energy Center 2, will be developed by Wellhead Electric Company on a parcel that already hosts a natural gas power generation facility built in 2000. The new installation will use containerized lithium-ion batteries to store excess renewable electricity and discharge it during peak hours or grid emergencies.

Mayor John McCann said the city took extra precautions in reviewing the proposal, noting lessons learned from older battery facilities that experienced fires in Otay Mesa and Escondido.

“We did our due diligence, and the technology that they’re using is far superior and up to date and new,” McCann said Wednesday. “They also are outdoors and not in a warehouse. So I think we did our due diligence in making sure that these battery systems would be as safe as possible.”

The project site at 3497 Main St. lies between Del Monte Avenue and Reed Court in a limited industrial zone, buffered from nearby residential areas by existing landscaping and fencing. The facility will occupy the northern section of the property, operating independently from the gas plant on the southern portion.

The system will consist of 56 temperature-controlled containers housing lithium-ion batteries, supported by transformers, electrical cabinets and substation improvements. A second phase of the project will add additional containers over time to offset gradual battery capacity loss, maintaining the site’s total capacity of 50 megawatts.

The project cleared city safety reviews — including from the Chula Vista Fire Department and the Engineering and Capital Projects Department — and will follow state and federal codes under third-party fire engineer supervision.

McCann said the council’s unanimous vote reflected confidence in the system’s safety and its benefit to the city’s clean energy goals.

“It’s great because this project is going to generate millions of dollars in taxes and economic development that together will bring real value to Chula Vista and the local economy,” he said.

Wellhead Electric President Harold Dittmer said the project will cost around $75 million and will feature “purpose-built containers that are tested and engineered like crazy,” using Tesla Megapack 2 technology and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry, which he described as safer and more stable than earlier versions.

“We had to work with the fire department and make sure that all of the codes are met and the spacing is far enough apart so that if one does happen to catch on fire, it doesn’t start the neighbor,” Dittmer said Wednesday. “The last thing in the world we want to do as long-term owners of these things is build something unsafe.”

McCann said the city did not contribute any public funds toward the project as Wellhead Electric owns the property and is financing construction privately.

“There was already an existing facility there,” McCann said. “Wellhead actually owns the property, and was just expanding on the property that they owned.”

He said the project represents private investment in local clean-energy infrastructure and will benefit the community through job creation and new revenue.",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SUT-L-ENERSMART-BATTERIES-0609-01.jpg?w=1024&h=813,N,,2025-10-09 01:59:17.404220

GM cancels EV lease tax credit program after concerns from Senator Moreno

Program aimed to ease impact of tax credit expiration on dealers

Ford’s similar program status unclear, spokesperson declined to comment

(Reuters) – General Motors is scrapping a program aimed at allowing its dealers to continue offering a $7,500 tax credit for several months on electric-vehicle leases following the September 30 expiration of the federal subsidy, the company said on Wednesday.

Toward the end of last month, GM devised a plan to have its in-house lending arm initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The company planned to apply for the federal $7,500 credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers through the end of the year.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday, declining to elaborate on the reason for its decision.

Moreno told Reuters in an interview he was happy with GM’s decision to scrap the EV tax-credit plan. “The EV subsidies ended September 30 and I’m happy that every car company” is going to abide by that. “I look forward to working with GM,” he said. “We’re putting a lot of policies in place to protect our domestic auto industry.”

The idea behind the program was to ease the impact of the expiration of the tax credit on dealers, who worried they would be stuck with EVs that would be tough to sell. GM had planned to apply for the credit on tens of thousands of EVs in dealer stocks, according to people familiar with the plan.

Ford rolled out a similar program ahead of the tax-credit expiration. It is unclear if Ford is continuing its program. A spokesperson declined to comment.

GM had planned to claim the credit on roughly 20,000 EVs that were on dealership lots or being shipped to stores, people familiar with the matter said. Its finance arm, GM Financial, began making down payments on those vehicles before the deadline to qualify for the subsidy on each of those cars, the sources said.

In its statement on Wednesday, the company said it would “fund the incentive lease terms” through the end of October.

The formula for determining the down payments that GM Financial paid to dealers on those EVs was 5% of the maximum price for each car. For example, GM Financial would have made a down payment of about $6,300 for two Chevrolet Blazer EVs, which top out in the mid-$60,000s, according to documents GM provided to dealers outlining the terms.

GM scrambled to put together the program just a few days before the September 30 tax-credit expiration, and outlined the details on a call with dealers on September 29, three sources said. GM officials had caught wind of a similar program that Ford was putting in place for its dealers, the sources said.

Auto executives, dealers and analysts have said they expect EV sales to plummet in the wake of the tax credit’s disappearance. A consumer rush to take advantage of the subsidy helped drive record electric-car sales in September.

So it’s hardly shocking that many former EV owners say they’d consider returning to battery power only if a generous incentive were back on the table, according to a recent study from The Harris Poll.

Read: Expiring EV Tax Credit Sent Tesla Sales Into Overdrive But Its Flagships Crashed

The survey, conducted between September 23 and 25, included responses from 2,095 adults across the United States. Of these, 1,675 participants, or about 80 percent, said they plan to buy or lease a new or used vehicle in the future. Within that group, 485 respondents, roughly 29 percent, said they were extremely or somewhat likely to choose an EV.

What Would It Take?

Among respondents who had previously owned or driven an electric vehicle but later switched away, 60 percent said they would need an incentive of at least $5,000 to consider returning to an EV.

A further 30 percent said they would need an incentive of between $2,500 and $4,999 to reconsider, while 11 percent said they would be willing to accept an incentive of less than $2,500.

Senior consultant at The Harris Poll, Greg Paratore, acknowledged that affordability remains the top concern for 64 percent of EV buyers.

Automakers Step In

While the removal of the new and used EV tax credit will impact demand for electric cars, Paratore noted that automakers could use the removal of the credit to build extra trust with consumers by helping to share the added cost burden.

For example, Hyundai recently announced it’s cutting prices of the 2026 Ioniq 5 by a significant $9,800 in the wake of the tax credit’s removal. Additionally, Hyundai is offering a $7,500 cash incentive on the remaining 2025 Ioniq 5s that it has in its inventory.

Meanwhile, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned that EV demand in the U.S. could tumble by as much as half due to the tax credit’s removal. If that happens, electric vehicles could see their market share shrink to around 5 percent, a figure last recorded in 2022.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tesla-Home-Chargeraa-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 03:59:40.303722

Hyperscalers had just begun endorsing the idea, popularized in a landmark Duke University paper, that occasionally dialing down data centers could help make the most of the existing grid — and potentially allow more server farms to come online before new power plants can be built.

However, in their public comments the big tech companies balked at the pitch, repeatedly accusing PJM of “exceeding” its authority. And last week, six of the biggest power users that would be subject to the rules — the tech giants Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and the utilities Calpine, Constellation, and Talen — proposed an alternative.

Acknowledging the need for load flexibility, they pitched the idea that data centers cut back on power usage just 24 to 100 hours per year, and only on a voluntary basis. Aniruddh Mohan, an energy associate at the consultancy The Brattle Group, said that could be sufficient, though it’s no guarantee.

“If sufficient large loads volunteered to provide demand response, it is possible that 24 to 100 hours per year of demand response could be sufficient for reliability under many conditions,” Mohan told Latitude Media via email. “If it turns out we still need more supply, it’s unclear how much more additional generation and storage can be brought online within the next five years.”

PJM issued a forecast last month calling for at least five gigawatts of load flexibility by 2030. While flexibility “conceptually is a good thing,” former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member Allison Clements explained on a recent Latitude Dispatch about PJM, it’s essentially a stop-gap measure for a grid plagued by bottlenecks and delays, and “not ideal from an efficiency or an economic perspective.”

As a secondary measure, the companies called on PJM to establish a new procedure that would trigger data centers to go off-grid and switch to on-site back-up generators. The proposal also calls for setting up a new procurement process that would lock in today’s current high prices for seven years, giving developers an extra incentive to invest in new clean, firm power plants to meet surging demand.

But they also acknowledged that the system may ultimately need less new generation than the hype today suggests.

Grid operators’ load-growth forecasts tend to come from transmission owners. In Texas, the ERCOT receives those estimates but modifies the forecasts based on factors such as how successfully large power users, like data centers, managed to come online. The PJM currently does not have that same kind of check on its forecasts.

The hyperscalers’ pitch called for implementing corrections based on a range of factors, including those that have nothing to do with generation, such as the availability of the microchips needed over the next five years to actually construct proposed data centers. ERCOT, for example, reduces all new data center demand by about half, based on the average number of proposed new server farms that entered into service between 2022 and 2024.

PJM has signaled interest in adjusting its load forecasting, including giving state regulators the chance to review and provide feedback before the grid operator finalizes load forecasts. “As the load forecast is driving these reliability considerations, this is definitely worth examining closely,” Mohan said.

But revising estimates’ enough to bend the curve on how much power is needed on the grid “is somewhat wishful thinking,” said Daniel King, a research fellow at the right-leaning Foundation for American Innovation.

“Even if, frankly, load forecasts do improve, it won’t be by the nearly double-digit gigawatt amounts that will really tip the scales or change the fact that we’re in the situation of pretty great resource inadequacy,” King told Latitude Media.

One thing the proposal’s nine-page slidedeck does not include: an idea for how PJM should speed up interconnections, a key consideration for bringing new power sources onto the grid.

But other pitches submitted to PJM do mention the interconnection queue. The grid operator has set a deadline of December for submitting a final proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

In the meantime, different parties have until October 14 to submit counter proposals. Then the PJM will negotiate a deal that draws from the range of solutions put forward. Once that blended proposal is public, stakeholders will have time to comment before PJM holds a final vote on what goes to FERC.

The talks come amid mounting political pressure on PJM to curb soaring electricity prices. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro held a 13-state summit two weeks ago to convene governments from every state in the PJM system and discuss ways to pressure the grid operator to bring new generation online faster and at lower rates. If that fails, the Democrat said, Pennsylvania may consider exiting the grid operator altogether and forming its own statewide market like those in New York and California.

PETERSBURG — Arevon Energy, Inc. has announced that operations are underway at its Ratts 1 and Heirloom Solar projects in Pike County, Indiana. Together, the projects add 264 megawatts of new domestic solar power to the grid and are the company’s first owned and operational utility-scale projects in the Hoosier State.

A ribbon-cutting ceremony was hosted to commemorate the start of operations at Ratts 1 and Heirloom. Speaking at the ribbon-cutting were Kevin Smith, Chief Executive Officer at Arevon; Jill Hyneman, Executive Director at Pike County Chamber of Commerce; and Aaron Meyer Principal at Winslow Elementary School.

“Ratts 1 and Heirloom are about more than megawatts — they are tangible illustrations of the positive and real impact renewable energy can bring to local communities,” said Smith. “These facilities will produce American-made power for decades, while also supporting Pike County’s economy and quality of life. Arevon is proud to be a long-term partner here, as we continue to invest in Indiana’s future.”

Ratts 1 and Heirloom represent an investment of nearly $400 million and will disburse more than $86 million to local governments over their lifespans, supporting schools, infrastructure, and other essential public services. The two facilities employed more than 200 full-time equivalent personnel to build the projects and also brought about an increase in spending at local stores, hotels, and restaurants. Ratts 1 Solar is under a long-term power purchase agreement with Indiana Municipal Power Agency, and Meta is the offtaker for Heirloom Solar.

“The Ratts 1 project is a great addition to IMPA’s power supply portfolio,” said Senior Vice President, Market Operations and Planning at IMPA Kyle Brouillette. “This solar site helps us further diversify our resources, assisting in our mission to provide low-cost, reliable, and environmentally responsible power. We’re glad to be a part of Arevon’s project and celebrate this milestone in energy production.”

To date, Arevon has partnered with and supported the following local organizations and initiatives: the Pike County Affordable Housing Program, Jefferson Township Volunteer Fire Department, Elmer Buchta Technology Center, Pike County Chamber of Commerce, Pike County 4-H Fair, Pike County High School Career Fair, among others.

“Pike County is an energy community, and renewable energy sources are a piece of our diversified energy strategy. We are grateful for Arevon’s investment in our area,” said Ashley Willis, MPA, EDFP, executive director at the Pike County Economic Development Corporation. “Solar power is a wonderful asset for rural communities, like Pike County, to increase assessed value and has had a positive impact on our tax revenue for our taxing districts.”

Arevon is actively growing its portfolio in the Midwest region of the United States. Besides Ratts 1 and Heirloom, the company is currently constructing the two-phase 430 MWdc Kelso Solar Project in Missouri. In addition, Arevon developed and managed construction of the 251 MWdc Gibson Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana Public Service Company, or NIPSCO, and the 228 MWdc Posey Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company. Arevon is also actively advancing development on other proposed renewable energy facilities in the region.

What’s on the ballot?

If the Texas Constitution had a graded report card, it would read “needs improvement.” Much of this stems from a, you guessed it, post-Reconstruction response to limit governmental powers and citizen involvement. Many of America’s problems stem back to the Civil War and the failure to respond to white supremacist backlash of the Reconstruction Era. This document, our Constitution, that simultaneously holds and protects our most precious rights, is no exception with components that are built strictly to make our government inefficient at delivering public goods. That’s why it’s been amended more than 530 times, and why our legislature is one of less than five states that only meets biannually (instead of every year). It sucks, but we’re stuck with it.

This November, 17 amendments have been proposed by our legislature (under attack for its similar efforts to kick you out of your own government through racial redistricting) to continue in this strong tradition of taking away opportunity for civic engagement. Don’t let them, and learn what’s on the ballot next month ahead of time (totaling to more than $50 billion in property tax cuts). Fund your public services, and fight back by getting informed on what other unsatisfactory things are going to be added to this work-in-progress document.

Here’s our 2025 Texas voter guide to help you navigate the issues and elections on the ballot this year.

Proposition 1 (SJR 59): yes 🏫

Creates an endowment for the Texas State Technical Colleges, used to purchase loans and buildings.

A “Yes” vote means voting for a TSTC endowment. Would support a skilled workforce and broader career choices in our college system.

A “No” vote means voting against a TSTC endowment. Does not support dedicating reliable funding to TSTC, to be dedicated elsewhere.

Proposition 2 (SJR 18): no ❌

Prohibits the establishment of a capital gains tax (tax on assets like real estate, investments, and personal property).

A “Yes” vote means voting for a ban on a capital gains tax. This protects wealthy Texans and potential for state economic growth. Of note: no such tax was considered by the legislature, this would prohibit future action to propose a capital gains tax.

A “No” vote means voting against a ban on a capital gains tax. A future capital gains tax could shift the tax burden from those more impacted by sales taxes to wealthier Texans.

Proposition 3 (SJR 5): no ❌

Requires the denial of bail for individuals accused of violent offenses punishable as a felony.

A “Yes” vote means voting to support the denial of bail for high risk individuals. This introduces a financial barrier only put on poorer Texans, as denying bail usually requires a trial, increasing risk of imprisonment to overcrowded jails.

A “No” vote means voting against additional bail reform. Judges already have tools at their disposal to keep accused individuals under state supervision.

Proposition 4 (HJR 7): yes 🌊

Dedicates the first $1 billion per fiscal year of sales tax revenue exceeding $46.5 billion to the Texas water fund until 2047.

A “Yes” vote means voting to support funding from sales tax revenue to the Texas water fund. Texas is in a water crisis, facing increased demand and aging infrastructure. Long-term funding would help address these and farmers’ needs, as well as our economic growth.

A “No” vote means voting against additional revenue for the Texas water fund.This transfers authority to the governor-appointed Texas Water Development Board from the legislature.

Proposition 5 (HJR 99): yes 🐔

Exempts individuals from taxes on animal feed.

A “Yes” vote means voting for a tax exemption for those selling animal feed. This could help farmers and ranchers, already dealing with rising costs. Animal feed is already tax exempt when harvested or purchased.

A “No” vote means voting against a tax exemption to sell animal feed.This could benefit large businesses selling feed.

Proposition 6 (HJR 4): no ❌

Bans new taxes on securities transactions, and financial market operators (aimed at those who work in the stock market today, or will work in the Texas Stock Trade).

A “Yes” vote means voting for a ban on stock trade taxes. This would cement protection for those invested in the market, and for the new Texas Stock Trade (TXSE) in Dallas.

A “No” vote means voting against a ban on stock trade taxes. This would only impact the most wealthy Texans, and future reforms and regulations could bring forward budget measures to return revenue to working class Texans, who face the brunt of sales and property tax hikes.

Proposition 7 (HJR 133): yes ✅

Provides a property tax exemption for deceased veterans’ spouses.

A “Yes” vote means voting for tax breaks for veteran widow/widowers. This would provide tax breaks for the un-remarried spouses of veterans who died in the line of duty.

A “No” vote means voting against tax breaks for veteran widows/widowers.This could reduce property tax revenue, impacting local school districts. Expected to impact 3,000 Texans.

Proposition 8 (HJR 2): no ❌

Bans taxes on estate and inheritance.

A “Yes” vote means voting for a ban on inheritance taxes. Our state does not have estate taxes, and a ban would prevent future regulations that could level the playing field to shift the tax burden from working families to wealthy Texans.

A “No” vote means voting against a ban on inheritance taxes. A ban would only benefit a handful of Texans, making others pay higher property taxes.

Proposition 9 (HJR 1): toss up 🤷

Introduces a tax exemption for up to $125,000 worth of business inventory or equipment.

A “Yes” vote means voting for a tax exemption for business inventory or equipment. This could help relieve small businesses of large financial costs to produce income derived from expensive equipment or inventory.

A “No” vote means voting against a tax exemption for business inventory or equipment.This tax exemption could be exploited by big businesses, and could reduce income for school districts from property taxes—though the state will pay for that loss with general revenue.

Proposition 10 (SJR 84): yes 🏠

Introduces a temporary tax exemption for homeowners whose properties were destroyed by fire.

A “Yes” vote means voting for tax breaks for victims of house fires. While most individuals might have home insurance, this exemption could be an extra support.

A “No” vote means voting against a tax break for house fire victims.This exemption only applies to those whose houses are completely destroyed.

Proposition 11 (SJR 85): yes 👵🏾

Increases school property tax exemptions from $10,000 to $60,000 for elderly and disabled homeowners.

A “Yes” vote means voting for a tax exemption for elderly and disabled homeowners. The state will pay for losses, and this amendment provides extra support for an expected 2 million homeowners—who are more likely to be in fixed income households.

A “No” vote means voting against a tax exemption for elderly and disabled homeowners.This would mean school districts have to find funding elsewhere than property taxes derived from these individuals.

Proposition 12 (SJR 27): no ❌

Expands the State Commission on Judicial Conduct (investigates judicial misconduct and reviews termination of judgeships).

A “Yes” vote means voting for the expansion of the SCJC. This new membership would be outweighed by Governor-appointed citizens, and could politicize the judicial process. While proponents claim this could help promote accountability, critics claim that this could be used against progressive judges.

A “No” vote means voting against the expansion of the SCJC. Currently, membership includes six judges or justices, two attorneys, and five citizens appointed by different bodies. Voting against this amendment prevents the executive branch from undermining the review of judicial conduct by keeping membership numbers from increasing.

Proposition 13 (SJR 2): yes 🏠

Increases school property tax exemption for all homeowners, from $100,000 to $140,000.

A “Yes” vote means voting for the increase of homestead exemptions. If this was implemented last year, it would have helped homeowners save $490, on average. The state will pay for losses in revenue for school districts (an estimated $2.7 billion for 2026-2027).

A “No” vote means voting against the increase of homestead exemptions.This does not benefit renters, and leaves less revenue from property taxes to pay for school districts.

Proposition 14 (SJR 3): yes ✅

Establish the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (DPRIT).

A “Yes” vote means voting to fund (DPRIT). Provides $3 billion in funding for dementia research and prevention to study brain related conditions (dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, etc…) This could establish Texas as a national leader in dementia research.

A “No” vote means voting against dedicating funding to DPRIT. One might vote against this if they believe medical research should be left to the private sector.

Proposition 15 (SJR 34): no ❌

Codifies “parental rights” language in the Constitution.

A “Yes” vote means voting to codify parental rights language. This could weaponize the Constitution to propagate right-wing culture wars involving LGBTQ+ families, book bans, and what’s taught in public schools.

A “No” vote means voting against the codification of parental rights language. Parental rights are already outlined in federal case law, and voting against this language being codified would protect against attacks on LGBTQ+ families, book bans, and what’s taught in our public schools.

Proposition 16 (SJR 37): no ❌

Adds citizenship requirements to the Constitution.

A “Yes” vote means voting to add citizenship requirements to the Constitution. This is a redundant amendment as U.S. citizenship is already a requirement to register to vote in Texas. This is an inflammatory response aligned with anti-immigration policies and stokes fear about non-citizen voting (an extremely rare phenomenon).

A “No” vote means voting against additional citizenship requirements in the Constitution. This would protect against the Constitution being wielded to propagate xenophobic rhetoric and policies.

Proposition 17 (HJR 34): no ❌

Provides tax exemption for property involved with border security infrastructure

A “Yes” vote means voting for border security efforts and exemptions for property around the Texas-Mexico border. This could incentivize support for border security infrastructure, and shift the tax burden onto other property owners. This could be used to bring forward measures to militarize the border.

A “No” vote means voting against property tax exemptions for border security infrastructure. This amendment could be used to flame xenophobic rhetoric, and bolster support for border security infrastructure.
