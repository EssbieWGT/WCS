While improvements in vehicle battery technology have led to increased battery range, consumers are still left wondering how long they can expect their vehicle battery to last. After all, the battery pack is the most expensive part of an electric car, with a new battery costing upwards of $20,000.

So what can you expect for an electric vehicle’s battery lifespan? We have the important answers.

What are EV Batteries?

Internal combustion engined cars are powered by gasoline, while EVs are powered by a battery pack driving one or more electric motors. The batteries that power electric cars are rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which is the same type of battery found in cell phones and other consumer electronics. Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density than lead-acid or nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, which means they don’t take up as much space while providing an equivalent level of power. A vehicle’s battery capacity is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh), so a vehicle with a higher kWh rating means it has more range.

How Long Do EV Batteries Last?

The lifespan of an EV battery depends on a number of factors. While battery life can vary, EV manufacturers are generally required to issue a warranty for at least 8 years or 100,000 miles. However, some manufacturers offer longer warranties. Kia offers a battery pack warranty for 10 years or 100,000 miles, and Hyundai provides warranty coverage on EV batteries for the vehicle’s entire lifetime. Battery warranties vary not only by time but also by the nature of the coverage. Some automakers will only replace the battery if it completely fails, while others, like BMW, Tesla, and Volkswagen, will cover a battery if its capacity falls below a certain percentage.

Recent studies show that EV batteries may retain around 90% capacity after 100,000 kilometers and about 87% after 300,000 kilometers, with an annual degradation rate of approximately 1.8%. For example, a Tesla Model S only loses an estimated five percent of battery capacity over its first 50,000 miles. As battery technology continues to evolve, companies are creating larger batteries with increased range and reduced degradation. The first-generation Nissan LEAF had a maximum range of 84 miles, while the newest LEAF has a maximum range of 212 miles.

Modern electric car batteries are increasingly designed to last the entire life of the vehicle, reducing the likelihood of needing a battery replacement. With advancements in battery management systems and engineering, an EV battery is expected to last 10-20 years, depending on maintenance and care.

How to Prolong the Life of Your Electric Vehicle Battery

Just like there are preventative maintenance measures to extend the life of your gasoline vehicle, there are EV charging measures you can take to prolong your EV’s battery life. Here are the top tips to protect your EV battery’s health:

1. Avoid parking in extreme temperatures

Lithium batteries have thermal management systems that will heat or cool themselves, which in turn uses energy and drains EV battery packs. Try to park in the shade if possible on hot days and inside in extreme cold temperatures to assist battery longevity.

2. Don’t Charge Your Car Too Much or Too Little

Modern electric cars are equipped with management systems that avoid charging and discharging at the maximum and minimum charging levels. You should avoid charging your vehicle above 80 percent or below 20 percent to extend EV battery life.

3. Minimize Use of Fast Charging Stations

DC fast charging stations can bring your battery level up to 80 percent in as little as 30 minutes. With this convenience comes a strain on your EV battery. For optimal battery life, you should limit how often you plug in to these fast charging stations for occasional scenarios, like road trips.

4. Maintain Optimal State of Charge While Vehicle is Stored

If you are planning on storing your vehicle for a long time, make sure that your battery does not have an empty or full charge. With a timed charger, you can set it to maintain the charging level between 25 and 75 percent.

Second Life of EV Batteries

When an automotive EV battery’s performance dips below 70 percent, it can have a second life when it is no longer useful to power a vehicle. There are many applications to repurpose EV batteries for renewable energy sources including home battery storage systems and powering manufacturing plants. In Japan, Toyota has installed EV batteries to store power generated from solar panels.

Bottom Line

While an electric car’s battery life can vary, advancements in technology have helped ensure that it typically lasts for the lifespan of a vehicle. The main factor for prolonging a battery’s life expectancy is to limit the number of charging cycles each battery cell goes through. Battery cells die when a battery reaches its empty or full state of charge for too long, so make sure you charge your vehicle according to the manufacturer’s instructions to minimize battery degradation.

Where it is safe to do so, crews have begun restoring power to customers who lost service but continued icy road conditions may delay teams from safely traveling to restore power. With temperatures dropping below freezing overnight, there is a threat of refreezing on untreated surfaces, which could hamper traveling until roads thaw. We continue to monitor the forecast and are prepared to respond where it is safe to do so.

As of 2 p.m., we have approximately 3,200 company employees, contractors and mutual aid resources in Louisiana, with more anticipated to arrive.

Estimated restoration times will be available on Monday, January 26.

Ice storms cause delays because the damage doesn’t happen all at once. Unlike wind events or hurricanes, ice storms often unfold over many hours or even days, leading to outages that occur in waves.

As freezing rain falls, ice steadily accumulates on power lines, trees and poles, adding layer upon layer of weight. Equipment may hold initially, then fail hours or days later as stress increases. Even small amounts of ice can add hundreds of pounds, causing lines to sag, tree limbs to snap, or poles to be pulled down well after precipitation ends. Trees often fail gradually, with ice-laden branches cracking or falling later as temperatures fluctuate, sometimes bringing down lines after crews have already restored nearby power. Repeated freezing, slight melting and refreezing further strain equipment, weakening components and triggering new outages over time.

Restoring power during winter storms is different from other weather events and requires a careful, step-by-step approach to protect both customers, workers and the electric grid.

Before power can be restored, damage to infrastructure must be assessed. Damage assessment and restoration work has been slowed by downed vegetation blocking roadways and icy road conditions. Once it is safe to do so, crews begin evaluating damage to power plants, transmission lines, substations and local distribution equipment.

Cold load pickup is the phenomenon that takes place when a distribution circuit is re-energized following an extended outage of that circuit.

It is referred to as cold load pickup because the power supply has been unavailable for a period of time, so the load has reached a “cold” state before being re-energized.

Customer safety and community resources

Customers should continue to prioritize safety while outages persist.

Warming centers: Customers in need of shelter and warmth should consider local warming centers or shelters if it is safe to travel. To find a listing of available warming centers, visit GOHSEP’s Louisiana Warming Centers: https://gohsep.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/9d47b24a528f43cf84633a2c04270706

Road conditions: Please be aware that roads may be hazardous or closed during restoration efforts. Road conditions and closure information can be found here from Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development: https://www.511la.org/

: Never use generators indoors or in and never connect a generator directly to home wiring without proper transfer equipment.

Heating safety: Never use ovens, grills or outdoor heating devices to heat your home.

Energy secretary Ed Miliband (pictured) said the agreement marks a historic clean energy security pact with countries including Germany, Norway, France and Denmark to strengthen energy resilience amid global instability.

He added that the deal will, for the first time, commit North Sea nations to delivering part of their 300GW 2050 offshore wind pledge through joint clean-energy projects.

Three years ago these countries set the 300GW target in response to geopolitical shocks, and the Hamburg Declaration will now outline how 100GW will be built through “offshore wind hybrid assets”, which are wind farms directly connected to more than one country using interconnectors.

The Energy Secretary will meet leaders from Germany, France, Belgium, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark and Norway as they pursue plans to transform the North Sea into a major clean energy reservoir.

“We are standing up for our national interest by driving for clean energy, which can get the UK off the fossil fuel rollercoaster and give us energy sovereignty and abundance,” said Miliband.

“After our record renewables auction, we today go further by signing a clean energy security pact with European allies to ensure we maximise the clean energy potential for the North Sea.”

Industry is expected to unveil plans for new projects in response to the pledge, with interconnectors highlighted as crucial to sending clean power where it is needed and ending reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets controlled by petrostates and dictators.

The UK earlier this month secured 8.4GW of offshore wind in its latest auction, which the government described as the biggest in European history.

Further summit outcomes include a statement of intent between the UK and Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands to unlock cross-border offshore electricity projects through joint planning, cost-sharing and market arrangements.

The UK will also agree a framework to deepen collaboration with Germany on offshore hybrid assets, which combine offshore wind connections with interconnectors and could open export opportunities for UK firms.

Talks are beginning between the EU and UK on the UK's participation in the EU internal electricity market to drive investment in North Sea clean energy projects and reduce exposure to fossil fuel price volatility.

The summit will additionally feature agreements between NATO and European countries on cyber security cooperation focused on North Sea infrastructure, with leaders warning of increasing threats.

""Today is a step towards a more integrated energy system in the North Seas,” said Ben Wilson, president of National Grid Ventures.

""LionLink and projects like those being announced today are important for maximising the efficient use of resources, reducing costs, and minimising the impact on coastal communities.”

Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, added that the sector is “fully behind the landmark efforts” to build a regional clean power hub and deliver 100GW of offshore cooperation projects by 2050.

“This deeper cooperation on supply chains, standardisation, and shared infrastructure is not just a strategic necessity, it is the most effective way to bring down energy costs for households and businesses while fuelling sustainable economic growth and high-value jobs for years to come,” stated Vyas.

Jane Cooper, deputy chief executive of RenewableUK, said the announcement will “increase the energy security of the UK and the whole of the North Sea region significantly”.

“We are strengthening our security collaboration to ensure the North Sea’s critical energy infrastructure is protected from harm, so that we can continue to generate the huge quantities of clean power needed by the UK and our neighbours reliably at all times,” added Cooper.

Gus Jaspert, managing director, marine at The Crown Estate, said the UK offshore wind sector “is a national success story” that attracts investment, supports jobs and boosts energy security.",https://renews.biz/media/35295/miliband-credit-zara-farrar-and-desnz.jpg?width=640,N,,2026-01-25 19:57:59.176931

Energy costs — especially gasoline and electricity — play a major but often overlooked role. Our dependence on imported fossil fuels keeps prices far above the national average, placing a heavy burden on families across the state.

Hawaii has more than 1 million registered gas-powered passenger vehicles, or about 4 for every 5 residents. Gasoline prices here are typically 40% to 50% higher than the U.S. average and frequently the highest in the nation. With more than 400 million gallons of gasoline consumed each year, the costs add up quickly.

At today’s average retail price of about $4.40 per gallon, residents spend roughly $1.75 billion annually on gasoline alone. That is more than $1,700 per gas-powered vehicle every year, much of which is money that leaves Hawaii to pay for imported fuel rather than circulating within the local economy.

Electricity costs are just as punishing. Hawaii has the highest electricity rates in the country, averaging more than 40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The reason is straightforward. More than 60% of our electricity is generated from oil. The average household pays about $212 per month for electricity, or over $2,500 per year.

Rates vary by island, but the underlying problem is the same statewide — heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels. Kauai Island Utility Cooperative shows what’s possible. By moving aggressively toward renewable energy, KIUC transformed its rates from the highest in the state to the lowest.

Renewable energy, particularly solar, is a cost-effective, local alternative to fossil fuel. The AES Maui solar farm, which includes battery storage, generates electricity at roughly 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, far less than oil-fired generation.

Hawaiian Electric reports that about half of a typical electricity bill comes from fuel costs. Based on the utility’s own filings, generating electricity from oil costs roughly 21 cents per kilowatt-hour. If electricity were obtained at 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, estimated retail rates would drop to about 30 cents per kilowatt-hour, which would be a meaningful savings for families.

Lower electricity prices could also reduce transportation costs. An electric vehicle traveling three miles per kilowatt-hour, powered by electricity at 30 cents per kilowatt-hour, costs about 10 cents per mile to drive. A gasoline vehicle getting 30 miles per gallon costs roughly 15 cents per mile at today’s fuel prices. Over time, that difference would translate into real savings.

Hawaii already gets about a quarter of its electricity from the sun, and the potential for growth is enormous. The State Climate Commission’s Hawaii Climate Action Pathways 2025 envisions nearly quadrupling solar generation by 2045 through rooftop systems and utility-scale projects.

However, the transition to clean energy has been slowed by decades of fossil fuel subsidies that built an entrenched and increasingly expensive system. The costs of extraction, shipping, processing and storage make imported fuels less competitive than locally produced renewable energy.

Programs like carbon cashback offer a practical and equitable way forward. By placing a fee on fossil fuel pollution and distributing the revenue directly to residents in equal shares, the program discourages fossil fuel use while helping households pay for essentials.

Proposals to use liquefied natural gas as a “bridge fuel” miss the point. LNG is another polluting fossil fuel and remains, in the long run, more expensive and less sustainable than renewables.

The math is clear. Hawaii families spend thousands of dollars each year on imported fossil fuels for electricity and transportation. Faster adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles would lower those costs, reduce pollution, and strengthen local energy independence. Carbon cashback would do exactly that.

When former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) first took office in 2016, she set ambitious goals for remaking the energy mix in Taiwan. At the core of this effort was a significant expansion of the percentage of renewable energy generated to keep pace with growing domestic and global demands to reduce emissions. This effort met with broad bipartisan support as all three major parties placed expanding renewable energy at the center of their energy platforms. However, over the past several years partisanship has become a major headwind in realizing a set of energy goals that all three parties profess to want.

Tsai made good on a key campaign promise to phase out nuclear energy by 2025 through pushing for an energy transition that featured a rapid expansion of Taiwan’s renewable energy capacity. Power generation targets for 2025, set by the Executive Yuan in December 2017, were to increase renewable energy’s share of gross power generation from 5 percent to 20 percent; drop nuclear power to zero from 12 percent; reduce the share of coal-generated power to 30 percent from 45 percent; and increase LNG’s share to 50 percent from 32 percent.

The nuclear strategy conforms to the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) long-held position against nuclear power, originating in the efforts of the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s and its role in the formation of the DPP, over safety and environmental concerns while seeking to reduce reliance on imported energy sources and shift to cleaner ones. Her successor, President William Lai Ching-te (賴清德), vowed to continue the same energy policy direction with a “second energy transition” seeking to catalyze what was achieved from 2016 to 2024.

Nearly nine years after the energy transition policy shift began, the structural change to Taiwan’s power generation is clear. Based on the latest data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, power generation shares by energy sources toward the end of 2025 are remarkably close to the policy targets set in 2017, with one glaring exception — renewable energy.

Renewable energy, including hydro, solar, wind, waste-to-energy, and biomass, produced just over 12 percent of Taiwan’s electricity through November 2025, well off the 20 percent mark. Upon closer examination, one can see that solar installed capacity growth has slowed significantly in 2025, while installed capacity of waste-to-energy, which contributes about 1.2 percent of power generation, has been stagnant since 2023. In 2025 this prompted the Ministry of Economic Affairs to quietly reset the timeline for the 20 percent target to November 2026, a date which may see further outward revisions.

The Executive Yuan’s own Annual Report on National Sustainable Development pointed out some of the reasons for the slower-than-expected adoption of renewable energy: solar power was affected by local governments’ interpretation of regulations and residents’ concerns about the environmental impact on solar farm sites. And biomass and waste-to-energy facilities are stalled by stock feeds collection issues and system operation.

What’s more worrisome is that renewable energy companies appear to have become prime targets for partisan rancor, creating significant uncertainties and unforeseen risks for investors in this sector. That is going to have a negative longer-term impact on public-private efforts to expand and modernize Taiwan’s power generation and grid.

Taiwan’s economy is partly driven by the partnership between domestic manufacturers and global technology giants such as AWS, Microsoft and Google. These global companies place significant demands on their Taiwanese suppliers to produce their sourced products with renewable energy. There are hard deadlines in future years where suppliers must reach 100 percent of production utilizing renewable, zero-emission sources. There is a finite amount of this energy in Taiwan and an absence of supply will inhibit growth in these partnerships while adding costs as supply tightens and demand expands. The only viable solution is to speed up the supply of renewables to reduce the cost and ensure supply meets the demands of global partners.

There are several examples illustrating the growing headwinds to expanding renewable energy.

Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) lawmakers last year alleged Kaohsiung’s lack of supervision resulted in solar vendors causing damage to hillside areas. The reaction to this situation and other solar-related ecosystem impact complaints caused a recent, November 2025, set of amendments to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act (環境影響評估法), the Act for the Development of Tourism (發展觀光條例) and the Geology Act (地質法), jointly supported by both the opposition KMT and the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP). They passed the Legislative Yuan resulting in significant increases in the environmental impact review burden for companies installing solar panels. These actions expanded the bureaucracy, adding time and cost.

Three previously approved waste-to-energy, or solid recovered fuel (SRF), companies in Taoyuan, including US-invested Taiwan Cube, were forced to cease construction or simply withdraw in 2024, after local lawmakers and residents made pollution claims into an election issue. Such a flipflop of a major multi-governmental administrative decision (local and national) affecting large, long-term investments removed renewable energy capacity that could help to not only reduce burgeoning waste, but also produce much-needed renewable electricity. The case also sets a negative precedent for Taiwan as an attractive location for foreign investment.

This latter point is important. The just completed tariff negotiations with the United States seek to place Taiwan as the strategic partner for the US in the development of artificial intelligence technologies, a huge opportunity that could continue to turbo-charge Taiwan’s economy in the coming years; however, it will require power and an investment environment that is transparent and reliable. The situation in Taoyuan undermines future renewable energy production, the removal of waste, and the attractiveness of Taiwan as a market for global capital.

The closing of Taiwan’s nuclear power stations too is a lamentable development. Nuclear power produces zero emissions, is clean and reliable, and should be playing an important role in Taiwan’s ongoing energy transition. The recent loss of three plants has hurt both efforts to reduce emissions as well as Taiwan’s national security, given the absence of energy supply chains in comparison to those needed to power coal, oil and LNG plants. Nuclear power is a plus when we consider Chinese blockade and quarantine scenarios that disrupt incoming energy supplies. It is a modest but welcome development that one of the power plants may yet be restored through efforts by the KMT and that Lai continues to leave open the possibility of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) to power the island in the future. SMRs are attractive but some years away from a mature technology ready for island-wide utility. Politics has undermined an important power source that produces zero emissions.

Environmental protection is fundamentally important to the health and welfare of all countries and should be taken into consideration when assessing renewable energy projects. But the stark reality is that Taiwan is falling behind in its renewable energy goals. While the excesses of more radical environmental demands in Europe have dissipated due to concerns over high prices and the reliability of grids that are overly reliant on renewables, the need for a healthy mix of power sources, including renewables, remains a must.

Pursuing an ambitious renewable energy goal will require bipartisan vision, political will and reliability, and a set of policies that can attract global capital. That was a goal all three parties agreed was important for national advancement as recently as 2016.

It’s time for all parties to stop using renewable energy projects for short-term political gain, otherwise the 20 percent renewable energy target could well remain elusive, endangering important national commitments to the Taiwanese and to the global community.",https://img.taipeitimes.com/images/2026/01/26/p08-260126_RupertHammond-Chambers.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 21:58:44.709422

Energy Secretary Chris Wright called on the Energy Reliability Council of Texas to require major facilities like data centers to operate their backup generators to help reduce the risk of blackouts amid increased energy demands during the winter storm.

What they're saying:

""The Trump administration is committed to unleashing all available power generation needed to keep Americans safe during Winter Storm Fern,"" Wright said. ""The Trump administration will continue taking action to ensure that the 35 GW of untapped backup generation that exists across the country can be deployed as needed during Winter Storm Fern and in the future.""

What does the emergency order do?

What we know:

The order directs ERCOT to require large energy consumers to use backup generators after using all of ERCOT's resources. The order can also be invoked if the Texas power grid falls to emergency level three.

Under section 202c of the Federal Power Act, the Department of Energy has the authority to make temporary changes to the U.S. electric system and ""require by order such temporary connections of facilities and such generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy as in its judgment will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest.""

While the Federal Power Act allows for a waiver of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, an emergency order must ""'to the maximum extent practicable' ensure the order is consistent with environmental laws or regulations and ‘minimizes any adverse environmental impacts.’""

The order would not require defense, homeland security, first responder, air traffic control, hospital facilities, 911 call centers, water treatment or wastewater facilities, natural gas pipeline facilities, natural gas gathering facilities, or other similar facilities to use their backup generators.

ERCOT is required to tell the Department of Energy within one day of directing facilities to use backup generation.

What we don't know:

It is unclear if the use of backup generators will be needed during the current arctic blast.

According to the agency's dashboard, ERCOT's grid is operating under normal conditions with sufficient operating reserves for its current demand.

Power outages in Texas

As of Sunday afternoon, findenergy.com is showing more than 83,000 Texans are without power. A majority of those impacted are in east Texas.

According to ERCOT, current power outages are likely local outages and not an issue with the grid.

What's next:

One analysis found that bills from Indiana’s five investor-owned electric utilities shows went up 17.5% in one year, or $28 a month on average statewide.

So, I was excited to hear that House Republicans would be tackling utility affordability.

But the bill won’t help all Hoosiers.

The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission oversees eight electric utilities and 17 natural gas utilities in the state, according to the commission. However, more than 100 municipal and Rural Electric Membership Cooperatives have withdrawn from the commission’s rate jurisdiction. That includes my provider.

Kerwin Olson, executive director of the consumer-focused Citizens Action Coalition, estimates up to 20% of Hoosiers aren’t protected by regulators — about one in five Hoosiers.

“The rationale is largely that those customers are taxpayers and constituents or voting members and can take complaints directly to the utility. Their only recourse really is common courts if they are not satisfied,” he said.

Olson thinks it’s fair in the context of investor-owned utilities needing more oversight. He does wish some of the state rules on deposits, late fees, reconnect charges and efficiency programs applied to all utilities.

But that’s a fight for another day.

Legislative efforts

The rest of you should be watching House Bill 1002.

Most of the bill doesn’t do anything to reduce or control your gas and electric bills. It instead provides ways to cope with them. But that doesn’t mean those provisions aren’t important.

The bill would do the following:

Require an electricity supplier that is under the jurisdiction of the IURC to offer a low-income customer assistance program that provides financial assistance to low-income residential customers for the payment of monthly bills for utility service.

Block service shut-offs to those customers during dangerously hot months. This protection already exists for cold-weather months — another time when bills jump but disconnection could harm Hoosiers.

Put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans. These plans level out your monthly bills so that your costs are more consistent. But they don’t control or lower them. And ratepayers could opt out of the program if they want.

The one section that could have a positive future impact is performance-based ratemaking.

It’s a newer concept, under consideration in other states, that would tie future rate increase requests to specific metrics. The Indiana bill would pair the new multi-year rate plans with performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.

Lawmakers may also look at peak load demand or environmental sustainability.

It’s unclear if the incentives would be enough to truly impact future rate increases, and customers wouldn’t see change for several years. But it’s a worthy discussion to have as Hoosiers struggle with higher costs.

Gov. Mike Braun is hoping to move the needle by revamping IURC’s membership and targeting rate hikes that pad company profits at the expense of ratepayers.

“Affordability is why I support Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to hold investor-owned utility companies accountable to provide affordable energy before they can increase their profit margin,” he said during his State of the State speech.

“And it’s why I appointed three ratepayer-conscious members, now constituting a majority, to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission — to make decisions in the public interest to ensure utilities provide service at just and reasonable rates.”

Between the executive and legislative efforts, it’s my hope that Hoosiers will start to see the cost curve bend to a more reasonable level after years of increases.",,N,,2026-01-25 16:59:08.968658

We should know that over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from burning fossil fuels for energy and every $1 invested in renewable energy creates 3 times more jobs than in the fossil fuel industry. Polluting fuels for cooking causes 3.2 million premature deaths annually while clean cooking can prevent many of these.

Globally the energy sector, dominated by fossil fuels, accounts for 34 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a total of 20 Gigatons (Gt) of GHG globally (IPCC, 2023). Global CO2 emissions should be halved by 2030 to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

We need energy and more importantly clean energy. Energy lies at the core of a double challenge: leaving no one behind and protecting the Planet. Our challenge is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels to source our electricity, supply our heating and cooling needs, and power our industry and transportation, by accelerating the transition to sustainable and affordable energy for all.

At a time when we are all getting more questions than answers due to climate change, clean energy plays a vital role in reducing emissions, and can also benefit communities lacking access to reliable power sources. But the global data says that 666 million people live in the dark – more than 85 percent of them in Sub-Saharan Africa.

We are aware that a large chunk of the greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the Sun’s heat are generated through energy production, by burning fossil fuels (oil, coal, and gas) to generate electricity and heat.

Our agenda must be clear and it must focus on limiting climate change. To do this , we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable. Renewable energy sources – which are available in abundance all around us, provided by the sun, wind, water, waste, and heat from the Earth – are replenished by nature and emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.

The International Day of Clean Energy on 26 January was declared by the United Nations General Assembly (resolution A/77/327) as a call to raise awareness and mobilize action for a just and inclusive transition to clean energy for the benefit of people and the planet. 26th January is also the founding date of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), a global intergovernmental agency established in 2009 to support countries in their energy transitions, serve as a platform for international cooperation, and provide data and analyses on clean energy technology, innovation, policy, finance and investment. In 2023, the power sector was the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions. We have to take more and more action to reach net-zero by 2050. It’s time to move to alternate and the positive side is that renewable energy sources — such as sunlight, wind, water, organic waste, and heat from the Earth — are abundant, replenished by nature, and emit little to no greenhouse gases or air pollutants. About 80 per cent of the global population lives in countries that are net-importers of fossil fuels – that’s about 6 billion people who are dependent on fossil fuels from other countries, which makes them vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and crises. In contrast, renewable energy sources are available in all countries, and their potential is yet to be fully harnessed.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 99 percent of people in the world breathe air that exceeds air quality limits and threatens their health. Air pollution is associated with 7 million premature deaths every year. The unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide originate mainly from the burning of fossil fuels.

Prices for renewable energy technologies are dropping rapidly. Over 90 per cent of new renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuels alternatives. On the positive note, clean energy sector jobs already outnumber fossil fuel jobs – employing almost 35 million people worldwide. In 2023, 16.2 million people were employed in the renewable energy sector, up from 13.7 million in 2022. The transition towards net-zero emissions will lead to an overall increase in energy sector jobs, while about 5 million jobs in fossil fuel production could be lost by 2030, an estimated 14 million new jobs would be created in clean energy, resulting in a net gain of 9 million jobs.

Our energy consumption must be sustainable and to ensure a sustainable future, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable. With new innovation and technologies things are possible and we must shift to clean energy for the benefit of each and every living being on the planet. We must not forget that we do not have any other planet to live.

A clean energy future is within reach.","On this International Day of Clean Energy, we can feel the world shifting – but we must pick up the pace.

The science tells us we are heading for a temporary overshoot above 1.5 degrees Celsius. Our responsibility is to make that breach as small, as short, and as safe as possible – through a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.

Renewables are the engine that can drive this transition. They are the cheapest source of new power in most places. And last year, for the first time, wind, solar, and other renewables generated more electricity worldwide than coal.

Renewable energy connects communities still left in the dark, provides clean cooking, and opens the door to better health, education, and opportunities. Renewables anchor new industries, create decent jobs and lower energy costs, while shielding countries from geopolitical shocks and market volatility.

Even so, the renewables revolution is not moving fast enough or far enough. Grid infrastructure is lagging well behind the expansion of clean energy capacity, and high costs continue to shut many countries out of the transition entirely.

The roadmap is clear: we must triple global renewable capacity by 2030, by lifting barriers, cutting costs, and connecting clean power to people and industry – with scale, speed, and solidarity.

Regulators must adopt policies that reward clean power and streamline permitting while protecting people and nature. Utilities must upgrade, expand, and digitize grids and interconnections, to carry clean power where it is needed, and scale storage so power systems stay steady as renewables grow. Industry must diversify supply chains so more countries can manufacture, install, and maintain clean energy systems. This includes the critical minerals essential to the transition, which must benefit producing countries and communities – not just global markets.

Finance must bring down the cost of capital, especially for developing countries with vast renewable potential. And multilateral development banks must reduce risk and unlock far greater private investment.

While improvements in vehicle battery technology have led to increased battery range, consumers are still left wondering how long they can expect their vehicle battery to last. After all, the battery pack is the most expensive part of an electric car, with a new battery costing upwards of $20,000.

So what can you expect for an electric vehicle’s battery lifespan? We have the important answers.

What are EV Batteries?

Internal combustion engined cars are powered by gasoline, while EVs are powered by a battery pack driving one or more electric motors. The batteries that power electric cars are rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which is the same type of battery found in cell phones and other consumer electronics. Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density than lead-acid or nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, which means they don’t take up as much space while providing an equivalent level of power. A vehicle’s battery capacity is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh), so a vehicle with a higher kWh rating means it has more range.

How Long Do EV Batteries Last?

The lifespan of an EV battery depends on a number of factors. While battery life can vary, EV manufacturers are generally required to issue a warranty for at least 8 years or 100,000 miles. However, some manufacturers offer longer warranties. Kia offers a battery pack warranty for 10 years or 100,000 miles, and Hyundai provides warranty coverage on EV batteries for the vehicle’s entire lifetime. Battery warranties vary not only by time but also by the nature of the coverage. Some automakers will only replace the battery if it completely fails, while others, like BMW, Tesla, and Volkswagen, will cover a battery if its capacity falls below a certain percentage.

Recent studies show that EV batteries may retain around 90% capacity after 100,000 kilometers and about 87% after 300,000 kilometers, with an annual degradation rate of approximately 1.8%. For example, a Tesla Model S only loses an estimated five percent of battery capacity over its first 50,000 miles. As battery technology continues to evolve, companies are creating larger batteries with increased range and reduced degradation. The first-generation Nissan LEAF had a maximum range of 84 miles, while the newest LEAF has a maximum range of 212 miles.

Modern electric car batteries are increasingly designed to last the entire life of the vehicle, reducing the likelihood of needing a battery replacement. With advancements in battery management systems and engineering, an EV battery is expected to last 10-20 years, depending on maintenance and care.

How to Prolong the Life of Your Electric Vehicle Battery

Just like there are preventative maintenance measures to extend the life of your gasoline vehicle, there are EV charging measures you can take to prolong your EV’s battery life. Here are the top tips to protect your EV battery’s health:

1. Avoid parking in extreme temperatures

Lithium batteries have thermal management systems that will heat or cool themselves, which in turn uses energy and drains EV battery packs. Try to park in the shade if possible on hot days and inside in extreme cold temperatures to assist battery longevity.

2. Don’t Charge Your Car Too Much or Too Little

Modern electric cars are equipped with management systems that avoid charging and discharging at the maximum and minimum charging levels. You should avoid charging your vehicle above 80 percent or below 20 percent to extend EV battery life.

3. Minimize Use of Fast Charging Stations

DC fast charging stations can bring your battery level up to 80 percent in as little as 30 minutes. With this convenience comes a strain on your EV battery. For optimal battery life, you should limit how often you plug in to these fast charging stations for occasional scenarios, like road trips.

4. Maintain Optimal State of Charge While Vehicle is Stored

If you are planning on storing your vehicle for a long time, make sure that your battery does not have an empty or full charge. With a timed charger, you can set it to maintain the charging level between 25 and 75 percent.

Second Life of EV Batteries

When an automotive EV battery’s performance dips below 70 percent, it can have a second life when it is no longer useful to power a vehicle. There are many applications to repurpose EV batteries for renewable energy sources including home battery storage systems and powering manufacturing plants. In Japan, Toyota has installed EV batteries to store power generated from solar panels.

Manufacturers are hemorrhaging cash trying to stop the bleeding. Automakers are dumping $5,700 per EV in incentive spending—more than $2,000 higher than last year—trying to replace the lost federal credit.

Gas Cars Win the Discount War

The money automakers saved by selling fewer EVs went straight into gas and hybrid discounts. Non-EV incentives hit $3,004 per vehicle—up $403 from last year—while traditional hybrids are eating up 14.7% of sales, a 1.4-percentage-point gain. Internal combustion engines claimed 77.7% of sales, up 2.7 percentage points from last year. Total new-vehicle sales for January are projected at 1.12 million units, down 2.7% year-over-year. Consumers will spend $39.7 billion on new vehicles this month, but 27.3% of trade-ins now carry negative equity—up 2.4 percentage points—and 11.7% of buyers are stretching into 84-month loans just to make the math work.

My Verdict

If you're shopping for an EV right now, wait until March or April. Dealers are sitting on inventory they need to clear, and manufacturers are still figuring out how to price these things without federal help. Gas cars and hybrids are getting the best deals in years—if you don't need electric range, buy there instead and pocket the savings. If you're committed to electric, charging infrastructure is finally improving, but the price premium without tax credits is real. Run the total cost of ownership over five years—including insurance, maintenance, and electricity costs—before you sign.

The chief threat to the electric grid comes from ice and freezing rain that can topple trees and strain power lines.
Power loss is the main threat to life over the coming days — and pressure on the power grid is mounting.
Such a failure of natural gas infrastructure occurred during Winter Storm Uri in 2021 that killed 246 people in Texas.
Wright has said that has left customers in jeopardy of power outages during searing heatwaves or deep winter freezes.","The winter storm that stretched across half the country knocked out electricity to more than a million customers on Sunday, sending utilities scrambling to restore power ahead of the sub-freezing temperatures set to descend on tens of millions of people this week.

The outages, which were concentrated in Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana, came after warnings from weather forecasters that Winter Storm Fern could threaten the power grid and test utilities’ ability to meet the surge in demand.

The Trump administration took swift action to shore up some power supplies, with the Energy Department granting PJM Interconnection, the country’s largest electric grid operator, blanket permission to run all its power sources at full tilt — regardless of pollution rules in its region that reaches from the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic.

The concern about energy supplies will grow in the coming days as Fern plunges millions into a cold spell that will put a significant draw on heating and electricity resources. The polar vortex conditions that plunged Arctic air all the way to the Gulf Coast are expected to drive temperatures even lower through the end of the week, running the risk of exhausting power supplies or debilitating the electricity grid.

The chief threat to the electric grid comes from ice and freezing rain that can topple trees and strain power lines. Given the storm’s expansive geographic range, utilities may have fewer personnel to dispatch to help neighboring regions deal with outages as they face disruptions in their own territories.

“The ice is the big concern this week and that’s scary,” said Allison Clements, a former commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “When these types of things happen, you can’t control the ice. You can’t control the tree branch break.”

As of 4:15 p.m. EST Sunday, Tennessee experienced the most outages in the country, at more than 308,000, according to PowerOutage.us. Mississippi had more than 149,000 customers without power, trailed by 138,000 in Louisiana, 103,000 in Georgia, 80,000 in Texas, 67,000 in Kentucky, 33,000 in West Virginia and 28,000 in South Carolina.

Georgia Power said it restored power to 70,000 customers as of 4 p.m. EST, though another 70,000 concentrated in north Georgia and Atlanta are still without electricity.

“The bulk of these outages are caused [by] trees laden with ice falling on power lines. We currently have more than 10,000 crews working diligently to repair these outages,” the utility said in a statement. “We are confident that we can meet demand [in] the next week.”

All told, 200 million people face some mix of sleet, snow, ice and frigid temperatures sweeping the nation which makes for a “deadly combination,” AccuWeather meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said in a Sunday note.

Power loss is the main threat to life over the coming days — and pressure on the power grid is mounting. The storm has added stress to the utilities and operators that were already struggling to meet rising demand fueled by the influx of data centers, artificial intelligence and other large customers. That all has shrunk the power generating slack in the system, bringing electric reliability concerns to the forefront.

PJM said Sunday that peak demand for its 13-state footprint is expected to surpass 130,000 megawatts for seven consecutive days for the first time ever, noting extreme cold conditions may persist through Feb. 1. It said the region could set an all-time winter peak load record on Tuesday and activated pre-emergency measures for utilities BGE, Pepco and Dominion to curtail electricity usage to preserve supplies.

“This is a formidable arctic cold front coming our way, and it will impact our neighboring systems as much as it affects PJM,” Mike Bryson Sr., vice president of operations at PJM, said in a statement. “We will be relying on our generation fleet to perform as well as they did during last year’s record winter peak.”

DOE also tapped data centers and other large customers within Texas’ grid to bring their backup onsite power onto the public grid, a move that allowed those generators to skirt pollution rules.

“As Winter Storm Fern brings extreme cold and dangerous conditions to the Mid-Atlantic, maintaining affordable, reliable, and secure power in the PJM region is non-negotiable,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

Benchmark natural gas prices surged more than 80 percent in the three days before the storm, a jump that consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said was the largest increase in history. Supplies could get trapped if gas infrastructure in the Gulf Coast, which is unaccustomed to single-digit temperatures, succumbs to strain. Such a failure of natural gas infrastructure occurred during Winter Storm Uri in 2021 that killed 246 people in Texas.

Real-time electricity costs across the eastern half of the country soared on the storm demand, and operators overseeing New England and New York’s grid said consumption was outpacing forecasts by more than 3 percent as of 10:30 a.m. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which handles the grid from the Dakotas to Michigan south to Louisiana, said demand was below its forecasted peak, although it operated under alert for a few hours on Saturday due to “unplanned generator outages.”

Though the power disruptions so far appeared to be due to the storm, the frigid conditions to come this week could make the grid vulnerable to what the North American Electric Reliability Corp. warned in its latest winter reliability assessment: that several parts of the U.S. do not have sufficient energy supplies to meet demand during an extreme winter.

In its application to DOE requesting the emergency order, PJM said it has already experienced outages “trending up to 20,000 MW,” adding that “there are many other unknowns that could exacerbate already tightening system conditions.”

PJM has been the subject of scrutiny for rising prices as demand has squeezed power supply. The Trump administration has blamed the Biden administration and state policies that it contends incentivized solar and wind with artificially low prices that pushed gas, nuclear and coal power plants off the grid. Wright has said that has left customers in jeopardy of power outages during searing heatwaves or deep winter freezes.

On Sunday, those gas, coal and nuclear resources supplied an overwhelming majority of electricity to the nation’s largest customer base. Gas met more than 39 percent of PJM’s load, while nuclear supplied 26 percent and coal nearly 23 percent, while wind fed just shy of 5 percent.

“The claim that [Virginia] or any PJM state can run a modern grid without dispatchable gen is reckless. Facts are stubborn things,” former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chair Mark Christie posted on X.

Utilities spent the last week shoring up infrastructure by reinforcing wires and cutting tree branches to prevent major disruptions.

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned utilities, said companies marshaled 63,000 workers from 43 states and the District of Columbia to sites in the storm’s path. EEI spokesperson Brian Reil said that was comparable to the personnel deployed to the theater of Hurricane Helene, the 2024 storm that inflicted $78.7 billion worth of damage across North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia.

Ice is Fern’s key threat. Even a quarter-inch of ice layers tree branches with exponentially more weight, raising the chances of limbs breaking and damaging wires. Half an inch can snap electrical wires. Beyond that, treacherous ice can prevent or delay response teams from accessing compromised infrastructuring and prolong recovery time.

“We’re expecting a very serious situation if the worst comes with this storm,” Duke Energy spokesperson Riley Cook said, noting the utility had dispatched 18,000 employees to 22 critical sites. “We could be seeing power lines come down or tree limbs fall on our power lines, and we have to get those up.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/02/8a/18383c894775896d4c5519271e3a/winter-weather-chicago-33622.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 18:00:41.171399

Of course, we who follow electric vehicles know China is the world’s largest EV manufacturer. It’s also clear there are many affordable Chinese EVs — much more affordable than in some other countries. There might be less clarity about how much China is also leading in the number of EV chargers, which makes sense for a country that has the largest number of fully electric vehicles.

To get straight to it, here are some points recently published by China’s National Energy Administration: “By the end of December 2025, the number of electric vehicle charging facilities in my country reached 20.092 million, exceeding the 20 million mark. Among them, there were 4.717 million public charging facilities (guns) and 15.375 million private charging facilities (guns). Currently, my country has built the world’s largest electric vehicle charging network, supporting the charging needs of over 40 million new energy vehicles.”

Another claim in the article is that going from 10 million chargers to 20 million only took about 18 months. Many of China’s chargers are fast ones as well. Quite a few chargers have been installed in highway service areas, with almost full coverage of those areas now provided for long-distance driving.

For the sake of comparison, Europe has a little over one million public EV chargers. The US may have only about 237,000 non-home chargers.

China has great motivation for switching to full EVs, far too much toxic air pollution. Air pollution from fossil fuels harms many people in China every year and contributes to far too many premature deaths.

“Every year, more than four million people around the world die prematurely from breathing dirty air. In China alone, the number of deaths attributable to air pollution exceeds one million annually. That figure may not come as a surprise; after all, we are routinely treated to images in the media of thick, sooty smog enveloping Beijing, Shanghai, and other Chinese cities.”

There are some people who try to criticize electric vehicles by claiming they all run on electricity generated by coal, which is not true. Much electricity is now generated from clean, renewable sources: hydropower, solar power, wind power, etc. China is a world leader in solar power and in battery manufacturing, so it is poised to decrease its reliance on fossil fuels and become more energy independent while reducing toxic air pollution.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ChatGPT-Image-Jan-25-2026-10_36_46-AM-800x533.png,N,,2026-01-25 14:58:30.950944

In the bustling showrooms of Chevrolet dealerships across the United States, models like the Bolt EV and Equinox EV have been turning heads with their surprisingly low price tags. Priced under $30,000 after incentives, these vehicles represent a beacon of hope for mass-market electrification, promising to democratize access to zero-emission driving. But beneath this veneer of affordability lies a brewing storm of economic pressures that could soon inflate costs, making these budget-friendly options a relic of the past. Industry analysts and automakers are sounding alarms about supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly those tied to international trade dynamics.

The core issue revolves around the batteries that power these electric vehicles (EVs). Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, has relied on cost-effective components sourced from global suppliers, including those in China, to keep prices competitive. However, recent policy shifts in Washington are poised to disrupt this delicate balance. Proposed tariffs on imported batteries and related materials could add thousands of dollars to the production costs of vehicles like the Bolt, potentially forcing GM to pass those expenses onto consumers.

This isn’t mere speculation; it’s grounded in the realities of global trade tensions. As the U.S. seeks to bolster domestic manufacturing, measures aimed at curbing reliance on foreign tech are gaining traction. For Chevrolet’s EV lineup, which has been praised for undercutting rivals like Tesla’s Model 3 in price, these changes could erode their market edge. Dealerships from California to Michigan are already whispering about inventory adjustments in anticipation of higher sticker prices.

Rising Tariffs and the Battery Supply Chain Squeeze

The Biden administration’s push for tariffs on Chinese goods, including EV batteries, stems from a broader strategy to protect American jobs and reduce dependence on overseas production. According to a report from Digital Trends, these tariffs could increase the cost of key components by up to 25%, directly impacting models like the Chevrolet Bolt. This isn’t isolated; similar concerns echo across the industry, with experts predicting a ripple effect on all affordable EVs.

Beyond tariffs, the supply chain for lithium-ion batteries is fraught with volatility. Raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel have seen price fluctuations driven by geopolitical events and mining constraints. For instance, disruptions in African cobalt mines and Australian lithium exports have already pushed costs upward. General Motors has invested heavily in North American battery plants, like the Ultium Cells facility in Ohio, but scaling these operations to meet demand remains a challenge, potentially leading to short-term reliance on pricier domestic alternatives.

Automotive insiders point out that Chevrolet’s strategy of offering sub-$30,000 EVs hinges on economies of scale from global sourcing. If tariffs force a pivot to U.S.-based suppliers, the transition could involve not just higher material costs but also investments in new infrastructure. A recent analysis from BloombergNEF highlights how such shifts might add $2,000 to $5,000 per vehicle, a burden that budget-conscious buyers may not absorb easily.

Geopolitical Tensions Fueling Price Volatility

Trade wars aren’t new, but their intensification under recent administrations has amplified risks for the EV sector. The U.S. Commerce Department’s investigations into Chinese subsidies for battery manufacturers have led to calls for steeper duties, as detailed in a Wall Street Journal piece exploring the broader implications for American consumers. This comes at a time when EV adoption is accelerating, with sales projected to reach 10 million units globally this year.

Chevrolet’s parent company, GM, has been vocal about these challenges. In earnings calls, executives have warned that without policy relief or accelerated domestic production, affordable models could see price hikes of 10% or more. This sentiment is echoed on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where industry watchers such as @EVExpert and @AutoInsiderNews have shared threads on how tariffs might stifle competition, linking to real-time data from trade monitoring sites.

Moreover, the European Union’s parallel moves to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs add another layer of complexity. As reported by Reuters, this global clampdown could reroute supply chains, increasing costs for U.S. importers. For Chevrolet, which assembles many EVs in Mexico and Canada under NAFTA provisions, these international pressures might necessitate redesigns or sourcing overhauls, further inflating expenses.

Domestic Manufacturing Push: Opportunities and Hurdles

The silver lining in this scenario is the U.S. government’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers tax credits for domestically produced EVs and batteries. Chevrolet’s Bolt EV qualifies for up to $7,500 in federal incentives, helping offset potential price increases. However, as a New York Times investigation notes, the IRA’s strict domestic content requirements could exclude vehicles with foreign batteries, pressuring GM to accelerate localization efforts.

GM’s Ultium battery platform is central to this shift. Joint ventures with LG Energy Solution are ramping up production in states like Tennessee and Michigan, aiming to produce millions of cells annually. Yet, scaling these facilities involves billions in capital, and any delays—such as those caused by labor shortages or regulatory approvals—could prolong dependence on imported parts, exacerbating cost pressures.

Industry veterans argue that while domestic manufacturing builds resilience, it comes at a premium. A study from the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that U.S. battery costs could remain 20% higher than Chinese counterparts until 2030, even with subsidies. This disparity underscores why Chevrolet’s affordable EVs might soon carry a heftier price tag, challenging the narrative of EVs as accessible to the average American.

Consumer Impacts and Market Shifts

For everyday buyers, the prospect of rising EV prices is daunting. Take Sarah Jenkins, a teacher from Denver who recently purchased a Chevrolet Equinox EV for its $27,000 post-incentive price. “It was the only way I could afford to go electric,” she told reporters. But if tariffs push that figure to $32,000 or more, as speculated in forums on X, it could deter similar purchases, slowing the green transition.

Dealers are preparing for this by diversifying inventories, stocking more hybrid options that aren’t as tariff-sensitive. A Automotive News article details how GM is lobbying for exemptions, arguing that abrupt changes could harm sales momentum. Indeed, Chevrolet’s EV sales surged 60% last quarter, but analysts from Cox Automotive warn that price sensitivity remains high among middle-income households.

Competitors aren’t immune. Ford and Hyundai, which also offer budget EVs, face similar headwinds. Yet, Chevrolet’s heavy bet on affordability makes it particularly vulnerable. Social media buzz on X, including posts from @GreenCarReports linking to tariff updates, suggests consumers might turn to used EVs or delay purchases, potentially creating a market glut of older models.

Innovation as a Counterbalance to Cost Pressures

Amid these challenges, technological advancements offer hope. Solid-state batteries, which promise higher energy density and lower costs, are on the horizon for GM’s lineup. Partnerships with startups like Solid Power aim to commercialize this tech by 2027, potentially reducing reliance on volatile lithium supplies.

Recycling initiatives are also gaining steam. Companies like Redwood Materials are building U.S.-based facilities to reclaim battery materials, as covered in a Bloomberg report on circular economies in EVs. For Chevrolet, integrating recycled components could shave costs, making affordable models viable even under tariff regimes.

Furthermore, software updates and over-the-air improvements are extending vehicle lifespans, adding value without hardware changes. GM’s Super Cruise system, now standard on many EVs, enhances appeal, helping justify modest price bumps.

Strategic Responses from Automakers

General Motors isn’t standing idle. CEO Mary Barra has outlined a $35 billion investment in EVs through 2025, focusing on vertical integration. This includes mining deals in the U.S. and Canada to secure raw materials, mitigating tariff impacts.

Collaborations with tech giants like Google for infotainment could differentiate Chevrolet’s offerings, attracting buyers willing to pay a premium for features. As per insights from Electrek, such strategies are crucial for maintaining market share in a tariff-heavy environment.

Rivals like Tesla are doubling down on U.S. production, but Chevrolet’s mass-market focus requires broader accessibility. Industry forums on X highlight how GM might bundle financing or leases to soften price shocks, preserving the allure of models like the Bolt.

Long-Term Implications for EV Adoption

The trajectory of affordable EVs like Chevrolet’s hinges on policy evolution. If tariffs are moderated or domestic incentives expanded, prices could stabilize. However, persistent trade frictions might accelerate a bifurcation, with premium EVs thriving while entry-level options languish.

Environmental advocates worry this could hinder emissions reductions. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that widespread EV adoption requires prices below $30,000, a threshold now at risk.

Ultimately, Chevrolet’s challenge reflects broader industry dynamics, where affordability battles against protectionism. As one executive quipped on X, “Cheap EVs were never truly cheap—they were subsidized by global trade.” Moving forward, innovation and policy alignment will determine if models like the Bolt remain gateways to electrification or become cautionary tales of economic turbulence.

Navigating Uncertainty in Electric Mobility

Stakeholders from suppliers to regulators are monitoring these developments closely. A recent webinar hosted by the Society of Automotive Engineers discussed hedging strategies against tariff volatility, emphasizing diversified sourcing.

For consumers, staying informed via sources like X’s real-time updates or publications such as Car and Driver is key. Chevrolet’s website now features tariff impact FAQs, signaling transparency amid uncertainty.

Just because the federal government has turned its back on climate action doesn’t mean the United States is out of the fight.
Based on polling and local action, it seems that the American people understand the importance of climate action, even if the American president does not.
In a poll last year, 65 percent of US registered voters recognized a link between climate change and their cost of living.
A 2024 poll found that in 47 of the 50 states, a majority of voters were worried about climate change.","On January 7, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from 66 international organizations, conventions, and treaties, including 31 affiliated with the United Nations. Though many are environmentally focused, the list also includes groups with missions involving human rights, peace, trade, and women’s rights. One particularly striking item on that long list was the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the most important climate treaty in the world and the foundation for every global climate action of the last 30 years.

Former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy called the departure announcement “short-sighted, embarrassing, and foolish.” Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland, called it “unbelievably stupid.” The Sierra Club’s executive director, Loren Blackford, said, “Donald Trump may talk tough, but time and again he proves incapable of leading.”

Where does that leave the future of climate policy and greenhouse gas reduction?

The Trump administration has made moves to distance the United States from international climate agreements before, pulling out of the Paris Agreement once in 2017 and again in 2025, after President Biden rejoined the agreement during his term. But the UNFCCC is more than an agreement—it’s a full treaty, ratified unanimously by the Senate and signed into law by Republican President George H.W. Bush. Even without the US, it has 197 member states, more than the UN itself. The United States would be the first country ever to leave the treaty.

Many question whether Trump even has the authority to make this change. Article 2 of the US Constitution grants the president the power to make treaties, with Senate approval. However, the framers did not include a similar process for how to leave them. That leaves constitutional scholars divided over the legality of Trump’s decision. Some say that if the Senate has to ratify a treaty, it should also have to ratify a departure. This is the view of several environmental organizations, which may sue the administration to block the departure.

""Because the US entered the UNFCCC with advice and consent of the Senate in 1992, it’s our legal view that it also must be exited using the same process in reciprocation,"" Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, told Reuters.

But others claim the executive branch’s generally wide-ranging powers over foreign affairs give the president the ability to leave treaties unilaterally, or at least, that they are not explicitly barred from doing so by anything in the Constitution.

The Supreme Court had a chance to weigh in on the issue in 1979. Senator Barry Goldwater sued then-President Jimmy Carter over his decision to leave a treaty with Taiwan. The Court refused to decide one way or the other. Nearly 50 years later, it may come down to another Supreme Court, this one largely appointed by the same sitting president who will be the defendant in the case.

Some contend that if a US president can leave a treaty, another president may be able to simply rejoin it, since the Senate ratification would still apply. The head of the UNFCCC, Simon Steill, made it clear that the treaty organization itself would allow it. “The doors remain open for the US to reenter in the future, as it has in the past with the Paris Agreement,” he said in a statement. Executive authority, once granted by the Court or ceded by inaction, doesn’t go away when the office changes hands.

Each of the 66 organizations listed in the executive order have their own rules about how countries can leave them. The UNFCCC, for example, requires a year from formal declaration of departure, so it would not take effect until at least next January. Some of them require as much as three years, meaning that the US would remain for the rest of the second Trump term. A few have no rules at all for governing departures, which will leave even more unanswered legal questions.

The announcements came as a surprise to many at the UN, including top diplomats who told the Associated Press that they learned of the action through social media, with no notice or official communications.

Many experts and opponents of the departures say that there is one clear winner in all this chaos. If the United States makes its abdication of climate responsibility official, it hands the reins of climate policy, green energy, and all the economic and political power tied up in both to another global superpower: China.

“Withdrawing from the UNFCCC is an abandonment of America’s opportunity to drive the global economy into the future, ceding jobs and economic growth to China and other countries,” Blackford said in a press statement.

In another statement to CNN, former Secretary of State John Kerry called the departure “a gift to China and a get-out-of-jail-free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.” World Resources Institute director David Widawsky said it was “a strategic blunder that gives away American advantage for nothing in return.”

The United States is already far behind China on production of new green energy. In the first half of 2025, China installed more new solar power than the rest of the world combined. This week, only a few days after a new high-seas treaty came into effect, the Chinese government proposed hosting the secretariat of the treaty in Xiamen. As the United States hands over the soft power of international climate and environmental leadership, China appears more than happy to pick it up.

Some question how much American membership matters. The Trump administration has already stopped participating in international climate action. The administration has stopped paying its dues, amounting to over 20 percent of the treaty’s total funding. The United States is also the world’s biggest oil and gas producer, and also the largest exporter of fracked gas. We produce more crude oil than any country, ever.

Consequently, some experts have wondered whether removing such a massive petrostate from a leadership position on climate could have a bright side. Cornell climate scientist Daniele Visoni told Inside Climate News, “the only thing that this government is doing is depriving themselves of the opportunity to influence these reports in any way,” and suggests that the pullout could keep the US from being a cheerleader for fossil fuel interests.

COP30, held last year in Brazil, provided a test case for this theory. The United States sent no official delegation to the conference, which some believed might produce a less compromised agenda. But that’s not how it turned out. COP30 was widely seen as ineffective, resulting in some voluntary pledges but little measurable progress.

Just because the federal government has turned its back on climate action doesn’t mean the United States is out of the fight. Over both Trump terms, the role of states, cities, and other jurisdictions has grown to fill the gap. When the administration chose not to send a delegation to COP30 last year, California did. While the Trump administration may deny the scientific truth of climate change, 33 states, including Republican-led coastal states like South Carolina and Mississippi, have some sort of climate resilience and adaptation plan in effect, according to a report from the Brookings Institution.

Based on polling and local action, it seems that the American people understand the importance of climate action, even if the American president does not. In a poll last year, 65 percent of US registered voters recognized a link between climate change and their cost of living. A 2024 poll found that in 47 of the 50 states, a majority of voters were worried about climate change. In the absence of federal leadership, people power can move smaller-scale local elections and issues forward.

The future of global climate policy is more uncertain now than it has ever been. What is known is this: The United States has stepped back from its responsibilities on climate and handed that leadership role to China. But no president, no matter how reckless, can undo these basic truths of physics and economics: Climate change is real, and green energy is cheaper than fossil fuels. President Trump may be giving up our place at the table, but the rest of the world, and American cities and states, can still take meaningful action.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-25 12:59:21.650816

The mission: Have one 212 hp Leapmotor C10 range extender EV.
We also reference Audi's Dakar Rally-winning range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron.
This range, claims Leapmotor, is possible because of the unique range extender EV drivetrain.
And it did so using a range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron.","The theory seems absolutely brilliant. A practical SUV, propelled by an efficient, 212-hp electric motor. With a 1.5-liter, four-cylinder gas-powered engine under the hood, serving only as a generator, charging the SUV as you drive it. So, in theory, even though you can plug in your SUV and charge it like a Tesla or Ford Mustang Mach-E, you don't actually don't need to charge your EV with a range extender system in place.

To test this rather ambitious theory, we embarked on a 2,000-mile cross-country journey in a Leapmotor C10 range extender EV. Leapmotor, you ask? Stellantis owns a 20% equity stake in Chinese start-up Leapmotor, and the technology deployed in the C10 will soon find its way into Stellantis products, too. Here's how it all went down.

The mission: Have one 212 hp Leapmotor C10 range extender EV. Embark on a 2,000-mile cross-country trip, and see how far you get before you are left Volt-less next to the road. We also reference Audi's Dakar Rally-winning range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron.

How To Get Stranded Next To The Road... Or Not?

Auto companies have a habit of not calling a spade a spade, but rather calling a spade a Caterpillar front-end loader. In other words, marketing materials are known to embellish some details. Often, numbers that are claimed appear to be theoretical, achieved only in laboratory-perfect conditions. Numbers that the average driver will probably never achieve in the daily commute.

So, when Chinese start-up brand Leapmotor claims the C10's internal combustion engine, operating on the Atkinson cycle, can achieve 42.7 MPG, it seems rather... well... optimistic. It doesn't end there. You also get a 28.4 kWh battery pack in the game, which adds another 90 miles of pure EV range (when fully charged). Cue drum roll... with a 13.2-gallon fuel tank, the combined range of this contraption is claimed to be just over 603 miles. Optimistic, much?

This range, claims Leapmotor, is possible because of the unique range extender EV drivetrain. Instead of providing drive to any part of the car in any which way, the gasoline engine's sole purpose is to charge the battery. The C10 is driven only by Volts, with the internal combustion engine only generating Volts for the battery pack to power the 212-hp electric motor, driving the rear axle.

The theory is simple: a drivetrain that provides all the advantages of an EV-driven vehicle, including instant torque, smooth and efficient operation, and low maintenance. And with the gasoline generator in the game, range anxiety is no longer an issue at all. In fact, you don't have to charge the battery in the traditional EV way at all. Just add gas, and drive. Sounds too good to be true, right?

To test Leapmotor's claims, we embarked on an extensive 2,000-mile range, traveling to places where folks have never even heard of electric vehicle propulsion, Elon Musk or Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries.

What is it like to drive? Like a run-of-the-mill electric vehicle, that's what. So you have the instant torque, combined with 212 hp, providing more than adequate performance for a large SUV. The drivetrain is efficient and smooth, the progress seamless and refined. There is only the occasional, very faint drone from the gasoline engine, as it kicks in to charge the battery. It really is surprisingly quiet in its operation.

Is the C10 perfect? Nope. Driver assist systems like the lane-keep assist set-up are certainly not as polished as offerings from some other brands, and the system's interventions can be disruptive. But you can switch these systems off by using the massive 14.6-inch touchscreen. Wireless software updates should sort this out soon enough.

On that note. The Leapmotor's minimalist interior takes the button-free concept to the next level. The only buttons or actions available in the cabin are the basic buttons on the steering wheel, controlling functions like the sound system, side mirror adjustment, cruise control and the voice control (with a lady living in the dashboard that takes some convincing before performing the requested task). The gearlever is a stalk behind the steering wheel, and the left stalk operates the wiper and high beam function. Other than the buttons to roll the windows up and down, that's it. Everything else requires adjustment via that big central screen.

Meanwhile, cruising along at a merry 75 mph, we were waiting for the Leapmotor to grind to a halt next to the road, without a Volt in sight. After a stint of about 400 miles, and with the range indicator claiming we still had around 150 miles in the tank, with some Volts as change, we stopped for gas. Just in case. And then we worked out the numbers, using the actual fuel added. It had done 36.7 MPG, with plenty of lead-footed driving included, as we explored the C10's dynamic prowess.

With more finesse and care, we realized that more than 40 MPG may be possible... and that is without any additional Volts from a charging station. Say what? Is Leapmotor's ambitious range claim actually achievable? Well, apparently, it is!

Going The Whole Nine Yards

After we achieved 37.6 MPG on the first stint of our trip without really trying, we made a more concerted effort to extend the range, driving in a more economical fashion, sticking to 70 mph. It became a challenge. But unlike the challenge of a normal EV, where drivers have to keep an anxious eye on that range and continuously plan their journey around charging stations, we had no such qualms. Any filling station would do.

The high-end sound system, once you've figured out how to work it, is pretty fine. Climate control gets the job done in the most efficient manner. And the interior is a comfortable place in which to spend your hours. In no time, we had racked up another 500 miles, and topped up the fuel, and crunched some numbers... 42.9 MPG! That means, with a full charge of the battery (after you give it an AC or DC charge), the C10 can reach more than 600 miles without refueling or recharging!

The Leapmotor continued to impress on the rest of the 2,000-mile trip. Smooth. Efficient. Comfortable. Luxurious. Running on gas fumes. And, importantly, no range anxiety, whatsoever. Is this the way of the future? Combining all the advantages of an EV with an efficient, low-emission gasoline engine?

It certainly seems to tick a lot of ""Yes"" boxes.

For the record, Leapmotor is obviously a big deal in China, and is also sold in various European markets, as well as in Southern Africa. In theory, it will eventually be sold in every country with a Stellantis outlet. The trip recorded here was conducted in Southern Africa, driving from Johannesburg to the desert-like Karoo area, and the surrounding areas.

Range Extender EVs are heading to the US. As is the Leapmotor's distant cousin, the RAM 1500 REV, which is expected to go on sale soon. As you'd expect, the RAM is bigger and better in every department compared to the C10. A 3.6-liter V6 is deployed as the generator, it has a much larger 92.8 kWh battery pack, and two electric motors power the truck. The result is 647 hp of pure electric power, and a drivetrain that can blast the truck to 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds. Yet it can also reach a claimed 690 miles before requiring a recharge or refuel.

With fellow Stellantis brand Jeep also set to introduce the Grand Wagoneer REV soon, and Nissan adding its own range of REEVs too, the way of the car in the USA may be about to change, forever.

Audi's Cool Party Trick That Changed The EV Game

In 2024, Audi won the Dakar Rally, the most grueling motorsport event on Earth. And it did so using a range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron. The RS Q is propelled by two powerful electric motors, hailing from Audi's Formula E racing program. With one motor per axle, the all-wheel-drive Audi produces 384 hp, and around 600 lb-ft of torque.

The generator part is taken care of by a two-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder, DTM racing engine. In racing conditions, the engine runs constantly between 4,500 and 6,000 rpm, providing the relatively small 52 kWh battery pack with all the Volts it needs. Yes, it may have sounded weird, the gas engine running at constant revs with a high-pitched, ungainly wail. But it was effective. So effective that it managed to beat a horde of competitors, racing in purpose-built internal combustion racing vehicles.

In doing so, Audi's pioneering race winner steered EVs in a new direction. Welcome to the age of REEV.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_4174.JPG?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-25 12:59:17.423928

For three centuries, southern right whales were known as “the right whales” to hunt. Their docility, slow speed, and floating carcasses made them easy prey for whalers. By the 1920s, the species’ estimated global population of more than 70,000 had been all but eliminated, with around 300 remaining. The hunt was banned in 1935.

Since then, various initiatives have sought to reverse the trend, such as the International Whaling Commission. This intergovernmental organization is charged with regulating whaling and conserving all species of these animals. The commission celebrates its 80th anniversary this year. These days, southern right whale populations off the coast of Argentine Patagonia are showing signs of recovery. Here, the “Blue Gulf” of San Matías has emerged as a key site for their reproduction and breeding. But a new threat is looming.

The San Matías Gulf, alongside Argentina’s central Río Negro province, has become a key site in national plans to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). As extraction operations ramp up inland at the Vaca Muerta oil and gas field (one of the world’s biggest shale oil and gas deposits), exportation is being galvanized under the pro-extraction presidency of Javier Milei. He has described Argentine LNG as “the largest investment in the history of Argentina.”

Argentina is eyeing LNG markets, including Europe, India, China, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil. There are still no firm agreements with any of these countries, although there are signs of interest from some.

However, the San Matías Gulf is an area of enormous ecological value, home to five national and provincial marine reserves. It has been internationally recognized for around 20 years as one of the richest ecosystems in Argentina. The gulf concentrates phytoplankton and captures large amounts of CO₂. It is also one of the few places in the world where southern right whales can be observed from land.

Biologists and oceanographers have told Dialogue Earth that the installation of oil and gas projects in the area poses a critical risk to these whales, as well as the rest of the ecosystem.

Until a little over three years ago, such activity was prohibited by law. In 2022, the government of Alberto Fernández reformed Río Negro province’s law number 3308, which had prohibited hydrocarbon activities in the area. The reform has paved the way for a new port to enable LNG exports and other strategic projects.

The San Matías Gulf was chosen because it is one of the few points on Argentina’s Atlantic coast with sufficient depth and a direct connection to Vaca Muerta.

Four key projects — a pipeline, a port, and two floating LNG plants — are currently at different stages of development, with plans for four more. These are opposed by several environmentalists and scientists who are raising concerns about their cumulative impact.

Ship collisions and oil spills

Critics claim this development will heighten the risk of oil spills, and could change ocean dynamics. It will also lead to a wider increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

There are multiple risks for whales and other animals living in the San Matías Gulf, warns the ecologist Belén Braga, a member of the multinational, non-profit Whale Conservation Institute (ICB). One of the most significant is ship collisions, which Braga says will increase. This is in addition to the entanglement risks they face from the fishing industry. And greater numbers of gas liquefaction vessels could cause more seaweed to grow, bringing a heightened risk of disease, she adds.

“We are talking about collisions, noise pollution, spills, and chronic micro-spills. All these warnings are on the table,” says Braga. The impacts would not only compromise wildlife, she adds, but also the regional economy, which is based on fishing and tourism.

In its environmental impact assessment, the national energy company YPF acknowledges that the necessary pipeline and two huge, floating platforms used for loading tankers (known as “monobuoys”) all represent spill risks. The operators have designed a “safe operation management” plan in the event of a spill.

However, a 2025 study concluded that, in several scenarios, the oil could spread further across 30 hours than YPF has calculated for. The study was coordinated by the Forum for the Conservation of the Patagonian Sea (FMP), a network of civil society organizations that includes the ICB.

Several sources consulted by Dialogue Earth have pointed out that environmental assessments of fossil fuel projects in the San Matías Gulf are fragmented. As a result, they say, there has not yet been a comprehensive analysis of the cumulative impacts of these developments in this area.

Cristian Fernández, legal coordinator for the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (Farn), an Argentine NGO, raises issues with the potential for increased emissions: “The environmental impact study omits a serious analysis of emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, and volatile organic compounds such as benzene.”

Fernández claims the San Matías Gulf is being treated as a “sacrifice zone” in the name of economic development.

Argentina’s LNG vision

Four projects linked to the LNG export plan have been approved by the national government so far. The most significant is a nearly 500-kilometer-long oil pipeline called Vaca Muerta Oil Sur. YPF’s president and CEO, Horacio Marín, has described it as “the largest infrastructure project in the country.” The shareholder companies are YPF, Vista Energy, Pampa Energía, all Latin American, and Pan American Energy, headquartered in Canada.

The pipeline begins in Loma Campana, Neuquén, in the heart of Vaca Muerta. It runs to Punta Colorada, a town located between two protected areas in the San Matías Gulf. The pipeline will carry LNG to the port and its two monobuoys.

In addition, two floating vessels from the Norwegian company Golar LNG, named the Hilli Epiceyo and the MK II, are expected to be deployed off the coast of Argentina to liquefy the gas. An alternative to permanent, onshore facilities, the vessels are ship-based units, 300-400 meters long and 112 meters high. This project is being handled by the consortium Southern Energy, comprising Pan American Energy, YPF, Pampa Energía, Golar LNG, and Harbour Energy, headquartered in London.

According to Southern Energy, the first ship would begin operating in 2027, the second in 2028. They will eventually process around 17% of Argentina’s current gas production.

A separate gas pipeline is currently out for tender with the Italian-Argentine manufacturer Techint. The firm is facing competition from a number of unidentified Chinese companies.

The MK II is currently being repurposed by a Chinese company. Philip Andrews-Speed, a researcher at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in the United Kingdom, explains that China’s status as one of the world’s largest shipbuilders gives it a key role in the LNG market.

Despite strong support from the government, however, Argentine LNG has yet to gain commercial traction. In April 2025, YPF signed a memorandum of understanding with Eni, an Italian oil major. The following November, YPF signed another similar agreement with Abu Dhabi’s state oil company, ADNOC.

But in early December, the London-based oil giant Shell withdrew from the project before it began; Shell itself had been a replacement for another company that also withdrew, Malaysia’s PETRONAS. Meanwhile, China — the country with the highest LNG import figures globally — has been reducing its purchases of foreign gas due to “excess demand” and higher than expected prices.

Despite these troubles, the government of Río Negro has continued to support the projects’ progress.

The reform that made it possible

Critics say the September 2022 reform of Río Negro’s law 3308 was hurried through and failed to fulfill consultation requirements.

Pablo Barreno, a regional legislator, tells Dialogue Earth the bill arrived without prior notice – and with strong support from the then-governor, Arabela Carreras. “We found out about it through a WhatsApp group.” Barreno adds that the meeting took place just one day later. He was the only legislator who voted against it, citing insufficient information.

The session was targeted by protestors, including Fabrizio di Giacomo, a member of Multisectoral Gulf of San Matías (MGSM). This collective brings together local residents, coastal communities, and other organizations. Di Giacomo claims the government sought to prevent any form of social participation by holding the session behind closed doors and reinforcing police control.

Several campaigners and scientific institutions argue the reform was unconstitutional and violates the Escazú Agreement. The treaty, which entered into force in 2021, guarantees civic participation in decision-making. An appeal against the reform was rejected by Río Negro’s superior court of justice in 2023. Another appeal has been lodged at the Supreme Court.

The Ministry is implementing a clear plan for technology transfer and is open to diverse partnership models, particularly those prioritizing the use of locally manufactured components to build a robust domestic renewable energy market, said Esmat.

The drive for localization is supported by Egypt’s massive natural resource capacity. Hassan El-Khatib, Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade, noted during the World Economic Forum (WEF) that Egypt possesses the potential to generate 700 to 900 gigawatts (GW) from the Western Desert alone.

To unlock this potential, Egypt is expanding cooperation in power generation while simultaneously developing energy storage systems to ensure grid stability.

Restoring power during winter storms is different from other weather events and requires a careful, step-by-step approach to protect both customers, workers and the electric grid.

Before power can be restored, damage to infrastructure must be assessed. Damage assessment and restoration work has been slowed by downed vegetation blocking roadways and icy road conditions. Once it is safe to do so, crews begin evaluating damage to power plants, transmission lines, substations and local distribution equipment. In some areas, icy roads and unsafe conditions may delay access.

During extreme cold, power cannot be restored all at once. Many customers leave heating systems and appliances running during an outage, which can create a sudden surge in electricity demand when power is restored. To prevent additional outages or equipment damage, crews restore service one section at a time using a controlled process known as cold load pickup.

We restore customers in a planned and deliberate order. We start with essential services, move on to large neighborhoods and then to individual homes.

Power is first restored to critical community infrastructure and essential services such as hospitals, water treatment plants, police and fire stations, and communication systems.

Next, we restore lines serving large areas of customers, and then we restore neighborhoods. This returns power to the largest number of customers in the shortest amount of time.

Some homes and businesses take longer, as individual customer homes or businesses with damage are often the most time-consuming repairs.

While many customers may be restored relatively quickly, some outages may last longer depending on damage severity, ice conditions and accessibility.

Customer safety and community resources

Customers should continue to prioritize safety while outages persist.

Warming centers: Customers in need of shelter and warmth should consider local warming centers or shelters if it is safe to travel. To find a listing of available warming centers, visit GOHSEP’s Louisiana Warming Centers: https://gohsep.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/9d47b24a528f43cf84633a2c04270706

Road conditions: Please be aware that roads may be hazardous or closed during restoration efforts. Road conditions and closure information can be found here from Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development: https://www.511la.org/

Generator safety: Never use generators indoors or in and never connect a generator directly to home wiring without proper transfer equipment.

Heating safety: Never use ovens, grills or outdoor heating devices to heat your home.

Downed power lines: Always assume downed lines are energized and dangerous — stay away and report them immediately by calling 1-800-9OUTAGE (1-800-968-8243) or your local police/fire department.

Ongoing monitoring and workforce readiness

Entergy Louisiana continues to closely monitor weather conditions, grid operations and energy demand. We are coordinating with the regional grid operator and have secured hundreds of additional restoration workers, though the widespread footprint of this storm may limit the availability of outside crews.

Our employees are prepared to work extended hours once conditions are safe, while following strict safety and fatigue-management protocols.

But at the other four border forts, troops and time marched on.","When Anthony Knopp first came to the campus of Texas Southmost College in 1976, his office was in an old barrack, and some faculty members lived in single-story, 100-year-old former military buildings, recalls the retired history professor.

While the old structures lacked modern amenities, Knopp made the most of teaching at a historic site. “When studying U.S. history, particularly relations with Mexico and 20th-century wars,” he says, “I was able to connect students to what was here at Fort Brown.”

Today, a former 48-bed hospital houses the college president’s offices on the campus in Brownsville, in the Rio Grande Valley. Fort Brown’s hospital annex (built in 1868), commissary (1904), guardhouse and morgue (1870) support various college departments.

Fort Brown and four other U.S. Army forts, established along the Rio Grande in the years after Texas became a state in 1845, endured for decades as military installations.

Unlike Texas frontier forts of the 1800s, such as Fort Concho in San Angelo and Fort McKavett in Menard County, which were rapidly abandoned as the frontier moved west, the border forts in Brownsville, Rio Grande City, Laredo and Eagle Pass remained defensive posts, off and on, for nearly 100 years. Fort Bliss in El Paso is still in use.

Today—178 years after the Mexican-American War—repurposed buildings from these border forts contribute to the vitality and identity of those Texas towns. Retaining their 1800s ambiance, the former Army headquarters, barracks and hospitals serve as schools, colleges, museums and parks.

The border forts had much in common, each named for veterans of the Mexican-American War, fought immediately following Texas statehood. At Rio Grande crossings, most about 100 miles apart, each fort shifted locations several times before being rebuilt as permanent posts after the Civil War.

Troops at the forts alternately dealt with Mexican bandits and rustlers and rowdy revolutionaries from both sides of the border, protected travelers and settlers from raids by Comanche and Lipan Apache tribes, and trained troops for both world wars. The garrisons shaped the cities that grew around them, as Army suppliers set up shops that also catered to local residents.

Fort Brown

Count riverboat pilot Mifflin Kenedy among the early merchants who cashed in on Army contracts. He ferried troops and equipment from Fort Brown, near the Gulf Coast, up the Rio Grande during the Mexican-American War.

He later started a steamboat company, married a wealthy widow and acquired hundreds of thousands of acres. He is the namesake of the Kenedy Ranch, the town of Kenedy and Kenedy County.

Fort Brown evolved from a star-shaped earthen fort to a commanding presence after the Civil War, when 70 buildings were erected of locally made border brick. With wide arches fronting shaded breezeways, Fort Brown’s 1869 hospital (said to be the most beautiful hospital in the Army) was of crucial importance during epidemics of yellow fever and cholera as the only hospital in Cameron County until 1909.

Quartermasters negotiated contracts with local businesses for goods and services such as beans, flour, coffee pots and hay for horses. Although a brick wall separated the town from Fort Brown and its palm-lined parade grounds, traffic flowed between them.

“Interactions resulted in marriages,” Knopp says. “Married soldiers either stayed in the area or returned.”

Fort Brown provided several forms of entertainment for the town: parades, concerts and sporting activities. Sunday afternoon polo matches, a cavalry favorite, drew locals as did concerts at the post bandstand, held twice a week.

A tree-shaded “lovers’ lane” curled between the fort and the river. Troops marched in local parades and Charro Days celebrations. Off-duty troops ate at local restaurants. The officers’ club hosted dances while enlisted men attended dances on the patio of El Jardin Hotel. Soldiers’ sisters and daughters met and married local men, too.

Deactivated in 1944 when the last U.S.-based mounted soldiers left, Fort Brown almost immediately started a new life as part of what is now Texas Southmost College. New campus construction echoes the border brick architecture of bygone days.

Fort Brown tours, arranged by the Brownsville Historical Association, link the past to its visible remnants.

Fort Ringgold

Upriver at Rio Grande City, Fort Ringgold followed Fort Brown’s trajectory. Veterans of the Mexican-American War went into business, not always successfully.

Capt. Forbes Britton and partners failed at making their Rio Grande City riverboat landing a major stop for Kenedy’s steamboats. But construction booms after the Civil War and continuing through World War I boosted the local economy.

At Fort Ringgold, barracks, a jail, an arched brick hospital and officers’ quarters surrounded a parade ground, which was larger than a football field.

“The parade ground gives a real picture of what Fort Ringgold looked like 150 years ago, about 1870,” says Aminta Reyna Alaniz, a Rio Grande City historian and tour guide. The post bugler played reveille and taps in front of a megaphone longer than 5 feet on the parade ground, signaling the troops as well as townsfolk.

Alaniz identifies 17 fort buildings—from the guardhouse and bakery to warehouses and six barracks—that are today used by the Rio Grande City Grulla Independent School District.

The school district purchased the fort’s 325 acres and buildings in 1947 with plans for an education complex and park. Along F Troop and 12th Cavalry streets, tan- and white-painted brick buildings house registration, curriculum and instruction units.

Near a two-story enlisted cavalry barracks that once housed about 100 soldiers (and later was used as an elementary school), girls played softball on a recent Sunday afternoon. The expansive parade ground hosts marching band practice and school Christmas displays.

Until recently, Alaniz says, an electronic sound system broadcast a digital bugle call morning and night. But even those echoes have ended.

Fort McIntosh

Fort McIntosh was built at a long-established Rio Grande crossing in 1849, opposite a former Spanish presidio. Laredo grew along with the fort, which held as many as 400 soldiers on over 400 acres with a requisite hospital, jail, barracks and cemetery.

In 1946, the International Boundary and Water Commission and the city of Laredo divided up the former fort. The city created what is now the Fort McIntosh campus of Laredo College in 1947.

Inside the Fort McIntosh Historic District, streets are named for post commanders and soldiers. The brick hospital has become Laredo College’s purchasing department. The former officers’ quarters houses the campus student ministry, and the old commandant’s house became a museum furnished with Victorian-era pieces.

The bakery is occupied by a customs brokers association. Other refurbished McIntosh campus buildings are used for classrooms. The cemetery is empty, the remains relocated.

Fort Bliss

In 1848, more than 400 miles up the Rio Grande, a fifth border fort was established at El Paso. It too moved locations multiple times as El Paso flourished around it.

Hoping to remain prosperous, the residents in 1890 purchased and donated land for a permanent Army post, which remains active today.

Unlike the other forts in this list, Fort Bliss grew after World War II. It now covers 1.1 million acres of Texas and New Mexico and is among America’s largest Army posts, home to about 20,000 troops.

Replicas of Fort Bliss’ early adobe buildings were constructed for the fort’s centennial in 1948 and house a museum, which is open to the public.

But at the other four border forts, troops and time marched on. Swords were beaten into street signs. Some of those streets are named for the soldiers who shaped those towns’ histories.",https://texascooppower.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fea-border-forts-illustration-og.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 12:00:26.692980

While companies have rushed to ramp up production of power transformers and distribution transformers, keeping up with skyrocketing demand is an impossibly tall order.
""This surging transformer demand has created a significant supply deficit, with domestic manufacturing capacity unable to keep pace,"" Wood Mackenzie Senior Analyst Ben Boucher.
In 2025, imports will account for an estimated 80% of US power transformer supply and 50% of the distribution transformer supply.
This market imbalance is escalating costs and lead times and is delaying our ability to bring generating plants online in pace with the surging energy demand.""","The global clean energy transition has passed a tipping point as renewable energies have simply become too cheap to fail. Worldwide, nations both rich and poor are rushing to install more and more wind and solar capacity to keep up with rising energy demand rates driven by global economic development and the age of AI. But while countries have been investing heavily into increased production capacity, investments in critical grid infrastructure have not kept pace, leading to a major energy transition bottleneck and a potential threat to energy security for an increasing number of countries.

The United States and Europe are both facing critical transformer shortages and aging and inadequate grid infrastructure, and the threat that this shortage poses to energy security is already being felt through historic blackouts such as last year's cascading grid failure in Spain and Portugal. While these setbacks have raised the profile of infrastructure investing in European policy spheres, ""ambition is not yet being matched by action from governments, policy-makers, investors and businesses,"" according to a recent report from the World Economic Forum.

In the United States, specialists foresee a yearslong transformer crunch, with little to no relief forthcoming. While companies have rushed to ramp up production of power transformers and distribution transformers, keeping up with skyrocketing demand is an impossibly tall order. Wood Mackenzie estimates that, since 2019, U.S. demand for power transformers has jumped by 116 percent, while demand for distribution transformers has shot up 41 percent.

""This surging transformer demand has created a significant supply deficit, with domestic manufacturing capacity unable to keep pace,"" Wood Mackenzie Senior Analyst Ben Boucher. ""Utilities are routinely turning to the import market to meet project timelines. In 2025, imports will account for an estimated 80% of US power transformer supply and 50% of the distribution transformer supply. This market imbalance is escalating costs and lead times and is delaying our ability to bring generating plants online in pace with the surging energy demand.""

However, some experts disagree with this takeaway, arguing that the transformer ""shortage"" is overblown if not fabricated, and the issue lies in self-inflicted procurement problems. There's room for debate because the issue is a complex one stretching over many different economic sectors and supply chains. Whether the problem is one of supply or one of procurement, however, the impact is the same - major bottlenecks for new electricity with potential pitfalls for national energy security.

""Over the past few years, what started as a squeeze has gradually morphed into a crisis,"" Power Magazine recently reported. The Power article contends that this growing crisis has been ""furnished by years of underinvestment in domestic manufacturing, a sudden surge in post-pandemic construction and electrification, and volatility in grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES) and copper markets, which steadily pushed lead times for large power and generator step-up (GSU) transformers beyond historical norms.""

And those driving factors are showing little signs of changing, indicating that delay times for transformer delivery are going to continue to stretch on. Even though demand for these products is now growing exponentially, this spike is coming in the wake of years of lackluster demand, and would-be investors are still warming up to the idea that they'll get a return on their investment in the sector.

Hitachi, one major producer of such transformers, for example, has strategically only invested in transformer development when the purchase of those components is already guaranteed and buyer-backed. ""Nobody wants to overinvest"" in new production facilities, according to Hitachi Energy CEO Andreas Schierenbeck.

Through these kinds of up-front deals, Hitachi has planned $1 billion in new manufacturing capacity across the United States. However, Schierenbeck told news outlet Semafor this week that these deals are ""probably not enough to close the gap between supply and demandâ€¦ There are still customers who are just in the old world with transactional behavior, and they'll have to be lucky to get a slot.""

""Defendants’ conspiracy [...] denied the State and Michigan consumers meaningful choices, raised switching costs, and eliminated competitive price pressure.""","Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a federal antitrust lawsuit accusing major oil companies and an industry group of colluding to ""suppress"" renewable energy and electric vehicle competition.

The suit names BP, Chevron, Exxon, Shell, and the American Petroleum Institute, alleging they acted like a cartel to restrain trade and block clean energy alternatives.

Michigan claims this alleged conspiracy has kept energy prices high and limited affordable EV options for consumers.

The American auto industry is in the middle of a pivot back to gasoline-powered cars after more than a decade of chasing a mostly electric future. Some observers say it's short-lived, driven by new tariffs and shifting regulations under the Trump administration. Others blame market forces and the fact that many electric-vehicle choices haven't been on par with consumers' needs.

But the State of Michigan is attempting to hold another group responsible for the downturn of EVs and renewable power in general: the oil industry.

Michigan's attorney general Dana Nessel on Friday filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell Oil and the American Petroleum Institute, alleging that the petroleum giants and their trade association ""have unlawfully colluded to reduce innovation and output (and thereby increase prices) in the Michigan transportation energy market and the Michigan primary energy market.""

The 126-page lawsuit alleges that the oil companies committed a ""conspiracy"" that has kept energy prices artificially high in the state and dependent on fossil fuels, while also working to undermine the American EV market.

The state is seeking a jury trial and unspecified financial damages tied to what Michigan consumers and the state government have allegedly overpaid for energy. It's also seeking a repayment of fossil-fuel industry profits.

""For decades, defendants have conspired with each other to forestall meaningful competition from renewable energy and maintain their dominance in the energy market,"" the lawsuit said. ""They have done so as a cartel, agreeing to reduce the production and distribution of electricity from renewable sources and to restrain the emergence of EV and renewable primary energy technologies in the United States.""

InsideEVs has reached out to the oil companies named in the lawsuit. We will update this story if they respond to our request for a comment.

""These baseless lawsuits are a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America’s economy, and is actively reducing emissions,"" an attorney for the American Petroleum Institute told the Detroit Free Press. ""We continue to believe that energy policy belongs in Congress, not a patchwork of courtrooms.”

While Michigan's lawsuit is wide-ranging in its claims around energy sources and prices, it specifically blames an oil industry ""conspiracy"" for decades of slower growth around EVs, charging infrastructure and cheaper electricity.

Alpitronic EV Chargers

Among other things, the state accuses the oil companies of slow-walking charger growth at their fueling stations; deliberately delaying their own hybrid and battery technology development that they once helped pioneer; driving ""misinformation"" campaigns with “thinktanks, blogs, and ideologically sympathetic media outlets” that have undermined EV adoption and spread false narratives about renewable technology.

""But for the conspiracy, EVs would have reached scale years earlier and Michigan and its consumers would have avoided billions of dollars in overcharges on transportation energy,"" the lawsuit alleged.

Michigan has some of the highest electricity costs in the U.S. It remains home to much of the American automotive industry, which is now delaying, repurposing or outright cancelling many of the EV investments that have been underway for years. Ford, General Motors and Stellantis have all announced a slower EV rollout than they projected at the outset of the decade, and have more recently touted ""consumer choice"" as the reason for renewed investments back to fossil-fuel powertrains.

That shift comes amid a second Trump administration that has been overtly friendly to oil and gas interests. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump vowed to ""unleash American energy"" and eliminate what's been called an ""EV mandate"" instituted by his predecessor, President Joe Biden.

Trump has since rolled back strict fuel economy rules, sought to cancel federal EV charger funding and eliminated EV tax credits. Trump's own cabinet is also extensively staffed with officials who have strong ties to the fossil-fuel industry.

But Michigan’s lawsuit goes further, including claims of technology and climate data suppression that stretch back decades—and have since left people in that state without viable energy alternatives.

""Drivers in Michigan continue to rely on gasoline not because it is superior or cheaper, but because cleaner alternatives have been restrained,"" the lawsuit said. ""Defendants’ conspiracy [...] denied the State and Michigan consumers meaningful choices, raised switching costs, and eliminated competitive price pressure.""

While Nessel has said that this lawsuit is the first of its kind to target oil companies with antitrust laws, other states have sued the industry on climate-related grounds in recent years as well. Maine, Connecticut, New Jersey and other states have all filed litigation in recent years against various oil companies, typically alleging that the energy giants have misled and deceived consumers about the climate damage caused by fossil-fuel power.

One of their own is fighting back.,"Amelia Davidson, Kelsey Brugger",,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/democrats-climate-affordability-trump-00745597,"Now Democrats are increasingly showing they have decided it’s a losing message to tout the ways in which they’d curb fossil fuel production to thwart the most dire effects of climate change.
His social media thread notes that people are feeling the economic burdens of climate change throughout the country, from home insurance hikes to drops in property values.
Some are talking nearly exclusively about competitive prices for clean energy — largely in hopes of beating Republicans at their own messaging game.
Talking about affordability need not negate the focus on the impact of climate change, she said.
“Democrats and environmental groups’ climate messaging for years has been crap, and so if you go back to that crap messaging, obviously it’s not going to succeed,” Whitehouse said.","In a later interview about his posts, Whitehouse warned these “climate hushers” have also made their way into strategy conversations on Capitol Hill. He noted he’s been present for some of them, which he described as “polling presentations made to the Senate Democratic Caucus in a so-called strategy retreat that didn’t ask about climate change … There’s this massive blind spot.”

In recent years, Democrats have been handwringing over the best messaging on environmental issues to reach an electorate that cares about “kitchen table” matters – and doesn’t uniformly consider the rapidly warming planet to be one of them. Environmentalists made a strong argument during the 2024 presidential campaign that the climate crisis should be a motivator in electing Kamala Harris — but the contest went to Donald Trump.

Now Democrats are increasingly showing they have decided it’s a losing message to tout the ways in which they’d curb fossil fuel production to thwart the most dire effects of climate change. Instead, they’re choosing to focus on policies that would lower energy costs and lean hard into affordability talking points embraced by Trump and congressional Republicans.

Whitehouse understands the importance of talking about affordability — for years he’s spoken about the climate crisis as a threat to the global economy.

His social media thread notes that people are feeling the economic burdens of climate change throughout the country, from home insurance hikes to drops in property values.

That’s the message Democrats should lean into, he said, rather than shy away from.

“When leaders don’t talk about something, enthusiasm falls among voters,” Whitehouse wrote in his post. “In politics, you can often make your own wind, or you can make your own doldrums.”

This is something Democrats are grappling with on Capitol Hill. Interviews with a half dozen House and Senate Democrats revealed how many are still struggling with how to discuss climate change, a problem they consider existential but that doesn’t register among voters’ top immediate concerns.

Some are talking nearly exclusively about competitive prices for clean energy — largely in hopes of beating Republicans at their own messaging game.

“My theory of the case is that the argument that I’ve been making for 30 years is finally breaking through,” said Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.), a former clean energy professional.

“The urgency of climate change means that we have to focus on it especially when it’s not as salient with the American people, if we are to be the leaders we claim to be,” he added. “But I think that’s largely a separable conversation from what is the best way to talk about it in any given moment, that has the most ability to move public opinion.”

Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who is on track to be the next Senate Democratic whip, has a similar perspective.

Last year, he removed “climate hawk,” along with other self-descriptions, from his bio on X. And during an event this fall affiliated with New York Climate Week, he said that “those of us in the climate community who are used to making a more broad argument about where we are in the sweep of history have to get comfortable making a more immediate argument that says the reason prices are going up is a deliberate policy choice of the Republican Party.”

Schatz said in a statement last week that he and Whitehouse were united in their ideas around “climate action,” but he also doubled down on the importance of affordability messaging at this time.

“There are think tanks and advocacy organizations that are dedicated to the proposition that climate action is incompatible with affordable energy, but those factional rivalries have been overtaken by events,” Schatz said. “Cheap is clean, and clean is cheap.”

Recent actions from the Democrats’ Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, or SEEC — of which Casten is vice-chair — have also focused squarely on energy costs and the ability of clean energy to lower Americans’ bills.

At a SEEC press conference earlier this month meant to respond to the last year of energy and environment policy under President Donald Trump, a roster of climate-focused Democrats spoke nearly exclusively about energy prices. “Trump lied; Energy costs are up,” read the main sign at the presser.

Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in an interview that Democrats need to focus on energy prices because Trump has used that as a justification for executive actions that bolster oil and gas.

“People, when they see the ways in which the energy policies that are serving big oil are hurting their pocketbooks, it makes it more tangible for why folks should care, in addition to the welfare of the planet,” Stansbury said.

Meanwhile, Republicans have picked up on the Democrats’ shift in talking points and have used it to their advantage.

“You actually see on the left, this debate going on right now, where a lot of people within the Democratic Party, they are talking about how they’ve lost the narrative, or the culture war, on climate,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on Fox Business this month.

Left-leaning thinkers and independent analysts have also argued that Democrats may have gone too far in following the lead of environmental groups they say were out of touch with most Americans.

Columnist Matt Yglesias argued in a New York Times op-ed that Democrats should not be hostile to oil and gas. Longtime energy expert Daniel Yergin wrote in Foreign Affairs about the “troubled energy transition” and the need for a “pragmatic path” forward. And Veteran Democratic operative Adam Jentleson started the think tank the Searchlight Institute to curb the influence of the “groups” on party positions, including climate.

Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce’s Energy Subcommittee, downplayed the notion that congressional Democrats were at odds over how to message on climate change. Talking about affordability need not negate the focus on the impact of climate change, she said.

“I think they are one in the same,” Castor said. “Take my community in Florida. We’re still recovering from Hurricane Helen and Milton and people understand that those storms were supercharged because the Gulf was very, very hot, very warm. And the rain was unlike anything we’ve ever seen. So they are trying to afford rebuilding their homes and paying their property insurance and also suffering higher rate increases.”

Whitehouse in an interview acknowledged some shortcomings to Democrats’ past depictions of climate change “as sort of a moral imperative, as an intangible thing floating out there, something that will affect polar bears,” but said the solution wasn’t to be silent in calling out the harmful impacts of fossil fuel emissions and the influence of oil and gas companies on Trump administration policy.

Ultimately, there’s only so much he can do to press his case. In recent months he has organized forums on climate change as the senior Democrat on the Environment and Public Works panel, toured red states to talk about rising insurance rates related to natural disasters spurred by global warming and said he has commissioned his own polling on the issue.

A tax credit is different from a tax deduction, which lowers the amount of an individual’s taxable income. Tax credits are often more valuable compared to deductions because they directly reduce your tax bill, dollar-for-dollar.

Tax credits can be nonrefundable, refundable or partially refundable. Here’s what to know when filing your taxes this year:

What is a tax credit?

A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar amount an individual can directly subtract from their tax return to reduce the tax they owe. This can lower the total tax payment or increase the refund amount.

Tax credits are more favorable than tax deductions because they reduce the tax due, not just the amount of taxable income, according to Investopedia.

Tax credits are available for a variety of expenses, including purchasing health insurance through the marketplace, paying for higher education and covering child care costs.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases and energy‑efficient home upgrades are no longer available for 2026, after their eligibility deadlines passed in late 2025, according to NerdWallet.

How do refundable tax credits work?

Refundable credits are paid out in full, and a taxpayer also gets a refund for any remaining credit that’s still available. Some taxpayers who aren’t required to file may still want to do so to claim refundable tax credits.

There are several types of refundable tax credits, such as the Premium Tax Credit, which helps individuals and families cover the cost of health insurance premiums purchased through the health insurance marketplace.

The Earned Income Tax Credit is for low‑ to moderate‑income workers who meet eligibility rules based on income and family size.

For 2026, the IRS increased maximum earned income tax credit amounts to:

Up to $664 for workers without children.

Up to $4,427 for those with one qualifying child.

Up to $7,316 for those with two qualifying children.

Up to $8,231 for those with three or more qualifying children.

How do nonrefundable tax credits work?

For nonrefundable tax credits, once a taxpayer’s amount owed reaches zero, they won’t see any leftover amount as a refund.

Some nonrefundable tax credits must be used in the year they are claimed and expire if unused, according to Investopedia. Others, such as the Adoption Credit, may be carried forward to future years.

Nonrefundable tax credits can negatively impact low-income taxpayers because they cannot use the entire amount of the credit.

How do partially refundable credits work?

Some types of credits are partially refundable. One example is the American Opportunity Tax Credit for postsecondary education students.

Under this credit, if a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to zero before using the entire $2,500 credit, the remaining portion may be taken as a refundable credit up to the lesser of 40% of the remaining credit or $1,000, according to Investopedia.

TL;DR EraNova Metals offers asymmetric risk-reward through its undervalued Ruby Creek molybdenum project in British Columbia, trading at $10 million market capitalisation against $30 million in existing infrastructure and a 433 million pound molybdenum resource.","EraNova Metals, a new name & new President & CEO Meredith Eades, has repositioned the company to pursue dual value creation paths through both development of its 433 million pound molybdenum deposit at Ruby Creek and exploration of high-grade copper-gold-silver targets across its 30,000-hectare British Columbia property.

The Ruby Creek molybdenum project, which reached full feasibility and environmental assessment certificate stage in 2008, represents significant embedded value with $30 million in existing infrastructure against a current market capitalisation of just $10 million.

The company completed a 1,585-pound bulk sample from the Silver Surprise zone that yielded a 14.3-ounce silver bar through simple crushing and gravity separation, with grades of 4,200 g/t silver and 95% recoveries, demonstrating potential for near-term direct shipping ore (DSO) revenue generation.

EraNova is working with Tetra Tech to advance the molybdenum project toward a preliminary economic assessment (PEA), updating previous economics to reflect current market conditions as molybdenum prices show steady improvement, with minimal additional drilling required due to comprehensive historical work.

Management is exploring various development options including strategic partnerships, joint ventures, and offtake agreements for the molybdenum asset, whilst maintaining capital discipline and minimising dilution, with a lean operational team heavily invested in the company working to advance both development and exploration objectives.

The global transition to clean energy and advanced manufacturing is creating unprecedented demand for critical minerals, with molybdenum emerging as an essential strategic metal for high-strength steel alloys, oil refining catalysts, and emerging green technologies. In this backdrop, EraNova Metals presents a compelling investment opportunity through its advanced-stage Ruby Creek molybdenum project in British Columbia, combined with emerging high-grade precious metals discovery potential that provides multiple pathways to value creation.

Under the leadership of newly appointed President and CEO Meredith Eades, EraNova has undergone a strategic repositioning that recognises both the embedded value in its molybdenum asset and the significant exploration upside across its expansive land package. This dual-path approach addresses a fundamental challenge facing many junior mining companies: balancing the capital-intensive requirements of resource development with the need to generate shareholder value through exploration success.

The Molybdenum Market Opportunity

Molybdenum, whilst less widely understood than precious metals or base metals like copper, serves critical functions across multiple industrial applications. The metal is essential for producing high-strength, corrosion-resistant steel alloys used in infrastructure, oil and gas pipelines, automotive manufacturing, and construction. As economies globally emphasise infrastructure renewal and industrial upgrading, molybdenum demand continues to grow steadily.

The current market environment appears increasingly favourable for molybdenum projects.

Eades noted, ""We've been seeing this slow steady uptick in the molybdenum price, and like any project, at one minute it's amazing and the economics make a lot of sense, and then the market completely changes.""

This acknowledgement of commodity price cyclicality is important—molybdenum projects that struggled economically during price troughs can rapidly become attractive as fundamentals improve.

EraNova's positioning within the molybdenum sector carries several distinct advantages. As Eades emphasised,

""We're a molybdenum-only project, which is quite rare in general. The metallurgy is quite simple. It's not complex.""

This simplicity translates directly into lower processing costs and reduced technical risk during development and operation. Unlike complex polymetallic deposits that require sophisticated metallurgical flowsheets and multiple product streams, Ruby Creek's straightforward molybdenum mineralisation offers a clearer path to production.

Ruby Creek: Embedded Value & Development Pathway

The Ruby Creek molybdenum deposit represents a substantially de-risked asset that has already undergone extensive technical work. The project reached full feasibility study and environmental assessment certificate approval in 2008, with previous owners positioning it for mine construction before commodity price weakness led to shelving the project. This historical work created significant embedded value that the current market capitalisation fails to recognise.

The project's infrastructure represents tangible value independent of the resource itself. With $30 million invested in roads, access, and site infrastructure against a current market capitalisation of approximately $10 million, investors are essentially acquiring proven infrastructure at a substantial discount. The 433 million pound molybdenum resource provides the foundation for economic assessment, with EraNova now working with engineering firm Tetra Tech to advance toward a preliminary economic assessment that will update previous economics to current market conditions.

Critically, the technical work required to reach PEA stage does not demand extensive additional drilling programmes. The deposit has been well-defined through historical exploration, allowing management to focus capital on economic studies and engineering work rather than costly drill campaigns. This capital efficiency aligns with management's stated focus on ""execution and being disciplined around dilution,"" addressing a key concern for investors in junior mining companies where shareholder value can be eroded through continuous equity raises.

Valuation Metrics

EraNova's current valuation metrics present a compelling opportunity for value-oriented investors. The company sits at a significant discount to comparable molybdenum developers trading at approximately 2.5 cents per pound of molybdenum in-ground,

As Eades noted, ""Compared to our peers, we trade at about 2.5 cents per pound of molybdenum in the ground, while some of our peers are five to 35 cents.""

This fourteen-fold differential in valuation multiples suggests substantial re-rating potential as the company advances its PEA and demonstrates the economic viability of Ruby Creek under current market conditions. This valuation gap can be attributed from the company's previous focus and market perception as primarily a molybdenum developer may not have resonated during periods of weak molybdenum prices. The recent management transition and strategic repositioning have not yet been fully recognised by the market. Additionally, the broader junior mining sector has experienced sustained undervaluation, with many quality assets trading below intrinsic value due to limited risk capital and investor attention.

The jurisdiction also provides meaningful value. British Columbia offers established mining regulations, reliable infrastructure, skilled labour availability, and political stability—factors that reduce development risk and support project financing. The Ruby Creek property's road accessibility further enhances its attractiveness, reducing both construction capital requirements and operating costs compared to remote projects requiring extensive infrastructure development.

Development Pathways

Management's approach to advancing Ruby Creek demonstrates pragmatic flexibility in considering multiple development pathways. Eades outlined several potential structures, the openness to various transaction structures positions EraNova to capitalise on market opportunities as they emerge, whether through traditional equity partnerships, production-linked financing, or strategic acquisitions by larger producers seeking to expand molybdenum exposure.

The preliminary economic assessment represents a critical de-risking milestone that will significantly enhance the company's ability to attract strategic partners or secure development capital. By updating the project economics to reflect current costs, commodity prices, and technical parameters, EraNova can present potential partners with a clear, credible basis for evaluation and negotiation. This positions the company to potentially secure development partnerships that provide funding whilst preserving shareholder value through carried interests or production royalties.

Interview with Meredith Eades, President & CEO of EraNova Metals

Capital Structure & Financing Strategy

EraNova completed a financing round in autumn that strengthened its treasury position to fund advancement of the PEA and initial exploration activities. The financing came together efficiently despite the loss of a significant intended investor, demonstrating market receptivity to the company's strategic vision. The participation of both existing long-term shareholders and new investors suggests confidence in management's ability to execute its dual-path strategy.

The company's capital structure benefits from insider alignment, with key team members holding significant equity positions. Looking forward, management's stated focus on capital discipline and anti-dilutive strategies addresses a critical concern for investors in junior mining companies. The exploration of alternative financing mechanisms, including the potential for direct shipping ore from high-grade silver zones to generate internal cash flow, demonstrates creative thinking about funding exploration and development activities without resorting to continuous equity dilution.

Eades confirmed active interest from potential partners, noting people that have been reaching out to get more involved. Whilst remaining appropriately circumspect about specific discussions, this acknowledgement signals that the investment community and potential strategic partners recognise Ruby Creek's value proposition. For investors, this suggests that value recognition may not require years of additional technical work, but rather the completion of the PEA and effective communication of the project's economics.

The Exploration Upside: Silver & Precious Metals Potential

Whilst molybdenum provides the foundation for EraNova's value proposition, the exploration potential across the 30,000-hectare Ruby Creek property offers significant additional upside that remains largely unrecognised by the market. This discovery potential effectively provides investors with a free option on exploration success, given that the current valuation appears entirely focused on the molybdenum asset.

The Silver Surprise zone represents the most advanced exploration target, with results from a bulk sampling programme demonstrating both high grades and simple metallurgy. The 1,585-pound sample yielded a 14.3-ounce silver bar through straightforward crushing and gravity concentration, with direct smelting achieving 95% recoveries. The grades of 4,200 grams per tonne silver, with even tailings material running 3,500 g/t, indicate robust mineralisation with potential for near-term economic extraction.

The three parallel veins identified at Silver Surprise extend up to 180 metres in length and occur at surface, enabling hand sampling of the bulk sample material. This surface expression and high-grade character raise the possibility of direct shipping ore scenarios, particularly as silver prices have strengthened substantially. Management is actively evaluating this potential, with Eades noting the changing economics:

""A month ago when the price of silver was $50, we discussed could we do that. Yhe conversation at $75 it makes way more sense, and now it's in the $90s. So it seems like something that would be a miss to not think about more seriously.""

Considerations

As with any junior mining investment, EraNova carries execution risks that investors must carefully consider. The company requires successful completion of the PEA to validate the economic viability of Ruby Creek under current market conditions. Whilst historical work de-risks the technical aspects, changing cost structures, environmental requirements, and permitting standards may impact project economics relative to the 2008 feasibility study.

Molybdenum prices, whilst showing recent improvement, remain cyclical and sensitive to global industrial activity and steel production trends. A sustained downturn in industrial demand could undermine project economics and limit financing options. Similarly, whilst silver price strength enhances the exploration upside, precious metals markets can be volatile.

The company's lean management structure, whilst capital-efficient, places significant execution burden on a small team. Successful advancement of both the molybdenum development pathway and the exploration programme will require effective capital allocation, technical execution, and strategic decision-making. Investors should monitor management's ability to attract additional experienced personnel as the company scales its activities.

Permitting and regulatory processes in British Columbia, whilst generally supportive of responsible mining development, can be lengthy and complex. Although Ruby Creek received an environmental assessment certificate in 2008, permitting requirements and community expectations have evolved, potentially requiring additional engagement and approvals before construction could commence.

The Investment Thesis for Era Nova Metals

‍Significant Valuation Discount to Asset Value: Current market capitalisation of $10 million represents 33% of the $30 million in existing infrastructure value at Ruby Creek, before accounting for the 433 million pound molybdenum resource. Trading at 2.5 cents per pound molybdenum in-ground versus peer range of 5-35 cents suggests 2-14x re-rating potential based on sector-standard valuation multiples.‍

De-Risked Development Asset: Ruby Creek's 433 million pound molybdenum resource benefits from historical feasibility study and environmental approval, with simple metallurgy requiring straightforward processing. Minimal additional drilling needed before PEA completion enables capital-efficient advancement, whilst road-accessible location in established British Columbia mining district reduces infrastructure capital and operating costs.‍

Multiple Near-Term Value Catalysts: Preliminary economic assessment with Tetra Tech expected to demonstrate improved project economics under current molybdenum pricing, whilst potential strategic partnership or joint venture discussions are actively underway. 2026 exploration programme targeting high-grade silver zones offers additional catalysts through bulk sampling or direct shipping ore scenarios.‍

Exploration Optionality: Silver Surprise zone bulk sample demonstrated 4,200 g/t silver grades with 95% recoveries through simple gravity concentration, with three parallel surface veins up to 180 metres strike length. Seven distinct mineralised zones across 30,000-hectare property with copper-gold-silver-tungsten potential remain largely unexplored, providing free exploration upside.‍

Strong Management Alignment: Key technical team members including operations manager and chief geologist work without cash compensation as significant shareholders, ensuring alignment with investor interests. Explicit focus on minimising dilution through exploration of alternative funding mechanisms including DSO revenue demonstrates commitment to shareholder value preservation.‍

Strategic Flexibility, Multiple Development Pathways: Management's openness to strategic partnerships, joint ventures, and offtake agreements for molybdenum development provides optionality to capitalise on market opportunities whilst preserving shareholder value. Active interest from potential partners signals market recognition of Ruby Creek's value proposition.‍

Favourable Macro Backdrop: Molybdenum demand supported by infrastructure spending, industrial upgrading, and high-strength steel requirements, whilst silver benefits from monetary uncertainty and supply constraints. Government focus on domestic critical minerals production enhances strategic value of Canadian molybdenum supply in stable jurisdiction.

TL;DR

EraNova Metals offers asymmetric risk-reward through its undervalued Ruby Creek molybdenum project in British Columbia, trading at $10 million market capitalisation against $30 million in existing infrastructure and a 433 million pound molybdenum resource. Under new CEO Meredith Eades, the company is advancing toward preliminary economic assessment with Tetra Tech whilst exploring high-grade silver targets that yielded 4,200 g/t from bulk sampling. Trading at 2.5 cents per pound molybdenum in-ground versus peers at 5-35 cents, EraNova presents 2-14x re-rating potential as it demonstrates project economics and explores strategic partnerships. The exploration upside across 30,000 hectares provides additional optionality, with potential direct shipping ore from surface silver mineralisation offering near-term revenue generation. Management's capital-disciplined approach and heavily invested technical team working without cash compensation ensures strong alignment with shareholders, whilst multiple development pathways including joint ventures and offtakes preserve strategic flexibility.

It’s important to understand that not all of the bad news for the coal industry is coming by way of the EPA. While the CO2 limits for new coal and gas plants complicates domestic power generation, the global market for U.S. coal is softening. Up until several months ago, many people (myself included) were expecting U.S. coal exports to increase based on strong international demand. I wrote last year that even though domestic coal production was declining, significant amounts of U.S. coal (and carbon) were being consumed by European and Asian markets.

However, instead of expecting a record year of coal exports, U.S. exports are expected to decline by 5 percent this year.

Perhaps the biggest indicator is China’s announcement that they will ban construction of coal-fired power plants in three key industrial regions around Beijing, Shanhai, and Guanghzou in an effort improve air quality. The action plan from the State Council, China's Cabinet, also aims to cut coal's share of the country's total primary energy use to below 65% in 2017 and increase the share of nuclear power, natural gas and renewable energy.

In the most recent news, the country took a major forward leap after a previously delayed state subsidy agreement has now officially been secured. Ultimately, this means that the UK has received the go ahead or approval to move forward into the construction phase of its hydrogen project and advance its portfolio of projects that are looking to achieve decarbonization.

Understanding the impacts of ownership shifting in the green hydrogen project

Tax paying residents are not usually concerned with the complex issues that arise during the execution of an energy project. Instead, their main concern is reaping the benefits of the electricity or power supply once a project has finally reached completion. In the UK, agreements under the government’s Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR1) are expected to guarantee extensive revenue support that will permit the first phase of turning meticulous planning into a full reality. This is monumental for the European country considering that it is embracing something which it has not previously done in the past.

Much has been made about the UK receiving public support during its energy related aspirations, but what is an even bigger deal is how the agreement is set to initiate shifts in project ownership which investors are paying careful attention to. 2026 might be the year that the UK moves past the previous delays that have haunted its hydrogen production potential.

The United Kingdom’s green hydrogen project: Analyzing the role of the government

In most cases, the government is the only branch responsible for halting an energy project because private corporations require approval from it. Thus, when a government finally decides to play ball and take part in a project, countries along with their residents stand to gain massively. The UK government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) created a lot of anticipation and excitement after breaking the news that an astounding 10 green hydrogen projects have officially signed Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreements with the state-owned entity Low Carbon Contracts allowing them to receive long term subsidies. The agreed contracts are expected to foster a compromise between green hydrogen and fossil fuels.

Now investors may fully commit to strategically planning for the construction phase with more confidence that it will come to fruition.

Assessing the ownership shift in the UK’s green hydrogen project

The agreed upon contract means that the UK state will be able to support hydrogen production in a timescale spanning over 15 years. According to reports, the UK is sure that the current structure will foster private capital and significantly assist the UK in becoming one of the leading countries in clean energy.

New investors’ involvement is imminent in the green hydrogen project

Following the renewed government backing, it is almost a certainty that many companies will be seeking to benefit from it by becoming investors just as is usually the case in energy projects. For instance, consumer goods manufacturer Kimberly-Clark is set to become one of the first industrial end users to utilize green energy hydrogen at a high scale. The company has reached collaborative deals with other corporations such as HYRO, Carlton Power, and Schroders Greencoat, with the intent of securing investment agreements that will amalgamate hydrogen production with its manufacturing resources in Barrow-in Furness and Northfleet.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/21-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:21.484527

WA lawmakers want them to pay - The Olympian,Simone Carter,,,,,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/article314431886.html,"Washington state has sought to grow as a hub for data centers, but now state lawmakers are considering setting new requirements for them.

There are more than 100 data centers in Washington state, which ranks among the top 10 nationally, according to the website Data Center Map.

Data centers are physical facilities that hold various IT infrastructure to process, store and deliver data for various purposes including artificial intelligence, streaming services and online banking.

Such centers can generate sizable revenue and job growth for the communities that call them home — but concerns have begun to bubble up about their implications for local electricity rates and the surrounding environment.

State Rep. Beth Doglio, an Olympia Democrat, is the primary sponsor of House Bill 2515. During a Jan. 22 hearing on the bill, she said that lawmakers are confronting the possibility of significant demands on the state’s water, communities and power grid.

”These policies seek to protect ratepayers by ensuring new data centers are picking up the whole tab for new growth, protect against stranded assets, ensure grid reliability,” Doglio told the House Environment & Energy Committee, which she chairs.

There are more than 100 data centers in Washington state, which ranks among the top 10 nationally, according to the website Data Center Map.

Washington has worked to attract more data centers to the state by providing tax incentives. Yet 2024 reporting by The Seattle Times and ProPublica showed that the state’s courting of data centers has conflicted with its ambitious clean-energy goals.

Gov. Bob Ferguson launched a workgroup last year examining how data centers affect the state’s economy and environment.

The group’s preliminary findings, released last month, suggest that the state has work to do when it comes to meeting burgeoning power demands. They also highlighted “potential impacts” regarding water resources, and recommended shielding ratepayers by ensuring that data centers foot the bill for full energy-system expenses.

Doglio’s proposal would, in part, set new requirements for data centers. They would need to report on their energy and water use, with new or expanded facilities meeting certain thresholds for using electricity from nonemitting electric generation or renewable resources. Data centers would also pay the Department of Revenue an annual fee to deposit into a new account, with proceeds split between energy- and higher education-related purposes.

A preliminary fiscal note projects that in the fiscal 2027-29 biennium, $46.4 million would be generated from the annual fee, legislative staff said at the hearing. That number is estimated to come in at $67.7 million in the following biennium.

Data centers in Eastern Washington communities in particular, including Quincy and East Wenatchee, have led to rising local property values, job creation, funding for public infrastructure and declining levy rates, the governor’s workgroup found.

The Tri-City Herald reported in November that the Tri-Cities has received three data center proposals in the past year, any of which would mark the first facility in or near that area.

Republican state Rep. Alex Ybarra said during the hearing that data center-related water issues aren’t a concern in Quincy, which he represents. Despite 85% of its residents living in poverty, the city is home to the third-cheapest electricity in the U.S., he added.

Logan Bahr with Tacoma Power/Tacoma Public Utilities testified in support of HB 2515, which he said would help protect consumers. He also said the bill would set clear guidelines for new large-energy users.

“These same principles guided Tacoma as we implemented our large-load rate in 2024 that ensures new high-demand customers are accountable for the impacts they have on the system,” Bahr said.

The measure also saw support from climate and environmental advocates who argued that the bill would help safeguard clean air, water and salmon. Others want to see data centers report on energy use to better understand the toll on the power grid.

By 2030, the Northwest’s power supply gap is forecasted to hit close to 9 gigawatts, sparking concern about potential energy shortfalls, McClatchy previously reported

Some in the business community voiced their opposition at Thursday’s hearing.

Peter Godlewski with the Association of Washington Business noted that Grant County saw a 131% spike in tax revenue between 2005 and 2024 thanks to the data-center sector.

Tom Pierson, interim president and CEO of the Tacoma-Pierce County Chamber, said past legislation authorizing data center tax preference for Pierce, King and Snohomish counties. Before then, a data center in Puyallup had sat vacant for 13 years, he said, but today it counts some $200 million in investments — with tax dollars returning to the local economy.

“Data centers are not theoretical investments,” Pierson said. “They’re proven infrastructure.”",https://www.theolympian.com/public/latest-news/t6dcx3/picture314433937/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Beth_Doglio.png,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:26.409035

It also supplies its own autonomous driving solutions for use in conjunction with its battery electric trucks.
In its 2024 Sustainability Report released in 2025, Zijin Mining stated that the Xinjiang Zijin Zinc mine had 250 all electric mining trucks undertaking 80% of the transportation tasks in the mining area.
In addition, the safety and operating efficiency of electric mining trucks have notable advantages over diesel trucks.
But ultimately, Zijin Mining is looking to have its own in-house captive electric mining trucks.","Zijin Mining has announced a major sustainability milestone – its total installed clean energy capacity has officially surpassed 1,000 MW. This achievement reflects successful grid connections across its global operations, including a 70 MW wind power project at Bayannur Zijin in China; a 23.87 MW solar project in the Democratic Republic of Congo; and a a 25 MW solar facility at Rosebel Gold Mine in Suriname. It states: “Together, these projects mark meaningful progress in our green and low-carbon development journey.”

Alongside expanding renewable energy generation, Zijin says it continues to implement comprehensive energy-saving initiatives, including waste heat recovery systems. As a result, by the end of 2024, carbon emissions per RMB10,000 of industrial added value decreased by 35% compared to 2020, while renewable energy now accounts for more than 50% of its total electricity consumption.

But the company’s net zero transition also extends to green fleets in mining. Since 2020, the Zijin electric vehicle fleet has grown from 13 to 1,183 vehicles, and Xinjiang Zijin Zinc in China it says has become the single mine with the world’s largest fleet of pure electric mining trucks. These trucks have included models supplied by Breton Technology, which is headquartered in Shanghai and listed on the HKSE in May 2025. Breton has introduced three main BEV mining truck models to the market. In August 2022, it launched a 105-t model, the BRT105E, which enabled heavy-load uphill operations. In the second half of 2024, it launched a 120 t model, the BRT120E, with a greater payload and the 135 t range-extended model BRT135E. It also supplies its own autonomous driving solutions for use in conjunction with its battery electric trucks.

In its 2024 Sustainability Report released in 2025, Zijin Mining stated that the Xinjiang Zijin Zinc mine had 250 all electric mining trucks undertaking 80% of the transportation tasks in the mining area. It added: “The energy cost per tonne kilometre for electric mining trucks is only about RMB0.177, compared to as high as RMB0.68 when using fossil energy. In addition, the safety and operating efficiency of electric mining trucks have notable advantages over diesel trucks. With fewer complex transmission components such as engines and transmissions, these trucks have a much lower failure rate than that of fossil fuel vehicles. Moreover, the simpler operation of electric vehicles reduces the risk of accidents due to operational errors.”

At this operation and at other mines, Zijin is also working with other major battery mining truck OEMs like Tonly, LGMG, SANY, XCMG and others. For example at the Zhibula copper mine, part of the Julong Copper Mine complex, Zijin is deploying 60 SANY battery mining trucks fitted with EACON’s autonomous driving system. On January 23, 2026, Phase 2 of the Zijin’s Julong Copper Mine project was officially completed and put into production. Based on the existing mining and processing scale of 150,000 t/d, an additional production scale of 200,000 t/d will be newly added to Julong Copper Mine, resulting in an overall production scale of 350,000 t/d.

At another major Zijin operation, its namesake Zijinshan gold mine in Shanghang County, Longyan, Fujian Province, the electric fleet has also been growing. By September 2024, electric vehicles accounted for 45% of Zijinshan’s fleet, all of which support both static charging and battery swapping. The battery swap station, built by Zijin Mining and State Grid Corporation of China and launched in September 2023, can service a truck in just 8 minutes and has an annual battery charging capacity of 12 million kWh. The fleet includes the new XCMG EX80 truck, on which EACON has also deployed its autonomous driving system.

But ultimately, Zijin Mining is looking to have its own in-house captive electric mining trucks. For the problem of slow recharging speed of electric vehicles, Fujian Longking, a company in which Zijin is the controlling shareholder (its stake recently increased from 25% to 33.76%) tailored a battery box and side battery swap system plan for the Xinjiang Zijin Zinc mine.

The capacity of each battery box is as high as 770 kWh, representing Zijin says the largest capacity of side swapping battery technology globally, with a swap time of only four minutes. Leveraging these advantages, Xinjiang Zijin Zinc restructured the roles of electric and diesel trucks to optimise their use within the remaining lifespan of diesel trucks, assigning the electric mining trucks to steeper sections at the bottom of the mine and diesel trucks to gentler slopes in the upper areas. “This adjustment gives full play to the best performance of different power vehicles, reducing diesel consumption at the mining site from 42,000 t in the previous reporting period to 34,000 t.”

This relationship with Fujian Longking has recently deepened, with Zijin working closely with the company for the development of next generation battery trucks for its own use, not just in China but globally. Xie Xionghui, a Vice President of Zijin Mining is also the Chairman of Longking.

In December 2025 the first all electric mining truck developed by Zijin and Longking rolled off the Longking production line in Longyan – the 140 t class LK220E. This was it says after only nine months of development.

Longking states: “The mines of Zijin Mining are mostly located in remote areas at high altitudes, and adverse conditions such as large day and night temperature difference, high cold temperature, and high temperature have brought severe tests to the stable operation of mine equipment. The pain points of difficult operation, large load demand, and high energy consumption have become key bottlenecks limiting the efficient and green development of the mining industry.”

It adds that its R&D team has gone through several rounds of research and technical arguments, with ‘stable power, improved energy efficiency, and strong safety’ as the main goals. “By customising a pure electric special drive bridge with high carrying capacity and large tonnage, it greatly improves energy recovery efficiency, achieves the precise adaptation of power output and high endurance capacity under large heavy duty work conditions, and improves the transportation efficiency of mines.” Longking has developed a two-bridge independent central distributed drive system, enabling flexible torque distribution and adaptation to mine conditions.

The core parts of the entire vehicle are made of cold, abrasion and vibration resistant high strength materials, which translate to good shock resistance in low temperature environments. The steering and braking system combine with dual safety redundancy to significantly reduce the risk of failure; The battery pack protection level reaches IP68, which can effectively guarantee the safe and stable operation of the vehicle through dozens of rigorous tests such as soaking in water, fire, simulated collision, extrusion, and thermal diffusion.

Its adds that the LK220E can achieve seamless docking with Zijin’s intelligent mine ecosystem, “marking a new stage in the R&D and industrialisation process of Longking in the field of new energy mining equipment.” At present, Longking on key technologies such as high-capacity power battery system integration, high-power drive control, and cloud platform computing power. “By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as big data analysis, AI-driven decision-making, and simulation design, we can optimise core strategies like vehicle scheduling, energy consumption management, and intelligent maintenance, accelerate the development and mass production of next-generation fully electric mining dump trucks, and build a differentiated, high-end, and intelligent product matrix.”

The statement pointed out that as a world-leading multinational mining giant, Zijin Mining has more than 30 large-scale mines at home and abroad and in order to accelerate the construction of green and smart mines, and at the same time solve the problem of the long-term monopoly of imported brands in the high-end mining truck market, Zijin Mining has clearly put forward the goal of building “a new energy independent equipment system.” This will see it use its more than 30 mining scenarios around the world as innovation test fields so that products can continue to be tempered and iteratively matured in real and complex working conditions.

Longking: “Relying on the rich scene support provided by Zijin and the equipment R&D and manufacturing experience accumulated by Longking for decades, the company’s R&D and industrialisation of pure electric mining trucks has obtained unique fertile ground and development advantages.”

Longking states: “The Julong mining area is located in a high-altitude and alpine area, with a working altitude of 5,300 metres, which will fully and comprehensively verify the product performance. With an average annual operation of 50,000 kilometres, compared with traditional fuel mining trucks, each model can reduce carbon emissions by more than 120 t per year, and the cost per tonne-kilometre can be reduced by more than 30%, bringing significant environmental benefits and economic returns to mines, and filling the gap in Julong large-tonnage pure electric mining dump truck products.”",https://im-mining.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9982.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:29.447225

A tax credit is different from a tax deduction, which lowers the amount of an individual’s taxable income. Tax credits are often more valuable compared to deductions because they directly reduce your tax bill, dollar-for-dollar.

Tax credits can be nonrefundable, refundable or partially refundable. Here’s what to know when filing your taxes this year:

What is a tax credit?

A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar amount an individual can directly subtract from their tax return to reduce the tax they owe. This can lower the total tax payment or increase the refund amount.

Tax credits are more favorable than tax deductions because they reduce the tax due, not just the amount of taxable income, according to Investopedia.

Tax credits are available for a variety of expenses, including purchasing health insurance through the marketplace, paying for higher education and covering child care costs.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases and energy‑efficient home upgrades are no longer available for 2026, after their eligibility deadlines passed in late 2025, according to NerdWallet.

How do refundable tax credits work?

Refundable credits are paid out in full, and a taxpayer also gets a refund for any remaining credit that’s still available. Some taxpayers who aren’t required to file may still want to do so to claim refundable tax credits.

There are several types of refundable tax credits, such as the Premium Tax Credit, which helps individuals and families cover the cost of health insurance premiums purchased through the health insurance marketplace.

The Earned Income Tax Credit is for low‑ to moderate‑income workers who meet eligibility rules based on income and family size.

For 2026, the IRS increased maximum earned income tax credit amounts to:

Up to $664 for workers without children.

Up to $4,427 for those with one qualifying child.

Up to $7,316 for those with two qualifying children.

Up to $8,231 for those with three or more qualifying children.

How do nonrefundable tax credits work?

For nonrefundable tax credits, once a taxpayer’s amount owed reaches zero, they won’t see any leftover amount as a refund.

Some nonrefundable tax credits must be used in the year they are claimed and expire if unused, according to Investopedia. Others, such as the Adoption Credit, may be carried forward to future years.

Nonrefundable tax credits can negatively impact low-income taxpayers because they cannot use the entire amount of the credit.

How do partially refundable credits work?

Some types of credits are partially refundable. One example is the American Opportunity Tax Credit for postsecondary education students.

Under this credit, if a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to zero before using the entire $2,500 credit, the remaining portion may be taken as a refundable credit up to the lesser of 40% of the remaining credit or $1,000, according to Investopedia.

Clean energy is reshaping countries, economies and lives faster than anyone expected.

Bangladesh has set a global record, electrifying millions of homes powered by off-grid solar, bringing electricity to rural families who waited generations for it. Denmark has shown how wind power can move from experiment to energy infrastructure backbone. The massive purchase by Pakistan of solar panels and batteries has helped the country walk away from natural gas as a strategic fuel. And the ban by Ethiopia on fossil-fuel car imports has sparked a rapid shift to electric vehicles.

These projects are proof that clean energy works at scale.

This is because clean energy now makes economic sense. Today, more than 90 per cent of new renewable power is cheaper than building new fossil fuel plants. Investors see it. Governments see it. Communities feel it. Clean energy is faster to deploy, cheaper to run and more resilient in an increasingly volatile world.

It is also creating millions of jobs. About 16.6 million people already work in clean energy worldwide, from manufacturing to installation to innovation. In 2025 alone, global investment in renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency and electrification hit $2.2 trillion, twice the amount that flowed into oil, gas and coal. For developing economies, this shift offers a powerful opportunity to grow without locking into costly fuel imports or outdated systems.

Energy is the engine behind nearly every development goal we care about. Without reliable, affordable energy, progress on poverty, health, education, gender equality, clean water, industry and cities stalls. In fact, an analysis across the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) framework shows that energy underpins roughly two thirds of all SDG targets, with 125 of the 169 SDGs linked to energy, either directly or indirectly. This is why access to clean energy sits at the heart of the 2030 Agenda, and why getting it right accelerates progress across the board.

Nowhere is this clearer than with climate change. Energy use produces about three quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions. If we do not transform how we power our homes, factories, transport and cities, there is no credible path to a safe climate. Clean energy is quite simply the solution. Without a rapid and sustained transformation of energy systems, no credible pathway exists to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century or to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.

There has been real progress. Nearly 92 per cent of people worldwide now have access to electricity. Clean cooking access has also grown, and currently stands at 74 per cent globally, improving health, saving lives and easing the burden on women and girls. These gains show what is possible when ambition meets action.

But the gaps remain stark and unacceptable. 666 million people still live without electricity and 2.1 billion rely on dirty fuels to cook, breathing smoke that harms their health every day. At the same time, clean energy investment remains slow and uneven. For example, Africa, which holds some of the world’s best solar resources, receives just 2 per cent of global clean energy finance. Many countries with the greatest need are still left waiting, perpetuating poverty, inequality and health risks while constraining climate action.

This carries significant economic risk. To meet global climate goals and deliver energy for all, clean energy investment must more than triple by 2030, and much of it must go to emerging and developing economies.

The good news is that momentum is building. Governments are renewing commitments. Global plans are being updated. Clean energy is firmly on the climate agenda. And 2026 will be a defining year, with a major global review of progress on energy access and sustainability.

Clean energy is one of the rare solutions that brings people together rather than pulling them apart. It cuts emissions while creating jobs. It strengthens economies while improving health and opportunity. It gives countries more control over their futures, and communities more power over their lives.

The International Day of Clean Energy, observed each year on 26 January, is a moment to recognize just how far we have come and how much further we can go. This day is our call to accelerate action, share solutions and build momentum behind a transition that is already underway.

The building blocks are in place. The technologies work. The costs are falling. And the evidence, from villages to entire nations, shows that clean energy delivers. What is needed now is the confidence to move faster and the commitment to ensure that no one is left behind.

The international community has a decisive role to play in accelerating the build-out of clean energy infrastructure, especially across the developing world, where energy demand is rising fastest and the stakes are highest.

By mobilizing concessional finance, de-risking private investment, and transferring technology and technical expertise, developing countries can undertake grid modernization, energy storage and robust renewable projects that will, in turn, expand clean energy access and strengthen economic resilience.

If we choose ambition over hesitation, partnership over fragmentation and action over delay, clean energy can become the defining success story of this decade. It can turn global promises into real progress, lighting homes, powering schools, fuelling businesses and protecting the planet we share.

A clean energy future is not only possible. It is within reach. The choices we make today, starting now, will determine whether it becomes a reality for everyone.",https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/field/image/2026/01/un71079981_dsc2395_.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:34.784157

QADIRABAD, Pakistan—Only a few weeks to wrap up a lifetime. The thought crossed Muhammad Imran’s mind and lingered as he prepared in November to depart the country with his family, perhaps for good.

Disheartened by Pakistan’s chronic political and economic troubles, Imran decided to look for a better future elsewhere. But the other, more immediate worry was less than a mile from his family’s neighborhood in the agricultural heartland of the nation’s largest province: a giant coal-fired power plant.

“We never felt comfortable here. This environment … it’s not just about us. Everyone here breathes the same air,” Imran, 33, said somberly as his wife, Asma Rafique, comforted the younger of their two children.

The couple stepped into the courtyard of their government housing colony, awash in afternoon light that glared against a wall of broken bricks and scattered weeds. The Sahiwal power plant towered over the neighborhood, a thick white plume rising from one of its massive smokestacks.

In 2015, as countries increasingly retired coal power plants because of their health- and climate-damaging pollution, Pakistan struck a deal with China for eight new ones—starting with Sahiwal. The logic was simple: Generate more electricity fast to end destabilizing blackouts in Pakistan, while producing a return for China as part of its massive infrastructure push across the Global South.

A decade later, seven of those power plants are running and Pakistan faces new problems. Ballooning debt from the energy complexes has jacked up electricity costs, fueling a surge in rooftop solar that in turn means less money to address the debt. Communities near the plants bear the brunt of the new pollution. And many regions still experience rolling blackouts, now triggered not by lack of electrical generation capacity but because the country doesn’t have the cash to fully run the plants.

China describes its Belt and Road investment campaign as a major win for lower-income countries long exploited by the West. But a number of the projects have harmed surrounding communities, an investigative series by Inside Climate News found. And in Pakistan’s case, the power-plant deal built on the playbook developed by Western companies operating in the country years earlier.

Imran and Rafique moved to Qadirabad several years after the power plant began operating in 2017. They and their children started experiencing lingering respiratory and skin symptoms and could get no explanation for the cause. For a while, before deciding they had to leave, they tried to spare their children’s health by spending weekends with relatives, some 50 miles away in a city called Chichawatni.

“We leave every Friday and come back on Monday. That way our kids get to breathe fresh air back in our family home,” Rafique said. The air in Qadirabad is so polluted, Imran said, that his mother, who has chronic asthma, cannot visit for even a few hours.

A pharmacist at the local clinic described similar experiences. “Half the patients who come now complain of cough or eye redness,” said the man, who asked not to be named because staff is not supposed to speak with the media. “It wasn’t like this before the plant.”

How a Coal Plant Landed in the Middle of Farmland

Pakistan’s electricity shortages have persisted for decades. But the hours-long rolling blackouts that started in 2011 and continued into 2015 were among the worst in recent memory, plunging communities into darkness, shuttering factories and stalling economic growth. Under pressure, the conservative Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party then in power scrambled for fixes to calm public anger and reboot the economy.

China offered one.

Its talks with the PML-N government for the multibillion-dollar Pakistan component of the Belt and Road, the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, included the slate of coal-fired plants.

Built for $1.9 billion by a subsidiary of the state-owned China Huaneng Group, the plant was one of many Belt and Road projects constructed by Chinese firms across the Global South.

Afia Malik, an Islamabad-based energy economist with the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, a government research organization, said the decision to rely on imported coal that Chinese investors found more viable than Pakistan’s domestic resource locked it into foreign fuel dependence and price volatility.

The terms of the contracts have caused even more problems for Pakistan.

The government agreed to pay the plant operators for 85 percent of the electricity each facility is capable of generating, whether that amount was generated or not, she said.

Pakistan already had experience with that “take-or-pay” structure. Pushed by the World Bank and other multilateral lenders to address electricity shortages in the 1990s with privatization, the country agreed to contracts with Western independent power producers that also guaranteed minimum payment based on capacity. But that threshold was 65 percent, not 85, Malik said. And even so, Pakistan is paying billions each year for 1990s-era plants operating at low levels.​

Both the older and newer contracts require payments in dollars, a further problem for Pakistan as its currency value sinks. All of that adds to the country’s “circular” energy debt, which refers to overdue payments from electricity users including households and businesses as well as transmission and distribution-related losses piled across the power system, impacting the government’s ability to pay power producers on time. That cycle has metastasized overtime and cannot subside without systemwide upgrades and reforms, experts say.

The International Monetary Fund said in a January 2024 report that the country’s circular debt stood at 2.6 trillion Pakistani rupees, about $9 billion in U.S. dollars, equivalent to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product.

Pakistan’s planning failures are to blame for the financial impacts of the CPEC plants, in Malik’s view. “[The] Chinese government didn’t ask us to take it. We asked them to come and invest here.”

Ayesha Ali, an associate professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences who studies electricity access and structural failures in low- and middle-income energy systems, said Pakistan missed a chance in the mid-2010s to build a more balanced energy mix.

“A slower path, but perhaps more sustainable … would have integrated more renewables,” she said from her Lahore office. She pointed to hydropower, utility-scale solar and distributed mini-grids as options overlooked in the rush to end blackouts.

In a written statement, officials at Pakistan’s power ministry said CPEC coal plants “largely resolved” the country’s blackouts related to insufficient capacity. But the government doesn’t have enough money to fully run those plants because the cost of fuel, its transport and related services are so high. That, along with problems such as climate-driven breakdowns, is driving current-day outages, the ministry said.

Pakistan’s rapid, citizen-led shift to rooftop solar—with inexpensive panels from China—is both a symptom and a catalyst of this dysfunction. As more households and businesses go solar, the country’s electric utilities have fewer paying customers, further worsening their financial troubles.

The Clinic in the Shadow of the Smokestacks

When the Sahiwal power plant project in Punjab province received approval, the region’s Environment Protection Department laid out compliance requirements, including routine monitoring to ensure air quality standards would not be exceeded. The operator was also instructed to promptly address complaints from neighboring residents.

But when some local community organizations raised concerns about the plant’s impact on public health and the environment, they said the operator didn’t respond directly but rather through Chinese media platforms, little-known forums and paid content, insisting that emissions remained well within limits and complied with local laws. The groups weren’t able to confirm that: Officials at the Punjab Environmental Protection Department in the provincial capital referred them to annual compliance reports that are not independently verified or even publicly available, the local advocates said.

The Punjab Environmental Protection Department and the office of the provincial minister, Marriyum Aurangzeb, did not respond when asked by Inside Climate News whether any emissions monitoring, groundwater sampling or similar periodic testing has been done as required. They also did not say whether they would make any results public or comment on whether the government has a plan to address public grievances and health concerns.

In the absence of public monitoring and compliance data, the best way to grasp the coal plant’s impacts is to visit the modest rural health center in village 55/5L, a short drive from the government colony where Imran and Rafique lived with their two young children.

Dr. Samir Baig, a young medical doctor posted here last February, said the facility has no reliable system for tracking illnesses over time, but patterns in the steady stream of cases jump out to him.

“I’ve seen a clear burden of skin issues, and a close second is flu and sore throat. I’m seeing this from the very beginning,” he said. Upper airway irritation is also common.

The clinic’s dispenser, who joined the staff several years before the plant began operating in 2017, offered a clearer sense of how illness patterns have evolved over the years, describing common ailments like skin irritation, congestion and asthma. “In my experience, the frequency of these burdens has increased, not lessened, since the power plant started working here,” he said, asking not to be named because he was not supposed to talk with the media.

The problems both men described, even susceptibility to influenza, are what decades of health research has shown a community can expect when exposed to the toxic particles and sulfur pollution from burning coal. Coughing, throat irritation, recurrent chest infections and asthma‑like episodes are noted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the World Health Organization and toxicological assessments of sulfur dioxide and particulate pollution.

At the village 55/5L clinic, handwritten pages in English and Urdu note the illnesses reported by patients and medicines they were sent home with.

In 2018 and 2019, the first full years after the plant began commercial operation, respiratory illness was the most common complaint noted in the daily outpatient registers, documents reviewed by Inside Climate News show. Many pages are densely filled with the names of villagers from the plant’s immediate vicinity.

Children under 5 came in frequently with acute respiratory infections and fever, while older adults showed up with wheezing, shortness of breath and other chronic chest complaints.

On several days in July and September 2018, more than half the entries involve breathing complaints. None of the handwritten entries discuss causes, pollution or otherwise.

Inside Climate News was also able to review the 2022 records. In July, August and September of that year, the forms record several hundred cases of “acute (upper) respiratory infections” each month, alongside smaller but persistent numbers of pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and suspected tuberculosis cases.

Only gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea and peptic ulcer disease rivaled respiratory illness in scale, and skin conditions like scabies trail behind them. Taken together, these reflect the infectious‑disease burden typical of rural Punjab, said a local health department expert who asked not to be named. What stood out was that respiratory diagnoses remained near the top of the list.

These clinic numbers are one of the few datasets reflecting health conditions near the Sahiwal plant. In communities exposed to coal combustion, public‑health experts typically watch for three early markers: persistently high rates of acute respiratory infections, more frequent flare‑ups of asthma and obstructive pulmonary disease and a noticeable burden of eye and upper‑airway irritation. All appear in the clinic’s registers.

None of that information can establish causation. What it shows are troubling patterns.

And independent research suggests that residents are being exposed to pollution that can harm their health. Findings published in the PLOS One journal in 2024 showed elevated levels of coal-related heavy metals in soil and crops across villages closest to the plant.

Plant operator Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy and its parent company, China Huaneng Group, did not respond to repeated requests for comment by Inside Climate News. The Chinese embassies in Islamabad and Washington, D.C., also did not respond.

Asked about conditions near the Sahiwal plant, Shezra Mansab, Pakistan’s minister of state for climate change, said Pakistan is “committed to environmental justice.” Provincial environmental agencies are responsible for enforcement but concerns will “take some time” to address, she said.

Locked in a Vicious Circle

Weak oversight isn’t limited to the coal plants’ pollution. A 2020 government-commissioned inquiry found that numerous power producers under CPEC “were earning profits far in excess of what was allowed,” with inflated project costs and contracts that “transferred most of the risk to the Government of Pakistan” and worsened the circular debt. The report urged officials to renegotiate the deals in the public interest.

As policymakers in Islamabad weigh contract revisions and early coal retirements, public officials and experts are asking why Pakistan didn’t learn from its expensive 1990s private power deals before locking the country into another exorbitantly expensive 30-year fossil fuel generation cycle.

Pakistan’s former climate change minister, Malik Amin Aslam, who was not part of the administration that negotiated CPEC power deals, sees those coal plants as a “big liability” and called the Sahiwal coal power plant “a project … done with criminal neglect.”

In a phone interview with Inside Climate News, Aslam said the plant “was clearly sited in the wrong place” and is “having disastrous effects on the people who are living around it and the agriculturists.” He said underground water sources and crop yields have both declined since the plant opened.

“It is the heartland of Pakistan and it has had disastrous results,” he said bluntly. Now the country is trapped in what he called a “very bad situation,” paying for power it no longer needs from multiple new coal plants as consumers rapidly migrate to rooftop solar.

Pakistan is negotiating to repurpose or retire some of the coal plants early, particularly Sahiwal, Aslam said. Both Pakistani business interests and outside experts say a deal to fix the country’s coal-energy conundrum would accelerate the country’s shift to renewables. But Aslam warned the talks will be difficult, given the “very luxurious” 30-year contracts to Chinese investors. “Why would they walk away from future profits?” he said.

Mansab, the minister of state for climate change, defended the country’s heavy dependence on imported coal while acknowledging planning flipflops underpinning CPEC’s power projects.

“Pakistan was in dire need of stable energy,” she said in a phone interview. The coal plants, she maintained, were built at a time when “there wasn’t so much policy … for renewables” and therefore were necessary. She did not dispute that the same projects are now at the core of Pakistan’s fiscal troubles.

Mansab also conceded that the planning assumptions underpinning CPEC deals did not materialize. The expected industrial growth “did not happen,” she said, leaving the country with more power plant capacity than it needed.

Mansab resisted calling the episode a failure of governance, saying the contacts reflected “global financing norms at that time.” But she acknowledged that Pakistan is now “relooking” at these deals both domestically and in discussions with foreign partners, including China. Without offering any specifics on timelines or possible terms of renegotiation, she said, “We cannot afford any more loans.”

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s power ministry is trying to address some of the structural problems that began with the 1990s-era power plants. Officials said in a statement that they have terminated five “redundant” independent power producers that predate CPEC, saving an estimated $210 to $215 million annually, and renegotiated terms with 14 others to save even more per year.

Davide Zoppolato, a researcher affiliated with Mapping Global China, which looks at Beijing’s overseas engagement, sees that 1990s privatization as the prelude to Pakistan’s current woes. China stepped into the policy space already shaped by Western lenders, he noted. In his view, China made a clear choice to profit from a vulnerable system.

“China was there to make money,” he said, adding that it’s not taking responsibility for the fallout.

Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged in 2021 to stop financing new coal abroad, but so far that has not helped Pakistan extract itself from CPEC coal plants.

Zoppolato said China is shifting toward a “small and beautiful” development model after years of frustration with corruption and instability in countries like Pakistan. But whatever the next phase of CPEC looks like, China now dominates both ends of Pakistan’s energy transition. It owns a major slice of the fossil generation fleet and is “almost the sole seller of solar panels” flooding Pakistan’s rooftops, he said.

That combination of long-term fossil contracts and reliance on Chinese solar imports leaves Pakistan more dependent on Beijing than before. “There’s no easy way out,” Zoppolato said.

What strikes Muhammad Tayyab Safdar at the University of Virginia about the CPEC coal plants is how the contracts maximized returns no matter how ill-thought-out any of the projects were. He said it amounts to 17 to 20 percent guaranteed profit rates, which “you wouldn’t get anywhere else in the world.” That means the investors have already recovered most of their investments, he said, even as Pakistan struggles to run the plants.

The Sahiwal coal plant, in his view, is a clear example of bad planning. The decision to build it in the middle of Punjab’s farmland “doesn’t make sense,” he said, but Pakistani officials wanted it near population centers to cut transmission losses.

He doubts Beijing will budge on restructuring or retiring Pakistan’s coal plants. “Why would they?” he asked.

What Was and What Comes Next

In 2022, Asma Rafique was posted in Qadirabad as a veterinarian at a government-run facility. The modest housing came with the job. What she didn’t realize was how difficult it would be to live next to the massive coal-burning power plant that shared a boundary wall with her residential colony.

Imran, her husband and a fellow veterinarian, had just found a job in Oman. Over the next three years, as he tried to find a good place to raise his family, he moved to Ireland and then to Australia, coming home every few months for brief visits.

Sitting in the courtyard of their Qadirabad home as the sun set on one of his final days in the country, Imran felt the weight of his family’s imminent move to Australia. They would escape the plant’s pollution, he said, but what about their neighbors?

“All the people living here, we are a family here. So I think about them as well,” he said. “It’s our collective issue, our national issue, so that should be addressed.”

It was beyond him why government officials approved such costly and dirty operations or why the plants are still running today. “I would tell them that solar and wind will be the cheapest and environment-friendly options. This will be my message for them.”

That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio, on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added, “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular and are doing better and better and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?///

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?///

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion-dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe,” Wakefield said. “They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada.”

American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and … like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV makers’ expansion? ///

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles,” Fiorani said. “And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile. The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers … and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable,” Fiorani added. “It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have.”",https://nsjonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26016745120320.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 08:58:07.304958

He estimated the U.S. put 5.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in the air in 2025, which is 139 million tons more than in 2024.

That included plants using coal, which creates more carbon pollution than other fuel sources.
Solar power generation jumped 34%, pushing it past hydroelectric power, with zero-carbon emitting energy sources now supplying 42% of American power, Rhodium found.","WASHINGTON -- In a reversal from previous years' pollution reductions, the United States spewed 2.4% more heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels in 2025 than in the year before, researchers calculated in a study released Jan. 13.

The increase in greenhouse gas emissions is attributable to a combination of a cool winter, the explosive growth of data centers and cryptocurrency mining, and higher natural gas prices, according to the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. Environmental policy rollbacks by President Donald Trump's administration were not significant factors in the increase because they were only put in place this year, the study authors said. Heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas are the major cause of worsening global warming, scientists say.

American emissions of carbon dioxide and methane had dropped 20% from 2005 to 2024, with a few one- or two-year increases in the overall downward trend. Traditionally, carbon pollution has risen alongside economic growth, but efforts to boost cleaner energy in recent years decoupled the two, so emissions would drop as gross domestic product rose.

But that changed last year with pollution actually growing faster than economic activity, said study co-author Ben King, a director in Rhodium's energy group. He estimated the U.S. put 5.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in the air in 2025, which is 139 million tons more than in 2024.

The cold 2025 winter meant more heating of buildings, which often comes from natural gas and fuel oil that are big greenhouse gas emitters, King said. A significant and noticeable jump in electricity demand from data centers and cryptocurrency mining meant more power plants producing energy. That included plants using coal, which creates more carbon pollution than other fuel sources.

A rise in natural gas prices helped create a 13% increase in coal power, which had shrunk by nearly two-thirds since its peak in 2007, King said.

""It's not like this is a huge rebound,"" King said. ""We're not sitting here claiming that coal is back and going to dominate the sector or anything like that. But we did see this increase and that was a large part of why emissions went up in the power sector.""

King said the list of more than two dozen proposed rollbacks of American environmental policies by the Trump administration hadn't been in place long enough to have an effect in 2025, but may be more noticeable in future years.

""It's one year of data so far,"" King said. ""So we need to see the extent to which this trend sustains.""

Solar power generation jumped 34%, pushing it past hydroelectric power, with zero-carbon emitting energy sources now supplying 42% of American power, Rhodium found. It will be interesting to see what happens as the Trump administration ends solar and wind subsidies and discourages their use, King said.

""The economic case for adding renewables is quite strong still,"" King said. ""This stuff is cost-competitive in a lot of places. Try as they might, this administration can't alter the fundamental economics of this stuff.""

Before the Trump administration took office, the Rhodium team projected that in 2035, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions would have fallen between 38% and 56% compared to 2005 levels, King said. Now, the projected pollution drop is expected to be about one-third less, he calculated.

Others who were not involved in the Rhodium report said last year's increase in emissions is an ominous sign.

""Unfortunately, the 2025 U.S. emission increase is likely a harbinger of what's to come as the U.S. federal leadership continues to make what amounts to a huge unforced economic error by favoring legacy fossil fuels when the rest of the world is going all in on mobility and power generation using low-carbon technology, primarily based on renewables and batteries,"" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck.

Overpeck said that favoring fossil fuels will harm both the U.S. economy and air quality.

Longtime climate change activist Bill McKibben said bluntly: ""It's so incredibly stupid that the U.S. is going backwards on this stuff.""

Exacerbating Global Roadblocks If Iowa isn’t building much wind power, it’s a bad sign for the industry as a whole.","SHENANDOAH, Iowa—First viewed from a pickup truck driving south on U.S. 59, the wind turbines seem small and delicate.

The newly constructed wind farm is a matter of pride for Gregg Connell, the man behind the wheel of the truck. He is a former two-term mayor of this southwestern Iowa city and an official with the local chamber of commerce.

The turbines are “beautiful,” Connell said, looking out the driver’s side window. “You’re capturing energy, you’re helping the environment.”

But the sight of a new wind farm is increasingly rare, even in Iowa, a state that trails only Texas in electricity production from wind.

Wind energy development has all but ground to a halt in the face of community opposition, a phaseout of federal tax credits and the Trump administration’s actions to slow the approval of federal permits.

Some of the administration’s most notable moves on wind power have been attacks on offshore development, including a stop-work order in December that halted construction on five projects. But land-based wind projects—often described in the industry as “onshore wind”—are a much larger contributor to the nation’s electricity supply and are struggling to make even modest gains. Without robust growth in onshore wind, the United States will be severely limited in its ability to build enough power-generation capacity to meet rising demand and combat climate change.

One of Iowa’s few new developments, the Shenandoah Hills Wind Farm, illustrates what it takes to build in the current political and regulatory environment.

The developer, Chicago-based Invenergy, faced years of blowback from residents who raised concerns about damage to the visual landscape along with concerns about potential harm to human and animal health and effects on property values. The opposition campaign dragged on into court cases and led to one county supervisor losing his re-election bid.

Though controversial, Shenandoah Hills still had the advantage of obtaining all of its federal permits before the Trump administration returned to office in January and began using federal agencies to slow or halt new projects.

If the Shenandoah Hills ordeal is what success looks like for the wind industry, then it’s understandable that investors, developers and others see few reasons to pursue new projects.

“U.S. onshore wind is in its weakest shape in about a decade, not because the technology has stopped being competitive, but because the policy and, to an extent, the macro-environment have turned sharply against it,” said Atin Jain, an energy analyst for the research firm BloombergNEF, in an email.

In 2024, the most recent full year for which data is available, wind energy produced 7.7 percent of the nation’s electricity, more than any other renewable source, according to the Energy Information Administration. Since the country has only three operational offshore wind farms, onshore wind accounts for nearly all of this production.

New projects peaked in 2020 when 14,878 megawatts of onshore wind farms came online in the United States, according to the EIA. This number has decreased steadily since then, bottoming out at 5,026 megawatts in 2024.

The industry had a slight rebound in 2025, with 7,804 new megawatts of capacity—including completed projects and those that were projected to be operational by Dec. 31—and will grow more in 2026, with 10,044 megawatts listed by EIA as planned for completion.

After that, things are likely to get much worse. Developers and analysts expect a drop-off in 2027 and beyond, when the current chill in development stemming from the Trump administration’s actions will lead to fewer completed projects.

Meanwhile, electricity demand is soaring as utilities and grid operators determine how to meet the needs of large users such as AI data centers.

There is a disconnect in the market when demand is surging while wind power development is slowing, a situation that bodes poorly for the future of clean energy in the U.S., said Michael Thomas, CEO of Cleanview, a market intelligence platform focused on power plants and data centers.

“The decline in wind energy development is one of the trends that I’m most concerned about when it comes to climate progress in the United States,” Thomas said in an email. “I’m not aware of a single model that shows us meeting our climate targets or avoiding significant warming without a huge buildout out of wind power.”

A City Divided

Connell, 76, parked his truck on the gravel lot that the wind farm’s construction crew has used as a staging ground for the past year. Workers installed the last of 54 turbines in November, bringing the total generating capacity to 214 megawatts.

Acting as a tour guide for two reporters, Connell had spent much of the day discussing his work as mayor and now as executive vice president of the chamber of commerce to attract jobs and investment to Shenandoah.

A city of about 4,900 residents, Shenandoah was the childhood home of the Everly Brothers, the musical duo behind hits such as “Wake Up Little Susie.” The main street has a vitality that many other cities of this size would envy, with a first-run movie theater and a recently renovated mill that now hosts an indoor farmers market.

Still, such vibrance is a challenge to maintain.

The median age in Page County, which includes much of Shenandoah, is 45 years, the 12th highest of Iowa’s 99 counties. To grow and prosper, the community needs to attract new residents, and, to do so, it needs to maintain and expand a tax base that can support schools and government services.

“We need more young people,” Connell said.

The Shenandoah Hills wind farm is one of the largest investments in the county’s history. Payments to landowners and local governments are projected to total $234 million over the life of the project, according to Invenergy.

For context, the Shenandoah school district has an annual budget of $28.4 million, with $6.2 million from local property taxes. The wind farm is expected to generate an additional $1.3 million in property taxes annually for the district, based on a 2022 estimate from a consulting firm on behalf of Invenergy.

Its plans for a wind farm in the area had been underway since the mid-2010s. The company already had the support of landowners willing to lease their property and of government officials who were moving forward with permit approval.

Then, in the late 2010s, something changed. In both Iowa and nationwide, wind energy projects began to face local opposition that was more aggressive and better organized than before.

Some of the shift was due to the boom in wind energy, which had already changed the landscape in parts of Iowa, contributing to backlash from residents who disliked the look of the turbines.

Some of the changing tide was partisan, fueled by the hardening of beliefs that Democrats support renewable energy and Republicans—the large majority in rural Iowa—support fossil fuels. President Donald Trump helped to popularize this view with his use of the unfounded term “wind cancer” and other criticism of wind and solar energy.

The upshot was that the development of Shenandoah Hills turned bitter.

The opposition organized on social media, including a Facebook group, Page County Horizons, which served as a forum to encourage attendance at public meetings and share video clips and articles portraying wind energy as dangerous and unreliable.

Todd Maher, who lives within view of the wind farm, opposed the project and decided in 2022 to run for the county Board of Supervisors because he felt that officials weren’t listening to concerns. He won in the Republican primary, defeating the incumbent, who supported the wind farm, and then ran unopposed in the general election.

“A lot of people want to live where they can see the sunrise and sunset without having to look at a wind turbine,” he said, interviewed on a recent Sunday afternoon.

Legal counsel warned county officials that there was a decent chance of losing in court and then facing a judgement so large that the government might need to file for bankruptcy.

Maher was unwilling to take that risk. In November 2024, he was in the majority in a 2-1 vote to accept a settlement with Invenergy that would allow the project to move forward.

“It was the toughest vote I’ve ever made,” he said. “I lost a lot of friends over it. I lost a lot of people that supported me.”

“Closed for Business”

Iowa, especially its western half, has some of the richest wind resources in the country.

Early developers capitalized on this, with the completion of Storm Lake 1 in northwestern Iowa in 1999, the first wind farm in the state with a capacity exceeding 100 megawatts. By 2010, wind farms were a familiar part of the landscape, with more than 3,500 megawatts of capacity, including some large installations along I-80, the major east-west highway that bisects the state, connecting California to New Jersey.

For years, Iowa’s leadership in wind energy was a point of pride, with the silhouette of a wind turbine appearing on the state’s license plate next to images of city skylines and farm buildings.

Wind power enjoyed bipartisan support in the state, with proponents including Democrats such as former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin and former Gov. Tom Vilsack, and Republicans such as former Gov. Terry Branstad and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley. They viewed wind farms as an opportunity to increase incomes in rural counties.

Their vision paid off. As of 2024, Iowa led the country in the share of electricity produced by wind farms, with 63 percent.

But the era of growth in Iowa’s wind industry is almost certainly nearing its end. Shenandoah Hills was one of just three wind farms to be completed in the state in 2025, and only one was completed in 2024, according to the EIA. The last significant year of development was 2020, when 12 projects went online.

The contraction of the industry is a grave concern for Jeff Danielson, a Democrat who served four terms in the Iowa Senate and now is vice president of advocacy for Clean Grid Alliance, a clean energy business group.

“Iowa is essentially closed for business when it comes to wind development,” he said.

The resistance comes almost entirely from the local level. His organization lists 58 of Iowa’s 99 counties as having rules designed to limit wind power development, including many of the counties with the strongest wind resources.

He described the opposition as formidable in its ability to organize at the local level and then throw out a large number of objections in the hope that one of them will stick. It’s not a fair fight, with one side repeating a litany of claims found on anti-wind websites, and the wind power companies obligated to stick to facts that will stand up in court, said Danielson.

“It’s not even really an adult conversation anymore,” he said.

If Iowa’s legislature and governor wanted to encourage wind energy development, they could pass a law to expand state authority to approve projects, limiting the ability of local governments to pass restrictions. The state has previously done this on hot-button issues such as regulating large animal feeding operations, but there’s little indication they’ll intervene when it comes to wind.

“One thing you find out about legislators is they like local control when they like it, and they don’t always like it,” said Iowa Rep. Brent Siegrist, a Republican whose district is a short drive from Shenandoah.

Siegrist supports wind energy and thinks it is important for making Iowa an attractive location for providing plentiful, affordable electricity for data centers. But he doesn’t expect any push at the state level to make it easier to build wind farms. Republicans control both chambers of the legislature and the governor’s office.

“I’m not sure that we would step into that,” he said.

Exacerbating Global Roadblocks

If Iowa isn’t building much wind power, it’s a bad sign for the industry as a whole.

But local opposition in rural areas is just one of several obstacles for wind developers.

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July included a rapid phaseout of the production tax credit, an important federal policy that had helped to encourage development.

Developers are now on a tight deadline. Projects must be completed by the end of 2027 or begin construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the tax credit.

Amidst the rush to begin construction, the Trump administration has issued executive orders to slow development of wind and solar. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has taken additional steps, requiring that he personally sign off on new wind or solar projects subject to his agency’s jurisdiction.

Jain, the BloombergNEF analyst, said the global wind energy market faces challenges tied to local acceptance and slow progress in building enough power lines to serve new projects.

The United States deals with those same problems, as well as the obstacles created by its federal policies.

The U.S. outlook, Jain said, “now looks so much weaker than the global picture.”

Uncertain Ground

In Shenandoah, the wind farm is up and running but the debate over its approval has left scars.

In February 2025, Invenergy sold the project to MidAmerican Energy, Iowa’s largest electricity utility. Invenergy quietly walked away from the wind farm while MidAmerican inherited a community relations crisis.

MidAmerican has attempted to smooth things over, hosting events for landowners and community members and meeting with supervisors and engineers of Page and Fremont counties.

Outside of the two counties, MidAmerican’s publicity for the wind farm has been scant. However, in recent correspondence with Inside Climate News, the company expressed no regrets over its decision to take on the project.

“The Shenandoah Hills wind farm is an economic success story for both Page and Fremont counties,” Geoff Greenwood, media relations manager for MidAmerican, wrote in an email. The company projects paying nearly $87 million to Fremont County and $65 million to Page County in property taxes over the life of the project, said Greenwood.

“Wind energy has helped us create relationships with partner landowners and helps Iowa attract new companies to the state. It also provides direct, long-term economic benefits to our rural areas,” Greenwood added.

But as the very last turbines were erected outside Shenandoah, the atmosphere hardly felt triumphant.

The closest thing to a celebration was a ribbon-cutting held in September 2024 when Invenergy opened an office in downtown Shenandoah to manage the construction and community relations.

Connell, who has been unabashed in his support for the project since the beginning, was one of the people holding the ribbon. But his words that day didn’t feel like a victory lap.

“This has been a difficult project,” he said, quoted by KMA, the local radio station. “There are people that oppose wind, and there are people for wind. But I admire the fact that Invenergy, in my estimation, has taken the high ground on everything.”

The office closed a few months later, around the time of the sale to MidAmerican.

Maher, the county supervisor, wishes the wind farm had never happened. But since it’s here, he is hopeful that he and his neighbors can learn to live with the change.

No big countdowns, no dramatic switches being flipped overnight. But behind the scenes, something important is building momentum.

Energy experts say the way the world produces electricity is shifting again — and this time, the change isn’t loud. It’s steady, spread out, and already taking shape in places you might not expect.

Solar and wind continue to dominate global power growth

Over the past few years, wind and solar have become the backbone of new electricity generation worldwide. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable energy is expected to provide around 36% of global electricity in 2026, making it the single largest power source.

Solar power remains the biggest driver of this growth. While experts say expansion may slow slightly in 2026, it is far from stopping. The IEA estimates that global solar capacity will still grow by about 540 gigawatts, even after record-breaking growth in previous years.

Some of the slowdown is linked to policy changes, supply chain issues, grid limits, and stronger industrial competition. Still, analysts expect growth to pick up again in 2027 — especially with many large projects already prepared to go live.

A quiet shift begins in an unexpected place

This is where the story becomes more concrete.

When people think of Michigan, solar energy is rarely the first thing that comes to mind. The state is better known for cars than clean power. But that image is starting to change.

Earlier this year, a major new solar project began operating in Muskegon County, turning a former industrial site into a new energy hub. The project was developed by Consumers Energy, which says it represents the future of Michigan’s power grid.

A new high-voltage transmission line, nearly 0.75 miles long, now connects the site to existing infrastructure — allowing large amounts of clean electricity to flow directly into the grid.

Half a million panels, built to follow the sun

The Muskegon Solar Plant is a 250-megawatt project spread across 1,900 acres. Once fully running, it will use up to 500,000 sun-tracking solar panels, arranged in long rows across the site.

Unlike traditional fixed panels, these panels move with the sun throughout the day. This simple motion helps them capture more light, boost efficiency, and increase total power output.

The result is significant: the plant is expected to generate enough electricity to power nearly 40,000 homes in Michigan.

Project partners say the site shows what happens when local expertise, modern technology, and long-term planning come together. Beyond clean power, the project also strengthens regional energy security and reduces dependence on older systems.

While solar growth may slow slightly this year, projects like Muskegon show the bigger picture. Solar isn’t fading — it’s spreading, adapting, and quietly becoming a central part of how electricity is made.

And as more plants like this come online around the world, 2026 may be remembered as the year solar power truly stepped into the spotlight.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/7.-Energies-Media-Up-to-500000-sun-tracking-panels-to-power-40000-homes-—-Michigan-s-Muskegon-Solar-Plant-begins-operations.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 14:58:47.821036

LFP chemistry has now become the dominant technology in the country’s EV ecosystem, moving beyond mass-market models and gaining acceptance even in higher-end vehicles.

LFP batteries become the mainstream choice

Several Chinese carmakers have increasingly aligned their product strategies around LFP batteries. Manufacturers that once depended on nickel manganese cobalt chemistry have either expanded their LFP offerings or redesigned their portfolios entirely. Advances in battery design and manufacturing have helped LFP cells address earlier concerns around energy density, while offering cost stability and durability.

This transition is reflected clearly in production data. In 2025, LFP batteries accounted for 625.3 GWh, representing more than 81 per cent of China’s total EV battery output. This marked a year-on-year increase of over 50 per cent. In contrast, NMC batteries contributed 144.1 GWh, or under 19 per cent of the market, with growth remaining marginal. The figures underline a steady decline in the relevance of NMC chemistry within China’s fast-growing EV sector.

Production momentum stays strong through the year

Battery production in 2025 exceeded the previous year’s levels in every month, despite seasonal slowdowns linked to the Chinese New Year. December emerged as a high point, with output reaching close to 100 GWh. LFP batteries continued to dominate monthly volumes, while NMC production showed limited movement compared to previous years.

CATL and BYD drive market concentration

Two manufacturers continue to anchor the market. CATL retained its leadership with over 333 GWh of EV battery production, giving it more than 43 per cent market share. BYD followed with nearly 166 GWh and over 21 per cent share. Although several other battery makers increased their presence, their combined impact remains limited, with most holding single-digit shares.

CATL’s position is particularly strong in the NMC segment, where it controls over two-thirds of total output. In LFP batteries, CATL also leads, though the gap with BYD is narrower. Other players such as Gotion High-Tech and CALB remain some distance behind, reinforcing the concentration at the top of China’s EV battery manufacturing sector.

The result would be damaging for Texas oil and gas production, the backbone of the state's economy, some experts argued.
And parts of Texas, such as the Permian Basin, where city and county governments rely on oil and gas, stand to lose revenue as a result.
Texas Oil and Gas Association President Todd Staples said in a statement that the current conditions don't spell serious trouble for the industry.
""The Texas oil and natural gas industry has a long history of delivering essential products while navigating price volatility,"" Staples said.","After covid-19 tanked oil prices, Texas' oil and gas industry rebounded.

By 2024, operators were drilling record amounts of oil. Each barrel sold for at least $70, bringing profits and momentum that enriched the state's coffers, school districts and local government budgets with billions in tax revenue.

Now, President Donald Trump's pledge to bring oil prices down to $50 a barrel could decimate that momentum, making trouble -- even if temporarily -- for the Lone Star State.

Trump, who suggested the U.S. should take control of Venezuela's oil after the country arrested President Nicolás Maduro, could certainly deliver on his promise to lower fuel costs for consumers by flooding the market with the South American country's oil.

The result would be damaging for Texas oil and gas production, the backbone of the state's economy, some experts argued. Operators will find it harder to break even on costs -- much less profit -- resulting in dwindling production for the industry's estimated 495,000 Texas employees. And parts of Texas, such as the Permian Basin, where city and county governments rely on oil and gas, stand to lose revenue as a result.

Tom Manskey, director of economic development for Odessa, said prices that low, while beneficial at the gas pump, could injure the regional economy. In Odessa, a city of about 120,000, oil and gas is the dominant employer, he said.

""I would imagine it would have a negative effect on our region with regards to jobs and everything else,"" Manskey said. ""We're in a very unpredictable economic time, and I think that's just adding to it. There's no predictability right now in the marketplace.""

Ray Perryman, an economist and founder of the Perryman Group, which conducts economic analyses across several Texas industries, suggested that if the price per barrel drops to $50, it would cause trouble and major market shifts with short and long-term impacts. Oil companies would change their practices and limit how much new oil is entering the marketplace, eventually driving the cost back up to make a profit, creating a volatile and unpredictable economic environment.

""If oil prices were to drop to $50 per barrel, the short-term effects are likely to be somewhat positive for many segments of the U.S. economy, but there would clearly be winners and losers,"" Perryman said.

""In an area such as the Permian Basin, reducing activity in the oil and gas industry has substantial ripple effects on housing, retail in other areas,"" Perryman said. ""Because economic activity leads to tax receipts, an inevitable outcome is lower tax revenue to local entities.""

Other oil and gas industry leaders were bullish on the economy. While production will take a hit, existing drilling techniques will help operators continue to access an abundance of oil, said Ed Longanecker, president of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, an industry trade group. Horizontal drilling, for instance, allows operators to access larger reservoirs of hydrocarbons, reducing the need to drill new wells.

""A slight decline in production in 2026 would modestly pressure (state and local) budgets, but Texas'srobust economy and drilling efficiencies would help to mitigate statewide impacts,"" Longanecker said.

Texas Oil and Gas Association President Todd Staples said in a statement that the current conditions don't spell serious trouble for the industry.

""The Texas oil and natural gas industry has a long history of delivering essential products while navigating price volatility,"" Staples said. ""What we're seeing today reflects market adjustment rather than distress, recognizing that companies are necessarily adapting to current and forecasted market conditions.""

Staples said efficiency and innovation allow Texas producers to remain competitive into the future.

In Texas, it takes at least $62 per barrel to cover the cost of drilling more oil and gas wells and still make money.

Anything below that that price, operators will make little -- if any -- money from their wells, said Dane Gregoris, managing director of Enverus, an energy analytics firm. And shareholders who have been pushing oil companies to become profitable would not see their demands met.

Despite Trump's promise to ""drill, baby, drill"" oil and gas production in Texas between December 2024 and October 2025 remained relatively flat, at 5.8 million barrels per day. The number of drilling rigs, which indicate whether there is an appetite to extract more oil and gas, also declined. Texas has lost 20 rigs since Trump took office, according to the company's data.

""These companies would be in survival mode rather than thriving in this environment,"" Gregoris said. ""At $50 (a barrel), things look pretty dire, and then at $40, you're looking at big cuts to capital budgets, likely big declines in crude oil production in the US, and a significant amount of sort of cash flow negative producers out there, which usually spells trouble for foreign investors in the space.""

Declining production could have damaging effects on regional economies that rely on the industry for its revenue and workforce. Companies, for instance, could lay off more workers who are a key tax base for Odessa, said Renee Earls, president and chief executive of the city's Chamber of Commerce. If those workers spend less, the local economy slows.

""We're all in the oil business, regardless of whether we work at a restaurant, in a chamber, or in a bank,"" she said. ""We've learned to always prefer stability.""

Earls, who has witnessed many booms and busts in West Texas, said she'd really start to panic if oil dropped to $40 a barrel.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/teaser_images/www.nwaonline.com_default.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 04:58:14.693921

Issued pursuant to Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, the order authorizes PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) to run specified resources located within the PJM Region, regardless of limits established by environmental permits or state law. The order will help PJM with the extreme temperatures and storm destruction across the Mid-Atlantic and reduce costs for Americans during the winter storm.

“As Winter Storm Fern brings extreme cold and dangerous conditions to the Mid-Atlantic, maintaining affordable, reliable, and secure power in the PJM region is non-negotiable,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “The previous administration’s energy subtraction policies weakened the grid, leaving Americans more vulnerable during events like Winter Storm Fern. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are reversing those failures and using every available tool to keep the lights on and Americans safe through this storm.”

On day one, President Trump declared a national energy emergency after the Biden administration’s energy subtraction agenda left behind a grid increasingly vulnerable to blackouts. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), “Winter electricity demand is rising at the fastest rate in recent years,” while the premature forced closure of reliable generation such as coal and natural gas plants leaves American families vulnerable to power outages. The NERC 2025 – 2026 Winter Reliability Assessment further warns that areas across the continental United States have an elevated risk of blackouts during extreme weather conditions.

Power outages cost the American people $44 billion per year, according to data from DOE’s National Laboratories. This order will help mitigate power outages in the Mid-Atlantic and highlights the commonsense policies of the Trump Administration to ensure Americans have access to affordable, reliable and secure electricity.

The order is in effect from January 25—January 31, 2026.

BACKGROUND

Orders such as this are in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency and will ensure the availability of generation needed to meet high electricity demand and mitigate the risk of blackouts.

“Wisconsin finds itself at the center of a national debate surrounding data center development,” the Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin (CECW) said in a statement announcing the framework Friday.
The coalition is worried data center development will lead to delays in shutting down coal-fired power plants and potentially spur investment in other fossil-fuel-powered energy infrastructure.
She also called data center regulation “one of the most important issues” currently before the Legislature.
The coalition is asking for the state to put the brakes on further data center development until a comprehensive framework is adopted.","A large coalition of environmental organizations in Wisconsin is calling for a pause on data center development until plans are in place for protecting climate goals, energy infrastructure and energy ratepayers.

“Wisconsin finds itself at the center of a national debate surrounding data center development,” the Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin (CECW) said in a statement announcing the framework Friday. “Too often, this discussion suggests the state only has the ability to choose between prioritizing economic growth or meeting our state’s clean energy and climate goals.”

The coalition includes dozens of major nonprofits and advocacy organizations from across the state interested in protecting the environment, advancing a clean economy and addressing climate change.

The coalition has drafted a proposed framework for regulating large-scale economic development projects, with particular focus on data centers. The organizations are calling on the governor and the Legislature to work with local communities and state agencies to adopt the framework.

The groups see data center development moving too quickly and at an unprecedented scale, with the energy needs of planned data centers expected to quickly outstrip the energy consumption of all the residential consumers in the state. The coalition is worried data center development will lead to delays in shutting down coal-fired power plants and potentially spur investment in other fossil-fuel-powered energy infrastructure. They are also concerned about the impact rapid data center development will have on the state’s energy grid, the cost residents pay for utilities and the environment.

“By placing Wisconsin’s clean energy and climate commitments at the center of planning, Wisconsin’s leaders can steer data center development in a way that prioritizes energy affordability, safeguards public health, and upholds our clean energy and climate commitments,” the coalition said.

To protect these priorities, the framework includes 10 general policy solutions for state government to work toward:

Ensure lower costs for ratepayers

Lead with 100% clean energy

Maximize investment in an array of non-fossil-fuel energy sources to meet demand

Plan for future energy infrastructure needs

Ensure prevailing wage and labor standards for the workforce involved in data center development

Negotiate community benefits agreements between tech companies and local communities

Engage local communities

Protect taxpayers through responsible use of public funding for economic incentives

Minimize water use and protect local natural resources

Create consistent reporting requirements for environmental impact and energy use

The proposed framework stands in contrast to Republican-backed legislation that recently passed the Assembly. The bill would direct the Public Service Commission to ensure residential ratepayers are not covering the cost to construct or expand energy infrastructure for data centers, and requires them to recycle water used to cool servers. But critics point out that it does little to ensure data centers don’t drive further reliance on fossil fuels.

The bill requires renewable energy generation to occur on the property of any new data center. Democratic lawmakers who opposed the bill said the renewables provision locks data centers into fossil-fuel-generated power and makes it harder to add more renewable energy to the grid.

Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the provision prevents people who “don’t want to live across from a solar field” from paying for somebody else’s power needs.

State Rep. Robyn Vining said the legislation was “rushed” and fails to protect residents from rising energy costs. She also called data center regulation “one of the most important issues” currently before the Legislature.

The coalition is asking for the state to put the brakes on further data center development until a comprehensive framework is adopted.

“While we recognize the immediate and time-sensitive factors driving data center developments, we urge state leaders to take a holistic, forward-looking approach – one that balances speed-to-market timelines with long-term sustainability, affordability, and reliability practices,” the coalition said.",https://urbanmilwaukee.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-from-rawpixel-id-9648108-original-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 06:58:55.948829

Legal Battles and Uncertainty for Offshore Wind The year closed with a dramatic intervention in offshore wind.
Projects affected included Revolution Wind, Empire, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Sunrise Wind, and Vineyard Wind.","“Drill, baby, drill” — the rallying cry of his first campaign — returned with Donald Trump as he took office again in January 2025. From the very start, the president made it clear that renewable energy would take a back seat to fossil fuels. In his inauguration speech, Trump rejected the Green New Deal, vowed to roll back electric vehicle mandates, and promised a renewed push for oil, gas, and coal, framing it as the key to lowering energy costs and restoring American energy independence.

Fossil Fuels Take Center Stage

Within his first 45 days, Trump declared a national energy emergency, expedited permits for oil and gas projects, and suspended permits for new offshore wind farms. Biden-era regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions were revoked, and the United States formally withdrew from the Paris Agreement. Federal restrictions on drilling in Alaska were lifted, and more than 625 million acres of offshore waters were reopened to oil and gas exploration.

Shortly after returning to the White House for a second term, Trump once again ordered the United States to exit the Paris Agreement, the international pact aimed at coordinating global action against climate change. Recently, the administration went even further, severing ties with broader international climate efforts by withdrawing the country from key global bodies, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), effectively cutting off U.S. participation in multilateral climate governance.

While fossil fuels gained momentum, renewables began to face mounting obstacles. In April, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered a halt to construction at the Empire Wind 1 offshore project, citing the need for a new environmental review. In August, the administration imposed a 50% tariff on imported wind turbines and parts, dramatically increasing costs for projects in development. Just days afterward, work on the Revolution Wind offshore project was suspended despite being over 80% complete. Once operational, it would have delivered enough clean energy for more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Renewables Under Pressure, Solar Still Grows

Federal funding was also redirected away from wind energy. In September, $679 million previously allocated to twelve offshore wind projects was withdrawn or canceled, with officials citing the need to strengthen the nation’s maritime industry and core infrastructure.

Meanwhile, coal and nuclear power were elevated as policy priorities. DOE approved a $1 billion loan to restart a nuclear plant, launched programs to extract critical minerals from coal waste, and invested $800 million in small modular reactors. By January 2026, the administration claimed to have prevented the closure of more than 17 GW of coal-fired capacity and announced a $2.7 billion investment to expand domestic uranium enrichment.

Even as federal policy favored fossil fuels, U.S. solar manufacturing boomed. By October, 65 new or expanded solar and storage facilities had begun operating, bringing $4.5 billion in private investment. Domestic capacity for solar modules surpassed 60 GW, solar cell production more than tripled, and battery storage reached 21 GWh — enough to power the city of Houston overnight. Yet industry leaders warned that federal tariffs and regulatory uncertainty threatened more than 100 planned factories and $31 billion in investment.

Legal Battles and Uncertainty for Offshore Wind

The year closed with a dramatic intervention in offshore wind. On December 22, the Department of Interior issued stop-work orders for all five major projects under construction, citing national security concerns in a classified report. Projects affected included Revolution Wind, Empire, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Sunrise Wind, and Vineyard Wind. Courts quickly intervened, granting preliminary injunctions that allowed some projects to resume, but the episode underscored the legal and political uncertainty now surrounding the U.S. offshore wind sector.

By the end of 2025, the contrast was stark. Fossil fuels and nuclear power were elevated as pillars of national energy policy, receiving loans, regulatory support, and federal investment. Renewable energy, meanwhile, faced suspensions, tariffs, funding withdrawals, and regulatory scrutiny that slowed deployment and increased uncertainty. Even as U.S. solar manufacturing expanded at record pace, the policy environment threatened to undercut that growth and shift investment overseas.",https://www.review-energy.com/fileuploads/news/review-energy-noticias-1-copia17691799041.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 04:58:05.785555

Drivers will still be able to access features such as Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, which maintains the vehicle at a set speed and follows traffic at a safe distance. However, as Electrek notes, drivers will lose free access to Autosteer, which keeps the vehicle centered in its lane and helps it navigate curves, unless thy pay for an FSD subscription.

Until Feb. 14, drivers can purchase FSD as a one-time $8,000 upgrade, which in theory grants lifetime access to the software. FSD also offers more advanced functionality than Autopilot, including support for urban environments like city streets and tasks such as lane changes and parking. It uses more cameras, sensor data, and computing power than Autopilot.

Paying $8,000 for lifetime access may not initially seem appealing, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said prices for the subscription are likely to rise as FSD's capabilities advance.

Tesla did not announce why it chose to remove Autopilot, but the move comes amid the threat of a potential ban in California, as well as a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigation into the feature.

In December, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles threatened Tesla with a 30-day sales suspension in the state if it failed to stop using the terms “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” in its marketing, arguing they were misleading and violated state law. Tesla was given a 60-day deadline to take action before the suspension would take effect.

Autopilot has also been the focus of several costly lawsuits for Tesla. In August 2025, the EV maker was found liable for $249 million in damages after a Florida court ruled that Autopilot was partially responsible for the death of a young woman in Key Largo, Florida, though Tesla is set to fight the decision.

After withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement for a second time last year and declining to send a delegation to the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil, the U.S. administration announced earlier this month its intention to exit the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change -- delivering yet another blow to global climate governance.

By contrast, defying global headwinds, China has accelerated its green, low-carbon transition, putting in place the world's most complete policy system on reducing carbon emissions and building the world's largest renewable energy system.

As a global leader in renewable energy, China's green production capacity not only enriches its own energy supply, but also creates broad opportunities for Global South countries to achieve low-carbon, leapfrog development, helping build a clean and beautiful world.

REMARKABLE STRIDES

In China, the world's largest electricity consumer, one in every three kilowatt-hours of electricity comes from green energy sources, powering daily life, while reshaping the national and global energy and industrial landscapes, according to the National Energy Administration (NEA).

China has ranked first worldwide in installed wind power capacity for 15 consecutive years. By November 2025, its total installed capacity had exceeded 600 million kilowatts (kW), far exceeding that of any other nation, official data show.

With vast onshore wind farms across its northern and western regions and rapidly expanding offshore projects along the eastern coastline, China's wind energy not only provides clean electricity to millions of households but also plays a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions.

Northwestern Chinese regions like Qinghai, Xinjiang and Ningxia have turned their sunbaked, wind-swept deserts into treasure troves of green power through large-scale solar development, while coastal provinces like Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shandong are scaling up offshore wind power clusters to meet high electricity demand.

China's total installed power-generating capacity reached 3.79 billion kW by the end of November 2025, marking a 17.1 percent year-on-year increase, according to the NEA. Solar power capacity led the growth with a 41.9-percent year-on-year surge to 1.16 billion kW, while wind power capacity expanded by 22.4 percent to 600 million kW.

Yao Shangheng, a researcher at the Energy Development Research Institute under China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd., said that China has built the world's largest and most integrated renewable energy system, with complete industrial chains.

Its outputs of PV polysilicon, wafers and cells account for 90 percent of the global total, with its module outputs accounting for about 85 percent of the global total.

China is also spearheading cutting-edge technology. Recently, a Shanghai start-up announced a breakthrough in creating sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).

Using high-performance catalysts, the method converts carbon dioxide and green hydrogen produced from water electrolysis into liquid fuels, primarily hydrocarbons.

Song Xuefeng, the project's manager and vice president of Shanghai Airport (Group) Co., Ltd., said the one-stop synthesis process consumes less energy than alternatives. ""Electrolysis can tap low-cost wind and solar power in northwest China to yield high-value, storable and transportable clean fuels,"" he said.

COMMENDABLE CONTRIBUTIONS

""Two years ago, there was nothing here but barren hills and the wind blowing dust everywhere,"" recalled Sarvan Gahramanov, a civil engineer with PowerChina Huadong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC).

Standing at the booster substation of a new wind farm in eastern Azerbaijan, he looked up toward the ridgeline -- one now dotted with towering white wind turbines.

As one of local engineers engaged in the site's transformation, Gahramanov has witnessed every stage of the 240-megawatt Khizi-Absheron Wind Power Plant's construction. The Chinese-built project's commissioning was described by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev as a milestone in the energy sector of Azerbaijan, a nation targeting a 30 percent share of renewable capacity by 2030.

This is only one example of how China has shared its green achievements beyond its borders. During the 2021-2025 period, the wind power and photovoltaic products China exported helped reduce around 4.1 billion tons of carbon emissions in other countries, official data show.

China's new energy products and technologies, which are of high quality and affordable, meet the urgent need of developing countries for sustainable and affordable energy, offering a viable alternative to fossil fuels and paving a new path towards green development.

In Jordan, the country's cooperation with China on green energy is helping Jordan's Economic Modernization Vision for 2023-2033, which aims to spur growth, create jobs and reduce reliance on imported energy.

Firas Blasmeh, a member of the Jordanian energy and environment association, said Chinese firms are increasingly active across the sector, from renewable power projects to equipment supply and electric transport.

""They combine technical expertise with flexible financing and fast execution,"" Blasmeh said.

Thong Mengdavid, deputy director of the China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Studies Center of the Cambodia University of Technology and Science, said that the renewable energy equipment produced by China has driven down costs for solar, wind and battery technologies sharply over the past decade.

""It is also helping ASEAN expand renewable power generation, smart grid integration and electric mobility infrastructure. Such cooperation supports ASEAN's commitments under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while positioning the region to benefit from the global transition to a low-carbon economy,"" Mengdavid said.

Georg Pflomm, the project manager at the Competence Center for Energy, Environment and Sustainable Economy of AHK Services Eastern Africa Ltd., said that Chinese-manufactured solar products have boosted energy diversification and security on a continent keen to advance low-carbon growth.

Across the globe, models such as ""photovoltaics plus agriculture"" and ""small hydropower plus aquaculture"" have alleviated the problem of insufficient electricity in rural Africa, and also improved people's livelihoods.

The U.S. academic journal Science named the renewable energy surge as the 2025 Breakthrough of the Year, noting that China's mighty industrial engine is the driver.

Quoting the Britain-based Carbon Brief, it said solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles and wind turbines exported from China in 2024 are set to cut annual CO2 emissions in the rest of the world by 1 percent.

Official data showed that during the 2021-2025 period, wind power and photovoltaic products China exported helped reduce around 4.1 billion tons of carbon emissions in other countries.

Also, Chinese firms have pledged roughly 200 billion U.S. dollars in overseas clean energy investments since 2022, reported The Wired in December, saying that this is ""beginning to narrow the gap in funding needed to slash the world's climate pollution.""

Maroun Kairouz, managing director of the World Economic Forum (WEF), told Xinhua recently that China's massive investment in advanced manufacturing and green technology demonstrates how innovation can be deployed at scale.

""China's strengths in green technology and advanced manufacturing play a vital role in addressing the dual challenges of climate change and supply chain instability,"" he said.

""China's principle of integrating industrial, digital, and climate strategies with skills development offers valuable lessons for other emerging markets,"" he said.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2026/2026-01-20/99e83a2e-a118-4444-834b-b86e6655ac11.jpeg,N,,2026-01-25 00:58:04.398427

RESTORING AMERICA: WELL-TRAINED MIND GOES WOKE FirstNet was created as an investment in the future of public safety communications.
Recognizing this evolved mission, first responders would benefit if FirstNet empowered interoperability across various public safety networks rather than focusing solely on one.
Congress should also examine the need to expand competition in public safety communications and direct agencies across the federal government to do the same.","This challenge is magnified by a foundational dynamic of the program: The “FirstNet network” is entirely owned and operated by a single telecommunications provider, AT&T. Given the magnitude of the scale and complexity of the public safety challenges facing our first responders, consolidating this risk with one provider could result in the network’s failure when police officers, firefighters and other emergency response personnel need it the most to save lives. As we have seen several times in recent years, most recently earlier this month, even the most sophisticated wireless providers can experience service disruptions.

The renewal of FirstNet should not simply be a reaffirmation of the importance of interoperable new generation communications for first responders. That debate has been settled. It must embrace a reality that public safety professionals know all too well: no matter how rugged the network, there is always a risk of failure. This includes A&T’s FirstNet network, as documented by several significant inspector general reports. Congress has a unique opportunity to consider changing technological landscapes and confront a critical question: In an era of increasing technological complexity, do we really want to put all our public safety eggs in one basket? Absolutely not. The threats we face continue to evolve, and the way we approach those threats must, too.

A natural disaster, a large-scale cyberattack, or even a local network outage could sever the capabilities of a single network, turning a lifesaving tool into a useless piece of hardware. We don’t have to wonder about these scenarios; we have evidence of the challenges posed by a single point of failure in AT&T’s FirstNet network.

A Commerce Department inspector general report evaluating the 2023 Maui wildfires found that the “FirstNet Authority did not ensure that timely, adequate [communications] services were provided to support public safety’s response to the wildfires.” As an example, the report noted that AT&T took up to 11 days to restore service at affected cell sites; even then, “issues with connectivity and communication hampered first responders’ ability to provide their services.”

The Nashville Christmas bombing in 2020 provides another instance of FirstNet falling short. The Commerce Department inspector general found that the National Guard requested a deployable for a network outage during the bombing, but it “was defective and it was no longer needed by the time it was repaired.” Notably, the bombing occurred in front of a central building housing AT&T equipment, taking out all customer and public safety services at the same time — further illustrating the inherent risks associated with excessive reliance on a single network provider.

Resilience is now the ultimate measure of preparedness. After the disruptions of the pandemic, supply chains have shifted away from a sole focus on efficiency to a new emphasis on resilience. Major companies no longer rely on a single overseas manufacturer for a critical component, instead opting for “dual-sourcing” or “multi-sourcing” from geographically diverse locations.

The principles of resilience and redundancy must guide the FirstNet reauthorization debate. As the former acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, I know how important it is for preparedness policy to move beyond the post-9/11 single-network paradigm and build public safety infrastructure that mirrors the redundancy and resilience we demand of other critical systems.

RESTORING AMERICA: WELL-TRAINED MIND GOES WOKE

FirstNet was created as an investment in the future of public safety communications. As Congress weighs reauthorization, it should consider how that investment can be better utilized to meet the evolving needs of first responders and how it can fully leverage a more reliable and resilient multi-provider ecosystem. Recognizing this evolved mission, first responders would benefit if FirstNet empowered interoperability across various public safety networks rather than focusing solely on one. Congress should also examine the need to expand competition in public safety communications and direct agencies across the federal government to do the same.

Given the vast public safety challenges facing our nation — including natural disasters, terrorist threats, cyber events, lone wolf actors, as well as sophisticated criminal networks — complacency is not an option. We should always be asking how we can meet the emergency response needs of today and working to prevent the threats of tomorrow. Our first responders, and the people they protect, deserve nothing less.

Chad F. Wolf served as acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the third-largest federal department in the U.S. government, under President Donald Trump’s first term. He has over 25 years of government and public policy experience, having served in two presidential administrations, on Capitol Hill, and in the private sector.

The Trump Administration has been looking for ways to cancel billions of dollars of commitments to clean energy projects, including solar, wind, and EV production. Hundreds of projects worth dozens of billions have been terminated since President Donald Trump took office a year ago.

In the year since Inauguration Day, the Trump Administration has made abundantly clear that it will back fossil fuels and gas for affordable and reliable energy and will look to degrade solar and wind as contributors to meeting America’s surging power demand—the highest demand growth since the 1990s, due to AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing.

Earlier this month, the Trump Administration gave the latest signal that it prefers natural gas, coal, and nuclear power to provide the bulk of new generation supporting the data center build-out.

Energy Secretary Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and the bipartisan group of governors of all 13 states served by PJM Interconnection issued a so-called Statement of Principles urging the biggest U.S. power grid operator to hold a capacity auction, in which leading technology companies have committed to funding this new generation capacity.

Coal, natural gas, and nuclear will be the pillars of the new U.S. power capacity, providing reliable baseload, and ending years of “misguided policies” that favored intermittent energy resources such as solar and wind power, the U.S. Administration said.

Following the call on PJM for a capacity auction, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) said in an analysis that without timely deployment of significant new clean energy resources, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states “face serious reliability risks and dramatically higher electricity costs over the next decade.”

The mismatch between immediate demand growth and the lead time of new conventional generation means that, without new clean energy development, ratepayers across nine PJM states would pay an additional $360 billion over the next ten years, driven primarily by higher wholesale electricity prices. The average residential household would see $3,000 to $8,500 in additional electricity costs over the next decade, ACP estimates.

“To keep the lights on and power economic growth, PJM needs resources that can be built quickly, operate reliably, and protect customers from surprises on their electric bills,” said John Hensley, Senior Vice President of Markets and Policy Analysis at ACP.

The Trump Administration has been actively overhauling, restructuring, and rescinding billions of dollars in clean energy loans and funding commitments established during the Biden era. This shift marks a renewed focus on supporting fossil fuels and nuclear energy as part of the nation’s energy dominance strategy.

In a recent move, the Department of Energy revealed that the Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF)—formerly known as the Loan Programs Office—will be modifying, reviewing, or canceling over $83 billion in what it described as “Green New Scam” loans and conditional agreements from the previous administration’s portfolio.

According to the Department of Energy, EDF has spent the past year evaluating each recipient to ensure that taxpayer funds are invested wisely and align with the current administration’s priorities.

The EDF is now being restructured to better manage public funds and to promote financing for projects that deliver affordable, dependable, and secure American energy.

For the Trump Administration, these priorities translate to supporting fossil fuels and nuclear power, while excluding solar and wind initiatives from their definition of reliable energy.

The Department of Energy noted that the Biden Administration had previously approved over $104 billion in energy financing, with $85 billion of that amount finalized or committed between the 2024 election and the 2025 inauguration.

Related: Azerbaijan Commits to Supplying More Gas to Europe Amid Production Challenges

Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated, “We discovered that more funds were distributed by the Loan Programs Office in the final months of the Biden Administration than had been allocated in the previous fifteen years.”

Out of the $104 billion in principal loan obligations from the Biden era, EDF has already rescinded or is in the process of rescinding over $29.9 billion (about 29%), and is revising another $53.6 billion (roughly 51%) of the total.

Additionally, EDF has canceled approximately $9.5 billion in government-backed wind and solar projects, opting instead—where feasible—to replace them with natural gas and nuclear upgrades that are considered more cost-effective and reliable.

Currently, the EDF has more than $289 billion in available loan authority. With the office’s new direction, EDF will now support six key sectors: nuclear energy; coal, oil, gas, and hydrocarbons; critical materials and minerals; geothermal energy; grid and transmission infrastructure; and manufacturing and transportation.

Ongoing Rollback of Clean Energy Support

The continued reversal of Biden-era clean energy funding comes as no surprise. The Trump Administration has been seeking ways to revoke billions in commitments to renewable energy projects, including those for solar, wind, and electric vehicle manufacturing. Since President Trump took office a year ago, hundreds of projects valued at tens of billions have been terminated.

Over the past year, the administration has made it clear that its energy policy will prioritize fossil fuels and natural gas to ensure affordable and reliable power, while reducing the role of solar and wind in meeting the nation’s rapidly growing electricity demand—driven by AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing, resulting in the highest demand growth since the 1990s.

Earlier this month, the administration signaled its intention to rely on natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy to supply the majority of new power generation needed for the expanding data center sector.

Energy Secretary Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and a bipartisan coalition of governors from all 13 states served by PJM Interconnection released a Statement of Principles urging the nation’s largest grid operator to conduct a capacity auction, with leading tech companies pledging to invest in new generation capacity.

The administration asserts that coal, natural gas, and nuclear power will form the backbone of America’s future energy supply, providing stable baseload power and ending what it calls years of “misguided policies” that favored intermittent sources like solar and wind.

Following this call, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) warned that without significant new clean energy projects, states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest could face major reliability issues and much higher electricity costs over the next decade.

ACP estimates that the gap between surging demand and the time required to build new conventional power plants could lead to an extra $360 billion in costs for ratepayers across nine PJM states over the next ten years, mostly due to increased wholesale electricity prices. The average household could see their electricity bills rise by $3,000 to $8,500 during that period.

John Hensley, Senior Vice President of Markets and Policy Analysis at ACP, stated, “To ensure reliable power and support economic growth, PJM needs resources that can be deployed quickly, operate consistently, and shield customers from unexpected costs.”

The Climate and Clean Energy Equity Fund (Equity Fund) is a trusted and strategic collaborative funder and movement-builder whose focus is to lift up the leadership and organizing of multiracial, working-class communities to drive equitable climate action and clean energy policy. The Equity Fund’s work is grounded in climate equity, strategies that mitigate climate change, rectify racial and economic injustices, and thereby create the political will needed to propel the transition to clean energy. The Equity Fund is strategically building power by: (1) Investing in the leadership and organizing of diverse communities (Black, Latinx, AAPI, Indigenous people, and communities bearing the brunt of climate change); (2) Engaging voters in these communities through nonpartisan civic engagement campaigns; and (3) Winning climate and clean energy policy solutions that reflect the priorities of communities and advance racial, economic, and environmental justice.

Founded in 2016, the Equity Fund partners authentically with community-based organizations in 14 states (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia), to build power in communities, transform public narratives about climate change, and build political will for lasting public policies.

Grassroots groups advocating for and organizing communities of color, Indigenous, working class and rural communities – often people hit hardest by climate change – are accomplishing critical work to build the collective power of communities. These communities are often the strongest supporters of climate policy and are a key political force to advance community demands and win durable policy change. The Equity Fund serves as a conduit for foundations and donors to partner with and support these grassroots organizations across the country. Because of Equity Fund’s expertise and deep relationships with community-led groups working at the intersection of climate change and economic, racial, and environmental justice, the Equity Fund can identify and nurture local grantee partners that have large-scale bases of members and track records of winning policy victories in their cities and states. The team then works to synthesize and share lessons learned from their grantee partners so that foundations and donors can better understand how grassroots groups can more effectively build power to advance climate solutions and then develop and coordinate funding strategies that will have the greatest results.",https://d3ogvqw9m2inp7.cloudfront.net/assets/dynamic/headers/cc/responsive/partner_lib/23842/img/email-logo-23842.png,N,,2026-01-24 23:58:51.540497

As Michigan faces frigid winter temperatures, DTE Energy announced a $15 million donation to three nonprofits to help families heat their homes and stay safe throughout the winter season.

The funding includes $5 million each for The Heat and Warmth Fund (THAW), United Way for Southeastern Michigan, and The Salvation Army Great Lakes Division. The organizations provide energy assistance to residents across Michigan who are elderly, unemployed, underemployed, disabled, or otherwise in need.

“Michigan winters can be harsh, and we know how hard this season can be for families,” said Joi Harris, DTE’s president and CEO. “We want every household to feel safe and warm, and this donation is just one way we’re standing alongside the communities we serve to provide relief and hope during these challenging months.”

The $15 million commitment will help expand support for customers by preventing or minimizing service disruptions, lowering or eliminating past-due balances, providing emergency assistance during extreme weather events, and connecting households with long-term resources for energy affordability and stability. The nonprofits also help customers enroll in affordable payment plans such as DTE’s Low Income Self-Sufficiency Plan (LSP).

Help is available now. Customers are encouraged to reach out as soon as possible, as assistance can begin faster when contact is made early. Residents can call 211 to connect with local energy assistance agencies, which will guide them through the application process and help identify the best options for their situation.

That means the seven federal income tax rates remain and range from 10% to 37%.
IRS Direct File is gone for 2026 After piloting a free Direct File tool in limited states for the past two filing seasons, the IRS is not offering Direct File for the 2026 tax season.
But the 2025 tax law backs away from the controversial $600 threshold for Form 1099‑K reporting.","You may have heard that the 2026 tax season, which begins January 26, is the first to be impacted by President Donald Trump’s 2025 tax law, known by some as the ""big, beautiful bill.""

New tax changes, from revamped credits and one less free filing option to updated 1099‑K rules and new schedules for special breaks, could affect whether you owe money or get a tax refund, and how quickly the IRS processes your return.

On that note, the IRS is still implementing the changes and updating systems amid budget and staffing pressures. So be prepared this filing season for longer wait times for phone assistance and potentially slower resolution if your return needs extra review.

In the meantime, here are eight key 2026 tax season changes to know before you file.

1. The standard deduction is bigger

The 2025 Trump tax bill, signed into law on July 4, 2025, makes the lower individual tax brackets from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA, from Trump's first term as president) permanent. That means the seven federal income tax rates remain and range from 10% to 37%.

But for 2025 returns you'll file this tax season, the standard deduction increased to about $15,750 for single filers, $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, and $23,625 for heads of household.

(Those numbers reflect the higher base TCJA amount plus the Trump tax bill 2025 boost and inflation adjustment.) For more information, see 2025 Standard Deduction Changes Under the Trump Tax Law.

2. The SALT cap has increased — for now

Speaking of the state and local tax deduction, the ""big beautiful bill"" raises the SALT cap from $10,000 to $40,000 for 2025 returns.

The cap will increase by 1% annually through 2029. Phase‑outs begin for households with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $500,000.

Note: This expansion is temporary. After 2029, the SALT deduction cap is scheduled to revert to $10,000.

The higher cap will likely have the most significant impact on joint filers with high property‑tax bills in high‑cost housing markets. For many in that group, itemizing could now result in a bigger deduction than claiming the standard deduction.

For more information, see SALT Deduction: Three Things to Know.

3. Child tax credit amounts and rules have changed

Taxpayers with children see a modestly higher federal child tax credit (CTC) for 2025, along with some eligibility rule changes.

For 2025 returns, the maximum child tax credit is $2,200 per qualifying child under age 17. That's up $200 from last year and is subject to income limits.

Up to about $1,700 of the credit can be refundable for eligible lower‑income families through the additional child tax credit, depending on earned income and other requirements.

Income‑based phase‑outs still apply. For most single filers, the CTC begins to phase out when MAGI exceeds $200,000. For most married couples filing jointly, it begins to phase out at $400,000, with the credit shrinking as income rises above those thresholds.

Co‑parents should coordinate which parent will claim each child for the year to avoid duplicate claims and processing delays.

4. Older adults get a 'senior' bonus deduction

Beginning with the 2025 tax year and running through 2028, individuals age 65 and older may claim an additional $6,000 deduction on top of their standard or itemized deduction, subject to certain conditions.

This “senior bonus” deduction phase-out starts at modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $75,000 for singles (and $150,000 for joint filers), and disappears once income exceeds $175,000 (single) or $250,000 (joint).

The deduction requires a Social Security number valid for work and is not available to those filing as married filing separately.

For retirees living on Social Security, pensions, and IRA withdrawals, that extra $6,000 can significantly reduce taxable income. That's especially when it's combined with the higher standard deduction and the existing extra standard deduction for people over 65.

Note: Tax software should automatically calculate the amount once the date of birth is entered, but paper filers should check the age boxes and follow the form instructions.

To learn more, see How the New Senior Bonus Deduction Works.

5. There are several new deductions and a Schedule 1‑A

The 2025 Trump tax bill also introduces several new “above‑the‑line” deductions and organizes them on redesigned schedules.

A revamped Schedule 1 now works with a new Schedule 1‑A to capture adjustments to income created by the new tax law. That includes the new car‑loan interest deduction and targeted tax relief for qualified tip income and overtime pay.

For 2025 through 2028, individuals may deduct interest paid on a loan used to purchase a “qualified vehicle,” subject to a $10,000 annual cap and strict requirements, including final assembly in the United States and other eligibility rules.

This deduction is treated as an adjustment to income, meaning eligible borrowers can benefit even if they don't itemize.

For more information, see New Car Loan Interest Deduction: Which Buyers and Vehicles Qualify.

In addition, workers can claim new deductions for certain earnings: up to $25,000 of qualified tip income (subject to income phaseouts and specific occupation eligibility) and up to $12,500 of overtime pay for single filers ($25,000 fo joint filers), subject to income limits and qualifying work definitions.

These overtime pay and tip income amounts are generally claimed through the new schedules rather than directly on Form 1040, and they depend on accurate employer reporting of wages and tip income.

Note: For many filers who previously used only Form 1040, taking full advantage of these breaks may now require completing Schedule 1 and Schedule 1‑A. Expect your tax software or preparer to ask extra questions about car loans, tip reporting, and overtime pay in its income and deductions sections.

6. IRS Direct File is gone for 2026

After piloting a free Direct File tool in limited states for the past two filing seasons, the IRS is not offering Direct File for the 2026 tax season.

Taxpayers seeking free filing options must instead rely on IRS Free File (if eligible), commercial software (some exceptions may mean filing isn't free), volunteer tax‑prep programs such as VITA and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE), or paper forms (IRS Free Fillable Forms) to file 2025 federal tax returns.

7. Casual sellers get 1099-K rule relief

Third‑party payment platforms remain a major source of information for the IRS. But the 2025 tax law backs away from the controversial $600 threshold for Form 1099‑K reporting.

Instead, the tax agency reverts to an old rule: platforms send a 1099‑K if you have more than $20,000 in gross payments and over 200 transactions in a year. That gives casual online sellers far more breathing room.

Some side‑gig workers and people who regularly use payment platform apps for business activity will still receive 1099‑Ks, and the IRS can compare those gross amounts to what’s reported on the return.

Because a 1099‑K can also reflect non‑taxable reimbursements and sales at a loss, it helps to keep good records. Those records should separate actual taxable income from personal transfers and other non‑taxable amounts.

Good records can help lower the odds of an IRS mismatch notice or make it easier to straighten things out if the tax agency flags a discrepancy.

8. Small‑business owners see full expensing again

For 2025 returns,100% bonus depreciation (or full expensing) is available and can increase the deduction you claim for the year. However, the tax break only applies to qualified business equipment placed in service after January 19, 2025.

Business owners should confirm the “placed in service” date for major purchases.

The January 19 date, not when the equipment was ordered or paid for, determines how much can be expensed on the 2025 return.

How to get ready before you file

Given this mix of higher and new deductions, new schedules, and reworked rules, it makes sense to treat this filing season as more of a reevaluation rather than an automatic replay of last year.

Check your withholding or estimated tax payments against the new tax brackets and deductions, gather any 1099‑K and new‑account forms, and confirm that you're eligible to use your desired filing method.

As mentioned, because the IRS is rolling out these changes while managing budget and staffing cuts, taxpayers should anticipate longer phone wait times and slower processing for returns that need human review.

The IRS advises not waiting until the last minute to file, responding promptly to legitimate IRS letters (beware of tax scams), and using online tools where possible can also help reduce friction and improve the odds of a timely refund, if you're due one.

And, speaking of tax refunds…

As Kiplinger has reported, U.S. House of Representatives tax writers have said many filers could see 2026 refunds jump by roughly $1,000 under the new law if they claim every tax break they are entitled to.

Though, as always, whether a taxpayer receives a refund—and how much—will depend on their individual tax situation.

When The Power of the Powerless was written in 1978, Havel's country was still in the grip of Soviet Communist control. The essay could only be circulated by hand, and read in secret.

It was eventually published around the world. Havel's essay invites us to ask ourselves: how can good people sign on to the nonsense of a bad regime?

Havel presents a greengrocer who puts a sign in his window saying, ""Workers of the world, unite!""— an old Communist rallying cry.

""Why does he do it?,"" asks Havel. ""He could be reproached for not having the proper decoration in his window; someone might even accuse him of disloyalty. He does it because these things must be done if one is to get along in life.""

And, Havel asks, who would say it's wrong for workers of the world to unite?

""It is an excuse that everyone can use,"" he writes, ""from the greengrocer, who conceals his fear of losing his job behind an alleged interest in the unification of the workers of the world, to the highest functionary, whose interest in staying in power can be cloaked in phrases about service to the working class.""

Havel's essay did not call for mass demonstrations, although many would follow. It suggested that change might begin in a society when people stop the rote motions by which a government infers loyalty.

Prime Minister Carney did not mention President Trump by name. But he called on what he called middle-powers, like Canada, and most of the European states at Davos, ""to live the truth,"" and see the scaffold of American power on which so much of their security had been built was being abandoned.

""When even one person stops performing, when the greengrocer removes his sign, the illusion begins to crack,"" Carney said. ""Friends, it is time for companies and countries to take their signs down,"" and find a different way forward.

Almost half a century later Vaclav Havel's vision and words may offer strength as the world faces another great change.

This story was originally published by Canary Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The Double Island Volunteer Fire Department in Yancey County, North Carolina, is the beating heart of this remote community in the shadow of Mount Mitchell, about 50 miles northeast of Asheville. Once home to a schoolhouse that doubled as a church, the red-roofed building still hosts weddings, parties, and other events.

“It was built to serve as a community center,” said Dan Buchanan, whose family has lived in the area since 1747 and whose mother attended the school as a young girl. ​“A place to gather.”

Sixteen months ago, when Hurricane Helene hit this rugged corner of countryside with catastrophic floods, Double Island’s fire department was where locals turned for help.

“This is [our] ​‘downtown,’” said Buchanan, who serves as the assistant fire chief. ​“In the wake of the storm, people were like, ​‘Let’s get to the fire station.’ That was the goal of everybody.”

“We aren’t only preparing for a disaster; we’re also helping utility diversification, cost savings, and normalization of the technology.”

Fresh out of retirement and living back in his hometown to care for his ailing mother, Buchanan drew on his long career in emergency response to spring into action. With the station, powered by generators, serving as their command center, he and his neighbors gathered and distributed food, water, and other provisions to those in need. They hacked through downed limbs and sent out search teams.

“By the end of the fourth day, we had accounted for all the residents of the Double Island community,” Buchanan said. And while no one in the enclave died because of the hurricane, some suffered while they waited for medications like insulin.

A lack of drinking water and limited forms of communication were also huge obstacles. ​“When we finally got the roads cleared, and people could get in here, we were literally writing down our needs on a notepad and giving it to whomever, and then they would ferry supplies,” Buchanan said. ​“A carrier pigeon would have been nice.”

Helene was a ​“once in 10 lifetimes” storm, Buchanan said, with devastation he and the community hope to never see again. But more extreme weather events are all but certain thanks to climate change, and today Double Island is better prepared.

The station is equipped with a microgrid of 32 solar panels and a pair of four-hour batteries. The donated equipment will shave about $100 off the fire department’s monthly electric bill, meaningful savings for an organization with an annual operating budget of just $51,000.

When storms inevitably hit, felling trees and downing power lines, the self-sustaining microgrid can provide some electricity and an internet signal.

“We’ll have at least a way to run our radio equipment, run our well and basic lighting and refrigeration,” Buchanan said, adding that the latter was vital for medication. ​“It may not seem like much—but that’s the Willy Wonka golden ticket.”

Communication, he stressed, was key. ​“If you can’t communicate, you can’t get the help you need.”

The microgrid project, called a resilience hub, was made possible by a network of government and nonprofit groups that came together after Helene to help fire departments like Double Island and other community centers with long-term recovery. Now, a state grant program is injecting a burst of funds into their efforts. Using both public and private time, know-how, and money, the program aims to create a model for resilience that can be replicated nationwide.

“We aren’t only preparing for a disaster; we’re also helping utility diversification, cost savings, and normalization of the technology,” said Jamie Trowbridge, a senior program manager at Footprint Project, a leading nonprofit in the initiative. Those benefits aren’t unique to Yancey County, he said. ​“We’d like to see this be a pilot for us on what scalable microgrid technology could be across all of western North Carolina—and maybe the country.”

The Double Island experience was common in the immediate aftermath of Helene. Across the region, communities isolated by closed roads and mountainous terrain turned to their fire departments for help.

That’s part of how Kristin Stroup got involved in the resilience hub effort. Based in Black Mountain, a popular tourist destination 15 miles east of Asheville, Stroup helped start a corps of volunteers who gathered at the town’s visitor center. In coordination with an emergency operations center based at Black Mountain’s main fire station, she led over 200 volunteers in doing whatever they could, from cooking and doling out food to making the country roads passable.

“People [were] just driving around the town with chain saws,” said Stroup, today a senior manager in energy and climate resilience with the nonprofit Appalachian Voices. The weekend after Helene hit, she said, ​“Footprint rolled into town with a bunch of solar panels. I became an instant part of their family.”

With founders who cut their teeth in international aid, the New Orleans–based Footprint Project had teamed up with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, Greentech Renewables Raleigh, and others to pool donations of batteries, solar panels, and other equipment to deploy microgrids to dozens of sites in the region before the end of 2024. From Lake Junaluska to Linville Falls, recipients included fire stations such as the one in Double Island and an art collective in West Asheville.

By February 2025, Footprint had hired Trowbridge and another staff person to work in the area permanently. Footprint continued to cycle microgrid equipment throughout the region from its base of operations in Mars Hill, a tiny college town 20 miles north of Asheville that was virtually untouched by Helene. It launched the WNC Free Store, which donates solar panels and other supplies to residents still far from recovery—like those living out of RVs and school buses after losing their homes.

From the outset, Footprint had a critical local ally in Sara Nichols, the energy and economic development manager at the Land of Sky Regional Council, a local government partnership encompassing four counties that stretch from Tennessee to South Carolina.

“A lot of the other organizations we saw come through in the same way Footprint did, most of them did not stay. They leverage resources to do really important work, and when that work feels done, they go home,” Nichols said. ​“The fact that Footprint is working thoughtfully to figure out how our recovery and resiliency can be taken care of—while also thinking about their own organizational strategic growth—means a lot to me. They’ve been incredible partners.”

To be sure, assistance and rebuilding in the region are ongoing, and many systemic inequities exacerbated by the storm can’t be solved with a solar panel. But the power is back on. The cell towers are functioning. The roads are open. Piles of debris, from fallen limbs to moldy furniture, have been cleared. In relief parlance, western North Carolina is beginning to see ​“blue skies.”

That’s why it’s all the more important that Footprint, Appalachian Voices, and other local collaborators haven’t let up in their efforts. The web of organizations involved is thick and, seemingly, ever expanding. Last fall, the network announced it was deploying five resilience hubs around the region, including the Double Island project and a permanent microgrid at a community center in Yancey County.

“These projects, driven by a small group of determined partners, have accelerated Appalachia’s long-term resilience and preparedness,” Invest Appalachia, another nonprofit partner, said in a news release.

Now, the local public-private effort is getting a boost from the state of North Carolina. Under the administration of Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat who has made Helene recovery a centerpiece of his first-term agenda, the State Energy Office will deploy $5 million from the Biden-era Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to install up to 24 microgrids across six western counties impacted by Helene.

The money will also go to two mobile aid units for rural counties on either end of state—one in the east and one in the west. Dubbed ​“Beehives” by Footprint, these solar-powered portable units will be full of equipment that can be deployed to purify water, set up temporary microgrids, and otherwise respond to storms and extreme weather.

Expected recipients of the stationary microgrids could include first responders like the Double Island Fire Department and second responders like community centers. Peer-to-peer facilities and small businesses are also encouraged to apply.

Land of Sky and other stakeholders are choosing grantees on a rolling basis through next summer. There’s already been an inundation of applicants, and six grantees have been selected, including a community center about a dozen miles up the road from Double Island in Mitchell County. But organizers say they need more interest from outside the Land of Sky region, especially in Avery County, north of Yancey on the Tennessee border; and Rutherford County, east of Asheville, which includes Chimney Rock, a village that was infamously devastated by Helene and is slowly rebuilding.

Geographic distribution isn’t the only problem organizers have faced. Some entities—while undoubtedly deserving of assistance—aren’t appropriate for the government grant because they are located in areas at risk of future flooding.

“A battery underwater is not that useful,” Trowbridge said, ​“so if your site is in a floodplain, maybe this isn’t the right fit for you. But we definitely want you to know about the Beehive.”

Above all, organizers like Nichols, a passionate promoter of the Appalachian Region, are determined to ensure that the state’s effort is not the be-all and end-all of resilience.

“What we’re being tasked with as recipients of this money is to try and figure out how we make this a much bigger project,” she said. ​“That means we’ve brought in other partners like Invest Appalachia. We’ve been seeking other kinds of money. We’re using this state money to successfully build what could be a much more comprehensive resiliency hub model.”

She added that communities across the country—even if they think they’re safe from extreme weather and climate disaster—could take cues from the western North Carolina example.

“We were a place that was not supposed to get a storm,” Nichols said. ​“We were a climate haven.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Helene-Cropped.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-24 20:00:17.443209

Earlier this month, the Trump Administration gave the latest signal that it prefers natural gas, coal, and nuclear power to provide the bulk of new generation supporting the data center build-out.","The Trump Administration continues to revise, restructure, and cancel billions of U.S. dollars of Biden-era loans and funding commitments to clean energy projects as the United States shifted its policy to supporting fossil fuels and nuclear power as part of its energy dominance agenda.

In the latest instalment of canceled or revised funding, the Department of Energy this week announced that the Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF), previously known as the Loan Programs Office (LPO), is restructuring, revising, or eliminating more than $83 billion in what it called “Green New Scam” loans and conditional commitments from the Biden-era loan portfolio.

EDF has reviewed in the past year each borrower of these funds “to ensure loans were a responsible investment of taxpayer dollars and aligned with the Administration’s priorities,” the Department of Energy said.

EDF is reforming the office to more responsibly steward taxpayer dollars and support financing opportunities that accelerate the deployment of affordable, reliable, and secure American energy.

For the Trump Administration, affordable, reliable, and secure energy means fossil fuels and nuclear power, and excludes solar and wind capacity projects.

The Biden Administration has committed over $104 billion in financing, of which $85 billion was closed or committed between Election Day 2024 and Inauguration Day 2025, DOE said.

“We found more dollars were rushed out the door of the Loan Programs Office in the final months of the Biden Administration than had been disbursed in over fifteen years,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Out of the $104 billion in Biden-era principal loan obligations, EDF has completed or is in the process of de-obligating over $29.9 billion (about 29%) and has completed or is in the process of revising another $53.6 billion (approximately 51%) of this total.

EDF has also eliminated about $9.5 billion in government-subsidized, intermittent wind and solar projects, and, where possible, replacing those projects with natural gas and nuclear uprates that provide more affordable and reliable energy, DOE said.

The financing vehicle now has more than $289 billion in available loan authority, and the restructuring of the priorities of the loan office means that EDF will be backing six energy sectors. These are nuclear energy; coal, oil, gas, and hydrocarbons; critical materials and minerals; geothermal energy; grid and transmission; and manufacturing and transportation.

The latest axing of Biden-era loans to energy projects shouldn’t be a surprise. The Trump Administration has been looking for ways to cancel billions of dollars of commitments to clean energy projects, including solar, wind, and EV production. Hundreds of projects worth dozens of billions have been terminated since President Donald Trump took office a year ago.

In the year since Inauguration Day, the Trump Administration has made abundantly clear that it will back fossil fuels and gas for affordable and reliable energy and will look to degrade solar and wind as contributors to meeting America’s surging power demand—the highest demand growth since the 1990s, due to AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing.

Earlier this month, the Trump Administration gave the latest signal that it prefers natural gas, coal, and nuclear power to provide the bulk of new generation supporting the data center build-out.

Energy Secretary Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and the bipartisan group of governors of all 13 states served by PJM Interconnection issued a so-called Statement of Principles urging the biggest U.S. power grid operator to hold a capacity auction, in which leading technology companies have committed to funding this new generation capacity.

Coal, natural gas, and nuclear will be the pillars of the new U.S. power capacity, providing reliable baseload, and ending years of “misguided policies” that favored intermittent energy resources such as solar and wind power, the U.S. Administration said.

Following the call on PJM for a capacity auction, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) said in an analysis that without timely deployment of significant new clean energy resources, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states “face serious reliability risks and dramatically higher electricity costs over the next decade.”

The mismatch between immediate demand growth and the lead time of new conventional generation means that, without new clean energy development, ratepayers across nine PJM states would pay an additional $360 billion over the next ten years, driven primarily by higher wholesale electricity prices. The average residential household would see $3,000 to $8,500 in additional electricity costs over the next decade, ACP estimates.

“To keep the lights on and power economic growth, PJM needs resources that can be built quickly, operate reliably, and protect customers from surprises on their electric bills,” said John Hensley, Senior Vice President of Markets and Policy Analysis at ACP.

Some states have seen energy bills increase at a faster pace than others, with Washington DC experiencing the more dramatic increase, with electricity costs at 23 percent higher in 2025.

The increase in U.S. energy demand is expected to drive up consumer energy bills.","Despite President Trump’s big promises of driving down consumer energy bills, the cost of energy actually rose for consumers in 2025. Throughout his electoral campaign and during his first year in office, Trump pledged to slash Americans’ energy bills. However, his new approach to energy seems to have done the opposite, with higher prices expected for 2026 and beyond.

Upon entering office for his second term, President Trump announced a state of energy emergency, quickly passing executive orders to curb the rollout of former-President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and limit the deployment of renewable energy, to instead focus on expanding fossil fuels. This resulted in the pause of several wind energy projects across the U.S., as well as greater investor uncertainty in the clean energy sector, which stalled development. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to expand its oil and gas operations and is prolonging the life of several of its coal plants.

According to a Guardian analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average household electricity bill in the U.S. was 6.7 percent higher in 2025 than in 2024. This equates to an average household spending of around $116 more in 2025 than in the previous year. Some states have seen energy bills increase at a faster pace than others, with Washington DC experiencing the more dramatic increase, with electricity costs at 23 percent higher in 2025. Indiana came in second, with a 17 percent increase.

In addition to higher electricity bills, the cost of gas has also increased, by around 5.2 percent on average in the last year, according to EIA figures. This has led to an upsurge in disconnections for unpaid bills across several states. For example, the disconnection rate in New York State rose fivefold. This trend reflects the rising pressure on the consumer to choose between essentials, as the cost of groceries has also increased.

The executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, Mark Wolfe, stated, “Instead of reducing electric bills by 50 percent, the president’s actions have raised the cost of home energy for all Americans.” Wolfe added, “It used to be the poorest Americans who struggled with their power bills, but now we are seeing more and more middle-income families who have to make sacrifices to avoid being shut off. But there’s a limit to how much people are able to sacrifice, which we are very concerned about.”

In recent weeks, Trump has claimed that the affordability crisis is a “hoax” and a “fake narrative” invented by his political enemies. The president has also suggested that 2025 was the “greatest first year in history” for the economy.

As Trump focuses on expanding oil and gas production and keeping coal plants running, Americans are losing out on cheaper and cleaner sources, such as wind energy. Because coal-fired plants are increasingly costly and inefficient to run, delaying the decommissioning of several ageing U.S. plants is costing the consumer billions. Meanwhile, works have halted on several offshore wind energy projects over the past year, as Trump has restricted development in the sector, leading several companies to fight the move in court.

The projects that have been cancelled or delayed since Trump came into office have resulted in a loss of almost 25 GW of planned energy generation, which could have provided power to almost 13.2 million households, according to a Climate Power report published in December.

Meanwhile, Trump’s broad support for large-scale data centres, to support the rollout of artificial intelligence (AI), has driven the U.S. energy demand to increase for the first time in decades. Greater pressure from consumers about rising bills and concerns over an energy supply gap has finally led the White House to call for an emergency wholesale electricity auction, aimed at forcing tech companies to pay for the new power they require to run giant data centres.

In addition to encouraging fossil fuel expansion, Trump has also shown support for nuclear power, with significant investments in a range of nuclear technologies. While new power plants could help provide vast quantities of clean power to consumers, they will take several years to develop, during which time there will likely be a power supply shortage if tech companies are given free rein.

The increase in U.S. energy demand is expected to drive up consumer energy bills. While tech companies may be more than happy to pay a high price to get their data centre expansions approved, finding the energy needed to power normal households will be challenging. This is largely because the shift away from renewable energy expansion has slowed the development of new energy capacity. While investments in nuclear power may eventually help to fill this gap, it will likely take decades for them to make a meaningful impact.

State Rep. Jack Patrick Lewis raises many important points in his opinion piece (""Democrats can't accept false premises about our future,"" Jan. 18) about the Democrats and their need for a more honest dialogue.

However, Rep. Lewis does not need to separate the topic of affordability from climate. Action on climate can actually help affordability. For example, after decades of reliance on coal, Australia is launching a plan to offer many of its citizens three hours a day of free electricity when its enormous solar output is at a peak. Here in the U.S., a study in 2015 found that the states with the most renewable energy were paying less for electricity, on average, than states with less renewable energy. Since then, the cost of renewables has come down even more. In 2024, The Wall Street Journal published an article with the title, “For Lower Electricity Prices, Invest More in Renewables.”

I hope Rep. Lewis and his colleagues keep this in mind. They should reject the provisions of the Climate Rollback Bill (H.4744) that weaken MassSave and keep us tied to natural gas infrastructure. We need to keep Massachusetts on track for a rapid transition to cleaner, more affordable renewable energy.

Gigafactories – large-scale battery manufacturing plants – should be recognised not merely as individual industrial projects, but as elements of strategic national infrastructure.
They are the conditions that global automotive and battery investors now expect as standard.
A named Cabinet minister should be given personal accountability for delivering a package of investments in EV, battery and active material manufacturing.
The UK Battery Strategy, the Modern Industrial Strategy, DRIVE35, the Battery Innovation Programme and recent gigafactory investments in Sunderland and Bridgwater all represent important steps forward.","Governments across the world are racing to secure leadership in EV and battery manufacturing. Europe, the United States and Asia are deploying substantial incentives and aggressive investment strategies, cutting planning times and lowering energy costs. The UK is in this race – but unless firm and coordinated action is taken, it risks falling behind.

Set against these challenges, however, lies a significant opportunity. Establishing a robust, domestic battery manufacturing ecosystem will create thousands of high-skilled, well-paid jobs, support regional growth and secure the long-term future of the UK’s automotive sector. It offers a route to link industrial competitiveness with net zero ambitions, demonstrating that economic resilience and environmental sustainability can – and must – go hand in hand.

Gigafactories – large-scale battery manufacturing plants – should be recognised not merely as individual industrial projects, but as elements of strategic national infrastructure. Countries that succeed in co-locating EV manufacturing with gigafactories will determine where future automotive platforms are allocated, where new EV models are built, and which nations retain volume automotive production. In short, decisions taken over the next few years will determine whether the UK remains a serious player in global automotive manufacturing or sees production and investment move offshore.

Against this backdrop, the UK cannot afford a passive “open for business” stance. It needs a more interventionalist mindset: one that combines financial incentives, site readiness and proactive ministerial engagement to prioritise attracting a major global OEM as demand anchor and secure investment in gigafactories and their supply chains. The question is no longer whether government should act, but how quickly and how decisively.

That is why the policy commission on gigafactories – bringing together senior cross-party figures and experts from industry, policy, academia and public service – has set out a clear, practical roadmap in its report, The UK Gigafactory Commission: Britain’s Battery Future. Its recommendations rest on three pillars: proactive government leadership, strengthened domestic capabilities and capacities and targeted policy and regulatory reform. These are not abstract policy ambitions. They are the conditions that global automotive and battery investors now expect as standard.

Government leadership must be central. Attracting gigafactory investment and securing long-term commitments from automotive manufacturers as a demand anchor requires decisive, top-level engagement. A named Cabinet minister should be given personal accountability for delivering a package of investments in EV, battery and active material manufacturing. That minister, supported by a small but empowered secretariat, should have the authority to convene departments, remove barriers – on grid, planning and skills – and lead senior-level negotiations with prospective investors.

Capabilities and capacity on the ground are equally critical. Investor-ready sites with pre-secured grid, water and transport infrastructure, coupled with predictable, competitive energy costs, are now a basic requirement if the UK is to compete with rival locations. In parallel, the UK must close persistent supply chain gaps by attracting investment in cathode and anode active materials and recycling, alongside development and scale up of next-generation chemistries.

Skills must be treated as strategic infrastructure as well. Gigafactories and active materials plans will require a steady pipeline of technicians and engineers. A coordinated national approach to skills – including apprenticeships specific to battery manufacturing, reskilling programmes drawing from adjacent industries and curriculum reform in colleges and universities – will be needed to build the skilled workforce required to be in place at the right scale and time.

Policy and regulatory interventions must underpin this strategy. The Zero Emission Vehicle mandate should be reviewed to align with market realities. Relief for energy-intensive industries relief must be broadened across the EV and battery supply chain on a predictable, long-term footing. A deferral or phased transition for post-2027 rules of origin deadlines should be pursued with EU partners to protect UK exporters from tariffs while domestic battery and materials capacity is built up.

There has been significant progress. The UK Battery Strategy, the Modern Industrial Strategy, DRIVE35, the Battery Innovation Programme and recent gigafactory investments in Sunderland and Bridgwater all represent important steps forward. The UK retains strong research and engineering capabilities and an established automotive base. But the Commission’s conclusion is clear: on their own, these initiatives are not yet sufficient to make the UK genuinely competitive. Without more proactive and coordinated intervention, the UK risks losing momentum at a critical time – with global firms committing capital elsewhere.

The Commission has therefore set out 10 priority recommendations that together provide a coherent roadmap. This represents a significant but achievable agenda. The next 12–18 months will be decisive. What is required is the political will, industry focus and collective resolve to turn ambition into delivery.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/d6ec20e003b07da1d4877cfb2b79fda7:bb68cd1d50b023c79ea655f3b2dab5e7/screenshot-2026-01-23-091642.png.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 18:59:25.559224

About 60% of European Economic Area LNG imports now come from the United States.","By Robert Cyran

NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) – Greenland deal or no, the international order is fraying. As the Trump administration ramped up – before stepping back from – brazen territorial claims, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney captured the mood at the World Economic

Forum in Davos: “Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons.” The global linkage most vulnerable to disruption, from the 1970s oil shock to Russia’s aggression in Europe, has been energy. The United States controls enviable supplies. The possibility of weaponizing them, though, is ebbing.

While Uncle Sam is the world’s largest oil producer, churning out over 13 million barrels daily, it also consumes most of what it makes. That leaves just over 2 million barrels of net exports, about 2% of global consumption.

Where it dominates is sales of liquefied natural gas. It sold 111 million metric tons last year, roughly a quarter of all exports, according to LSEG data. Nations are frenziedly building facilities to handle shipments as the United States tracks toward roughly doubling export capacity by 2030.

The reason is simple. Domestic gas production surged nearly 50% over the past decade, largely thanks to a boom in hydraulic fracturing. That subdued local prices. The Henry Hub benchmark, despite a recent cold-snap-induced spike above $5 per million BTU, probably will spend most of this year below $4, judging by futures pricing.

In post-Ukraine-invasion Europe, prices are substantially higher, around $13 per million BTUs for March, based on the Dutch TTF benchmark. As the European Union sought to wean itself off Russian fuel, the United States has become the supplier of over 60% of its LNG, about a quarter of total gas supplies. This especially matters during winter doldrums, when renewable power generation falls and nations deplete their storage reserves.

However, this overstates Europe’s bind. Germany could not switch to a different supplier to fill Russian pipelines. Any ship could supply an LNG terminal. There would be delays, given that gas is usually sold via long-dated contracts. But if U.S. tankers go toward Asia instead, then gas from Qatar, Australia or elsewhere will find its way directly to Europe, or Asia buyers might re-ship gas off to the EU. After all, LNG is a fungible commodity. Meanwhile, the EU has reduced consumption by about a fifth since 2021. A further 25% drop is expected by 2030, according to the IEEFA, thanks to curtailed demand and growth in green electricity and batteries. Anxiety over U.S. belligerence might increase decarbonization budgets. That’s before getting into a rapidly growing domestic U.S. demand from data centers or rising export capacity elsewhere. The simple arbitrage underlying of cheap U.S. gas and European demand with nowhere to go was always going to wane. Trump has given his putative allies every reason to accelerate the shift.

CONTEXT NEWS

The United States exported 111 million metric tons of the fuel last year, over 20 million more than the year before, accounting for about a quarter of all global exports of the fuel, according to LSEG data.

About 60% of European Economic Area LNG imports now come from the United States.

The remarkable turnaround in sentiments regarding nuclear energy generation around the global market has opened the door to a significant revival of the international nuclear power sector. Now, the U.S. DoE has signed two new OTAs (Other Transaction Agreements) to accelerate the new surge in nuclear energy projects in the United States.

The U.S. is aiming to lead the surge in new nuclear energy developments across the international market

Since taking office for his second term, Donald Trump has shaken the U.S. energy market to its core. Trump signed several executive orders aimed at increasing the oil and gas production in the U.S., and has actively been approving the nuclear buildout as part of the government’s efforts to increase nuclear energy output in the United States.

The U.S. DOE has now finalized two new Other Transaction Agreements with Terrestrial Energy and Oklo. The new OTAs form part of the U.S. Reactor Pilot Program, which has outlined a target of fast-tracking the deployment of the reactors by July 4 of this year.

The context behind the new nuclear development in the U.S.

In August of 2025, the U.S. DOE formally selected ten companies as part of the Reactor Pilot Program, a new path for nuclear energy developers to leverage the accelerated DOE approval instead of the standard Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing process. Initially, the U.S. was targeting to get up to three reactors online within a year, but that target was amended by Energy Secretary Chris Wright at the 2025 ANS Winter Conference & Expo.

Other notable selections by the Department as part of the Reactor Pilot Program include:

Aalo Atomics

Deep Fission

Last Energy

Natura Resources

Standard Nuclear

Oklo and Terrestrial Energy will boost the U.S. nuclear energy output capacity

Oklo is as unique as it gets within the framework of the Reactor Pilot Program, as it has three distinct nuclear energy projects in the United States, namely the Aurora Powerhouse development, the Pluto reactor, and a third reactor being developed by the company’s subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.

“This OTA establishes a framework for execution and risk reduction. By building and operating a pilot reactor, we generate the data and experience to streamline future commercial deployments, improve regulatory efficiency, and deliver long-term value.” – Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte

Terrestrial Energy, on the other hand, follows a more conventional OTA process. The company’s Project Tetra has been slowly developing over the past few months and has now been added to the Reactor Pilot Program by the U.S. authority.

“The agreement sits on our development center-path, allowing the company to expedite key elements of its program to prepare licensing applications for commercial plant operation,” – Simon Irish, Terrestrial Energy’s CEO

The remarkable growth that is expected across the U.S. nuclear sector has positioned the U.S. as a major nuclear energy developer, alongside its arch nemesis, China, which has been developing several new nuclear energy projects over the past few years.

Authorities managing the US energy supply risk aim to balance transparency with reassurance, providing timely updates without causing unnecessary alarm.
How effectively institutions respond to the US energy supply risk will influence future policy direction and investment priorities.","Washington, January, 2026 — Brussels Morning Newspaper notes that the US energy supply risk has become a defining national concern as a prolonged winter weather system grips large parts of the United States. From the Plains to the Northeast, freezing temperatures, ice, and snow are testing oil fields, natural gas infrastructure, and electricity grids at a time of elevated seasonal demand. Federal agencies, state regulators, and private operators are coordinating closely as households and businesses brace for potential disruptions.

The convergence of cold weather and high consumption has placed energy resilience at the center of policy and market attention, highlighting vulnerabilities that extend beyond regional boundaries.

Winter Conditions Reshape the Energy Landscape

Severe cold has settled across major producing and consuming regions, altering the balance between supply and demand. The US energy supply risk is amplified during winter because fuel consumption for heating rises sharply while production systems face physical stress from freezing conditions.

Meteorological forecasts suggest temperature swings rather than a quick thaw, increasing uncertainty for energy planners tasked with maintaining steady flows under unpredictable conditions.

Oil Production Under Seasonal Strain

Crude oil operations have slowed in several producing basins as companies take precautionary measures to protect equipment. The US energy supply risk in the oil sector stems from surface infrastructure exposure, including wellheads, pipelines, and storage facilities that are sensitive to extreme cold.

Industry analysts note that even temporary shutdowns can remove significant volumes from daily output, tightening supply and influencing price expectations.

Natural Gas Output Meets Rising Heating Demand

Natural gas systems face a more complex challenge, as cold weather simultaneously restricts production and accelerates consumption. The US energy supply risk becomes more pronounced when processing plants and gathering lines freeze while residential and commercial heating demand surges.

Storage withdrawals have increased, drawing attention to inventory levels that will be critical if cold conditions persist deeper into the season.

Electricity Grids and Fuel Dependence

Electricity reliability is closely linked to fuel availability, particularly in regions reliant on gas-fired generation. The US energy supply risk extends into the power sector as generators balance peak demand against constrained gas flows.

Grid operators have issued conservation advisories in some states, emphasizing the importance of managing load during peak hours to reduce the likelihood of outages.

Regional Variations in Impact

Not all regions experience winter stress equally. The US energy supply risk differs by geography, with colder northern states accustomed to winter conditions while southern regions face greater challenges adapting infrastructure to rare freezes.

These regional differences complicate national coordination, requiring tailored responses rather than uniform solutions.

Energy Markets Respond to Uncertainty

Financial markets have reacted to weather-driven uncertainty with cautious price movements. Traders factor the US energy supply risk into short-term contracts, particularly for natural gas and electricity tied to winter delivery periods.

Market analysts emphasize that sentiment remains closely linked to weather forecasts and the pace of infrastructure recovery.

Federal Oversight and Coordination

Federal agencies have increased monitoring of energy systems, holding regular briefings with state authorities and industry leaders. Addressing the US energy supply risk involves ensuring transparent communication, rapid information sharing, and readiness to deploy emergency measures if needed.

Strategic reserves and regulatory flexibility are among the tools discussed to mitigate potential shortages.

Industry Preparedness and Winterization

Energy companies have invested in winterization following past cold-weather crises. Despite these improvements, the US energy supply risk persists due to the scale and duration of the current cold pattern.

Operators stress that resilience is cumulative, built through incremental upgrades rather than a single solution.

Consumer and Business Implications

For consumers, winter supply stress often translates into higher heating costs and calls for conservation. Businesses, particularly in manufacturing and logistics, monitor the US energy supply risk closely as it affects operating expenses and scheduling.

Utilities have expanded assistance programs aimed at protecting vulnerable households during prolonged cold spells.

Lessons From Earlier Winter Disruptions

Previous winter events exposed weaknesses in infrastructure and coordination. The US energy supply risk observed today reflects both progress made since those events and ongoing gaps that require attention.

Experts argue that learning from past disruptions remains essential as climate variability increases.

Climate Variability and Long-Term Planning

Shifting climate patterns have introduced greater extremes into seasonal weather, complicating energy planning. Managing long-term US energy supply risk increasingly involves preparing for both severe cold and unexpected heat, stretching systems designed for historical norms.

This dual challenge underscores the need for flexible infrastructure capable of adapting to a wider range of conditions.

Infrastructure Investment and Policy Debate

The current winter has reignited debate over infrastructure spending and regulatory standards. Reducing US energy supply risk is now framed by some policymakers as a matter of national resilience rather than market efficiency alone.

Proposals include enhanced weatherization requirements, expanded storage capacity, and grid modernization initiatives.

Technology and Innovation as Mitigation Tools

Advances in monitoring, automation, and forecasting offer tools to manage winter stress. While technology cannot eliminate the US energy supply risk, it can improve response times and situational awareness for operators navigating rapidly changing conditions.

Investment in smart grids and advanced analytics continues to gain momentum.

Expert Perspective

One senior energy strategist observed,

“Winter stress tests every layer of the system at once, revealing whether resilience plans exist only on paper or function under real pressure.”

The remark captures the broader challenge facing those tasked with safeguarding energy reliability.

Outlook for the Remainder of Winter

Forecast models indicate alternating cold and mild periods through late winter. The US energy supply risk will depend on how quickly production rebounds during warmer intervals and whether demand moderates accordingly.

Officials emphasize preparedness rather than prediction, noting that rapid shifts require constant vigilance.

International Context and Comparisons

Other major economies face similar winter challenges, offering comparative lessons. Observers note that approaches to mitigating US energy supply risk can benefit from global best practices in storage, diversification, and emergency response.

International coordination remains limited but informative as climate pressures intensify worldwide.

Economic Ripple Effects

Energy reliability influences inflation, consumer confidence, and industrial output. Persistent US energy supply risk can amplify economic uncertainty, particularly if disruptions coincide with other global market pressures.

Economists stress that stability in energy systems underpins broader economic resilience.

Public Communication and Trust

Clear communication plays a vital role during periods of stress. Authorities managing the US energy supply risk aim to balance transparency with reassurance, providing timely updates without causing unnecessary alarm.

Public trust is shaped not only by outcomes but by the clarity of messaging during crises.

A Test of Systemic Resilience

The winter of 2026 serves as a real-time test of reforms implemented after earlier disruptions. How effectively institutions respond to the US energy supply risk will influence future policy direction and investment priorities.

Resilience is increasingly measured by adaptability rather than absolute prevention.

A legal dispute over the halted construction of a proposed electric vehicle battery plant near Big Rapids is intensifying, with the company behind the project now seeking damages against a small mid-Michigan township.

Gotion, a Chinese tech company that had planned to build a $2.4 billion EV battery manufacturing facility in Green Charter Township, filed new court arguments this week asking for fiscal damages. The move comes after state economic development officials previously clawed back subsidies and as the project remains stalled amid a years-long legal fight.

According to the new filing, Gotion argues that the township’s actions amounted to a contract breach that has ultimately made the project impossible to complete.

Gotion Claims Township Breach Made Project “No Longer Viable

The legal battle centers on a lawsuit between Green Charter Township and Gotion over access to the local water supply — a necessity for battery manufacturing. The township revoked Gotion’s access, which led to construction being paused and the case working its way through court.

In its latest filing, Gotion said the township’s opposition has rendered the plant “no longer viable.” The documents were submitted after a judge asked whether the legal fight still matters if the facility will likely never be built.

Green Charter Township’s legal team has taken the opposite position, arguing the case should be dismissed because the company’s development intentions have shifted.

In a separate filing, township attorneys argued “Gotion no longer intends to develop the plant and soon will not own the Gotion property. This court can afford no real relief.”

Opposition Has Been Years in the Making

The proposed facility became one of Michigan’s most divisive economic development projects in recent years, drawing sustained protests from residents and political opposition from Republican lawmakers.

Local critics raised concerns about the company’s public ties to the Chinese Communist Party and questioned what the project could mean for regional safety and governance.

U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Caledonia, has been among the project’s most vocal opponents and criticized Gotion’s legal action.

“The people of Mecosta County, and the State of Michigan have thoroughly rejected it, but it is still trying to hold the town hostage,"" Moolenaar said. ""The CCP-affiliated company will stop at nothing to build a plant that no one wants.""

A recurring concern among some opponents was the plant’s location roughly 100 miles south of Camp Grayling, the nation’s largest National Guard training base. Republicans warned the site could become a hub for surveillance and intelligence-gathering tied to military activity — claims that fueled even more backlash in the region.

Local Leaders Warn Legal Fees Are Draining Township Resources

As the fight has continued, Green Charter Township leaders say the case is draining resources and adding financial pressure to a small community.

Township Supervisor Jason Kruse told WCMU the mounting legal fees have become one of the most difficult consequences of the dispute.

“It's just terrible to watch the amount of money that's chewed up,"" Kruse told WCMU. ""That could have just gone to other township projects.""

Last year, Mecosta County provided $193,987 from marijuana tax revenue to help the township cover legal expenses — funding officials say was needed to keep up with escalating costs.

State Pursues Millions in Recovered Incentives

The Michigan Economic Development Corporation has also stepped back from the project financially. Officials are seeking $23 million back after determining the company failed to meet progress benchmarks required to maintain state support.

The project had originally been approved for up to $270 million in state subsidies, but state officials later moved to reclaim a portion of those funds, adding another layer of financial uncertainty as the development stalled.

Gotion’s legal team has not yet responded publicly to requests for comment.

What Happens Next

With the project’s future increasingly unclear, the court dispute may determine whether either side is responsible for damages and whether the case can continue if the plant does not move forward.

For Green Charter Township, leaders say the priority is limiting financial exposure and moving ahead after years of uncertainty. For Gotion, the latest filing signals the company may pursue compensation for a development it now says can no longer proceed.",,N,,2026-01-24 15:59:25.582482

Electric cooperatives in Texas and nearby states were working to restore thousands of power outages Saturday as a massive winter storm began an onslaught of heavy snow, ice and frigid temperatures across more than 2,000 miles from New Mexico to New England this weekend and beyond.

Co-ops in the projected path of Winter Storm Fern have been gearing up for the brutal weather, and mutual aid crews from co-ops in states outside the storm’s main path were already beginning to arrive Saturday.

“Electric cooperatives are well-versed in safely responding to Mother Nature’s worst and have been preparing for this winter storm for days,” said NRECA CEO Jim Matheson.

“Electric co-ops have been coordinating ahead of the storm to ensure we can respond to potential power outages as quickly and safely as possible, drawing on crews from unaffected areas if needed. We urge consumers to take the storm seriously and prepare for the possibility of extended power outages.”

Co-ops said they are worried most about ice coating power lines and toppling tree limbs onto lines.

“Ice accumulation continues to be the main concern, as ice forming on tree limbs and power lines can cause catastrophic damage to the distribution system,” Georgia Electric Membership Corp. said as the storm headed its way.

Texas had the most outages in the nation as of midday Saturday, with about 50,000 reported across all types of electric utilities, according to poweroutage.us.

Ice accumulation on the lines caused outages to more than 7,300 meters at Deep East Texas Electric Cooperative Saturday. The San Augustine-based co-op serves about 45,000 meters.

“Crews are working and will continue to work as quickly as they safely can,” the co-op said on Facebook.

Bowie-Cass Electric Cooperative in Douglassville reported outages at more than 6,000 of its nearly 40,000 meters as of midday.

“There are several reports of fallen trees/limbs across the territory, along with other damage,” the co-op said on its website. “Roads and other surfaces are icy and hazardous, which may impact travel times and outage location access.

“Our crews are working as quickly and safely as possible to restore power to all affected members, but please keep in mind that it will take time due to weather conditions. Freezing rain is expected to continue throughout the day with temperatures below zero and bitter cold wind.”

Rusk County Electric Cooperative in Henderson reported that more than 6,500 of its nearly 24,000 consumer-members were without power.

“Trees are heavy, lines are stressed, and crews are moving as safely and quickly as possible to restore power,” the co-op said Saturday afternoon on Facebook.

Panola-Harrison Electric Cooperative in Marshall reported that about 2,100 of its nearly 21,000 members were without power as of early afternoon. The co-op serves both Texas and Louisiana.

“As a reminder, due to hazardous road conditions and working conditions, it will take crews longer than usual to make repairs,” the co-op said on its website.

In New Mexico, Cloudcroft-based Otero County Electric Cooperative reported about 6,000 of its 21,000 members without power as of about 12:30 p.m.

Co-ops throughout the storm’s projected path were gearing up for extended power outages.

“Based on weather predictions, Rappahannock Electric Cooperative is preparing for a multi-day outage event,” said Casey Hollins, the Fredericksburg, Virgina-based co-op’s managing director for communications and public relations. “Wet snow and ice add weight to power lines, causing them to break, and weigh down trees and limbs, which can lead to power outages.”

Florida-based SECO Energy was among the co-ops rushing to send mutual aid crews to help co-ops in neighboring states.

The Sumterville-based co-op sent a nine-member crew to South Carolina on Saturday to help with power restoration efforts in northern South Carolina and Georgia.

“Pressure Geothermal is designed to be commercial, scalable, and deployable almost anywhere,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems.
Tech giants need “firm power,” energy that runs 24/7 without weather interruptions.","Geothermal energy usually requires finding specific spots with natural hot water bubbling underground. It’s a great power source, but you can’t put it just anywhere. Sage Geosystems wants to find a solution to that limitation. The company just closed a $97 million Series B funding round to build its first commercial facility.

Ormat Technologies and Carbon Direct Capital co-led the round. The goal is to take Sage’s “Pressure Geothermal” technology out of the lab and into the real world.

Engineering an Underground Reservoir

Here is the main difference with Sage’s approach. Instead of hunting for rare natural hydrothermal systems, they tap into hot, dry rock. This rock is found almost everywhere if you dig deep enough.

The technology creates an engineered underground reservoir. It uses the Earth’s natural heat and pressure to make hot water expand and contract, which generates power. According to Sage, this method unlocks significantly more potential than traditional geothermal, over 130 times more in the U.S. alone.

They are moving fast to prove it works. Sage will deploy its first commercial facility at an existing Ormat power plant. This partnership helps them skip the long setup times usually associated with new energy projects.

“Pressure Geothermal is designed to be commercial, scalable, and deployable almost anywhere,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems. “This Series B allows us to prove that at commercial scale, reflecting strong conviction from partners who understand both the urgency of energy demand and the criticality of firm power.”

Scaling Geothermal Energy

A big driver behind this funding is the massive energy appetite of AI data centers. Tech giants need “firm power,” energy that runs 24/7 without weather interruptions. Solar and wind can’t always promise that, but geothermal can.

Additionally, Sage announced a partnership with Meta back in August 2024 to deliver up to 150 MW of power for their data centers. Investors see this as a key solution for the tech industry’s growing power bill.

“Enhanced Geothermal Systems (“EGS”) are extremely well-positioned to deliver for hyperscalers, who want clean firm power for their AI computing needs,” said Jonathan Goldberg, CEO at Carbon Direct Capital. “Sage’s pressurized EGS technology is advantaged on both economic and environmental evaluation criteria.”

But the immediate needs can and should be met with natural gas.
She must secure New York’s energy future by embracing natural gas and other reliable energy sources.
The path to success for the Dunkirk NRG plant has already been mapped out, including land easements that were secured for the gas lines to come from existing natural gas wells nearby.
That can only occur by using affordable, abundant natural gas to re-power the Dunkirk NRG plant.","In early 2013, New York’s then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo showed up in Dunkirk on a wintry day to announce with great fanfare that the NRG power plant in Dunkirk would be converted from a clean-coal facility to natural gas-fueled power production. I was a Chautauqua County Legislator at the time and I was there that day to experience the community’s collective sigh of relief that the county’s largest property-taxpaying entity would continue to operate.

However, everything changed as the governor pivoted and decided he would bow to political pressure from the advocates on the far left that ultimately led to this critical power plant closing down by 2016. The Dunkirk NRG plant was one of many casualties of Cuomo’s war on low-cost, reliable power in New York State.

Instead of investing in cleaner, reliable energy production using natural gas, hydropower and nuclear, Cuomo chose to shutter power plants in favor of importing power from outside New York, largely from coal-fired power plants. This was the start of a virtue-signaling emissions shell game that continues today; claiming that New York is “clean and green” while actually increasing overall emissions outside our state to meet our power needs. This reckless, costly agenda was designed to appease special interests at the expense of New York taxpayers and ratepayers.

In 2018, while I was county executive, a broad group of stakeholders came together, after securing a federal grant, to commission a study of re-use options for the closed power plant. After looking at everything from a public park to a resort hotel, the results were clear … the “best and highest use” for the NRG plant was for it to generate power again.

We have seen the devastating negative impact of power plant closures, including its contribution to Dunkirk’s financial woes. Our state is now importing more power than ever before. New York was once energy independent. But now, on peak demand days, our state often imports more power than it produces thanks to Albany’s incoherent and irresponsible energy policy.

Our energy situation is now so bad that the New York Independent System Operators (NYISO), which operates the state’s electric grid, is sounding the alarm that New York may face energy shortages, and even rolling blackouts, as soon as this year.

To her credit, Gov. Kathy Hochul has finally recognized that New York’s increasing energy demands cannot be met solely with wind and solar. However, the solution she is now offering is simply too little and too late to meet New York’s urgent power needs. I support the idea of developing nuclear power as a part of a diverse energy portfolio. But energy experts caution that developing a new nuclear power plant is likely a decade or more away from reality. The far more cost-effective and quicker solution to New York’s energy supply problem would be to expand the use of natural gas for electricity production. That was the right plan for the Dunkirk NRG plant back in 2013 and continues to be now. Nuclear power can be a long-term goal for a transition to a zero-emission energy future. But the immediate needs can and should be met with natural gas.

The governor needs to show leadership in this moment. She needs to push back against her far-left colleagues and radical special interests. She must secure New York’s energy future by embracing natural gas and other reliable energy sources. New Yorkers deserve relief from sky-high utility bills and a secure future with reliable, low-cost energy.

The path to success for the Dunkirk NRG plant has already been mapped out, including land easements that were secured for the gas lines to come from existing natural gas wells nearby. Most importantly, the people of Dunkirk, and all of Chautauqua County, deserve a future with a power plant that is providing energy, tax relief, and good paying jobs — as soon as possible. That can only occur by using affordable, abundant natural gas to re-power the Dunkirk NRG plant.

In a statement, the department said it has eliminated about $9.5 billion in financing for wind and solar projects as part of the adjustment and plans to redirect the funding toward natural gas and nuclear projects.

The Energy Department, which didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, didn’t provide specific details on which other deals were affected.

The Energy Department’s loans office swelled into a $400-billion green bank under Biden, partly due to an infusion in funds from his signature Inflation Reduction Act. The office has been used to finance Tesla Inc.’s Model S sedan and some of the first new nuclear reactors built in the U.S. in decades by Southern Co. But the program drew criticism from Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who said the department closed or offered $85 billion of financing in the final months of the Biden presidency after Donald Trump’s election.

“We found more dollars were rushed out the door of the Loan Programs Office in the final months of the Biden Administration than had been disbursed in over 15 years,” Wright said in Thursday’s statement.

While Trump once proposed killing the Energy Department program — arguing during his first term that the government had no business picking winners and losers — his administration later sought to tap the bank to pay for its own energy priorities.

Trump’s fascination with fossil fuels and dislike of renewables, for whatever reason, is costing the country, and consumers and businesses, money.","The Trump administration reportedly has canceled $30 billion in green loans from the Biden era and is revising another $53 billion, reported The Hill.

To be accurate, some of this total includes cancellations from last year, like a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for a power line that would connect wind and solar power to the grid, because generating power means nothing if it cannot reach where it’s needed.

But that is just one example. The administration’s animosity extends to every area, and the results are often unseen costs for taxpayers. The dismantling of the Energy Star program might seem unimportant — just some appliance labeling program. But it was much more than that, providing a vast data resource needed across multiple industries.

Forget for a moment that consumers wanted to know how much appliances would cost to run, to better calculate the true cost over time. Companies of all sorts need the same info, which has been available for such commercial equipment as HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), refrigerators, freezers, ovens, boilers, large-scale data processing equipment, windows, doors, and more. The lack of information means a lack of insight into how to save money.

The data cutoff is also hurting the entire real estate industry. Anyone who claims that businesses don’t care about environmental issues know next to nothing about corporate practicalities. Developers and investors focus on the long-term costs of building and maintaining properties, as I’ve learned over years of speaking to people in all areas of commercial real estate. Energy efficiency and, yes, even carbon footprints are important to them as they consider costs and current and eventual regulatory compliance.

Green tech is important for lowering environmental impact but also for saving money and providing the energy the country needs. Here are some graphs from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Over the next couple of years, electric generation from natural gas, coal, and nuclear will decline. Growth is going to come primarily from solar and wind, slightly from hydropower. These are critical to ensuring that the U.S. has the amount of electrical generation it needs.

More specifically, according to the EIA’s short-term energy outlook report, natural gas will drop from 40% of electrical generation to 39%. Coal will drop from 17% to 15%. Hydropower will be flat at 6%. Wind will climb from 11% to 12%. Solar, from 7% to 10%.

Then there is the question of how much energy costs. This is a lot more complicated than it might seem. Some fuels are used to directly create heat or power engines like cars. Some are used to generate electricity.

The costs of power from new renewables is now cheaper than from fossil fuels, according to an article in Our World in Data. In the last 10 years, in most places in the world, this changed from fossil fuels being cheaper. “The fundamental driver of this change is that renewable energy technologies follow learning curves, which means that with each doubling of the cumulative installed capacity their price declines by the same fraction,” they wrote. The more that’s done, the cheaper it becomes. Fossil fuel-generated electricity doesn’t follow the same path.

Jan 23 (Reuters) – A federal judge on Friday ruled President Donald Trump’s administration unlawfully suspended funding awarded to support the expansion of electric vehicle charger infrastructure, in a victory for 20 Democratic-led states ‍that sued over the action.

U.S. District Judge Tana Lin in Seattle ruled in favor of 20 states as well as the District of Columbia, which had filed their lawsuit after the U.S. Department of Transportation in February suspended an EV charger infrastructure program enacted by Congress in 2021 under Democratic President Joe Biden.

Lin, a Biden appointee, said the DOT and the Federal Highway ‌Administration “yanked the NEVI Formula Program’s cord out of the outlet,” ‌without working within the statutory confines of established administrative law as required.

Budget 2026 is all set to arrive with 2025’s harsh climate warnings still echoing across India. The water you drink and the air you breathe continue to hang in the balance as Nirmala Sitharaman and Co take centrestage to outline where New Delhi’s purse will be spending in the new fiscal year.

Unseasonal floods drowned farmland across the Gangetic plains, heatwaves scorched cities from Delhi to Nagpur for weeks on end, and coastal storms forced repeated evacuations in the east and west.

Crop yields fluctuated, power demand shattered records and municipal budgets were pushed to breaking point.

Climate change was no longer an abstract future risk -- it was a line item in every government file.

Live Events

It is against this backdrop that India walks toward the upcoming budget, with the world watching how the fastest-growing major economy plans to square its exploding energy appetite with its Net Zero commitments.

Over the past three years, New Delhi’s thinking has undergone a quiet transformation: climate action not just framed as an environmental duty, but became an industrial and economic strategy.

If earlier budgets laid the groundwork, 2026 is expected to be the year of full-scale execution - where policy blueprints harden into concrete infrastructure, capital deployment and national systems.

Union Budgets: ‘Industrialisation of climate action’

However, this transformation did not happen overnight. Rather, it has unfolded in stages, with each budget adding a new layer to what policymakers increasingly describe as the “industrialisation of climate action.”

The change is most visible when the last three budgets are read as a single evolving strategy rather than isolated policy documents.

In the Union Budget 2023–24, the PM Modi-led Centre placed “Green Growth” among the seven Saptarishi priorities of the ‘Amrit Kaal’ vision.

That year focused on establishing foundational missions and institutional frameworks, most notably the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an outlay of Rs 19,700 crore to steer the economy toward low-carbon intensity.

In addition to that, the Centre laid critical infrastructure groundwork through a Rs 20,700 crore inter-state transmission system to evacuate 13 GW of renewable energy from Ladakh, signalling that renewable expansion would be backed by serious grid investments rather than symbolic announcements.

What came next was the Union Budget 2024–25 that marked the shift from planning to rollout. The focus then shifted from design to deployment and energy security.

The centrepiece of this phase was the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, a nationwide rooftop solar programme backed by a massive central allocation of Rs 75,021 crore.

This budget also introduced a pivotal industrial shift with the launch of the Critical Mineral Mission, which fully exempted customs duties on 25 essential minerals needed for renewable energy tech and nuclear power.

With this move, India began addressing the raw material vulnerabilities that could otherwise constrain its clean energy ambitions.

The last Union Budget 2025–26 took the strategy into higher-stakes territory by explicitly placing nuclear power at the core of India’s energy transition.

Nirmala Sitharaman, in her eight consecutive budget speech, announced a target of developing at least 100 GW of nuclear capacity by 2047. On top of that, a dedicated Nuclear Energy Mission with a Rs 20,000 crore outlay for research and development of Small Modular Reactors was also established.

The mission aimed to operationalise at least five indigenously developed SMRs by 2033, reflecting a long-term commitment to stable, low-carbon baseload power.

Alongside this, the National Manufacturing Mission was expanded to support clean tech manufacturing, with a focus on building domestic ecosystems for solar PV cells, electric vehicle batteries, electrolyzers and wind turbines.

As such, climate policy was no longer separate from industrial policy; the two had effectively merged.

As policymakers now prepare for Budget 2026, the expectation is that this industrial footprint will widen even further.

“This budget has a real opportunity to sow the seeds of a multi-trillion dollar green economy for India. Extending PLI towards circular products, sending strong demand signals through green public procurement mandates and incentivising private sector investments in the green sectors via matching grants or tax breaks on R&D investments are some concrete measures to spur an economically and environmentally resilient future,” said Gunjan Jhunjhunwala, Programme Lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).

Financing the resilient frontier

Parallel to this industrial transformation, climate finance and resilience planning have also undergone a fundamental shift.

What began as conservation-focused spending has evolved into a sophisticated blend of public funding, private capital mobilisation and multilateral financing.

In the 2023–24 Budget, resilience policy was anchored primarily in nature-based solutions through initiatives such as MISHTI for mangrove plantations along India’s coastline and the Amrit Dharohar scheme to promote sustainable wetland use.

These programmes were crucial for ecological protection but remained largely within the traditional conservation framework.

By the time of the 2025–26 Budget rolled around, climate resilience had been integrated into the foundations of infra development and food security planning.

For example, the National Mission on High Yielding Seeds was launched with a specific focus on developing crop varieties that combine high productivity, pest resistance and climate resilience.

This move was a direct response to the increasing volatility of India’s agricultural systems under erratic weather patterns.

It also marked a recognition that food security is now inseparable from climate adaptation.

The most significant financial innovation, however, arrived with the creation of the Rs 1 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund, which fundamentally altered how green infrastructure is financed in India.

Instead of relying solely on government grants, the fund finances up to 25% of the cost of bankable urban projects while requiring that at least 50% of funding be mobilised through bonds, bank loans and public–private partnerships.

In effect, climate resilience was no longer seen just as government spending, but as an investment opportunity that could attract private capital.

This approach was reinforced by the launch of the Rural Prosperity and Resilience Programme, a multi-sector initiative designed to operate in partnership with state governments while seeking technical and financial assistance from multilateral development banks to address under-employment and climate-related shocks in rural India.

Bridging the Gaps: What Budget 2026 must fix

Despite the progress of recent budgets, policy observers and research institutions such as the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) have identified critical gaps that must be addressed if the strategy is to deliver long-term stability.

One major concern is the continued imbalance between mitigation and adaptation finance.

Current allocations remain heavily skewed toward emissions reduction, often overlooking the urgent need to protect vulnerable communities from floods, heatwaves and other climate-induced disasters.

ORF argued that Budget 2026 must revive a dedicated National Adaptation Fund with clear and transparent allocations and apply a strict climate-risk lens to the Urban Challenge Fund so that new infrastructure automatically includes heat mitigation, flood management and nature-based solutions.

Beyond funding priorities, there are also persistent implementation challenges.

Calling for a decisive shift in India’s economic thinking, Rusen Kumar, Managing Editor of India CSR Network, said the Union Budget 2026 must place climate action at the heart of national economic planning.

“India’s climate fight will succeed only when green transition also becomes an employment mission. Budget 2026 should focus on green jobs, renewable energy expansion, and sustainable agriculture while ensuring vulnerable communities are not left behind during the transition,” said Kumar.

“The real shift will be measured by how much funding moves from intention to implementation,” he reinforced.

Energy transition planning also needs sharper alignment. While funding for renewable energy and electric mobility has increased, the absence of clear sectoral targets and regulatory roadmaps remains a bottleneck.

Budget 2026 must accelerate grid modernisation and expand hybrid renewable projects to support the 500 GW non-fossil target by 2030, particularly in light of recent cuts to wind and hydropower investments.

“While solar and hydrogen saw increased allocations, the cut in wind energy funding and stagnant hydropower investments indicate an imbalanced path to energy transition. Strategic focus on grid modernisation, hybrid renewable projects, and domestic manufacturing incentives is essential to meet the 500 GW non-fossil target by 2030,” read the ORF report.

At the same time, stagnating afforestation budgets and earlier reductions in coastal mission funding need correction if India’s natural defences against climate shocks are to remain viable, noted the New Delhi-based thinktank.

Meanwhile, according to CEEW, water and urban resilience are now expected to take centre stage in Budget 2026. According to Nitin Bassi, Fellow CEEW, the upcoming budget is likely to feature three major water-related announcements.

“First, continued financial support is expected for drinking water and sanitation in rural areas, which received around Rs 74,000 crore in the previous budget, with a stronger focus this time on water source sustainability and service delivery in peri-urban regions,” Bassi said.

“Second, there is likely to be a significant allocation for the management of used water, including sewage treatment, grey water management, rejuvenation of water bodies, and reuse for non-potable purposes. As per CEEW’s analysis, achieving 100 per cent treatment coverage by 2047 represents an investment opportunity of Rs 1.6–2.3 lakh crore,” he added.

“Third, urban flood management is expected to receive enhanced financial commitment. Rainfall intensity is increasingly breaching local drainage design thresholds of 12–20 mm per hour, and more cities may be brought under a national adaptation framework to address rising flood risks.”

Moreover, sustainable mobility policy must also move beyond component-level tax incentives for electric vehicles to include large-scale investments in public transport, cycling networks and pedestrian infrastructure.

Finally, green finance needs clearer rules including a formal climate finance taxonomy and stronger carbon markets to attract the large private investments required for the transition.

To wrap up, India stands at a critical inflection point. The policy direction is clear, the building blocks are largely in place, and climate action has firmly entered the economic mainstream. What now matters is follow-through and whether ambitious targets are matched with steady funding, clear roadmaps, and on-ground delivery.

NMED News:

SANTA FE — The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board has unanimously adopted regulations establishing the Clean Transportation Fuel Program, setting April 1 as the opening date for the Southwest’s first clean fuel market.

Signed into law by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in 2024, the Clean Transportation Fuel Program is a market-based initiative that incentivizes and expands access to lower-carbon transportation fuels, including ethanol, biofuels, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, electricity, and supporting infrastructure.

The program will boost economic development across the state, create more than 800 jobs, and reduce health care costs by improving air quality. Overall, the program is expected to deliver $1.65 billion in net benefits to New Mexicans through avoided air quality health impacts and climate change infrastructure damages. Cumulatively through 2040, the program will prevent 337 asthma cases, 60 work-loss days, 59 school-loss days, and 353 restricted activity days for children.

“Affordability is a must-have with any new state policy, including our Clean Transportation Fuel Program,” Lujan Grisham said. “This practical yet powerful program will spur job growth and investments while decreasing health care costs for New Mexicans – to the tune of up to $20.8 million annually once fully implemented.”

“New Mexico is racing towards affordable, clean energy solutions in the transportation sector,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said. “Our state is officially open for clean fuel business investments – from cleaner renewable diesel and hydrogen for long-haul trucking to more charging infrastructure to accommodate our increasing battery-electric passenger vehicles.”

Transportation is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in New Mexico, accounting for approximately a quarter of statewide emissions. It contributes significantly to particulate matter (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which worsen asthma and other respiratory illnesses and disproportionately impact overburdened communities.

By 2030, the Clean Transportation Fuel Program is projected to reduce PM2.5 by 144 tons, VOCs by 200 tons, and NOx emissions by 169 tons. The program will move New Mexico closer to meeting the state’s goal of cutting climate pollution 45% by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Our teams are closely monitoring conditions and are prepared to respond as soon as it is safe to do so.

Real-time updates, outage information, and preparedness resources are available at: https://www.entergy.com/stormcenter

Restoration efforts

If outages occur, crews will begin restoring power as quickly and safely as possible. Restoration may include closing circuit breakers and rerouting power when available and deploying damage assessment teams to identify and prioritize repairs.

Following winter storms, it can take additional time to fully understand the extent of damage and provide more specific restoration timeframes. Ice, snow, weighed-down vegetation and extreme cold make restoration work especially dangerous, and icy roads may limit access to some communities. When possible, we restore power while damage assessments are still underway.

If you don’t see crews working nearby, they may be repairing another part of the electric system that must be fixed before power can be restored to your area.

Additional resources

As of 7 a.m., roughly 2,900 restoration workers are in place or mobilizing across our service area ahead of the storm.

Crews are also coming from more than a dozen states — including Maine, Florida, Illinois, Tennessee, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Alabama, Connecticut, West Virginia and New York — as well as Canada.

Safety is a core value

The most dangerous time during a storm is often after it has passed. Please keep yourself and your family safe:

Stay away from downed power lines — assume they are energized

Avoid areas with storm debris, where power lines may not be visible

Use extreme caution in icy and snowy conditions

Warming centers available

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are pervasive in Maine soils, surface water, and groundwater. Over the past several years a significant body of data has developed to characterize the hazard posed by these contaminants and understand why and how they move between sources, various media, and receptors. Our understanding of PFAS transport mechanisms is still nascent, but an interconnected system is now recognized in which PFAS persist throughout the water cycle as they are 1) transported from sources like waste processing systems, agricultural biosolid applications, or aqueous film-forming foam applications to surface waters, groundwater, and wells; 2) possibly transformed by hydrolysis, oxidation, or microbial action; and then 3) continuously recycled via irrigation from contaminated wells, gray water, septic leachate, or runoff from other waste streams. This session will focus on our current scientific understanding of transport mechanisms of PFAS, their accumulation and longevity in different parts of the water cycle, and what it means for users and downstream consumers of the water.

MORNING SESSION

8:30AM – 8:50AM

An analysis of PFAS in soil and groundwater at septage land application sites in Maine

Madeline Bruno, Louise Roy

Maine Department of Environmental Protection

As part of Maine’s LD 1600 investigation, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP) has investigated, or overseen the investigation of, all sites where septage was licensed to be spread. This presentation provides background on this statewide dataset and examines how PFAS associated with septage land application processes are distributed between soils and groundwater, and how those distributions manifest in on-site and off-site receptors.

The analysis is high-level, and includes descriptive evaluations of PFAS compositional fingerprints we observed in soils within spreading areas and in groundwater, both on-site and downgradient of licensed application areas. We focus on identifying if any clear/repeatable patterns exist to better inform our understanding of PFAS transport, persistence, and attenuation across interconnected media, rather than pursuing full source apportionment. Fingerprints are summarized by compound class (PFCAs, PFSAs, and precursors such as fluorotelomer sulfonates and fluorosulfonamides), chain length, and selected ratios that provide insight into mobility and subsurface longevity.

In order to place the chemical patterns into the transport framework, compositional summaries are paired with spatial analyses (e.g. detection frequency and rates with distance from site boundaries, generalized downgradient alignment, and contrasts between overburden and bedrock aquifers where data allow).

Using statewide soil and groundwater data, this work explores how historical septage land application contributes to PFAS transport in Maine and what that may mean for long-term exposure. This first-pass analysis is designed to be accessible to policymakers and the public but useful for a technical or academic audience.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are prevalent in biosolids, which had historically been amended to soils as fertilizer on agricultural lands in Maine and other U.S. states. Our understanding of PFAS fate and transport in agroecosystems is nascent, though the consequences for human health of PFAS movement into ground and surface waters are potentially severe. PFAS transport behavior in soil is related to numerous factors, including PFAS composition, soil chemistry, and subsurface hydrogeologic properties. To better understand and characterize PFAS transport behavior, we derived key PFAS transport parameters, including partitioning coefficients, from analytical chemistry and soil data collected by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP) between 2022 and 2024. We integrated these parameters into recently published 1-dimensional unsaturated zone transport models to assess parameter sensitivities and the utility of different modeling frameworks. MEDEP soil data were used to initialize these models and results were compared with collocated MEDEP groundwater analytical chemistry data.

In this talk we evaluate the ability of these models to effectively and consistently relate concentrations of PFAS in soils to concentrations in groundwater and assess the relative value of input parameters. This information has the potential to help agencies and consultants in planning cost-efficient field campaigns; to help regulators make decisions about risk; to help residents and municipalities make decisions about treatment for water-supply wells located near source areas; and to help farmers make decisions about where to grow crops, graze animals, and obtain water.

PFAS transport from irrigation water to crops

Randy Martin

Central Aroostook Soil and Water Conservation District

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) persist throughout interconnected components of the water cycle, creating emerging risks for agricultural production, drinking water and food safety. In Maine, legacy aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) applications have contaminated surface and groundwater resources that are increasingly used for agricultural irrigation. This study evaluates how irrigation with PFAS-impacted water contributes to soil accumulation, crop uptake, and potential human exposure in the Lower Aroostook River Watershed.

The Central Aroostook Soil and Water Conservation District, in partnership with the University of Virginia, the Mi’Kmaq Nation, Upland Grassroots, and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, received U.S. Environmental Protection Agency funding to examine PFAS fate and transport in irrigated cropping systems. Irrigation was collected from tributaries affected by leachate from the form Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, Maine, where over four decades of AFFF training activities occurred. Recent investigations have documented groundwater PFAS concentrations exceeding 17,000 ng/L in portions of the former base.

Over two growing seasons, potatoes, and selected vegetable crops including broccoli, yellow beans and kale, were irrigated with contaminated surface water representative of watershed conditions. Results demonstrate that repeated irrigation leads to measurable PFAS accumulation in the soils and translocation into plant tissues. Uptake varied by crop species and was strongly influenced by soil chemistry, including organic matter content, texture, pH, and cation exchange capacity. Crop PFAS concentrations differed substantially from those observed in biosolid-contaminated systems elsewhere in Maine, indicating that contaminant source, exposure pathway, and soil-PFAS interactions are critical determinants of risk.

These findings identify irrigation as a continuous PFAS recycling pathway and support the need for water screening, soil specific risk assessment, and crop-sensitive guidance to inform agricultural policy and consumer protection.

9:30AM – 9:50AM

Management strategies to reduce PFOS uptake by forages

Ellen Mallory, Sonora Ortiz, and Daniel Wasonga

University of Maine Cooperative Extension

Plant uptake from contaminated soils is a major pathway by which per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) enter our food system and an emerging agricultural crisis. In Maine and elsewhere, forage producers (dairy, beef, and hay) are among the most impacted farmers. We initiated a replicated field trial in 2023 on a PFAS-impacted farm to investigate the effects of various forage management practices on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) uptake by perennial and annual forage plants. Experimental treatments included crop species, harvest timing, harvested product, cutting height, and seasonality. Co-located plant and soil samples were analyzed for PFOS and PFOS transfer factors (TF) were determined (plant concentration divided by the soil concentration). Forage quality characteristics, leafiness, and evapotranspiration were evaluated as possible explanatory variables. First year results indicate seasonality has a strong effect on PFOS levels of perennial species, where PFOS TFs of aftermath growth harvested in August were 35-109% higher than TFs of the original spring growth harvested in May/June. Harvested product also had a substantial effect. In all cases tested (winter triticale, spring oat, field pea, and corn), PFOS TFs in grain was zero or close to zero versus TFs from 0.025 to 0.225 for the whole plant forages of these species. For corn, harvesting snaplage (cob, grain, and husk) is another promising strategy with a TF of 0.01 compared with 0.06 for whole plant silage. Second year results will be incorporated and presented, and together they offer farmers and decision-makers actionable information to guide recommendations and management options for PFAS-impacted farms.

Using soil sorbents to limit mobility of PFAS in PFAS-contaminated soil

This research investigates whether the incorporation of biochar and/or high carbon ash in PFAS -contaminated agricultural fields will reduce PFAS uptake by grasses and improve overall soil health. Published research indicates that biochar has the ability to bind to PFAS compounds, and potentially reduce bioavailability of PFAS compounds. In this research, biochar and high carbon ash were applied to field plots at two application rates. Plots were seeded with grass and crop uptake of PFAS was monitored. Parallel greenhouse trials were conducted with soil from the field that the field trials were conducted in, similar application rates of high carbon ash, and the same grass seed mix.

Results from the greenhouse trials show statistically significant differences between the uptake of PFAS compounds in pots that were amended with high carbon ash as compared to control pots. In contrast, data from two growing seasons in the field trials show variable results in crop uptake of PFAS compounds in plots that were amended with biochar or high carbon ash as compared to control plots. These results indicate that high carbon ash can be effective at immobilizing PFAS compounds in soil, but may not be immediately effective at doing so in the field, highlighting a need for more research and long-term monitoring of the plots. Northern Tilth is currently considering ways to research why high carbon ash was effective at reducing crop uptake in the greenhouse trials but not reliably so in the field trials.

AFTERNOON SESSION

1:30PM – 1:50PM

Transport of PFAS in rural school communities: Three case studies in Maine

Richard Hilliard, Jane E. Disney

MDI Biological Laboratory

We investigated the possibility that rural schools in Maine, with documented per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination in their drinking water, may be sources of contamination of nearby neighborhoods and surrounding environments. We focused on communities around three schools in Hancock County, Maine (each with previously documented PFAS contamination of drinking water): Mount Desert Island High School (MDIHS), Tremont Consolidated School (TCS), and Deer Isle–Stonington High School (DISHS). Across these three study areas, we collected drinking water samples from residences as well as additional samples from surrounding wetlands and downstream sites for PFAS analysis. Based on statistical analysis of PFAS profiles, we determined that groundwater and surface water from rural school campuses are a significant source of PFAS in nearby private wells and environments.

Several factors may influence the extent of PFAS contamination of drinking water, groundwater, and surface water near schools, including the types of PFAS-containing products used at the school, the type of wastewater treatment employed by the school, hydrological conditions, and the local bedrock composition. Subsurface transport of PFAS in bedrock aquifers will by faster than in typical porous media aquifers where PFAS may adsorb to organic matter or accumulate at air-water interfaces. Groundwater transport of PFAS, with lower attenuation than in porous media aquifers, represents a possible threat to public health for residents dependent on private wells which may presently test as non-detect but in subsequent years may see PFAS levels above drinking water standards. Surface water PFAS concentrations may also impact private wells and must be considered in long-term management of drinking water quality.

The primary objective of the study was to quantify how representative a single point-in-time sample is when PFOA or PFOS concentrations fall between 3.5 and 10 ppt, or when the Hazard Index exceeds 1 while PFOA and PFOS remain below 2 ppt, or when test results are close to the Maine Interim Drinking Water Standard for PFAS, currently 20 ng/L for the sum of six PFAS (PFHpA, PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFDA) or SUM6. The study was composed of sampling at 11 locations for 10 months to assess variability by using consistent sampling personnel and methods. A secondary objective was to determine whether the new EPA Method 1633 would produce data comparable to results obtained using the methodology DEP currently utilizes for evaluating PFAS in drinking water which is a Modified EPA Method 537 with Isotope Dilution (537MOD). To further evaluate geochemical variation between the study sites, the samples were analyzed for general water chemistry during two rounds, using a standard DEP analyte list in August and December. This parameter list is commonly used by MEDEP to assess ground and surface water chemistry at landfill sites. These parameters were evaluated to assess water chemistry variations between locations and potential correlation to PFAS concentrations or variability. Data were evaluated in several ways to assess the representativeness of a single residential well sample result relative to the Maine SUM6 or to the federal MCL values for PFOA and PFOS.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent, bioaccumulative contaminants of increasing concern for environmental and human health. While PFAS occurrence has been widely studied in terrestrial and freshwater systems, less is known about their transport and fate in estuarine and coastal environments. These transitional zones receive cumulative inputs from diverse sources and provide vital ecosystem services.

To address this gap, we conducted three sampling campaigns across more than 90 sites in the Casco Bay Estuary, targeting surface waters and, in one campaign, sediments. We also implemented a year-long, monthly monitoring program in an area impacted by an aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) spill. This study approach was designed to characterize spatial and temporal PFAS patterns, identify dominant sources, and assess their relative contributions to the estuary.

PFAS were detected at low background levels throughout the system, with distinct source-specific patterns near river mouths and the AFFF spill site. Compositional signatures and concentrations indicated that rivers are major contributors, particularly for the legacy compounds PFOS and PFOA. The spill site exhibited elevated levels of AFFF-associated marker compounds for two to six months, with tidally driven advection and dilution dominating attenuation. Interestingly, PFAS concentrations were not systematically higher near urban centers, and wastewater treatment plant effluents were minor sources. Instead, non-point inputs, likely linked to agricultural runoff and upstream sources, dominated PFAS loading.

These findings provide new insights into PFAS dynamics in temperate coastal systems and demonstrate the importance of spatially intensive and temporally resolved monitoring for source attribution and coastal contaminant management.

While PFAS transport and persistence are critical to characterize, exposure is shaped by human behavior in response to those physical processes: whether people are aware of contamination and advisories, how they interpret that risk, and whether they can change what they harvest and consume—especially when wild foods are a key component of food security. In partnership with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, we fielded surveys of licensed anglers (n=3,549) and hunters (n=13,330) to assess fish and wild game in Maine, including awareness of consumption advisories related to environmental contaminants and associated behavior changes. We find that concern about environmental contaminants is common, yet awareness of and confidence in advisories is not consistent across participants. Maine hunters had higher advisory awareness, with 74% reporting that they have heard of consumption advisories related to PFAS. Of anglers who report consuming freshwater fish caught in Maine, 63% have heard that there is PFAS in Maine’s lakes or fish, but only 26% have heard of a “do not eat” or “limit consumption” advisory related to PFAS. Food security appears to shape exposure-relevant behavior: anglers who describe freshwater fishing as important for their household food security report significantly higher levels of freshwater fish consumption than those who do not. We will also evaluate whether this relationship generalizes to hunters using preliminary results from an ongoing survey effort, and explore relationships between advisory awareness and respondents who report that fish and wild game are important for their household’s food security.

Composite samples for perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) in fish may change contaminant threshold decisions

The widespread occurrence and persistence of the per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), in the environment may pose significant health risks to humans. Fish consumption is a direct pathway for exposure prompting extensive monitoring. In the United States, fish consumption advisories for PFAS generally focus on perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), the most frequent and abundant PFAS compound reported in fish. However, PFAS analysis is costly, leading monitoring programs to frequently use composite samples —combining different fish of the same species. This financial saving comes at an analytical cost of lost information on individuals’ variation. It is unclear how this may influence threshold-based decisions. We used a modelling approach using aggregated data distribution from individual freshwater fish. We simulated the measurement of PFOS for individual fish compared to composites (3, 5, and 10 fish) at different levels of error structure. We assumed a composite is the mean of the components. These values were then compared to a typical do-not-eat threshold (200 ng•g wet mass-1). These results show that the probability of assigning PFOS levels above or below the threshold are shifted with a composite sample by masking individual value contributions. Because true individual contaminant loads are variable, composite sampling is a more conservative metric for contaminant thresholds. The greater the variability, the lower the detection probability for truly contaminated samples. Our study may help to inform sampling for monitoring programs aimed at managing human exposure to PFAS.

That means higher maintenance costs – and once again, working Americans footing the bill.","In 2022, Democrats rammed through what they misleadingly called the Inflation Reduction Act. The name was deceptive then, and the results are undeniable now: it didn’t reduce inflation. What it did accomplish was shovel hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into “Green New Deal” subsidies — chief among them, electric vehicle (EV) tax credits that disproportionately benefited the wealthy.

At the time, I stood on the Senate floor and asked: why should working Americans struggling with high prices be forced to subsidize luxury car purchases for the rich? Nearly every Senate Democrat voted to keep these handouts alive. Now, more than four years later, the data proves I was right.

The National Bureau of Economic Research found that seven out of 10 EV tax credit recipients would have bought an electric car anyway. In other words, taxpayers were footing the bill for decisions affluent households were already going to make. That’s not an incentive — that’s a windfall.

AMERICANS ARE PUMPING THE BRAKES ON ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION: ‘AFFORDABILITY IS A BIG ISSUE’

And who reaped that windfall? The wealthiest Americans. A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that before the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, the top 5% of earners claimed half of all EV tax credit benefits, while the bottom 60% of earners received less than 3%. Democrats claim they fixed this by adding income caps, but they set the ceiling at $300,000 for joint filers. Since when is $300,000 considered middle class? In what world should taxpayers be buying $80,000 SUVs for families earning three times the median household income?

The environmental case isn’t much stronger. Yes, EVs produce fewer emissions than gas-powered cars. But the Congressional Research Service highlights research showing that the credits mostly displaced sales of other efficient vehicles like hybrids. When you account for that substitution, the supposed climate benefits are overstated by nearly 40%. Simply put: these credits aren’t nearly as ‘green’ as Democrats claim.

Meanwhile, the price tag was massive. That’s why I’m pleased we repealed these wasteful tax credits in July’s reconciliation law. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this will save taxpayers $190 billion over the next decade. Republicans are saving taxpayers from this costly policy that was never going to deliver on Democrats’ own goal of 50% EV sales by 2030.

The verdict is clear: EV tax credits are inefficient, inequitable, and irresponsible. They don’t meaningfully change consumer behavior, they don’t deliver the promised environmental gains, and they drain taxpayer dollars into the pockets of the rich. If Democrats were serious about helping working families — instead of virtue-signaling about climate change — they would back policies that deliver a real return on investment.

A good place to start would be addressing the dwindling Highway Trust Fund (HTF), which is projected to run insolvent by 2028. While drivers of gasoline-powered cars pay into the HTF through the federal gas tax, EVs currently do not contribute at all – despite their heavier batteries putting greater wear and tear on our roads and bridges. That means higher maintenance costs – and once again, working Americans footing the bill.

That’s why I introduced the Fair SHARE Act, which would require EVs to contribute to this fund. I encourage my Democratic colleagues to cosponsor it and to work with me on including an EV fee in the upcoming Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act. That would be a fairer, smarter policy – one that actually serves working families instead of subsidizing the wealthy.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Jan. 22 directed grid operators to be prepared to call on unused backup generation at data centers and other large facilities as Winter Storm Fern bears down on much of the country this weekend.

The storm is testing the electric system across multiple regions, with heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain spreading across the south-central U.S. and moving east through Sunday. As of Saturday morning, more than 95,000 power outages had been reported nationwide, including roughly 36,000 in Texas and about 10,000 in Virginia.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 35 GW of backup generation capacity remains idle nationwide. DOE said making those resources available, if needed, could help mitigate the risk of rotating outages during periods of extreme cold and high demand.

The draft emergency order, issued under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, would apply to data centers and major industrial or commercial facilities with auxiliary, standby, directly connected or battery storage resources. The order would allow grid operators to call on those resources only after demand response options are exhausted and before a Reliability Coordinator declares an Energy Emergency Alert Level 3.

The action aligns with warnings raised in the North American Electric Reliability Corporation 2025 Winter Reliability Assessment, released in November. The assessment found elevated risk across much of North America of insufficient energy supplies during extreme operating conditions.

NERC urged Reliability Coordinators, Balancing Authorities and Transmission Operators in higher-risk regions to review seasonal operating plans and communication protocols for managing potential supply shortfalls. The assessment also emphasized advancing winterization measures and securing fuel supplies to ensure generation remains available during prolonged cold weather events.

“At this time, NERC is encouraged that industry has taken actions to prepare for what appears to be a very challenging winter storm system,” the organization said in a statement Jan. 22.

In a separate update issued Jan. 23, PJM Interconnection said it has issued precautionary alerts ahead of the winter storm and an extended period of extreme cold expected to affect much of its footprint, which spans 13 states and the District of Columbia. Forecasts call for single-digit temperatures across much of the RTO between Jan. 23 and Jan. 27, with subzero conditions possible in PJM’s Western Region.

PJM peak demand could exceed 130,000 MW for as many as seven consecutive days next week, a duration PJM said it has never experienced during winter operations. Depending on conditions, PJM could also set a new all-time winter peak load on Tuesday, Jan. 27.

PJM said it is taking additional precautions with generation and transmission owners, including issuing Cold Weather Alerts and expanding them to the full region through Jan. 27. The alerts prompt coordination with generators to ensure staffing levels are sufficient, units are fully winterized, and operational limitations are accurately communicated to the grid operator, including startup times and minimum and maximum run durations.

PJM said it is preparing for the possibility that the cold weather could extend into early February and emphasized the importance of fleet performance during sustained, high-load conditions.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-5-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 13:58:54.382734

Known as the “Maui Method,” the process involves submerging damaged batteries — specifically those from electric and hybrid vehicles — in a brine solution. This neutralizes the energy stored within the cells, allowing them to be processed as nonhazardous waste.

Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Amos Lonokailua-Hewett said the initiative demonstrates the power of local innovation .

“The ‘Maui Method’ shows what is possible when innovation, collaboration and expertise come together,” Lonokailua-Hewett said. “Considered one of the first full-scale, nondisaster initiatives of its kind, this operation sets a national and even global precedent for safe and effective EV battery management while protecting our community and environment.”

The technique was successfully deployed late last year during a Wildfire Risk Reduction project in Ukumehame. Over a five-week period in November and December 2025, crews stabilized, decommissioned and destroyed 13 tons of batteries using the method.

The US Environmental Protection Agency has identified the “Maui Method” as the preferred approach for lithium-ion battery disposal.

Justin Marquez, a member of the EPA’s National Lithium-Ion Battery Task Force, noted that prior to this development, there were few safe options for disposal.

“Up till about this point, there really hasn’t been any good way of disposing of lithium-ion batteries. A lot of them are going into people’s trash cans and ending up in landfills and causing tons of fires, burning up garbage trucks all over the place and causing millions of dollars of damage for local entities,” Marquez said. “Our ultimate goal is for this ‘Maui Method,’ or some version of it that accomplishes the same goals, to be rolled out across the entire nation and even potentially globally.”

The urgency to develop such a method arose following the Aug. 8, 2023, Lahaina fire. The disaster left thousands of damaged electric vehicle batteries scattered or buried. With no battery disposal facility on the island and shipping companies refusing to transport the damaged units due to safety risks, local officials were forced to find an on-island solution.

Lithium-ion batteries pose significant risks when damaged, including the potential for thermal runaway, a phenomenon where the battery self-heats and can lead to fire or explosion. These fires are difficult to extinguish with water or foam and emit toxic gases.

The “Maui Method” uses the conductivity of saltwater to slowly and safely pull remaining energy out of the battery, effectively destroying its structure and eliminating safety hazards before transport.

The announcement followed a protracted labor struggle at the paper that culminated in a recent loss for management at the Supreme Court. What does this mean for the future of environmental reporting in Western Pennsylvania?

The Allegheny Front’s Reid Frazier spoke with two recently retired Post-Gazette reporters who covered the environment for the paper: Don Hopey and David Templeton.

Templeton and Hopey worked on a large investigation called Mapping Mortality, which found higher numbers of death for certain diseases in Southwest Pennsylvania than national rates would predict. They also wrote about a large number of rare cancers in Southwest Pennsylvania, which led to a state investigation into fracking’s public health impact.

Templeton retired in 2020. Hopey retired in 2022.

REID FRAZIER: I want to go to each of you and ask your reaction to the paper ceasing publication. Dave, we’ll start with you.

DAVID TEMPLETON: I wasn’t surprised. I was kind of expecting that upon my retirement in 2020. [There were] some rumors that they might shut down at that point, but they did persist. I retired just at the point where things started to get really bad with the contract. So I took a buyout and got out of there.

REID FRAZIER: Did you have an emotional reaction?

DAVID TEMPLETON: I was not upset. I felt bad for my fellow reporters who had been there. I was concerned about what the legacy of the Post-Gazette would be and the lack of investigative tools that are necessary for a community as big as Pittsburgh.

REID FRAZIER: Don, what was your reaction?

DON HOPEY: I also wasn’t surprised. The company followed through on the threat that they had publicly made to pull the plug if it lost the court cases. I think it’s a tragedy for the region in terms of coverage, even though it hasn’t really been doing a whole lot of environmental coverage recently.

REID FRAZIER: So did you guys detect or did you notice how the environmental journalism beat changed over the years? Were there any significant evolutions, did things get better, or worse?

DON HOPEY: There was a time when most of what I was writing was about longwall mining in Washington and Greene counties. Things that I had seen when I worked on the zone edition down in Washington in Greene County for the Pittsburgh Press, I kind of segued very completely into discussions of the Marcellus Shale and stories about Marcellas Shale drilling. So in that way, there was a change in topics, but [it was] again, extractive industries.

REID FRAZIER: Dave, did you detect any evolution of the beat?

DAVID TEMPLETON: Don would know better than I, but I think the continuing issues with extraction industries and the legacy of coal mining in Washington County as people were building and Washington County was growing, (that) became an ever more important issue.

And I think Don was very much aware of that, that more and more people were becoming aware and more activist groups were emerging. They were very helpful. You had to check [what they said] as much as you had to check the industry on details, but they were very active in alerting us reporters about pollution issues and things that they were seeing. So I think it evolved.

Environmental journalism, maybe more so than other forms of journalism, requires someone interested in doing a lot of investigation, a lot of phone calls, record searches, getting into the studies in the archives. This takes a lot of effort. –David Templeton

It started out as something that we reporters were detecting on our own, and then it got to the point where there were a lot of people interested in this and there were a lot of people feeding us information that we had to check out, you know, right or wrong. A lot that led to things that required more investigation.

DON HOPEY: They were interested because things were happening in their backyard. And to them, in terms of their health, in their homes. And that really brought them out of the woodwork and really helped us in terms of our reporting.

REID FRAZIER: After you retired Don and Dave, the P-G no longer had a dedicated environmental journalist. What are your thoughts about the importance of having dedicated environmental journalists where that is their main job and their main area of expertise?

DON HOPEY: I think it’s very important to have that. I don’t see that very much anymore. I think that all the media outlets are facing constrictions because of budgets. I don’t see how that’s going to change. We also, in addition to budget cuts, we see publications like the Post-Gazette going out of business. There’s just fewer of them. Three out of the four newspapers that I’ve worked for in my career no longer exist. The other one has been sold twice since I was there.

[Environmental stories] can be complicated. They can be very scientific. You get to educate yourself, story by story, to the science involved. It can be challenging and you need reporters who are familiar with the science, familiar with subjects. – Don Hopey

DAVID TEMPLETON: I think that environmental journalism, maybe more so than other forms of journalism, requires someone interested in doing a lot of investigation, a lot of phone calls, record searches, getting into the studies in the archives. This takes a lot of effort.

When you don’t have a dedicated newspaper or any other media source that is devoting resources to this, then the public is not hearing the information it needs to hear. For example you see a lot of people supporting fracking statewide. And it does produce some jobs and money for landowners, but they’re not getting the other side, and that information does not come out in the news release generally. It takes a lot of effort to uncover that.

REID FRAZIER: As a follow-up to some of your reporting, Dave and Don, a team of researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found children living near shale gas activities like fracking in Southwest Pennsylvania had a higher risk of developing lymphoma, as well as a strong link between some of the phases of shale-gas development and severe exacerbations, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations for asthma.

DON HOPEY: Yeah, a lot of the stories are not simple stories. They’re not, as Dave said, they’re not the result of a news release. They’re a result of lots of news gathering. They can be complicated. They can be very scientific. You get to educate yourself, story by story, to the science involved. It can be challenging and you need reporters who are familiar with the science, familiar with subjects.

REID FRAZIER: What do you guys think is lost when the paper of record for a given city goes out of business or stops dedicating a reporter to environmental topics?

DON HOPEY: A lot of energy, for lack of a better word, gets lost, I think, in bringing reporters up to speed or reporters coming into an area, parachuting in, and not knowing the terrain, not knowing the geography. There’s also no one to talk to on the staff, no designated person. And getting a reporter up to speed on some of these things is time-consuming and energy-consuming.

DAVID TEMPLETON: It’s just a real detriment to the community and all of those people who are fighting these battles daily and need help and need good information, solid information. There’s a lot of bad information out there about, oh, this happened to me because of that. Well, the reporter is a neutral party that goes to both sides and talks to both sides. Without it, the whole community is lost and the whole community is lacking needed information, both for environmental and health reasons.",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC03744-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 11:59:38.628524

According to a press release, grants of between $25,000 to $100,000 support “assessment, planning, and implementation of efforts to reduce … environmental impact through clean energy generation and energy efficiency measures.” The initiative is managed by the Frankenthaler Foundation in partnership with Environment & Culture Partners, a Washington-based climate advocacy nonprofit, and Green Design Collaborative, a Colorado-based sustainable architectural design firm.

Lise Motherwell, Frankenthaler Foundation Board Chair, said, “We are proud to continue supporting the arts community as it integrates environmental responsibility into its infrastructure and operations. This work not only strengthens individual organizations, but also the broader cultural ecosystem they sustain.”

Elizabeth Smith, the foundation’s Executive Director, said, “Arts organizations across the country are translating their values into action, developing projects that not only improve their energy performance but also model new ways of thinking about stewardship and resourcefulness. Each cycle contributes to shaping a resilient, low-carbon cultural landscape.”

The initiative, now in its sixth annual granting cycle, is structured in four granting tiers: Catalyst Grants, Scoping Grants, Technical Assistance Grants, and Implementation Grants.

Visual arts organizations with annual budgets under $500,000 are eligible for Catalyst Grants of up to $20,000, for new or smaller-scale energy efficiency projects. Scoping Grants of up to $25,000 provide support for assessing ways to implement energy efficiency. Following a comprehensive assessment, Technical Assistance Grants award up to $50,000 for further evaluation on developing energy efficiency projects. Implementation Grants of up to $100,000 fund planned infrastructure upgrades for reductions in carbon emissions and overall energy usage.

Among 74 visual arts organizations receiving $3.4 million in project awards in 2025, Texas Scoping Grant recipients included Ballroom Marfa, The Contemporary Austin, and DiverseWorks in Houston. DiverseWorks partnered with Lawndale in Houston to develop its headquarters as “the first carbon net-positive facility for the arts in the city,” according to the FCI project description. The Contemporary Austin received funds to help in preservation of the historic Driscoll Villa building at its Laguna Gloria location, along with climate control improvements in all its buildings. Ballroom Marfa received funding for assessing energy efficiency upgrades in its newly acquired 1920s-era building.

Past Texas institutions to receive grants include the Arlington Museum of Art and the Chinati Foundation in 2024, Artpace in 2023, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston in 2022, and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth and the Nasher Sculpture Center in 2021.

Since the nationwide initiative was launched in 2021, the Frankenthaler Foundation has awarded $17.5 million to 249 visual arts organizations in 40 states, for 318 energy efficiency-related projects promoting “sustainable cultural infrastructure,” according to the foundation’s website.

Sarah Sutton, Environment & Culture Partners CEO, said, “FCI grantees continue to show extraordinary leadership in implementing practical energy solutions that yield long-term benefits … strengthening both institutions and the communities they serve while demonstrating that environmental progress and cultural vitality go hand in hand.”

Examples of visual arts-focused institutions eligible to apply for grants are museums, archives, colleges and university art programs, artist residency programs, community art centers, and other artist-endowed foundations.",https://glasstire.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1160_frankenthaler-driscoll-Laguna_Gloria.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 11:59:49.230681

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) “2025 Global Change Outlook” finds the world on track to exceed key climate thresholds under current policies, even as renewable energy expands rapidly. Released amid stalled global cooperation and the United States’ withdrawal from major climate commitments, the report projects continued emissions growth and dangerous levels of warming by the end of the century.

The outlook is based on MIT’s Integrated Global Systems Model, which links population growth, economic activity, energy use and international policy decisions to changes in the climate system. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has described it as “a comprehensive tool built to analyze interactions among humans and the climate system.”

“The current trends are very concerning,” said Sergey Paltsev, co-author of the “Global Change Outlook” and deputy director of MIT’s Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy. “We are nowhere near the stated goals of the Paris Agreement.”

Under current trends, the model projects a rapid expansion of renewable energy, led by wind and solar, with renewables supplying more than 70 percent of global electricity by 2050—up from roughly 40 percent today. It also finds that, despite U.S. efforts to revive the coal industry, global coal consumption is expected to continue declining.

Those gains from renewable energy are largely offset by ongoing economic and population growth. Global greenhouse gas emissions are expected to rise until around 2030, driven primarily by growth in developing countries, while emissions in developed nations, as well as in China and India, remain largely stagnant. Much of this increase comes from continued use of liquid fuels and natural gas. Between 2030 and 2050, emissions are projected to decline slowly, only to rise again later in the century, partly due to agricultural emissions linked to population growth.

With no significant emissions reductions on the horizon, the model projects global temperatures are likely to surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next few years, reach roughly 1.8 degrees by 2050, and approach 3 degrees by 2100. These projections represent the model’s “middle of the road path,” or most likely outcome. Across hundreds of simulations, some outcomes show far greater warming, while others fall below that central estimate.

“The findings align with other models and with my own modeling from about a decade ago,” said Ross Salawitch, an atmospheric researcher and climate modeler at the University of Maryland. According to Salawitch, political challenges and energy demand exceeding early projections explain why emissions reductions are not yet clearly reflected in current long-term projections.

More recent independent analyses point to similar outcomes. Rhodium Group estimates “middle-of-the-road” warming of about 2.7 degrees by century’s end, while Climate Action Tracker projects 2.5 degrees to 2.9 degrees, depending on future policy.

Keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees has long been a central goal of the international climate framework. Exceeding the threshold risks triggering critical tipping points and causing irreversible damage. The Paris goal of 1.5 degrees is a global average that masks regional extremes that are, in some cases, two to three times larger, meaning many places experience average warming of 3 degrees to 4.5 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit).

The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service report released last week ranked 2025 as the third-warmest year on record, just a hair cooler than 2023 and within striking distance of 2024, the hottest year on record. Together, the past three years averaged more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, the first time any three-year stretch has crossed that threshold.

“Any increase in temperature is an indication that the global system is taking on more energy,” said Adam Schlosser, co-author of the “Global Change Outlook” and deputy director at MIT’s Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy. “That energy has to go somewhere and it shows up as more intense and/or frequent extreme events.”

In addition to fueling deadly heat waves that already kill over half a million people each year, rising global temperatures are projected to intensify extreme weather, make precipitation more erratic, increase the risk of drought and disrupt agricultural production worldwide. The outlook warns these shifts would also accelerate biodiversity loss.

Despite the grim outlook, there is still reason for hope. The report also outlines “accelerated actions”—projections of emissions and climate outcomes if strong economic and policy commitments are implemented.

“Two years ago, governments promised to triple renewable energy, double efficiency and act on methane.” Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist at Climate Analytics, said in a statement. “Our results show if they achieved this by 2035 it would be a game-changer, quickly slowing the rate of warming in the next decade and lowering global warming this century from 2.6 degrees to about 1.7 degrees.

Achieving rapid electrification and decarbonization will demand substantial public and private investment, coordinated global commitments and a robust regulatory framework. “There’s no one magic bullet,” Paltsev said.

Even if these actions are realized, warming is still expected to exceed 1.5 degrees by 2050, under almost every IGSM projection. In some scenarios, by 2150, global temperatures could return to 1.5 degrees after a brief period of cooling.

“We are more than likely going to overshoot,” Schlosser said. “The question then becomes for how long and how strong.”

“It’s not a reason to give up hope or stop the necessary action,” Paltsev said. “Limiting every degree possible matters, even every tenth of a degree.” Small differences can determine how many lives are lost, how much land becomes uninhabitable and how severe the damage ultimately becomes.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Houston-1024x681.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 12:59:12.607728

We may never know what this TikTok deal entails, how it happened, or if it is legally compliant.
Should the questions of the deal’s compliance with the law remain unanswered, a future administration should direct the Department of Justice to examine the deal and its legality.","The Thursday night press release announcing the joint venture appears to be the only information that will be officially released about the change in TikTok’s management, an app that has more than 170 million U.S. users. As of 4 p.m. ET on January 23, there appear to be no updates related to TikTok on the White House website or on the press pages of the three newly named lead investors—Silverlake, Oracle, and MGX. Oracle, a publicly traded company, shows no new filings on the SEC website.

The details of the TikTok deal may never be known, and Congress and the American people are left with more questions than answers about what actually transpired.

The saga of TikTok matters because it encapsulates every abusive practice of the Trump administration: unprecedented nonenforcement of the law, sweeping claims of executive power, an opaque process enriching some Trump favorites, a deal that may not comply with the law, and total secrecy—all while Congress says nothing. Regardless of how Americans feel about banning TikTok, President Trump’s actions on this were among his first as president, and his handling of this deal is emblematic of the assault on the rule of law that has defined his second term.

The TikTok saga is a laundry list of the Trump administration’s preferred abuses

The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act was passed by Congress on an overwhelming bipartisan basis, signed by President Joe Biden, and upheld by the Supreme Court. The law took effect on January 19, 2025, but President Trump has refused to enforce it, promising after the 2024 election to save TikTok from the legislation. His first batch of executive orders included one that paused enforcement of the TikTok ban for 75 days and directed the attorney general to issue letters promising not to prosecute companies that let TikTok back online. These actions blatantly violated the letter of the law, which includes no mechanism for presidential delay. It immediately signaled Trump’s willingness to flaunt the government’s legal authority and ignore his own constitutional duty as president to ensure laws are “faithfully executed.”

Next, the president claimed unprecedented executive powers to justify his actions. In July, following Freedom of Information Act litigation, the U.S. Department of Justice released the letters it sent to companies promising not to prosecute them if they restored TikTok. The department argued that enforcing the TikTok ban would impede President Trump’s duty to protect national security and U.S. foreign affairs—an argument that Harvard Law School Professor Jack Goldsmith called “an astounding assertion of executive power—maybe the broadest I have ever seen any president or Justice Department make, ever, in any context.” Trump issued a total of five separate orders delaying enforcement of the TikTok ban.

When a TikTok divestment deal was finally announced, the selection of the three managing investors benefited one of Trump’s supporters and foreign governments that have been trying to curry favor with the president. It is unclear how these lead investors were selected to purchase TikTok despite reported higher offers from others. The deal reportedly values TikTok at $14 billion—far below what analysts believe it is worth. There are many questions that remain unanswered about how the managing investors were selected and how the valuation was determined.

What’s more, the TikTok deal may not meet the law’s requirements. While it seemingly addresses foreign ownership limits and data sharing, the law also requires no operational relationship with former owners, specifically regarding the content recommendation algorithm. The press release states, “The Joint Venture will retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data. The content recommendation algorithm will be secured in Oracle’s U.S. cloud environment” but provides no additional information that allows observers to judge if the law’s requirement has been met. The press release does confirm that “TikTok global’s U.S. entities will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.” That means ByteDance—or BD TikTok USA LLC or TT Commerce & Global Services, as they are referred to in the newly updated TikTok Terms of Service and Privacy Policy—will continue running advertising for TikTok USDS. Since that is how the site makes its money, this almost certainly constitutes the “maintenance of any operational relationship” with “formerly affiliated entities that are controlled by a foreign adversary” that is prohibited by the law.

The Trump administration negotiated this deal in near total secrecy. The law does not require disclosure, and the U.S. secretary of the treasury has called the agreement “commercial terms between two private parties,” which seems to indicate these terms will never be made public. Beyond compliance with the law, there are very real and important questions that need to be answered about the new TikTok USDS. The press release states, “The safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, and Lemon8, and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the U.S” but does not list those apps and websites. The TikTok ban law names TikTok but it also names ByteDance and includes all of its apps, of which there are at least 10 more in the United States that could be affected—those that Apple removed from the app store in the brief period when it complied with the law. In another case, and one of real public interest, Trump’s September executive order mentions that “[t]he Attorney General or the Attorney General’s designee shall serve as the United States Government’s representative under the Framework Agreement,” but there has been no further information on that U.S. government representative and any corporate powers or information they may be granted. Finally, there is no information about any fee the U.S. government would be paid for brokering the deal or the possibility that the U.S. government could take an ownership stake in the new entity, known as a “golden share,” which this administration has now taken in several companies. Americans and Congress alike will probably remain in the dark about whether the deal complies with the law, the scope of government involvement in this new entity, and even whether the government will take money or an ownership stake in TikTok USDS.

Unfortunately, the law has no mechanism to ensure the divestment meets its requirements. It only requires the president to certify compliance with the law, which Trump did in his September executive order with minimal details and many open questions remaining. There are few if any legal avenues to pursue since few entities—possibly only TikTok—have standing to sue if the deal fails to comply with the law.

All this has happened with nary a peep from Congress, which passed this law overwhelmingly—with Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) one of the few raising many of the unanswered questions about the TikTok deal. The lack of members of Congress willing to call out the president for ignoring a law they themselves passed is disappointing, but unsurprising. Beyond partisanship, the executive branch’s flaunting of the law while Congress does nothing has shredded the latter’s credibility. Congress has an opportunity to demand details about the deal, and they should do so immediately.

We may never know what this TikTok deal entails, how it happened, or if it is legally compliant. The Trump administration could and should release all the details and participate in congressional oversight hearings. Even though the deal has closed, these questions still deserve to be answered, and they represent a roadmap for future congressional investigations about abuse of power, secrecy, and flaunting existing laws—all the hallmarks Americans have come to expect from this administration.

That’s when the system operator anticipates it will reach the highest winter demand in its history.
The Texas grid, by comparison, has added many new large battery storage systems and solar farms.
During recent winter storms, the freezing temperatures shut down many power plants connected to the PJM and Texas grids.
In February 2021, the main Texas grid experienced a huge failure that left many electricity customers without power for days.","Unlike what sometimes unfolds with hurricanes and other extreme weather events, this weekend’s winter storm may not immediately cause power outages and other electrical problems.

Energy experts warned that the worst effects of the potentially catastrophic storm could come on Monday and Tuesday in areas like Texas and the Mid-Atlantic States, after snow and ice accumulate on tree branches and power lines, eventually causing them to snap and damage electrical equipment.

The damage could be compounded by sharp increases in electricity demand at the start of the week. Peak energy usage typically occurs in the early morning and evening hours on weekdays, when consumers fire up their appliances and raise the temperature on their thermostats as they get ready for work and school, and again after they return home.

“Just because the snow stops, that doesn’t mean the worst is over,” said Wei Du, a managing consultant for PA Consulting, which advises utilities, investors and other in the energy industry. “That’s frequently not the case.”

Analysis by ICF, an energy consulting firm, shows that the main grid in Texas, which is run by Electric Reliability Council of Texas, will hit its peak demand between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Monday. Across the Mid-Atlantic region, on the grid managed by PJM, which includes 13 states and the District of Columbia, demand is expected to crest from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Tuesday. That’s when the system operator anticipates it will reach the highest winter demand in its history.

PJM also warned customers that it may extend its winter weather alert through Jan. 30. That has prompted utilities and government officials to call on large energy users like data centers to prepare to reduce the amount of power they take from the grid.

“Definitely in the PJM system things are going to be extremely thin, and frankly we are concerned,” said George Katsigiannakis, a vice president at ICF.

The anticipated demand on Tuesday is almost 10 percent higher than the highest demand last winter, Mr. Katsigiannakis said. But PJM has not added many new power plants, batteries and other resources to its system. The Texas grid, by comparison, has added many new large battery storage systems and solar farms.

During recent winter storms, the freezing temperatures shut down many power plants connected to the PJM and Texas grids.

In February 2021, the main Texas grid experienced a huge failure that left many electricity customers without power for days. More than 200 people died in that storm.

Then, over the Christmas holidays in 2022, about a quarter of the natural gas power plants in PJM’s service area failed as snow, wind and subzero temperatures froze natural gas pipelines. Various types of power plants — fossil fuel and renewables like solar and wind — failed during both the 2021 and 2022 storms. But in PJM’s case, about 70 percent of the units were fueled by natural gas.

Mr. Katsigiannakis said managers of the Texas and PJM grids have tried to strengthen their systems to withstand the extreme winter weather, as neighboring energy networks in the Midwest do. Such potent winter storms had not been as common in Texas or at PJM, which extends from around the Chicago area to Virginia Beach.

The powerful storm this week began making its way east from the Rocky Mountains, and is expected to drop snow, sleet and freezing rain on an area that runs from the Southwest into New England, and is home to more than 160 million people.

The grid managers said they have sufficient reserves to meet the anticipated demand over the weekend and next week but are preparing for a storm that is worse than expected. Depending on the actual path it takes, the wintry mix could pose challenges for multiple grid systems, straining resources.

“This is a formidable arctic cold front coming our way, and it will impact our neighboring systems as much as it affects PJM,” Mike Bryson, senior vice president of operations for PJM, said in a statement.

The Edison Electric Institute, a utility industry organization, said top executives at its member companies were coordinating responses with state and federal agencies to minimize power outages.

Part of the strategy includes tamping down demand from data centers that support development of artificial intelligence. These facilities are increasingly using a larger share of the country's electricity, particularly in places like Ohio and Virginia, where forecasters are expecting snow squalls and freezing rain.

On Thursday, the energy secretary, Chris Wright, said the federal government was drafting orders that unused backup generators at data centers and “other major facilities” could be deployed to help prevent blackouts.

The orders would let grid operators force data centers to run on backup generators as a “last resort,” after all other supplies are exhausted. Data centers generally are not set up to feed energy back onto grids, but they can power their own operations from the generators, reducing the amount of electricity they draw from the grid.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/business/24biz-power-outage/24biz-power-outage-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 10:59:56.466589

“Under these extreme weather conditions, don’t do anything crazy,” St. Tammany Fire Protection District No. 1 Chief Chris Kaufmann said.

Using an extension cord to plug in a space heater or placing it within three feet of anything combustible is what Kaufmann might consider crazy.

“And don’t leave it unattended, because something can happen, a pet can knock it over, and before you know it, you have a fire started,” Kaufmann said.

He also said no matter how cold it gets, never use a gas stove to heat your home.

“It could cause carbon monoxide poisoning,” Kaufmann said. “You don’t want to create that situation.”

Carbon monoxide is emitted by gas-powered appliances, including generators, which is why if you end up relying on one to keep your house warm during a power outage, it should always be placed 20 feet away from the home.

“Whether it comes through a window or a door, it gets into an environment that you’re sitting in, or laying in, and you won’t even know it’s happening.” Kaufmann said.

Unless you have a carbon monoxide detector installed in your home, there is no way to know you are in danger until it’s too late.

“It’s odorless. It puts you to sleep. It makes you tired, and before you know it, you pass out and you don’t wake up,” Kaufmann said.

The department is also asking people to check on elderly friends, family, and neighbors to make sure they are prepared as well.

CDX Role Definitions: 1.","Introduction

The CAMD Business System (CBS) is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Industrial Processes and Power Division system for managing environmental compliance, allowance trading, and emissions reporting. Due to Federal and EPA security mandates, both ECMPS 2.0 and CBS will use EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) with Login.gov identity and access management solution.

This page outlines steps and serves a resource for users to begin the registration process in CDX ahead of the ECMPS 2.0 and CBS launch. Additional information and steps will be added when ECMPS 2.0 and the updated CBS are launched. For now, users should follow the CDX registration process only when instructed to do so by EPA or their Designated Representative (DR). At this time, users will not be able to link their existing CBS accounts with CBS nor log into the new ECMPS 2.0. As a reminder, if you have been beta testing, any CDX, Login.gov, or ECMPS test/beta account information will not translate into production, so you will have to follow the steps below in order to access the new system when it goes live.

CBS-CDX Transition Process

Important Notice: CBS will be updated to work with CDX in Q1 2026. We strongly encourage all users to begin registering with CDX as soon as the bulk registration process is started to prepare for this transition. EPA will email users directly when they are able to begin this process.

Why Register Early?

Ensures smooth transition when CBS-CDX integration is released

Allows time to resolve any registration or verification issues

Enables familiarity with the new authentication system

Facilitates bulk pre-registration of key personnel

Transition Timeline:

Phase 1 (Current): Bulk pre-registration of Initial Authorizers (IA), primarily Designated Representatives (DRs)

Phase 2: Extended user registration of other users types (alternate DRs, agents) by requesting sponsorship from IA

Phase 3: Full CBS-CDX integration release

Key Changes for Users:

CDX Registration Required: You must register in CDX/Login.gov before being assigned as a representative, agent, consultant, MATS Responsible Official in CBS

Consultant Access: Consultants will also need to be registered in CDX/login.gov before being assigned facilities

Unified Login: Use CDX/Login.gov credentials to access both CBS and ECMPS 2.0

Organization-Based Access: Users must have a CDX role with a CDX organizations

Role-Based Permissions: DRs and Alternate DRs (ADRs) can only assign agents who have a role that shares the same CDX organization

CBS provides secure access to various environmental programs including:

Allowance Trading and Transfers

Compliance Reporting and Management

General Account Management

Facility (Certificate of Representation) Management

Emissions Data Submission Access

CDX CBS Production

What to do Now

Before the Q1 2026 release ensure you have:

Current CBS Production Access: Verify you have up-to-date and appropriate access in CBS production

Correct Email Address: Use the SAME email address for CDX and Login.gov that is currently in CBS production - this is critical for proper account linking

Updated Information: Ensure all personal information (name, email, agent relationships) is current in CBS production

Key Notes and Best Practices

Organization ID Management

Critical Importance: CDX Organization ID (Org ID) of your role must match for all people you work with (DRs, ADRs, agents, consultants)

Obtaining an Organization ID (applies only to Initial Authorizers, likely DRs):

Primary Method: Initial Authorizers (IAs), which will likely be Designated Representatives, will receive an email from EPA directly with additional information on how to create their Org ID. Once an Org ID is established, anyone in the relationship hierarchy of a DR (i.e, ADRs and agents), should utilize the same Org ID when registering in CDX.

Finding Organization IDs (after an Org ID is already established):

Primary Method: CDX Manage Page - Click ""My CDX"" tab, then click the gear icon labeled ""Manage"" in the green services bar to view all your program services, organizations, and roles

Secondary Method: CDX Profile page - Shows Organization ID but not role-organization-program service connections

Important: Use BOTH the Manage page and Profile page to determine the correct Organization ID to communicate with others in your group

CBS General Account page for DRs and ADRs

CBS Certificate of Representation page

CBS Manage Agent Relationship section for agents

Role Understanding: Understand whether you need Initial Authorizer, Sponsor, Submitter, or Preparer role based on your responsibilities for each org (if you need multiple)

See User Types and Roles

Keep Track: Write down your Organization ID(s) and share with team members

No Direct Org-Facility Connection: CDX organizations are NOT tied to specific facilities or plants. Access is entirely people and relationship-based; facilities are accessed through individual user relationships with DRs/ADRs

Email Address Requirements

Same Email: Must use the SAME email address that is currently used in CBS production

Existing CDX Account: If you already have a production CDX account, continue using that email address and update your CBS production email to match if different

Update First: If your email differs, update it in CBS production BEFORE registering the program service in CDX

Login.gov Consistency: Use the same email for Login.gov account creation

Network Updates: Notify everyone in your network to update their information in CBS production

Account Limitations

One Account Rule: Do not create multiple CDX accounts. If you already have an existing CDX production account that you use to report for another EPA program, use that login information to add the EASEY program service to your account (instructions on how to do this appear below). Ensure the email in that CDX account is the same as your CBS account; otherwise, update the CBS account email address to match.

Transition Process and Early Registration

Transition Support

EPA provides dedicated support during this transition period:

Registration Assistance: Help with CDX account setup and verification

Organization Coordination: Support for establishing and managing CDX organizations

Role Assignment: Guidance on appropriate CDX roles for your CBS responsibilities

Issue Resolution: Priority support for transition-related problems

Phase 1: Bulk Pre-Registration of Initial Authorizers

Target Users: Designated Representatives (DRs) and key organizational contacts

Process Overview:

EPA will work with organizations to identify primary DRs who should become Initial Authorizers

Bulk invitation emails will be sent to selected DRs. EPA will reach out to users directly to initiate this process; do not attempt to register for the EASEY program service without being instructed to do so by EPA

DRs will complete the registration process to establish CDX organizations

This creates the foundation for subsequent user registrations within each organization

Phase 2: Extended user registration of other users

Target Users: Alternate representatives, agents, consultants, MATS Responsible Officials

Process Overview:

After being instructed to do so by EPA, Initial Authorizers (likely the DRs) will communicate the organization ID that they created or registered with and pass that information down to other users

It would be beneficial to approve another sponsor in the organization first so they can also help add people into the organization

Other users will register with the appropriate role and use to organization ID that was provided

The Initial Authorizer and sponsors will approve or reject requests into the organization

CDX Account Registration Process

There are a few paths for CDX registration depending on your role and situation. Choose the path that matches your needs:

Path 1: Initial Authorizer Registration (DRs: Bulk Pre-Registration Only)

When to use: You are a DR who has received a pre-registration email from CDX as part of EPA's bulk pre-registration process.

Important: This registration path is exclusively for DRs (or those previously approved individuals who have been delegated authority by their DR) who receive direct invitation emails from CDX and instruction from EPA.

Bulk Pre-Registration Process: EPA is conducting bulk pre-registration of selected DRs to establish organizational foundations in CDX. Only DRs who receive a pre-registration invitation email should use this process.

Step 1: Wait for CDX Pre-Registration Email and EPA instruction Email

You will receive a pre-registration invitation email directly from CDX as well as a separate email from EPA with additional information

The CDX email will contain your unique registration link

Do not attempt to register without receiving this official invitation

Step 2: Registration Process

Click link in email response to start registration

Either log-into your existing CDX production account or create a unique username for your account

Click ""Confirm Registration"" if you are creating a new CDX account

Click ""Proceed to Login.gov""

Step 3: Login.gov Setup

If new to Login.gov: Click ""Create an Account"" and follow steps

Complete multi-factor authentication setup

If existing Login.gov user: Sign in with existing credentials

Step 4: User Information

Fill out personal information

Answer three security questions

Submit information

Step 5: Organization Setup

Important: Check with your network before adding new organization as there may be an organization that exists with other EPA programs

Search for existing organization by Organization ID first

If truly new organization needed: Use ""request that we add your organization"" link

Step 6: Identity Verification

Complete LexisNexis verification process

If LexisNexis fails: Print and complete ESA (Electronic Signature Agreement)

Mail the ESA by following the instructions on the ESA. Note the address on that form; do not mail it to any other address.

Step 7: Approval Process

Your role will be automatically processed as part of the bulk pre-registration

If you experience any delays, email cbs-support@camdsupport.com

Subject: ""CDX Bulk Pre-Registration - Status Inquiry""

Include: First name, last name, email, CDX username

Step 8: Confirmation

Receive email: ""Your Central Data Exchange (CDX) CDX Role has been activated by EPA""

Log into CDX to confirm active status

Find your Organization ID using both ""My Profile"" and the Manage page (""My CDX"" tab → gear icon ""Manage"") to see role-program service connections

Path 2: Self-Registration (Requiring Sponsorship)

When to use: You do not have an existing CDX account. This should be done AFTER the assigned Initial Authorizer has fully registered.

Step 1: Start Registration

Go to CDX

Click ""Register with CDX""

Accept Terms and Conditions

Step 2: Program Selection

Type ""EASEY"" to filter results

Select ""EASEY: Emissions and Allowance System for Energy""

Step 3: Role Selection

Select appropriate role:

Sponsor: If you're a DR/ADR or MATS official with sponsorship responsibilities

Submitter: If you submit data as an agent or are a MATS official

Preparer: If you prepare data as a consultant

Step 4: Account Creation

Enter unique username

Click ""Proceed to Login.gov""

Complete Login.gov setup (same as Path 1)

Step 5: Organization Selection

Search for existing organization by Organization ID

Do not search by using a company name or other identifier as this is less reliable; Org ID will guarantee you're added to the correct relationship hierarchy

Critical: Use same email address as in CBS production

Do NOT create new organization

Step 6: Sponsorship Request

Provide email of Sponsor in your organization

Sponsor receives email and must approve request

Sponsor logs in and signs Sponsor Agreement

Step 7: Complete Registration

Click link in email once sponsorship is approved

Complete LexisNexis/ESA verification

Email EPA if approval needed

Path 3: Adding EASEY to Existing CDX Account

When to use: You already have a CDX account with Login.gov but need to add the EASEY program service to access CBS. This should be done AFTER the assigned Initial Authorizer has fully registered.

Step 1: Login to CDX

Go to CDX

Sign in with your existing Login.gov credentials

Step 2: Add Program Service

Navigate to ""My CDX"" tab

Click ""Add Program Service"" or similar option

Type ""EASEY"" to filter results

Select ""EASEY: Emissions and Allowance System for Energy""

Step 3: Role Selection

Select appropriate role:

Sponsor: If you're a DR/ADR or MATS official with sponsorship responsibilities

Submitter: If you submit data as an agent or are a MATS official

Preparer: If you prepare data as a consultant

Step 4: Organization Selection

Search for existing organization by Organization ID

Critical: Ensure this matches your team's CDX organization

Do NOT create new organization

Step 5: Sponsorship Request

Provide email of Sponsor or Initial Authorizer in your organization

Sponsor receives email and must approve request

Sponsor logs in and signs Sponsor Agreement

Step 6: Complete Process

Click link in email once sponsorship is approved

Verify role is active in CDX

Final Steps for All Paths:

Sponsorship Requests:

Initial Authorizers and sponsors can approve requests by going to the ""Sponsorship"" tab in CDX.

The PJM Interconnection - the largest U.S. regional grid which serves 67 million people in the East and Mid-Atlantic - reported temporary spikes in spot wholesale electricity prices to nearly $3,000 per megawatt hour on Saturday morning from earlier levels of less than $200 per MWh.

Prices soared as stormy weather and temperatures hovering around 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 C) pushed up electricity demand and prompted some operators to shut in natural gas production in key basins, while grid companies also faced constraints on gas pipeline supply.

Faced with constricted gas supplies, regional grid operators in the U.S. are asking producers such as coal-fired power plants to boost their output, according to grid operations reports.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) called on power plants to maximize output and curtailed electricity exports in a territory that stretches across 15 states in the Midwest and South and Manitoba, Canada.

MISO's all-hands-on-deck emergency action is designed to avoid capacity shortfalls as some power plants are forced offline or reduce their output because of freezing temperatures, alerting utilities to be prepared to produce as much electricity as possible.

MISO spot wholesale electricity prices soared to nearly $500 per MWh in MISO's Minnesota hub, as the upper Midwest experienced transmission bottlenecks across high-voltage power lines. By contrast spot electricity prices in MISO's southern territory were less than $50 per MWh.

In New England, fuel oil generation kicked into high gear to help the six-state region's electric grid to conserve natural gas, its top fuel source.

Early Saturday, oil-fired generation accounted for 26% of the New England grid's output, compared with a typical level of about 1% or less, ISO New England's operations display showed. Natural gas accounted for 28% of the grid's generation output.

New England spot electricity prices were more than $300 per MWh, or about double the price on Friday.

Over the past decade, India has made rapid progress in renewable capacity addition. Installed renewable energy capacity has grown from 76 GW in 2014 to over 226 GW by mid-2025, underscoring the scale of the transition already underway. However, industry leaders now argue that the next phase must focus on quality, resilience, and integration, rather than capacity alone.

Decentralised Renewables Seen as the Next Growth Engine

Calling for a sharper policy focus, Radhika Choudhary, Co-founder and Director, Freyr Energy, said the upcoming Budget should prioritise decentralised renewable energy, particularly distributed and rooftop solar. She noted that decentralised systems can strengthen grid resilience, reduce transmission losses, and improve energy access in semi-urban and rural regions. According to Choudhary, these solutions are well positioned to drive the next phase of renewable growth.

In addition, she advocated targeted incentives for battery storage, domestic solar manufacturing, and digital energy platforms. Measures such as interest subvention, simplified GST structures, and faster project approvals could significantly boost rooftop solar adoption, she added.

Policy Support Sought for Low-Carbon Technologies and Green Finance

Meanwhile, Bharath Jairaj, Executive Program Director, WRI India, emphasised the need for stronger policy and financial support to scale low-carbon technologies, especially in hard-to-abate sectors. He called for expanded tax credits, guarantees, and R&D funding, along with greater investments in Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) pilot projects, electrolyser manufacturing, technology transfer, and workforce skilling.

Jairaj also proposed the creation of a green bank or credit guarantee institution to mobilise capital for battery storage, green hydrogen, and industrial electrification. In parallel, he highlighted the importance of Just Transition Funds for coal-dependent regions to support an equitable energy transition.

Strengthening Domestic Supply Chains and Industrial Decarbonisation

Beyond finance, Jairaj urged policymakers to deploy pooled procurement funds to accelerate adoption of green steel and green cement, while also investing in critical minerals and solar village initiatives. He further recommended expanding the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to cover the entire solar value chain, a move he said would help reduce import dependence and strengthen domestic manufacturing.

Grid Reliability and Discom Reforms Take Centre Stage

Shifting focus from capacity addition to system performance, Akshay Hiranandani, CEO, Serentica Renewables, stressed that India’s renewable strategy must now prioritise grid reliability and market viability. He flagged the urgent need to fix discom finances, noting that weak balance sheets have stalled nearly 50 GW of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Budgetary support, he said, is also essential to accelerate transmission expansion and grid modernisation, particularly through the deployment of advanced grid technologies.

Energy Storage as a Core Grid Asset

Hiranandani further argued that energy storage should be treated as a grid asset under the control of system operators. He highlighted Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for grid-connected battery systems as a critical requirement to scale storage capacity and enable round-the-clock renewable power integration.

From Capacity Growth to System Readiness

Collectively, industry voices ahead of Budget 2026 are calling for a shift in focus—from headline capacity numbers to system readiness, financial health, and decentralised deployment.

Legislators must have thought as much in 1975 when they passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, creating CAFE.
""We think the rule is giving freedom to manufacturers to build the vehicles that people want to buy,” he said.

“We can't let that happen.” As DOT secretary, Duffy has to contend with much more than car engines, and the last third of the panel touched on some of his other responsibilities.","Weeks after the Trump administration put the Biden administration’s strengthening of fuel-economy standards in reverse, Trump’s transportation secretary defended the move as a matter of fairness to fossil fuels.

In a talk at the Washington Auto Show’s public policy day on Thursday, DOT Secretary Sean Duffy called the previous administration’s phased increase in average fuel economy rules “a backdoor way to an EV mandate.”

Changes to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards finalized in June 2024 would have required automakers to meet a fleetwide average of 50.4 miles per gallon by the 2031 model year. The changes the DOT announced in December would lower that 2031 goal to 34.5MPG.

Speaking with John Bozzella, president and CEO of Washington-based trade group Alliance for Automotive Innovation, Duffy said the Biden requirement—which he incorrectly described as a 60MPG standard, an error he’s made before—set a goal unattainable with internal combustion engines. ""The problem is, nobody can meet that,” he said, justifying a combustion-compatible rewrite of CAFE on the grounds that Congress enacted it with combustion engines in mind.

Legislators must have thought as much in 1975 when they passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, creating CAFE. But the text of the Energy Independence and Security Act that raised and expanded these standards in 2007 has numerous mentions of hybrid, battery-electric, and even fuel-cell vehicles.

Duffy did not mention another recent change to CAFE: the budget-reconciliation bill that last year killed off Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for EVs and other clean-energy expenses, and also reduced the fine for CAFE violations to zero, going back to 2022 model-year vehicles.

“We want fuel efficiency,” Duffy said. “That's a great thing.”

But the US government is now leaving the value of that up to the market, as Duffy reaffirmed more than once in his roughly 45-minute conversation with Bozzella. ""We think the rule is giving freedom to manufacturers to build the vehicles that people want to buy,” he said. He expects this to lead to cheaper cars, which in turn will prompt people to upgrade from older, less efficient, and less safe vehicles.

The Trump administration, however, has not been so free-market-minded in other areas of energy policy. It’s denied permits to solar and wind power-generation projects, attempted to halt construction of already-approved offshore wind projects (courts keep setting aside those stop-work orders, allowing work to resume), and is leveraging US military action in Venezuela to force the opening of that country’s oil industry to American firms.

While allowing that he expects some customers to keep buying electric or partially electric vehicles—“I have no problem with EVs and hybrids,” he said—Duffy suggested that EVs were more of a niche product propped up by Biden-administration policies. “Northern Wisconsin, where it's rural and cold, they don't work so well,” he said.

Stats published by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation show that EVs made up 5.33% of car sales in Duffy’s home state from September 2024 to September 2025, the most recent 12-month period available. The nationwide EV share over that timeframe was 8.96%, which is far below EV adoption in other countries such as Norway, where, notwithstanding many rural and cold areas, that figure now stands at 96%.

China vs. the US: An Unfair Comparison?

Bozzella quizzed Duffy at some length about another country now making a sharp turn toward vehicle electrification, China. The secretary professed respect for China’s efforts; ""They pay for 100 engineers compared to our five, they get this remarkable innovation, and they develop good products."" But he also said “massive” government support for Chinese EV manufacturers made this an unfair competition and raised concerns about data privacy.

Duffy criticized Canada’s recent move to allow the sale of 49,000 Chinese EVs at a tariff rate of just 6.1% instead of the current 100%, saying Canadians “will one day regret” that decision, and that other countries following similar policies would do the same. “You'll see the world be gouged by China, and they'll control all the manufacturing,” he said. “We can't let that happen.”

As DOT secretary, Duffy has to contend with much more than car engines, and the last third of the panel touched on some of his other responsibilities. He predicted that self-driving car technology could make highways more efficient through closer spacing of vehicles; voiced his enthusiasm about two other kinds of electric vehicles, drones and eVTOL air taxis; and said he looked forward to the prospect of quieter supersonic passenger flights over land.

On a more somber note, he observed that it had been almost a year since the mid-air collision over the Potomac River that killed 67 people and recalled how he had since met with so many relatives of those lost. “I think about safety all the time,” Duffy said.

Duffy’s plans for the coming year include making transportation part of celebrations of America’s 250th birthday. He said the DOT is working on one event in particular that would be “the coolest damn thing you've ever seen in DC,” but which will first require Congressional approval.

Among the principal contributors to the cost-of-living crisis are power bills. For millions, the cost of keeping the lights, heating, and cooling on feels like “a second rent,” a problem that the explosive growth in the development and use of AI and associated data center capacity appears poised to aggravate.

The nation’s capital is no exception. A quarter of residents in the District of Columbia are unable to pay their power bill and in debt to the city’s private electricity company Pepco, which prioritizes short-term profits over affordable service. In 2024, the utility sent disconnection notices to 187,000 customers, threatening to shut off their electricity if they did not pay their arrears in full and forcing them to choose between, for instance, keeping their home safe and comfortable and food fresh or making their car payment.

Thankfully, we have a proven alternative–public ownership of power–that has worked for decades in thousands of towns and cities and is being actively pursued in the District and other communities across the country.

Alongside rent, home prices, dining, and entertainment, our electric bills have shot upwards. The only difference? Our power rates are comprehensively regulated. To protect against the monopoly power of Pepco, we have the Public Service Commission (PSC): a three-person board that reviews Pepco’s costs when the company wants to raise rates. Officially, the PSC acts as our watchdog to protect consumers from being billed thousands of dollars each month and to ensure the lights stay on in an environmentally sustainable way. In reality, it’s a depressingly familiar story of corporate capture of government.

We Power DC, a local campaign for energy democracy, has a simple demand: replacing Pepco with an electric utility that belongs to the people of the District.

In just the past few years, Pepco has jacked up rates while slow rolling climate action and energy efficiency. According to a 2023 PSC report, Pepco obtained only 16% of its power supply from renewable energy sources, while it thwarted the adoption of rooftop solar across the city. In response to this bad behavior, the PSC rewarded Pepco: approving a $147.2 million dollar rate increase in 2021 and a $123 million dollar rate hike in 2023. These dollars flow out of the District and into the coffers of Pepco and its holding company owner, Exelon of Chicago.

Despite a wide-ranging outcry from the community, industry experts, and even landlords, the PSC in November 2024 largely approved Pepco’s latest proposed rate increase. Commissioner Richard Beverly wrote a blistering dissent in which he said the other two commissioners were essentially approving the case “because Pepco said so.”

The effects of the rate increase were immediate and expected. Following a cold winter, the additional 5% bump on bills slammed DC residents, with some customers seeing their bills double or triple. Public anger forced Pepco to suspend shutoffs for the first few months of 2025—but both bill collection and the rate increase stayed in place.

Meanwhile, Exelon flaunted the rate hike in DC as a major success, all the while an impending recession looms across the city and the country at large. Even in bleak times, the pursuit of profits by Pepco (and utilities like it) is relentless.

Unfortunately, the District is not an outlier: Regulators across the country rubber-stamp requested rate increases, despite the lack of economic logic. State regulatory agencies liberally reward utility shareholders even though they assume little risk by parking their money in a safe and stable industry.

Fortunately, there is an alternative for all of us. In towns and cities across the country, utilities are not controlled by shareholders—instead, they are governed by the communities that they serve and run on a not-for-profit basis. Public power is a proven model that altogether supplies electricity to about 55 million Americans in around 2,000 towns and cities across red and blue states, including Los Angeles, Nashville, and Seattle. On average, publicly owned utilities provide electricity that is cheaper and more reliable than their shareholder-controlled counterparts. Public power is not foreign or experimental but firmly established in the United States.

Affordable power is not the only argument in favor of public ownership. The urgency of the climate crisis means that we cannot rely solely on cajoling private utilities to remake our power grid. Despite the declining costs and rapid growth of wind and solar over the past 15 years, decarbonization of the American power sector is not happening quickly enough.

Furthermore, for the next few years, the responsibility of cleaning up the power sector will largely fall to state and local governments. Congress’ gutting of the Inflation Reduction Act in the One Big Beautiful Bill means that federal tax credits for wind and solar will soon dry up. Instead of trying to bribe the private sector to invest, we should take control of the climate transition through direct public investment. New York did exactly this in 2023 when it enacted the Build Public Renewables Act (BPRA) and empowered the state-owned New York Power Authority to build large-scale renewable projects and lead a just transition to a clean electric sector.

Inspired by the successful movement behind BPRA and determined to end the unbearable burden of power bills for hundreds of thousands of residents, We Power DC, a local campaign for energy democracy, has a simple demand: replacing Pepco with an electric utility that belongs to the people of the District. A utility governed by us could provide reliable service at lower rates; provide high-quality union jobs; and be a leader, not a laggard, in the fight against climate change. On top of its grassroots organizing, We Power published a report describing in detail how DC would benefit from a publicly owned utility, and how we can get there. While the road to public power can be long, the report outlines key intermediate steps that DC should pursue, including commissioning a study on municipalization of Pepco, taking control of grid planning, and building and operating community solar projects.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=63087723&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C178%2C0%2C178,N,,2026-01-24 09:59:09.720821

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said the office will now focus on supporting the private sector through energy projects that provide consistent power rather than intermittent generation.

Recent analysis finds that solar and battery energy storage costs have fallen enough where cost-competitive “anytime electricity” is available around-the-clock.

The department has already begun closing loans under the new priorities, including a deal to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear facility. A coal-powered fertilizer plant in Indiana also received support.

Meanwhile, many solar and storage developers that had received conditional commitments under the previous administration must now navigate a revised landscape where federal backing is no longer guaranteed for renewable technologies.

The department noted that $85 billion of the original portfolio was finalized in the final months of the Biden administration, a timeline the current leadership described as “rushed.”

The move signals a departure from federal support for the energy transition as previously defined, focusing instead on traditional energy production and nuclear expansion.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/Chris_Wright_52994732548-1200x800.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 08:58:38.686500

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Jan. 23, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- With Winter Storm Fern expected to move into the Carolinas this weekend, Duke Energy crews and support teams are completing their preparations and urging customers to finalize their own storm plans.

Forecasts point to dangerous travel conditions and outages that could last several days in the hardest‑hit areas.

Our view

Rick Canavan, Duke Energy storm director:

""Forecast models continue to shift, and both precipitation type and amounts may change as the storm approaches.""

""We're making our final preparations to ensure our 18,000 crew members have everything they need to assess damage, clear trees and restore power as soon as conditions are safe.""

""Freezing rain is going to be our enemy over the days ahead. It will build up on tree branches until the weight causes them to break – bringing down power lines and poles. The freezing rain and ice will also make roads extremely difficult for our crews to navigate, slowing power restoration efforts.""

""Winter storms like this can create serious challenges. I urge customers to ready themselves and their families for outages that could extend into next week – and check in on neighbors to make sure they're prepared, too.""

The latest

Meteorologists continue tracking Fern as it approaches from the west. Snow, sleet or freezing rain could begin as early as Saturday, with ice accumulation posing the greatest risk of extended outages.

Ice buildup of a quarter inch can bring trees and branches onto power lines. A half inch or more can pull down the lines themselves.

Tree and vegetation crews are completing targeted trimming today to help reduce outage risks ahead of the storm.

More than 18,000 restoration workers will be in position across the Carolinas by Friday night.

These include Duke Energy and contracted lineworkers, vegetation specialists and storm support staff from 27 U.S. states and Canada.

Duke Energy serves about 4.7 million electric customers in the Carolinas – about 3.8 million in North Carolina and nearly 860,000 in South Carolina.

What Duke Energy is doing

Tracking the latest updates from internal meteorologists.

Positioning crews, equipment and materials in locations that may experience the most severe weather.

Standing up 22 basecamps across the Carolinas where out‑of‑state crews park their trucks, pick up supplies and equipment, eat meals and board buses to nearby hotels where they sleep.

Preparing to deploy damage assessors, lineworkers and vegetation crews once travel conditions allow.

Trimming trees and vegetation in targeted areas to reduce potential damage to power lines.

Coordinating closely with state and local emergency management officials.

What customers should do right now

Review emergency plans and supplies: Charge phones, gather flashlights and extra batteries and take steps to stay ready.

Use the American Red Cross Emergency app: The app, sponsored by the Duke Energy Foundation, offers emergency checklists, maps of open shelters and tools to monitor multiple locations for weather alerts.

Download or update the Duke Energy app: Available through the Apple Store or Google Play.

Confirm your Duke Energy account login: Log in through My Account or the mobile app to check contact information and communications preferences.

Sign up for outage alerts: Receive updates by text, phone or email.

Know how to report an outage: Report online, through the mobile app, by texting OUT to 57801 or by calling 800.POWERON (800.769.3766).

What customers should know

Safety hazards: Stay away from downed power lines and storm debris. Use generators safely and follow the manufacturer's instructions.

Grid improvements: Upgrades such as stronger poles, undergrounding and self‑healing technology will help reduce some outages and speed restoration.

Extended outages remain possible: Freezing rain and ice can cause dangerous road conditions, which can slow repairs – especially in rural or heavily treed areas.

Restoration will begin as soon as conditions allow: Crews will assess damage, prioritize critical facilities and restore power as quickly and safely as possible.

In some areas, restoration may be delayed due to blocked roads, hidden damage or hazardous travel conditions.

Within the UK context, the partners will look to address the current challenge of a lack of grid capacity, which is keeping projects in a connection queue for years in some instances.

They say this urgently needs to be addressed, as power-hungry data centres are expected to drive demand significantly in the coming years.

To attempt to combat this, Octopus Energy and Masdar will identify portions of available capacity on the distribution network and design energy systems around them. These systems will include solar, batteries and flexible grid connections, allowing data centres to access the power needed without delay.

The systems will be powered by Kraken technology, which will balance on-site generation to ensure a secure supply, while decreasing costs by shifting consumption to cheaper periods.

The Africa-focused agreement aims to scale clean energy for the benefit of commercial and industrial users. The collaboration, which will initially being in South Africa, will see distributed energy and local grids deployed to support job creation and industrial growth in the region.

“This is about delivering projects that make energy cheaper, cleaner, and unlock real opportunities for businesses and industry,” said chief executive of Octopus Energy, Greg Jackson.

The sentiment was echoed by Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, his Masdar counterpart: “Through these agreements, we continue to reimagine the potential of renewables in the AI era, while also bringing much-needed clean energy to communities and businesses across Africa.”

Octopus Energy is looking to scale renewables across the African continent. In November last year, the company’s generation arm joined the European Commission, the Republic of South Africa and Global Citizen’s Scaling Up Renewables in Africa campaign – a pioneering and coordinated effort to expand renewable energy and grid infrastructure across Africa.

“If you were to stop most people on the street in this town, they would say Chuck Fleischmann is synonymous with nuclear energy.
I like the fact that we are extending the life of our larger nuclear power plants in this country because they’re built well.
It’s nuclear.
And nuclear energy definitely is going to have a huge role.” “But we need all kinds of energy.","“It’s safe. It’s clean. It’s one of those energies that is actually attracting people from both sides of the aisle. It’s truly amazing.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – With America facing unprecedented energy demands driven by data centers, artificial intelligence, and technological advancements, U.S. Reps. Chuck Fleischmann and Dan Newhouse appeared this past Thursday before a breakfast discussion of The Ripon Society to discuss the effort they are leading to meet this demand and boost U.S. energy security in the coming years.

Fleischmann represents the 3rd District of Tennessee and serves as Chairman of the Energy & Water Subcommittee of Appropriations. Newhouse represents the 4th District of Washington and is a member of the subcommittee. In their remarks, the two lawmakers talked about the increasing importance of nuclear power in meeting the country’s growing energy needs, and the steps they believe Congress and the President should take to make sure that America — not China or Russia — remains the top energy producer around the world.

“I’m all about energy,” Fleischmann stated in remarks to open the discussion. “If you were to stop most people on the street in this town, they would say Chuck Fleischmann is synonymous with nuclear energy. And I respect that. I do associate with those remarks. I like big and existing nuclear. I like the fact that we are extending the life of our larger nuclear power plants in this country because they’re built well. We’re going back. Companies like Holtec are going to bring a big one back in Michigan. Constellation is going to bring one back in Pennsylvania. My fervent hope is that New York State comes back at some point in time. Our friends on both sides of the aisle — excuse the pun—are warming towards nuclear energy.”

In addition to serving as Energy & Water Appropriations Subcommittee Chair, Fleischmann also serves as Co-Chair of several related caucuses, including Fusion Energy Caucus, the National Labs Caucus, the Advanced Nuclear Caucus, and the Nuclear Security Working Group — all of which reflect the fact that there is growing support for nuclear energy across the U.S., and that much of this support is bipartisan.

“The bottom line is we need energy in this country,” Fleischmann said. “We need natural gas. We need renewables. But we need all the above to get on the grid because we are going to have a dearth of energy. Nuclear is a big part of that. It’s safe. It’s clean. It’s one of those energies that is actually attracting people from both sides of the aisle. It’s truly amazing. I threw an event at the beginning of this Congress, and I invited Republicans and Democrats. It was a new nuclear dinner, and an equal number of Democrats and Republicans showed up. Our caucuses are bipartisan. Our efforts are bipartisan.”

Fleischmann noted that he is finding support for nuclear energy not only across the political aisle on Capitol Hill, but on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, as well.

“The Administration is working hand in hand with me,” the Tennessee lawmaker stated matter-of-factly. “Secretary Wright, Secretary Burgum, and the President of the United States — I work very closely with them. I’m a Republican who actually supports the Tennessee Valley Authority. I think it’s a great institution. The reality is, in our part of the world, we have less expensive, abundant energy, with a very diverse portfolio. It’s nuclear. It’s natural gas. It’s hydro. There is some coal in there. There are renewables in there. It is just very robust.”

Newhouse agreed.

“We are experiencing a never-before-seen demand for power in our country,” he stated. “It’s not just here, but throughout the world … We’ve got to meet these demands. And nuclear energy definitely is going to have a huge role.”

“But we need all kinds of energy. I think natural gas is still one of the things that we’re going to depend on, at least till we get to where we are with some of the other things. I’m really excited about geothermal, too. There are a lot of possibilities there. But nuclear — I don’t know that you could find another community in the country that is more pro-nuclear than the Tri-Cities of Washington State. And that’s a good thing. I think part of Tennessee absolutely falls into that category. Not too long ago, nuclear was almost a four-letter word. Now, people from both sides of the aisle and all philosophies are looking at nuclear as being a very viable option. And the good thing is we’ve got a lot of technology that will get us to a very strong nuclear future.”

Still, Newhouse cautioned, these and other developments related to expanding America’s nuclear power capacity, will not occur on their own. They will require smart policy in Washington and smart investment in innovation around the U.S.

“I believe the federal government has a clear role here,” the Washington state Republican said bluntly. “We were on the verge of losing a lot of that assistance and influence that we have to provide in H.R.1, the Big Beautiful Bill. Some of the tax credits that were very important to a lot of aspects of nuclear production were left on the cutting room floor — literally — until a group of us decided, ‘Hey, this is crazy — we can’t be throwing the baby out with the bath water here.’ Nuclear has got to be a part of our future. And we have to have those tax policies in place that will allow the industry to move forward.”

“We are very excited in Washington state about the small modular reactors. We believe that the Tri-Cities and the state of Washington will be a hub of production of that equipment. We’ve got the technology and we’ve got the brain power of the people that really know how to make this happen. I’m very excited about all of the different projects that are in place around the country. And we need more of that. We need some of these to actually come to fruition so that we can realize this future that we absolutely have to have.”

In addition to serving on the Energy & Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Newhouse also is a member of The Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, which, he noted, had been assessing the threat facing the U.S. from China and other energy powers around the globe.

“This is not just a domestic problem,” he stated. “We are faced with competition. I’m on the China committee, looking at the threats of the CCP. They’re producing not only nuclear, but coal and all kinds of different power generations. They are moving forward like there’s no tomorrow. Russia is the same way. We’re getting left in the dust as far as keeping up with them in this category. We can’t let that happen.”

On Friday (Jan. 23), the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved the rate increase as proposed in the joint settlement agreement that was filed Nov. 7 in the case.

In November, a SWEPCO participant said the bill of an average residential customer will increase by $24.32 per month, under the settlement agreement. The increase was based on November fuel rates rather than those when SWEPCO filed for the rate increase in March.

According to the regulatory documents, 227 public comments were filed in the case, and all comments opposed the proposed rate increase and/or investments made by the company in its coal plants.

Still, case participants recommended the commission approve the settlement because it resolved some of their concerns, including SWEPCO’s request for a resource-retirement study from Southwest Power Pool to consider the early retirement of the coal-fired Flint Creek Power Plant in Gentry, that SWEPCO complete a confidential economic analysis of the plant annually, look to procure clean energy resources in Northwest Arkansas, and consider all available technologies in its next request for generation resources.

A SWEPCO participant affirmed that the system can operate within Southwest Power Pool’s guidelines without Flint Creek online but said “it’s still the company’s thought process” to retire the plant in 2038.

Another participant said ratepayers would likely face a higher rate increase amid litigation, according to the documents. The settlement will result in a “significantly reduced rate increase” compared to what SWEPCO had originally requested in March. The rate increase in the settlement is roughly half of the original increase.

The Sierra Club was one of the participants opposing the rate increase.

“While it’s nice that the commissioners recognized the public’s outrage at SWEPCO’s rate request, nice doesn’t pay the bills,” said Cameron Rackley, a Northwest Arkansas resident and organizing intern for the Sierra Club. “Ultimately it’s the decision that impacts our lives, not the rhetoric. Arkansans are paying attention, and we look forward to holding SWEPCO and the PSC accountable for planning to replace the expensive, polluting Flint Creek coal plant with cheaper, cleaner renewables that will allow our Natural State to thrive.”",https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SWEPCO.png,N,,2026-01-24 11:00:12.318886

(AP) — California sued the federal government Friday for approving a Texas-based company's plans to restart two oil pipelines along the state's coast, escalating a fight over the Trump administration's removal of regulatory barriers to offshore oil drilling for the first time in decades.

The administration has hailed the project by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp. to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara damaged by a 2015 oil spill as the kind of project President Donald Trump wants to increase U.S. energy production.

The state oversees the pipelines that run through Santa Barbara and Kern counties, said Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta.

“The federal administration has no right to usurp California’s regulatory authority,” he said at a news conference. “We’re taking them to court to draw a line in the sand and to protect our coast, beaches and communities from potentially hazardous pipelines.”

But the U.S. Transportation Department agency that approved Sable's plan pushed back on the lawsuit.

“Restarting the Las Flores Pipeline will bring much needed American energy to a state with the highest gas prices in the country,” said a spokesperson with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

Sable did not respond for comment on the lawsuit.

Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term to reverse former President Joe Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. A federal court later struck down Biden’s order to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from oil development.

The federal administration in November announced plans for new offshore oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts, which the oil industry has backed for years.

But critics say the plans could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.

Bonta said one of the pipelines Sable wants to restart burst in 2015, spilling oil along the Southern California coast. The event was the state’s worst oil spill in decades. More than 140,000 gallons (3,300 barrels) of oil gushed out, blackening beaches for 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles. It polluted a biologically rich habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, killing scores of pelicans, seals and dolphins, and decimating the fishing industry.

The drilling platforms were subsequently shuttered.

Sable has faced a slew of legal challenges but has said it is determined to restart production, even if that means confining it to federal waters, where state regulators have virtually no say. California controls the 3 miles (5 kilometers) nearest to shore. The platforms are 5 to 9 miles (8 to 14 kilometers) offshore.

“It’s crazy that we are even talking about restarting this pipeline,” said Alex Katz, executive director of the Environmental Defense Center, a Santa Barbara group formed in response to a catastrophic 1969 California oil spill.

The federal government's approval to restart the pipelines ignores painful lessons the community learned from the 2015 oil spill, said California Assemblymember Gregg Hart, a Democrat representing Santa Barbara.

""California will not allow Trump and his Big Oil friends to bypass our essential environmental laws and threaten our coastline,"" he said in a statement.

California has been reducing the state’s production of fossil fuels in favor of clean energy for years.

Democratic-led states that sued over the action.

U.S. District Judge Tana Lin in Seattle ruled in favor of 20 states as well as the District of Columbia, which had filed their lawsuit after the U.S. Department of Transportation in February suspended an EV charger infrastructure program enacted by Congress in 2021 under Democratic President Joe Biden.

Lin, a Biden appointee, said the DOT and the Federal Highway Administration ""yanked the NEVI Formula Program's cord out of the outlet,"" without working within the statutory confines of established administrative law as required.

Environmental groups including the Sierra Club hailed the ruling, saying it ensures states can move forward with building infrastructure funded by the law. Lin's order permanently bars the Transportation Department from taking away the states' funds or canceling their previously approved implementation plans.

""Judge Lin's order is a resounding win for the rule of law and for smart investment in our clean energy future,"" Mike Faulk, a spokesperson for Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown, said in a statement.

The Transportation Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shortly after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took office in February, the DOT suspended the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, which was part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that Biden signed into law in 2021.

The Trump administration has pursued a number of policies to boost the sale of gas-powered vehicles and cut EV incentives for automakers and consumers.

States led by California, Colorado and Washington sued in May, alleging the Trump administration was wrongly withholding billions of dollars they were previously awarded.

The administration argued it was but a temporary pause, which it later ended after the judge earlier issued a preliminary injunction and the agency issued new guidance.

But Lin said the 2021 law never contemplated even temporary pauses in funding for the construction of EV infrastructure.

""In short, Defendants defied the will of Congress by withholding funds in a manner not contemplated by the IIJA,"" she wrote.

A Hot Spot Over the last year, rural Wisconsin has become somewhat of a hotspot for data center developers.
The debate over Wisconsin’s data center boom is both rooted in local governance and relevant to the national conversation about rising electricity costs.
In an election year, data center infrastructure has become a political issue, yet it’s one that rural coalition members insist is nonpartisan.
In addition to TIDs, Wisconsin also offers a sales and use tax exemption to incentivize data center development.","Blaine Halverson joked that his only exposure to data centers was from the Mission Impossible movies in the 1990s. That was, until one came to his town. Over the last seven months, Halverson’s community of Menomonie, Wisconsin, population 16,700, has become a flashpoint in a growing debate over data center development and local control in the state.

Halverson has lived in Menomonie, which is just over an hour east of Minneapolis, for most of his life. Like many others in his rural community, Halverson didn’t know much about the hyperscale data centers, built by the world’s largest technology companies, that are cropping up across the U.S. to power artificial intelligence. Then, in July 2025, Halverson was on vacation with his wife when he learned of a $1.6 billion data center proposal slated for around 320 acres of farmland on the outskirts of Menomonie.

Immediately, Halverson had questions.

“All of a sudden, I was activated,” said Halverson. “What really activated me was how far along this was, and that the public was just finding out.”

Over the next six months, Halverson and dozens of other concerned Menomonie residents coordinated a local opposition campaign that on January 5, 2026, resulted in Menomonie’s City Council revising a zoning ordinance to bar Balloonist, LLC, the developer representing an undisclosed ‘tech giant’, from moving ahead on construction.

An attorney for Balloonist did not respond to the Daily Yonder’s request for comment.

Halverson’s frustration about the project’s lack of transparency is one that has echoed throughout the state. In other rural counties and in villages sandwiched between larger cities like Milwaukee, Madison, and Green Bay, data center proposals in places like Beaver Dam, Port Washington, and Caledonia have been met with fierce opposition from residents. Developers eyeing land in Greenleaf, a village outside of Green Bay, and in Grant County, which borders the Mississippi River, have also faced community backlash. Commonly cited concerns revolve around project secrecy and the data centers’ projected energy usage, water needs, and financial impact on communities with small tax bases.

Beyond requiring vast amounts of power and water to keep operations running 24/7, large data center proposals in rural areas often represent a significant, if not dominant, share of the community’s tax levy. This leaves residents fearing what will happen if the planned data centers do not live up to their promises, should the stock market take a turn, the developers go bankrupt, or the technology inside the warehouse-like structures become obsolete.

“They’re not seeing the long-term risks,” said Prescott Balch about the elected officials who push for data center development in Wisconsin’s rural communities. Balch is a retired software developer and former technology executive at U.S. Bank. He also lives in Caledonia, Wisconsin, a rural village south of Milwaukee whose residents ousted a 244-acre Microsoft data center that was slated for land zoned for agriculture in October of 2025.

“No investment advisor, for example, would ever let you do [that] with your investment portfolio. They’d get fired for saying, ‘Put all your eggs in this one basket.’ It doesn’t matter how solid that one basket is. It’s still one basket with a lot of risk if it walks out the door,” Balch said.

A Hot Spot

Over the last year, rural Wisconsin has become somewhat of a hotspot for data center developers. The allure for Big Tech companies racing to build infrastructure to train and run complex AI models comes in the form of tax incentives, low-cost land, and, in many rural communities, flexible zoning codes.

But residents like Halverson and Balch are taking notice and starting to organize together. Opposition groups that have formed in communities faced with data center proposals are using digital tools like Facebook and Signal to connect with one another across the Badger State. Now, a growing coalition of rural residents and environmental organizations are urging state legislators to regulate data center development and, in some instances, taking legal action to improve transparency.

The debate over Wisconsin’s data center boom is both rooted in local governance and relevant to the national conversation about rising electricity costs. In an election year, data center infrastructure has become a political issue, yet it’s one that rural coalition members insist is nonpartisan. What’s on the ballot, including a crowded gubernatorial race, could influence that.

Why Wisconsin?

To grasp why data centers are coming to Wisconsin, you have to understand a particularly wonky part of the state’s tax code, according to Port Washington resident Michael Beaster. A resident of the rural city just north of Milwaukee, Beaster opposes the $15 billion campus being built by Vantage Data Centers to serve end-users Oracle and OpenAI as part of their $500 billion Stargate campaign to develop AI infrastructure across the U.S.

The wonky policy Beaster is talking about is a tax incremental district, or TID.

In Wisconsin, a TID lets developers pay their property taxes into a separate box from the rest of the community as a way to capture property value growth associated with new projects. During construction, a developer, like Vantage, contributes taxes to this special box to cover infrastructure costs associated with their project, like new roads and power lines. Depending on the terms of the TID, that tax money is then kept in the box until all infrastructure costs have been paid, often a period of 15-20 years.

Typically, this kind of tax policy helps small- or medium-scale developers, like new packing plants or housing developments, pay for their associated infrastructure costs over time. With hyperscale data centers, however, rural residents worry that the high costs of the developments’ power and water infrastructure will rack up for the community to pay while the developers’ taxes sit in a special box.

“If the village decides to raise the tax levy, it comes off the backs of the current residents only, and that is completely and utterly invisible right now to most people,” said Balch, who worked to reject Microsoft’s proposed data center campus in Caledonia last fall.

In November of 2025, the city of Port Washington approved a TID that enables Vantage to pay upfront for the estimated $175 million in infrastructure costs, plus $91 million for an electrical substation and $187 million in interest, associated with their data center campus, including upgraded water and sewer mains and new power infrastructure. Port Washington will then be responsible for paying Vantage back for those infrastructure costs over time.

The TID is set up as a pool of money to remain open for up to 20 years for the city to draw from to reimburse Vantage. Some residents, including Beaster, have expressed concerns that the financing model could end up raising taxes for locals. On January 2, 2026, a Port Washington-based group of activists filed a lawsuit against the city to challenge the TID.

“People don’t want to see their communities handed over to large corporations,” Beaster said.

Port Washington Mayor Ted Neitzke did not respond to the Daily Yonder’s request for clarification on whether the city’s TID would result in higher taxes for residents.

Last summer, a bipartisan measure in Wisconsin’s legislature updated the state’s tax incremental financing policy to exempt data centers from caps on the amount of money that can be held in a TID. The act mentions both Port Washington and Beaver Dam by name and was signed into law by Democratic Governor Tony Evers on July 8, 2025. In addition to TIDs, Wisconsin also offers a sales and use tax exemption to incentivize data center development. The exemptions are offered on a ladder based on a developer’s intended investment and the host county’s population, with less populous counties requiring less investment. For rural counties, the minimum investment required to claim the exemption is $50 million.

For Asad Ramzanali, former deputy director for strategy at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden Administration, it is this kind of policy that goes against the idea that data centers should have to pay their “fair share”.

“When the largest companies, the most well-resourced companies, in the history of the world are behind these data centers, it feels particularly unfair to have states level tax breaks for construction,” Ramzanali told the Daily Yonder.

“People should not have to pay increased utility bills. People should not have to pay for transmission lines going up, [and] people shouldn’t have to deal with dirty water sources because of a data center.”

Nonpartisan, but Political

With local pushback to data centers picking up steam, state legislators are taking note. Beaster said that’s a change from the attitude that some legislators had a few months ago, when his rural community members were mobilizing against the data center in Port Washington last summer and fall.

“When we started really getting involved in trying to mobilize, we tried to write letters and emails and stuff to state legislators, and they just weren’t very responsive,” Beaster said. “It felt to us like they were more interested in bringing these things here than regulating them.”

In early December, 2025, Democrats introduced a bill to regulate data centers and entice them to take climate-friendly steps. Under the proposed legislation, residents would be protected from footing the utility costs associated with data centers. If passed, the bill would also subject data centers to an annual fee, ranging from $2-3 million, to fund clean energy and low-income heating assistance programs. The legislation also includes a measure to hinge state tax incentives, like the sales and use tax exemption, upon data centers using at least 70% renewable energy.

In January, 2025, Republicans introduced a data center bill of their own, with similarities including mandated reporting on water usage and restrictions on passing development-related utility costs onto families and small businesses. The Republican legislation would also mandate that data centers wanting to use renewable energy would need to build those energy sources, like solar, on the same property.

The utility provisions in both the Democrat and Republican-backed bills come as the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) prepares to hear a case in February of 2026, from We Energies, the state’s largest utility, that will determine how much data centers will have to pay for their infrastructure, and how much gets passed onto other ratepayers.

We Energies has requested a pay structure that holds data centers accountable for 75% of their capital costs. That request has been challenged by the Wisconsin chapter of the Sierra Club, which argues large customers like data centers should be held responsible for 100% of their associated costs.

“This is the decision for how much the largest utility is making large customers pay, and right now the proposal is really bad for an average residential customer,” said Cassie Steiner, a senior campaign coordinator at Sierra Club. The PSC is expected to hand down a decision on the 2026 rate structure in the spring.

Even as data center regulation captures lawmakers’ attention at the state capitol in Madison, organizers in Menomonie, Port Washington, and Caledonia maintain that local opposition isn’t tied to party.

“One of the things that has been really amazing to me about this process is that I know the people I’m standing shoulder-to-shoulder with in this group, a lot of them never vote the same way I would when we go into the into the voting booth in November,” Halverson said of his work in Menomonie.

“If it’s your farmland and your community, you’re an extreme environmentalist, and if it’s your power bill going up, then you’re a fiscal conservative.”

Climate hazards in the city intersect with a variety of quality-of-life issues, and the Mamdani administration will be scrutinized for how it handles them.
“New York City … is unbelievably vulnerable in a climate-changing world.”","Climate advocates in New York City celebrated when Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral election, applauding his history of opposing the expansion of gas infrastructure in the city and his framing of climate action as important to his affordability agenda. Now, those advocates will closely monitor how he addresses the city’s pressing climate issues, including flooding, heat and pollution.

As he put it in his inaugural address, “every blizzard and flood we withstand, together.” The question of how well New Yorkers withstand them, and how the city responds, rests in part in the hands of the Mamdani administration. And it’s a heavy burden.

According to the city’s 2024 report on environmental justice, nearly half of the city’s population lives in an environmental justice community—an area that has historically been overburdened with environmental hazards such as air pollution.

Under local law, the city must now develop a plan of action to mitigate the environmental issues in these communities. This plan, likely to be released under Mamdani, could meaningfully address the concerns of residents who are disproportionately low-income and non-white.

Summer Sandoval, who worked on the environmental justice report, would like to see more clean energy opportunities for these communities, especially since they often face high levels of air pollution in their neighborhoods due to highways and gas power plants. Sandoval is now the community investment and implementation director of the Urban Sustainability Directors Network.

“I think it’s a very important issue of not only having access to clean energy, but having access to affordable and reliable energy,” Sandoval said. “It’s going to significantly impact people’s quality of life.”

Under former Mayor Eric Adams, City Hall expanded city zoning to allow more solar panels and battery storage to be built in the city. His administration also launched the Blue Highways Pilot Program, part of a larger plan to shift some freight entering the city from roads to waterways—limiting pollution from trucks in environmental justice communities near highways.

Advocacy groups have also pushed for City Hall to dedicate 1 percent of the city’s budget to the Department of Parks and Recreation, which cares for the city’s green spaces, nearly 14 percent of the city. Under Adams, the department’s budget hovered around 0.6 percent.

Chronic underfunding of the department means that parks in low-income neighborhoods often receive less maintenance work. Wealthier areas’ green space, like Central Park or Prospect Park, receive independent funding through conservancies—nonprofits that help fill those gaps.

Hanging over all that, federal funding for environmental justice communities has sharply declined. The Biden administration spearheaded multiple efforts to improve the lives of these communities, while the Trump administration has pulled back.

“That has never stopped New York before,” said Sandoval, “and it shouldn’t now in terms of the city working very closely with the state to create local and state resources that are necessary to address local environmental justice issues.”

520 Miles of Coastline

When New Yorkers think about flooding, Hurricane Sandy looms large. In 2012, it killed 44 city residents, destroyed 300 homes and caused over $19 billion in damages.

The disaster kickstarted the flood resilience conversation in the city, triggering the formation of plans to prevent the “surrender to the sea,” according to Rob Freudenberg of the Regional Plan Association, a civic organization that has conducted research into local flooding problems.

Flooding along the city’s 520 miles of coastline is a significant concern, especially with sea level rise and the likelihood of more frequent and devastating storms due to climate change.

According to a 2025 report by the Regional Plan Association, New York City, the Long Island counties of Nassau and Suffolk and Westchester County, just north of the city, could lose as many as 82,000 housing units due to “permanent, chronic and coastal flooding” by 2040.

Currently, the city has a mix of plans to protect lower Manhattan from storm surge, nicknamed the “Big U.” Developed with a combination of city, state and federal funds, the plan is designed to protect the Financial District and surrounding neighborhoods from coastal storms.

Projects like the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project, which raised a waterfront park by 10 feet to protect nearby residents, will become a feature of the lower Manhattan waterfront. The city is likely to employ a combination of natural solutions, like parks, and hard infrastructure, such as floodwalls, to curb storm-related flooding. Green areas can absorb a lot of stormwater, preventing it from flooding the streets.

Park advocacy groups have been pushing for more park funding for years, in part to better combat the city’s climate pressures. Mamdani has pledged to allocate 1 percent of the city budget to parks and has appointed Tricia Shimamura as the commissioner of the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation. She was previously Manhattan borough commissioner at the department.

The city also has tentative plans to protect areas of Staten Island, Brooklyn and Queens from potential disaster. In Staten Island, the city built hard structures off the island’s coast to break up potential large waves and fitted the structures with small holes to provide habitat for marine life.

In New York, the risk of flooding is not just coming from the coasts; it’s also coming from the skies. As the climate changes, New Yorkers are likely to experience more short bursts of heavy rain—“rain bombs,” as Bill Ulfelder, the executive director of The Nature Conservancy in New York, described them.

“[The new administration] needs to make sure that there’s good coordination between the coast and the areas that flood inland,” said the Regional Plan Association’s vice president of energy and environmental programs Freudenberg. “They’re too often kept separate in approaches.”

Freudenberg hopes to see changes to the city’s flood policy. He believes that a neighborhood-by-neighborhood approach that identifies all flooding sources in an area, along with potential solutions, would offer a clearer picture and enable more coordinated city policy under a new mayoral administration.

The city has a long history of project-by-project approaches to flooding, Freudenberg says. Under Adams, the city addressed rainfall flooding through a combination of policies such as sewer upgrades and the Cloudburst Management program, which uses a combination of infrastructure and natural solutions to absorb water, preventing street flooding that could overwhelm the sewer system.

The city’s myriad flooding problems may also complicate Mamdani’s campaign promise to build over 200,000 new affordable housing units over the next decade. According to the Regional Plan Association, approximately 77,300 acres, or just over 10 percent, of residential-zoned land could face future flooding.

If the new mayor’s eventual housing policy does not consider future flood risk, his administration may end up building housing units that will be uninhabitable in a few decades. City policy, Freudenberg said, also needs to provide options to those who already live in areas with high flood risk.

“This mayor no longer has the luxury of being a one-issue mayor,” said Freudenberg. “You can be an affordability mayor, you can be a housing mayor—but in order to truly succeed, you need to be a resilience and adaptation mayor at the same time.”

50,000 Polluting Buildings

The city’s building decarbonization law was a hot-button issue during the mayoral race. Local Law 97, passed in 2019, imposes gradually escalating limits on greenhouse gas emissions from large city buildings—starting in 2024.

According to the Urban Green Council, a nonprofit focused on building decarbonization, and energy benchmarking data, around 92 percent of buildings comply with last year’s limit. The more stringent limits will come in 2030, 2035 and 2040. Co-op and condominium owners are concerned about the cost of complying with these limits, which can sometimes require replacing a building’s heating system.

“We’re looking at the next four years and seeing that the priorities are pretty clear, it’s to reduce costs and simplify the process,” said Chris Halfnight, chief operating officer at the Urban Green Council, who served on the Mamdani transition team.

Over the course of his campaign, Mamdani suggested that the city could bulk-buy equipment like heat pumps, which are central to decarbonizing a building’s heating system, in order to provide them at lower prices to some building owners. He also said he wanted to “make it easier” for co-op and condominium owners to comply with the law.

Advocates like Halfnight will be closely watching how Mamdani approaches this issue. Many climate activists were unhappy with how Adams implemented the law. They have advocated for limits on the purchase of renewable energy certificates, which represent electricity generated by a renewable source, to mitigate fines.

Implementing the law stringently while still offering pathways to limit the cost of decarbonization has proven to be a delicate balance. Halfnight and his organization hope the mayor will expand his bulk-purchase campaign proposal to a one-stop shop for compliance with the law.

A program like this would call for the city to bulk-purchase equipment and installation services—hopefully making the process faster and cheaper. The program, Halfnight said, would be funded by public money at first and would ultimately be repaid by building owners through property taxes.

“There’s been some signs from the administration that this approach really aligns well with a joint climate and affordability focus,” said Halfnight.

Climate hazards in the city intersect with a variety of quality-of-life issues, and the Mamdani administration will be scrutinized for how it handles them.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s $200 million plan to revive the state’s stalling electric-car market faces several fundamental problems: It isn’t enough money, it may not reach consumers quickly enough and the state hasn’t decided whether to subsidize – or exclude – wealthier buyers.

The Newsom administration’s budget proposal — rolled out after President Donald Trump dismantled federal electric vehicle incentives and blocked California’s clean-vehicle mandate — would cover rebates for only about 20% of last year’s EV sales. That CalMatters estimate assumes the state follows the model of the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which offered rebates of up to $7,500 toward some electric and hybrid cars before the California Air Resources Board ended it in 2023.

So far the administration has released few details about the proposal, leaving experts and lawmakers circling a basic question: Who should get the money?

“It is better than nothing, which is what a lot of things are getting right now,” said Mars Wu, a senior program manager with the Greenlining Institute, which advocates for investments in communities of color. “How far that $200 million goes really depends on how the program is going to be structured.”

A small incentive in a huge market

California’s electric car market is one the governor celebrates on the world stage. While at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland earlier this week, Newsom highlighted that California has surpassed 2.5 million clean car sales, saying the achievement came after the state “invested in this future when others said it was impossible.” He framed the number against a modest goal to get 1.5 million clean cars on the road, set more than a decade ago.

California officials remain confident the state’s policies will succeed in pushing the transition to electric cars. Even as sales have slipped, EVs will drive future electricity demand, according to a long-term forecast approved Wednesday by the California Energy Commission.

But the limits of the governor’s $200 million EV proposal become clear in the numbers. A CalMatters analysis found the incentive would cover only one out of every five EV sales, assuming similar sales to last year, and the same average rebate level as the state’s last mass-market rebate program.

Advocates are also raising concerns about how quickly the money can get to consumers. Christopher Chavez, deputy policy director at the Coalition for Clean Air, a California-focused advocacy group, warned that the proposed rebates may not reach consumers until 2027, given how long it takes to approve the budget and to set up a new program. If the funding only lasts a year, the program would leave out buyers who need time to plan or save, he added.

“It's not going to be enough — just to be blunt about it,” Chavez said. “Two-hundred million for a mass-market program will go very quickly.”

The proposal comes as the latest sales numbers show an electric car market slump. Nationally, the loss of the uncapped, popular federal tax credit has accelerated manufacturer write-downs and sales declines as automakers adjusted to a tougher EV market.

In California, the slowdown has pushed the state further off course from its climate goals: even before Congress and President Trump blocked its vehicle mandate last year, California was struggling to hit a requirement that 35% of new cars sold in 2026 be zero-emission. Last year electric and other zero emission cars made up about 23% of new car sales in 2025, down from roughly 25% the year prior, California Energy Commission data shows.

Sales slowed down dramatically at the end of the year, when EVs and other clean cars accounted for just under 19% of new car sales in the fourth quarter of 2025 — the lowest quarterly share since mid-2022.

The Newsom administration will likely lay out the details of its proposal in a draft bill tied to the state budget. The Clean Vehicle Rebate Program would be “the foundation we’d be building from,” wrote Lindsey Buckley, an air board spokesperson, in an email, adding that the goal would be to deploy the $200 million “as soon as possible to support the market.”

Buckley said it is “speculative” to predict the impact of a new EV incentive or how quickly the money would reach consumers.

With limited funding, advocates say the question of who qualifies for the rebates becomes critical.

“What we really don't want to see is that money going towards higher-income folks for whom it would just be kind of like a bonus coupon,” said Wu, of the Greenlining Institute.

Fast or targeted: lawmakers face a choice

How the Newsom administration and lawmakers design the state’s next EV incentive will determine how quickly the air board can deliver rebates — and whether the program avoids recreating past inequities. California ended its last, broad EV rebate program in 2023 over concerns it benefited higher-income buyers. Targeting lower-income drivers delivers the greatest benefits because they tend to drive the most, and switching to EVs saves them money on fuel and maintenance, said Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley.

But income-based “means testing” can slow programs down, requiring income verification and layers of bureaucracy that eat up funding and discourage participation.

That’s a critique of one California program aimed at low-income buyers, Clean Cars 4 All, which offers grants to help drivers trade in older, more polluting vehicles for cleaner alternatives. As the state moved from budget surplus to deficit, the Newsom administration and lawmakers never adequately funded it, advocates say.

Lawmakers provided no new funding in the 2024–25 budget year, and in the current budget cycle, the state provided only about $45 million through a combination of funds and one-time budget actions, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office. That falls well short of a sustained, long-term commitment, said Chavez, of the Coalition for Clean Air.

“It's become — especially as the budget has become more difficult — more of a secondary priority, which is unfortunate,” he said.

Competing ideas, no clear consensus

California’s EV problem has no shortage of potential solutions — only disagreement over which one to choose.

Some policy analysts argue the state should focus on first-time adoption. A recent brief from Atlas Public Policy found that incentives are most cost-effective when they bring a household’s first electric vehicle into the garage — because once a family owns one EV, it is far more likely to buy another.

Elkind, of UC Berkeley, said a simpler approach — a point-of-sale rebate tied to lower-priced vehicles — would be easier for the air board to administer while avoiding subsidies for high-income buyers.

“If it's just tied to the price of the vehicle, that's pretty straightforward,” Elkind said.

Some lawmakers told CalMatters the air board should tightly target the rebates to communities most affected by pollution and transportation costs. State Senator Ben Allen, a Democrat from El Segundo, said incentives should focus on communities that suffer the most from air pollution, “so as to increase the bang for air quality buck.”

Senator Josh Becker, a Democrat from Menlo Park, said new incentives should go to the people “who are most burdened by transportation costs and drive the most.""

Fewer easy EV buyers in California

California needs to design its next rebate program well because its most eager EV buyers are gone and the state now faces a harder, more price-sensitive market, experts said.

“California is one of the first states to sort of get into that mainstream market: and it's a harder market to convert,” said Loren McDonald, a Danville-based EV analyst. Potential buyers now expect seamless charging and balk at waiting 30 to 40 minutes. They also are not keen to install home chargers or pay more upfront. Many, he says, stick with traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.

“We burned through the innovators and the early adopters — those people who want to save the planet, those people who make good money,” McDonald said.

On the balance sheet, it has become a test of what happens when a clean energy project gets overtaken by cheaper technology.

So is Ivanpah really closing in 2026? The owners have been aiming to turn off two of the plant’s three units this year, but on December 4, 2025, the California Public Utilities Commission rejected the proposed contract termination deal, leaving the timeline uncertain and sending the project back into the regulatory slow lane.

How Ivanpah turns sunlight into electricity

Ivanpah is a “concentrating solar power” plant, which means it uses mirrors to focus sunlight into heat, then uses that heat to make steam for a turbine. The US Department of Energy says the plant has three 459 foot towers, about 173,500 sun tracking mirrors, and $1.6 billion in federal loan guarantees, as outlined at energy.gov.

The mirrors, called heliostats, constantly shift to keep aiming at a receiver on top of each tower. Alternative energy consultant Edward Smeloff has described the basic idea as using the sun as a heat source, while noting the system is complicated compared with newer options.

A big debut, then a fast moving market

Ivanpah began construction in 2010 and entered commercial operation in January 2014, according to the Energy Department. At the dedication ceremony that February, then Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz called the project “an example of how America is becoming a world leader in solar energy,” as reported by Solar Power World.

But solar got cheaper in a different direction. Solar panels based on photovoltaic technology convert sunlight directly into electricity.

NRG Energy, a co owner, said that while the original power contracts looked competitive when they were signed, later “advancements over time” brought “more efficient, cost-effective and flexible options.” That shift left Ivanpah fighting for space in a grid that now has many cheaper ways to capture sunshine.

The 2026 shutdown plan, and the vote that blocked it

In January 2025, utility Pacific Gas and Electric Company said it had agreed with the plant owners to end two long term power purchase contracts early, citing savings for customers. The company said power deliveries from those contracts would stop beginning in 2026 if regulators approved the move.

That approval did not happen. In Resolution E-5429, the California Public Utilities Commission rejected the contract termination agreements “without prejudice,” meaning the parties can return with a revised proposal, according to the commission document.

Birds, heat, and what Ivanpah says about energy bets

Ivanpah has also faced criticism for wildlife impacts around its bright towers. The Association of Avian Veterinarians has said the facility is believed to be responsible for at least 6,000 bird deaths per year.

Researchers have pushed for better data and clearer comparisons with other hazards birds face. A 2016 review of studies at concentrating solar power sites, found that deaths at these plants mainly come from collisions and singeing, and that early estimates varied with monitoring methods.

Critics also point to the role of public support in backing technology that did not deliver as expected. Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, said in a statement quoted by Fox News that Ivanpah “never lived up to its promises,” arguing it produced less electricity than projected while relying on natural gas to stay operational.

The World Economic Forum, meanwhile, has argued that private investors can sometimes pivot faster when technology shifts.

The official decision was published on the California Public Utilities Commission website.

""Regulation has quietly become a tax on housing,"" Hughes told lawmakers, warning that cumulative mandates are limiting the industry's ability to scale production at a time when demand continues to outstrip supply.
Those costs, Hughes said, are ultimately passed on to buyers and renters, further pricing households out of the market.
Housing affordability has emerged as a bipartisan concern on Capitol Hill, as elevated mortgage rates and years of underbuilding have pushed home prices and rents to record levels in many markets.
""The industry can build more attainable housing,"" Hughes said, ""but only if the regulatory environment allows it to do so.""","U.S. home builders pressed lawmakers on Tuesday to roll back what they describe as a growing web of federal regulations that they say is exacerbating the nation's housing affordability crisis by constraining supply and inflating construction costs.

Appearing before a congressional panel focused on housing affordability, National Association of Home Builders Chairman Buddy Hughes argued that regulatory compliance -- spanning energy standards, environmental permitting and labor rules -- has become one of the largest cost drivers in residential construction, particularly for smaller builders.

""Regulation has quietly become a tax on housing,"" Hughes told lawmakers, warning that cumulative mandates are limiting the industry's ability to scale production at a time when demand continues to outstrip supply.

According to NAHB estimates, government regulations account for roughly a quarter of the cost of a newly built single-family home and more than 40% of the cost of a typical apartment development. Those costs, Hughes said, are ultimately passed on to buyers and renters, further pricing households out of the market.

Builders singled out federal energy-efficiency requirements as among the most burdensome. An April 2024 determination by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Agriculture requires new single-family and multifamily homes financed through the agencies to meet the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code or the ASHRAE 90.1-2019 standard. The effective date of the rule has been delayed until May 2026 under the Trump administration.

NAHB contends that the standards significantly increase upfront construction costs while delivering limited financial benefits to consumers. Citing industry-backed studies, Hughes said compliance with the 2021 energy code can add as much as $31,000 to the price of a new home, with energy savings that could take decades to offset the initial expense.

""In the middle of a nationwide affordability crisis, increasing the cost of housing through federal mandates is counterproductive,"" Hughes said, urging Congress to block HUD and USDA from enforcing minimum energy standards that raise prices. He also called on lawmakers to preserve state and local control over building code adoption, noting that most states have not embraced the federal standards.

Beyond energy rules, NAHB flagged what it characterized as costly delays tied to federal environmental reviews under the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act, along with labor regulations and other HUD policies that builders say slow project timelines and add uncertainty.

Housing affordability has emerged as a bipartisan concern on Capitol Hill, as elevated mortgage rates and years of underbuilding have pushed home prices and rents to record levels in many markets. Economists broadly agree that increasing housing supply is critical to easing cost pressures, though lawmakers remain divided over the appropriate balance between deregulation, environmental goals and consumer protections.

NAHB said it is seeking to work with Congress and the administration on what it calls ""sensible regulatory reforms"" aimed at lowering costs and accelerating production of entry-level and workforce housing.

North American business and cultural leaders participated in discussion on everything from artificial intelligence to safe access to water.

North America was a focal point of the World Economic Forum’s 56th Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with US President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney among the most prominent leaders in attendance.

The two leaders arrived at the Alpine gathering amid heightened geopolitical tensions and far-reaching geo-economic shifts, driven in large part by dramatic policy changes in Washington. Their participation, which coincided with a tense moment in US-European relations over US threats to take over Greenland and impose tariffs, underscored North America’s influence on global affairs at a time that is increasingly defined by fragmentation and shifts towards a more multipolar world.

Beyond political leadership, the meeting was marked by a strong showing from North American business leaders and cultural figures.

Executives from across industries — including Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase; Alex Karp, CEO and Co-Founder of Palantir; Larry Fink, Chair and CEO of BlackRock and Interim Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum; Marc Benioff, CEO and Co-Founder of Salesforce, and Bill Gates, Chair of the Gates Foundation, to name a few — joined conversations on growth, resilience and technological transformation. Meanwhile, well-known academics and cultural figures contributed to broader debates on issues ranging from sustainability to social cohesion.

Together, this wide-ranging North American participation reflected the region’s continued ability to shape global dialogue. Not only through global leadership and government policy, but also through private-sector innovation, economic might and cultural influence.

Here are some of the North American highlights from Davos 2026.

‘Principled and pragmatic’

North America’s participation in the Annual Meeting was showcased most prominently in special addresses delivered by President Trump and President Carney.

In a lengthy speech delivered at a fraught moment in US-European relations, Trump largely criticized previously longstanding US allies and spoke on a wide range of issues including trade and tariffs, regional security, AI development, nuclear power, housing affordability, migration and pandemics. One highlight came in relation to persistent US threats to take over Greenland: “I won’t use force” to attain the island, Trump said. Amid the threats and uncertainty, US stocks, government bonds and the value of the US dollar fell precipitously.

That evening, Trump announced that a framework of a deal on Greenland had been reached and that the US would not impose tariffs on European countries. Throughout the day, confidence was largely restored in financial markets.

Trump was accompanied in Davos by a high-level delegation that included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks.

Furthermore, on the margins of the Annual Meeting, the US government organized a signing event focused on peace and recovery in Gaza. The World Economic Forum facilitated the session in the Davos Congress Centre.

In a speech delivered earlier in the week, Carney delivered a stark assessment of the global moment. ""For decades, countries like Canada prospered under what we called the rules-based international order,"" he said. ""We joined its institutions, we praised its principles, we benefited from its predictability… this bargain no longer works.""

Moving forward, Carney said ""we aim to be both principled and pragmatic,"" adding that Canada will ""actively take on the world as it is, not wait around for the world we wish to be.""

Carney was also joined in Davos by a high-level delegation that included Foreign Minister Amita Anand, Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of International Trade Maninder Sidhu and Minister of Industry Melanie Joly.

A bipartisan delegation of US governors and lawmakers were also in Davos.

The governors included Governor Gavin Newsom of California, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma. In a public session, three of the governors discussed the importance of policy-making at the state level, noting that everything from zoning regulations to education policy can influence the health of the national and global economy.

“States are more nimble than the federal government. We can move faster,” Governor Whitmer said, noting alongside the other governors that state policies can facilitate a culture of innovation.

Meanwhile, Governor Newson, a vocal critic of Trump, sat down with Ben Smith, Co-Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Semafor, for a wide-ranging conversation on an array of core issues related to US politics.

Members of the US Congress who attended the Annual Meeting included Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Representative Sara Jacobs of California, among others. The lawmakers engaged in discussion on everything from bolstering the middle class to the future of US-China relations.

“I do think there are opportunities for us to create a framework to work with China,” Coons said.

The future of business and growth

Chief executives from North American companies ranging from Nvidia to Salesforce featured prominently in Davos. Their participation reflected both the continued importance of North American businesses in the global economy and the scale of uncertainty confronting private sector leaders today.

Artificial intelligence and its impact on North American economies was a major topic of discussion, with leaders exploring how the rapidly advancing technology is reshaping productivity, competitiveness and labour markets.

“I’m much more confident that [AI] will in fact build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster and bend the productivity curve and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world,” said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, Tesla and owner of social media platform X, stated that ""AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively"" by 2030 and that he foresees building solar-powered AI data centres in space. Musk concluded his remarks on a positive note, stating that ""it's better for your quality of life to be an optimist and wrong, than a pessimist and right"".

While optimism around AI was widespread, leaders also addressed its disruptive effects. Joe Ucuzoglu, Global CEO of Deloitte, noted that “there will absolutely be labour market displacement,” while stressing that, as with previous technological transitions, AI will also fuel “the creation of new jobs, many of which people could have never imagined in the moment.”

The business leaders also explored the rise of stablecoins and other digital assets in addition to general digitalisation trends. Jeremy Allaire, Chair and CEO of Circle, described the expanding applications of stablecoins, saying that the “use case proliferation that we're seeing is extraordinary.” Allaire noted that stablecoin use is increasing in cross-border trade settlements and e-commerce payments in particular.

Meanwhile, David McKay, President and CEO of RBC (Royal Bank of Canada), stated that the technical transformation is well underway within the financial sector. “Part of our digitisation is to digitise the physical services that we've been delivering for hundreds of years,” he said.

Business leaders also examined the state of the US economy, identifying strong points and areas of potential growth as well as continued weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

“We have seen consistently that the economy is performing really well overall,” said Charles Scharf, Chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo. “But at the same time, when you look at who's doing well and who's not doing well, it's very, very uneven.”

Earlier this month, the World Economic Forum released its Chief Economists' Outlook, a triennial measure of the global economy based on a survey of cross-sector chief economists.

The report found that the outlook for growth in the US has improved. In the January edition, 19% of chief economists said they expect weak or very weak growth in the US, a sharp drop from the 52% who expected it in September 2025. Over two thirds (69%) said they expect moderate growth while 11% said they expect strong growth.

The report noted that a substantial share of US GDP gains in the past year are estimated to have come from AI-related capital spending, adding that AI-related and data centre investments are expected to rise over the next five years.

The business leaders examined the ongoing impacts of US tariffs, too. Many warned that policy uncertainty continues to hinder investment planning and urged the government to pursue growth-oriented policy frameworks.

“Before you spend hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars to build a manufacturing plant, you really want to believe that the policy that is the anchor of that decision will be permanent in nature,” said Ken Griffin, President and CEO of Citadel.

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, added that in general “what governments should be focused on more is policy conducive to growth.”

At the Annual Meeting, the World Economic Forum also launched, SmartStart, a new initiative to prepare 1 million young people for future-ready manufacturing and supply chain jobs by 2035. The programme, which will be introduced this year in select US regions, has brought together over 60 leaders from government, education and labour to create industry-ready curricula and expand access to credentials, training, internship and hiring pathways.

A broader set of voices

The Annual Meeting also brought together North American labour leaders, academics and cultural figures who contributed critical perspectives to economic and social debates.

Artist and musician Jon Batiste performed at the opening concert, while actor and Water.org co-founder Matt Damon spoke about the importance of expanding access to safe water and sanitation. A lack of access to water, Damon said, is a significant “loss to human potential.”

Meanwhile, labour leaders included Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers, and Elizabeth Shuler, President of the AFL-CIO, which represents nearly 15 million workers in the United States.

Speaking on a panel focused on technology and the future of work, Shuler stated that “we are seeing as a backdrop that the economy, in the US and around the world, isn't working for working people now. We have inequality at its highest levels; people are working harder and harder for less.”",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_I7fJtyycU5hlKj5QFKcdPNkW_eef4v17h8mcwqz8Y6Y.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 05:58:27.156604

(RFD NEWS) — Frustration continues to build across agriculture over the lack of progress on securing year-round E15 sales, after the provision was left out of the latest federal spending bill. A potential stalemate in the push for year-round E15 sales is a story that is dominating the markets. Efforts to secure year-round access could soon shift to a newly approved council tasked with studying the issue.

The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) says the industry was very close to final approval and is frustrated by the delay.

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw says the measure was expected to be included in a spending bill due at the end of January.

“It was supposed to be in a spending bill, one of those spending bills that’s coming due. They’re called mini-buses, continued resolutions (CRs),” Shaw explains. “All this stuff is coming due at the end of January, from when we had the government shutdown before. It was supposed to be in there. It was agreed to be in there, and then some senators from primarily oil states got it pulled out.”

Instead of moving forward with a separate bill, the House Rules Committee has now approved the creation of a special council to study year-round E15 sales. The move has drawn criticism from agricultural stakeholders.

National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President Jed Bower says corn growers are “disgusted, disappointed, and disillusioned” after years of pushing for E15 passage, adding that Congress has again delayed action in what he described as a “spectacularly weak and offensive way.” Bower also criticized the plan to establish a rural energy council, saying it treats E15 as if discussions are just beginning.

The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) is also calling for E15 to be written into law. Economists there say expanding year-round E15 is one way to help use the current crop surplus. AFBF economist Dr. Faith Parum joined us on Thursday’s Market Day Report to speak on AFBF’s push to increase domestic demand for ethanol as an effective way to help stabilize farm markets and prices.

“Increasing domestic demand, anyway possible to help keep these farmers’ markets and have steady prices. One really easy way is year-round E15,” Parum said. “That would be an easy button for Congress that would really help our corn growers. But any types of market demand increases will be great for our farmers and ranchers.”

In addition to increased domestic demand, AFBF is also calling for more farmer assistance, with special attention to specialty crop producers.

Ag Lawmakers Push for Year-Round E15 in the House and Senate

Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE) joined us on Friday’s Market Day Report to discuss the growing concerns of farmers, traders, and lawmakers who hoped to see year-round E15 included. Smith addressed his own frustration with the omission and explained what happened when the House instead agreed to form a committee to study year-round sales — a move that drew criticism from the NCGA.

In his interview with RFD NEWS, Smith addressed the backlash from biofuel groups, including Growth Energy, which has sharply criticized the process, and responded to those concerns, outlining what the next week could look like as lawmakers work toward passing a new spending bill before the current one expires.

Smith also discussed a path forward for growers if year-round E15 sales are not secured and shared a message of optimism amid uncertainty about grain supplies, which remain elevated. He closed with final thoughts on the outlook for E15 and agricultural priorities moving forward.

Senate agriculture lawmakers are also weighing in on the push for year-round E15 sales. Senate Ag Committee Member, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), told reporters this week that the issue needs to be made permanent through legislation. He said the industry needs a law that provides long-term certainty and encourages retailer investment in pump infrastructure to enable E15 and higher blends.

“We need a law that says that this is going to be something that’s going to last forever,” Sen. Grassley said. “And that it’s going to get the investment that it needs from the retailers to put in the pumps and change their pumps to allow E15 all the way up to E85. And it’s not a simple process of just putting a certain amount of gas.”

Grassley added that work must continue in the weeks ahead to secure year-round E15 in law.

The less comforting news is that Americans are about to pay a lot more for electricity anyway — not because the grid fails, but because of how we now power it.

As another deep winter cold snap presses across much of the eastern United States, grid operators are doing what they always do in these moments: watching reserve margins, issuing conservation guidance, leaning on dispatchable generation, and quietly hoping nothing large trips offline at the wrong hour.

If history is a guide, the system will muddle through. It usually does. But survival isn’t the same thing as success. And it’s certainly not the same thing as affordability.

Even if there is no blackout, no emergency load shedding, and no headline-grabbing crisis, this weather event will still deliver a financial shock — one that will show up first in gas markets, then in wholesale power prices, and finally, months later, in the electric bills of households and businesses. That downstream billing impact is not accidental. It is structural. And it tells us far more about the state of the modern grid than any press release ever will.

Yes, the system will probably muddle through through this time. But one day in the not-too-distant future it won’t.

Counting the Cost of High Electric Bills

The modern American electric grid has become adept at avoiding disaster. Operators have more tools than ever: demand response, emergency imports, market signaling, conservation messaging, and sophisticated forecasting. What they do not have — at least not in sufficient quantity — is inexpensive, fuel-secure generation that can run whenever it is needed, regardless of weather.

In winter, the grid’s vulnerability is not generation capacity on paper. It is fuel deliverability in the real world.

Natural gas now sits at the center of that vulnerability. It dominates the marginal price of electricity across large portions of the country, particularly in regions like PJM Interconnection, which spans much of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. When gas is abundant and cheap, markets hum along. When it is constrained by cold weather, competing heating demand, pipeline limits, or freeze-offs, prices rise sharply — even if no generator actually fails.

Gas does not have to break to become expensive. It only has to be needed.

That is exactly what happens during prolonged cold snaps. Residential heating takes priority. Storage withdrawals accelerate. Pipelines run near their limits. Power generators bid defensively to secure fuel. The result is predictable: spot gas prices spike at constrained hubs, wholesale electric prices follow, and utilities quietly rack up higher procurement costs.

No blackout. No drama. Just higher bills.

And high electric bills extract a quiet but relentless toll. They are not merely an inconvenience; they function as a regressive tax on households least able to absorb them and a hidden drag on the broader economy.

For families, higher electric bills mean hard tradeoffs. Money spent keeping the lights on is money not spent on groceries, prescriptions, school supplies, or savings. For seniors on fixed incomes, a volatile power bill can force choices between heat and healthcare. For working households, it turns routine weather events into financial stress tests.

For businesses, especially manufacturers and small employers, high electricity costs erode margins, discourage expansion, and quietly kill jobs. Energy-intensive operations either scale back, pass costs along to consumers, or relocate to regions with more stable and affordable power. Over time, this hollowing-out effect weakens local tax bases and strains public services.

For communities, persistently high power costs accelerate decline. Retail districts dim. Investment slows. Population loss follows opportunity. Utility shutoffs rise, charitable assistance is stretched thin, and local governments face growing pressure to subsidize basic services that were once affordable.

And for the grid itself, high bills often signal deeper structural problems—overreliance on volatile fuels, premature retirement of reliable generation, or policy-driven distortions that shift costs from balance sheets to ratepayers. The bill arrives monthly, but the damage accumulates quietly, year after year.

In the end, high electric bills cost more than dollars. They cost stability, competitiveness, and confidence—exactly the things a healthy economy and a secure society require.

The Renewable Mirage in Winter

Renewable advocates often argue that wind and solar will insulate consumers from fossil-fuel volatility. Winter stress events expose the weakness of that claim.

Solar output is minimal during winter peak hours. Wind can help — or not — depending on meteorological luck. Batteries can shave peaks for minutes or a few hours, but they can’t carry a grid through multi-day cold events. When the weather turns hostile, renewables become supplements, not solutions.

That doesn’t mean renewables are useless. It means they are conditional. And conditional resources cannot set the reliability floor of a winter grid.

Yet they increasingly shape the cost structure of the system. Renewable mandates, tax credits, and priority dispatch suppress energy prices when conditions are favorable, discouraging investment in dispatchable generation. But when conditions are unfavorable — when cold sets in and demand spikes — those same policies leave the grid leaning heavily on gas, with fewer alternatives available to keep prices in check.

The irony is hard to ignore: policies sold as a hedge against volatility often amplify it.

The Quiet Role of Coal

This is where coal enters the discussion — not as a political symbol, but as an economic stabilizer.

When coal still dominated the grid, winter pricing behaved differently. Coal plants stored months of fuel on site. They did not compete with residential heating for delivery. They did not depend on pipeline pressure or wellhead performance. When cold arrived, they simply ran.

That mattered.

Coal-heavy systems were not immune to outages or price swings, but they were insulated from the kind of fuel-driven volatility that now defines winter power markets. Coal did not set the marginal price every hour, but it capped how high that price could go. It acted as ballast — heavy, unglamorous, and stabilizing.

Consider the role played by plants like John E. Amos Power Plant in West Virginia. Facilities like this are not interchangeable widgets. They anchor voltage, reduce transmission stress, and provide firm megawatts precisely when they are most valuable. When they run, they suppress scarcity pricing across wide swaths of the grid. When they retire, that suppression disappears — and consumers pay the difference.

If Coal Still Dominated the Grid, This Cold Snap Would Barely Register

It is worth asking a simple, uncomfortable question: If coal still dominated the electric grid the way it once did, would this cold snap even matter?

From a consumer perspective, the answer is largely no.

In a coal-dominated system, winter cold was an operational issue, not a pricing crisis. Load went up, coal units ran harder, operators adjusted dispatch, and the system absorbed the stress. What did not happen — at least not routinely — were sharp fuel price spikes, emergency conservation messaging, or springtime bill surprises blamed on “market conditions.”

The reason was structural.

Coal plants carried weeks — sometimes months — of fuel on site. That fuel was already purchased, already delivered, and already insulated from real-time weather events. Coal did not compete with residential heating demand. It did not depend on pipeline pressure, compressor stations, or wellhead performance. When the temperature dropped, coal plants did not enter a bidding war with homeowners for survival. They simply ran.

That mattered because coal often sat at or near the margin during winter peaks. And when coal is the marginal fuel, prices behave differently. They move modestly. They reflect cost, not fear. They do not explode because of perceived scarcity three states away.

Contrast that with today’s system. Natural gas now sets the price in much of the country. Gas does not need to fail to become expensive; it only needs to be stressed. Cold weather alone is enough. Add pipeline congestion, freeze-offs, or even the risk of nonperformance, and markets immediately inject a scarcity premium. Wholesale electric prices spike — even if every generator shows up and no emergency is declared.

That volatility then works its way downstream. Utilities absorb higher procurement costs. Fuel adjustment clauses kick in months later. Consumers see higher electric bills long after the weather has passed and are told, vaguely, that it was “because of winter.”

Under a coal-dominated grid, that chain reaction was muted or absent. Gas prices might still rise for home heating, but electricity did not compound the pain. Households were not hit twice — once for gas, and again for gas-driven power prices. Industrial customers did not face the same level of real-time exposure. Regulators were not forced to explain why nothing went wrong yet bills still went up.

None of this means coal eliminated winter stress. It did something more valuable: it absorbed it. Coal acted as ballast — heavy, unfashionable, and quietly stabilizing. By removing that ballast without replacing its function, we did not make the grid more fragile in obvious ways. We made it more expensive in subtle, recurring ones.

That is why today’s cold snap will show up on electric bills even if the grid performs flawlessly. And that is why, when coal still dominated, it would have passed with little more than a footnote in an operator’s log.

The lights stayed on then, too.

The difference is that the bill did not quietly grow teeth afterward.

How the Bill Really Shows Up

Consumers rarely connect winter reliability events to their electric bills, because the impact is delayed and obscured.

Here is how it actually works:

Renewables go MIA.

Cold weather tightens reserves

Gas prices spike at regional hubs

Wholesale power prices rise during peak hours

Utilities absorb higher procurement costs

Fuel adjustment clauses catch up months later

By spring, customers open their bills and wonder why rates are higher, even though “nothing happened.” Utilities point to weather. Regulators nod. The underlying structural cause goes largely unexamined.

Industrial customers feel it immediately through real-time pricing and demand charges. Residential customers feel it later, but more painfully, as higher energy bills stack on top of already elevated heating costs.

This is not a one-off phenomenon. It is now a recurring feature of winter.

We Chose This…

None of this is accidental. We made policy choices that traded fuel security for market efficiency, and market efficiency for political aesthetics. We shifted the grid toward just-in-time fuel delivery. We retired on-site fuel without replacing its stabilizing function. We assumed markets would solve problems that are, at their core, physical.

Markets are excellent at pricing scarcity. They are less effective at preventing it.

The result is a grid that survives winter stress events — but at a higher and more volatile cost. We have optimized for avoiding blackouts, not for protecting consumers from price shocks.

The Bottom Line

The grid will likely get through this winter storm. Operators are competent. Procedures are in place. The system will bend, not break.

But bending has a price.

Renewables will be MIA. Gas prices will rise. Wholesale electric prices will spike. Retail bills will follow. And once again, consumers will pay for a system that values politics over reliability.

Coal’s continued presence on the grid does not eliminate these costs — but its absence guarantees they will be higher.

If we want affordable electricity in winter, we must stop designing a grid that depends on perfect conditions to keep prices low.

And the bill always comes due.

ACC Battery Latest News

India’s flagship ACC Battery Manufacturing PLI scheme has fallen significantly short of its targets due to delays in capacity creation and technology constraints.

Background: Advanced Chemistry Cells and Their Strategic Importance

Advanced Chemistry Cells (ACCs) are next-generation battery technologies, such as lithium-ion cells, that power electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy storage systems, and consumer electronics.

Unlike traditional lead-acid batteries, ACCs offer higher energy density, faster charging, and longer lifecycle performance.

For India, domestic ACC Battery Manufacturing is strategically important for three reasons.

First, batteries account for nearly 40% of the cost of electric vehicles, making local production critical for EV affordability.

Second, India is heavily dependent on imports, mainly from China, for lithium-ion cells and battery components.

Third, battery manufacturing is central to India’s clean energy transition and its commitments toward reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy security.

The ACC Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme

The ACC-PLI scheme was launched in October 2021 by the Ministry of Heavy Industries to catalyse domestic manufacturing of next-generation battery cells.

With a total financial outlay of Rs. 18,100 crore, the scheme aimed to establish 50 GWh of battery manufacturing capacity by 2026.

Under the scheme, selected manufacturers were promised incentives linked to actual battery sales, with a maximum subsidy of about Rs. 2,000 per kilowatt-hour.

Companies were required to make a minimum investment of Rs. 1,100 crore and meet phased domestic value-addition targets, 25% within two years and 60% within five years.

Beyond capacity creation, the policy intended to develop a complete battery supply chain covering cathodes, anodes, electrolytes, and cell assembly, while also generating over one million jobs.

Current Status and Performance Gap

Despite its ambitious design, the scheme’s on-ground performance has been weak.

As of October 2025, only 1.4 GWh of battery cell capacity had been commissioned on time, while 8.6 GWh was under development but delayed. This is far below the original 50 GWh target.

Although bids were invited for the entire capacity, only 30 GWh was finally allotted.

Importantly, none of the selected firms had prior experience in large-scale battery cell manufacturing.

As no company has begun commercial battery sales, zero incentives have been disbursed so far, against a targeted Rs. 2,900 crore payout by October 2025.

Job creation has also been minimal, with just over 1,100 jobs generated compared to the projected 1.03 million.

Key Challenges Affecting Implementation

One major bottleneck is the lack of a mature battery manufacturing ecosystem in India.

Critical inputs such as lithium refining, cathode materials, and specialised machinery remain import-dependent, largely sourced from China.

Delays in visa approvals for foreign technical experts, especially Chinese specialists needed for equipment installation, have further slowed plant commissioning.

Additionally, strict localisation norms and aggressive installation timelines have posed challenges for companies without prior technical expertise.

Implications for Electric Mobility and Energy Transition

The EV sector accounts for nearly 70-80% of lithium-ion battery demand in India.

Slower progress in ACC Battery Manufacturing directly affects EV affordability, supply chain resilience, and the pace of clean mobility adoption.

While EV sales continue to grow, the pace has been lower than earlier projections, partly reflecting supply-side constraints in battery availability and pricing.

Continued reliance on imports also exposes India to geopolitical risks and trade disruptions.

Way Forward

To revive momentum, India needs a more flexible and phased localisation strategy that aligns with existing industrial capabilities.

Facilitating technology partnerships, easing skilled-visa processes, and supporting component-level manufacturing are critical.

Policy recalibration may also be required to encourage participation by experienced manufacturers and align incentives with realistic timelines.

Without such course correction, India’s ambition of becoming a global battery manufacturing hub may remain unfulfilled.

Hyperscale AI Data Centers: Massive next-generation computing facilities powering the AI revolution

The Geography of Serious Capital

Early-stage venture capital in 2025-2026 totaled approximately $300 billion globally, with artificial intelligence and clean energy technologies dominating the investment landscape. While general media coverage fixates on massive coastal innovation hubs, global players attracting and deploying large scale investment capital understand a different geography. Meta Platforms doesn’t commit $800 million to Wood County on sentiment. Amazon Web Services (AWS) doesn’t plan a $23 billion Ohio expansion by 2030 based on proximity to beaches. These are calculated decisions driven by power infrastructure, manufacturing capacity, research ecosystems and regulatory environments that enable deployment at scale.

Ohio isn’t overlooked by serious players, instead, it’s simply not well understood by the general public. The federal research presence is substantial: the NASA Glenn Research Center, Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Airforce Base, Battelle Memorial Institute and major NIH-funded medical research at Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University and allied academic medical research centers. When measured by research infrastructure, talent pipelines and capital deployed, Ohio’s position in breakthrough technology development becomes clear.

Hyperscale AI Infrastructure: The Biggest Money in Tech

Global early-stage AI infrastructure funding reached approximately $50 billion in 2025, making it the strongest attractor of venture capital by intensity. Nationally, AI/software captured roughly $89 billion in early-stage venture capital.

In Ohio, this translated to substantial deployment. AWS announced plans in December 2024 to invest $23 billion in Ohio data center infrastructure by 2030, one of the largest private investment commitments in state history. The initial wave includes a $5 billion data center campus in Fayette County (breaking ground in 2025), $3.5 billion for five data centers in New Albany, $3 billion in Sidney, $1 billion in Marysville, and a $4 billion proposal in Wilmington currently under planning commission review. AWS already operates data centers across Franklin and Licking counties, with over 1,000 direct employees and supporting more than 4,700 total jobs.

Meta Platforms’ $800 million AI-optimized data center in Middleton Township, Wood County represents the company’s second Ohio facility. The 715,000-square-foot installation employs 100 specialized workers and supported over 1,000 construction jobs during peak build-out. Vultr’s $1.3 billion Springfield facility houses 24,000 AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs in a 50-megawatt cluster – one of the largest concentrations of AI compute power deployed outside traditional coastal markets, with capacity sold out before the facility went operational in early 2026.

The economics favor Ohio. Northwest Ohio’s energy infrastructure includes over three dozen energy producers, suppliers, and transporters, with approximately $3 billion in regional energy industry capital investment in 2024-2025. But infrastructure alone doesn’t explain these deployments.

Cleveland-based Park Place Technologies has partnered with The Lubrizol Corporation – also Cleveland-headquartered – to deploy advanced liquid immersion cooling systems using Lubrizol’s CompuZol™ thermal management fluids. Developed through multi-year collaboration with Intel, these systems enable AI data centers to achieve substantially higher computing densities while reducing energy consumption by 30-40% and dramatically cutting water usage. As AI model training moves toward trillion-parameter scales, thermal management becomes the binding constraint on deployment. Ohio companies are solving the fundamental physics problems that make hyperscale AI economically viable.

Ohio-specific AI infrastructure ventures also raised capital in 2025. Finite State secured a $30 million Series B for AI-powered cybersecurity solutions. Scheduler AI closed a $5 million seed round. Tembo raised $17.7 million for AI assistant technology. Reg D filings show approximately $100 million in additional Ohio AI operations funding in 2025.

Next-Generation Nuclear: Record Capital Deployment

Nuclear reactor startups raised over $2 billion in early-stage venture capital in 2025, ranking second in funding intensity. TerraPower secured $650 million; X-energy raised $700 million. The sector is experiencing a renaissance driven by AI’s insatiable power demands and climate imperatives.

In Piketon, Pike County, Oklo’s planned small modular reactors on the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant site represent more than aspirational technology. In January 2026, Oklo announced a partnership with Meta Platforms to develop a multi-billion-dollar, 1.2-gigawatt nuclear campus capable of powering Meta’s next generation of AI training facilities. The site selection wasn’t accidental – Centrus Energy operates a $900 million federal facility at the same location producing High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU), the advanced fuel these new reactors require. This creates a vertically integrated supply chain from fuel fabrication through power generation.

Ohio’s nuclear expertise runs deep. The Portsmouth site employed thousands during the Cold War and maintains specialized infrastructure and workforce knowledge rare in the United States. Power to Hydrogen, an Ohio nuclear startup, raised an $18 million Series A (Reg D filed Q1 2025) to develop hydrogen production systems integrated with next-generation reactors.

And Ohio knows how to support early-stage energy efforts. A key example is BRITE Energy Innovators, based in Warren/Youngstown (a key industry lead in the Jumpstart Entrepreneurial Network), reports that it has supported over 600 companies and facilitated approximately $250 million in investment, creating roughly 2,100 jobs in the advanced energy space (along with allied technologies). While focused primarily on advanced manufacturing and energy technology, BRITE’s expert team and infrastructure supports the kind of early-stage commercialization that translates research breakthroughs into investable opportunities.

Generative Coding: Software Development Transformed

AI coding tools exploded in 2025, with Cursor alone raising $2.3 billion at a multi-billion-dollar valuation. The broader generative AI sector captured significant portions of the $89 billion in early-stage AI/software venture funding. These tools don’t merely assist programmers-they’re rewriting the economics of software development itself.

Ohio’s software development ecosystem has begun integrating these capabilities at scale. Major technology employers including JPMorgan Chase, IBM and Google maintain significant Ohio engineering operations. The state’s 15 research universities produce thousands of computer science graduates annually, creating talent pipelines that AI coding tools amplify rather than replace. Early-stage coding infrastructure companies raised modest but growing amounts-the velocity matters more than absolute dollars at this stage.

AI Companions and Mechanistic Interpretability: Understanding the Black Box

AI safety and interpretability research attracted substantial 2025 funding, with Anthropic raising $13 billion specifically for mechanistic interpretability work-techniques to understand how AI systems actually process information and make decisions. As AI companions form increasingly sophisticated relationships with users, understanding their decision-making becomes critical for safety and ethics.

Tembo’s $14 million raise positions the Cincinnati-area company in the AI assistant market, focusing on enterprise applications where understanding AI reasoning matters for compliance and liability purposes. The mechanistic interpretability field remains nascent but growing, particularly as regulators worldwide grapple with AI governance frameworks.

Base-Edited Gene Therapy and Cellular Medicine: Ohio’s Clinical Advantage

Biotech venture capital totaled approximately $1.5 billion in early-stage funding in 2025, though the sector lagged AI infrastructure. However, Q3 2025 saw a 70.9% surge in biotech VC to $3.1 billion nationally, driven largely by AI-biotech hybrids and precision medicine breakthroughs. Model transaction: Kriya Therapeutics’ $313 million raise for base-edited gene therapy. Nationally, reproductive genomics companies like Orchid Bioscience raised $12 million for embryo screening technologies.

Cleveland Clinic leads multiple CRISPR clinical trials that moved toward commercialization in 2025. CTX310, a base-edited CAR-T therapy for blood cancers, demonstrated encouraging Phase I/II results. EDIT-301 (renamed Reni-Cel) received FDA approval in December 2023 for sickle cell disease, with Cleveland Clinic participating in pivotal trials. Most significantly, a November 2025 NEJM publication detailed VERVE-101 results in familial hypercholesterolemia patients-a single base-editing infusion achieved 50%+ LDL reduction sustained over 12 months, approaching functional cure territory for a previously untreatable genetic condition.

The gene and cell therapy market, valued at $30 billion in 2022, is projected to reach $153 billion by 2029-a 26% compound annual growth rate. Ohio’s clinical infrastructure positions it well to capture this growth. Case Western Reserve University (home of the National Center for Regenerative Medicine), the MetroHealth System, the Cleveland Clinic, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center all maintain advanced cell therapy commercialization facilities and active clinical trial pipelines.

Ohio biotech ventures raised approximately $350 million across multiple rounds in 2025. Armatus Bio secured over $15 million for its microbiome platform. Clarametyx raised around $33 million for precision diagnostics adjacent to embryo scoring technologies. Branch Insurance ($60 million) and Root Insurance ($100 million), while not biotech companies, demonstrate Ohio’s capacity to raise significant late-stage capital across sectors.

Case Western Reserve University’s Fusion RGME (Regenerative Medicine & Entrepreneurship) program trains graduate students at the intersection of cellular medicine, intellectual property strategy, and business development-the exact skillset required to translate breakthrough research into viable companies. The program integrates with the law school’s established Fusion initiative, creating a unique pipeline of scientifically literate entrepreneurs who understand both the biology and business models.

Commercial Space Stations: From Orbit to Ohio

Space technology attracted $7.8 billion in venture capital in 2024, stabilizing a market that continues to mature. Starlab Space, the commercial joint venture between Voyager Space and Airbus, has established critical terrestrial operations at Ohio State University’s George Washington Carver Science Park (VISTA). The $160 million NASA Space Act Agreement awarded to the Voyager-led team funds the development of the station’s core modules, which will serve as an orbital research platform following the International Space Station’s retirement. Instead of a seed-stage startup, it is Voyager Space-through its acquisition of Cleveland-based ZIN Technologies-that provides advanced manufacturing and microgravity hardware expertise to the region. These Ohio operations are positioned to support both terrestrial testing and eventual orbital deployment, aligning with Starlab’s long-term vision of orbital industrial capacity. Ohio State’s involvement isn’t coincidental; the university maintains deep aerospace expertise through its proximity to the NASA Glenn Research Center and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (home of the national Airforce Research Labs), creating and growing talent pipelines and research collaborations unavailable in most markets.

Niche Technologies: Sodium-Ion, Gene Resurrection, and the Long Tail

Sodium-ion battery ventures raised $50-200 million globally in 2025, with most capital flowing to manufacturing scale-up rather than R&D. Acculon Energy in Columbus operates a 2-gigawatt-hour sodium-ion production facility, positioning Ohio in a supply chain less dependent on lithium sources concentrated in China and South America. While sodium-ion technology trades energy density for safety and cost, grid storage applications increasingly favor these trade-offs.

Gene resurrection-using extinct species’ DNA for novel therapeutic compounds-remains early-stage but raised modest venture rounds in 2025. Ohio’s research universities participate in synthetic biology research that could eventually support this work, though commercial activity remains limited.

The pattern across niche technologies: Ohio provides manufacturing scale, research partnerships, and regulatory pathways that translate breakthrough concepts into production realities.

What This Means for Investors and Companies

Ohio’s position in breakthrough technologies reflects structural advantages: abundant energy (validated by Meta’s 2026 nuclear partnership with Vistra), advanced manufacturing capacity, and research talent. While strict venture capital totals for 2025 were likely closer to $1.6 billion, the broader capital inflow was massive, anchored by corporate ‘megaprojects.’ This includes AWS’ continued multi-billion dollar expansion and the $4.4 billion Jeffersonville EV battery plant, which Honda moved to fully acquire from strategic partner LG Energy Solution in late 2025 to secure its supply chain.

The investment thesis for next-gen technologies extends beyond individual industry verticals. Hyperscale AI infrastructure requires nuclear power, which requires advanced manufacturing, which requires materials science breakthroughs. Gene therapies require AI-powered drug discovery, which requires compute infrastructure, which requires cooling technology and energy efficiency innovations. These technologies don’t develop in isolation-they form an integrated system where Ohio’s manufacturing and research strengths create compounding advantages.

For companies seeking capital to scale breakthrough technologies, and for investors seeking exposure to sectors likely to generate substantial returns over the next decade, Ohio offers deployment opportunities unavailable in higher-cost coastal markets.

Concluding the discussion can be the building block for something more ambitious: a partnership on clean energy that goes beyond trade.
Both sides face a common challenge: building clean energy industries without concentrated dependency.","At next week’s 16th EU-India Summit in New Delhi, long-running free trade agreement (FTA) talks are expected to conclude with a deal. This creates a timely opportunity to make clean technology manufacturing a central part of the relationship.

Clean tech manufacturing and deployment now sit at the heart of industrial strategy, trade policy and international partnerships, driving economic resilience, energy security and geopolitical influence.

The EU and India have complementary strengths across wind, batteries and solar that can underpin a green industrial partnership.

The EU-India FTA should be seen as a platform for deepening clean economy co-operation – not as an end point.

Story

As India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares to host European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa at the EU-India Summit in New Delhi, the moment offers a critical opportunity to deepen the strategic partnership beyond the Free Trade Agreement – by making clean tech cooperation a core pillar of the relationship.

The irreversible shift to a clean economy is reshaping energy security, industrial competitiveness and geopolitical alignments around the world. Global clean-energy investment now exceeds fossil-fuel spending, and the ability to manufacture, trade, and deploy clean technologies has become central to national resilience, economic strength, and geopolitical influence.

For both the EU and India, this transition is no longer driven by climate goals alone. Clean-tech manufacturing and deployment now sit at heart of industrial strategy, trade policy, and international partnerships. This was noted by India’s Vice President C. P. Radhakrishnan in his recent address at the Bharat Climate Forum where he said climate action is not a constraint on India’s development but a strategic opportunity to drive inclusive growth, strengthen energy security and build a future-ready economy. Clean-tech manufacturing should be central to this vision.

The shared value of EU-India clean trade

Against this backdrop, the Summit and FTA negotiations signal a desire to strengthen the strategic partnership and widen cooperation to support energy security, resilience, economic growth and stability for both sides. It can also lead to a deeper EU-India partnership in clean manufacturing that delivers growth and jobs, while strengthening supply chain resilience, accelerating clean energy deployment and contributing to a more balanced global clean-tech ecosystem.

At a time of geopolitical fragmentation and growing concentration risks in critical supply chains, cooperation can help both the EU and India reduce strategic vulnerabilities while building domestic industrial capacity.

For the EU, India offers scale, cost-competitive manufacturing and a trusted partner for diversifying clean-technology supply chains as Europe accelerates its energy transition.

Partnership with the EU can support India’s ambition to become a global clean-energy manufacturing hub. It will also help India diversify its export markets, while strengthening domestic value chains across clean tech supply chains.

The economic opportunity is substantial. India’s clean-technology market could reach USD90–135 billion by 2030 across solar, wind, batteries, hydrogen, electric vehicles and grid equipment. Read more on how EU-India cooperation can scale across 3 key areas: solar, wind and batteries.

These benefits can be catalysed by a robust EU-India partnership that allows each side to play to their existing technological and sectoral strengths, creating a stable framework for trade and investment that supports jobs and growth. In this context, the EU–India Free Trade Agreement should be seen as a platform for deepening future cooperation – not as an end point.

Quotes

Manon Dufour, Executive Director of E3G’s Brussels office, said:

“The EU-India summit is an opportunity for Europe to demonstrate that it can act strategically in a more contested world. Securing a comprehensive trade deal would reaffirm the EU as a reliable and collaborative partner, and mark a major achievement for von der Leyen’s Commission after nearly two decades of negotiations. More broadly, Europe is beginning to move beyond a year of reactiveness — accelerating partnerships from Mercosur to India and recognising that, in a world shaped by the US and China, major powers below that scale must cooperate to retain agency. Deepening ties with India is not just about trade, but about shaping a more resilient, competitive clean economy and a stable geopolitical order.”

Matthew Webb, Associate Director of Global Clean Power Diplomacy at E3G, said:

“The EU-India clean-energy partnership is no longer about [just] ambition — it is about resilience. A deeper strategic partnership between the EU and India can be an anchor in turbulent times and can offer mutual benefits by increasing cooperation and trade in clean energy. Europe’s push to diversify clean-tech supply chains and India’s ability to manufacture at scale create a shared opportunity to reduce strategic dependencies through co-investment to accelerate deployment in wind, batteries, and solar. As the EU–India FTA nears agreement, this is a key moment to lock in clean technology as strategic infrastructure for the 2030s.”

Madhura Joshi, Programme Lead – Asia at E3G, said:

“The EU is already India’s largest trading partner. Strengthening EU-India’s strategic partnership has the potential to boost economic growth, build resilience, improve energy security, and build a future-ready, collaborative relationship. An FTA between EU and India has been long in the making. Concluding the discussion can be the building block for something more ambitious: a partnership on clean energy that goes beyond trade. Both sides face a common challenge: building clean energy industries without concentrated dependency. The complementarity is real, the opportunity is significant, and the timing is right. A deeper partnership with clean tech as a foundation would build resilience, not just for both regions, but for global clean energy supply chains.”

Ellie Belton, Senior Policy Advisor – Trade at E3G, said:

“Completion of the EU-India FTA will be a landmark moment, marking a significant step towards strengthening the strategic partnership between two of the world’s largest economies. Building on this agreement to deepen cooperation in clean technology sectors and value chains will not only help to deliver shared decarbonisation goals, but is also in the interests of both sides’ geopolitical resilience, economic security and long-term prosperity.”

January 23, 2026 - WASHINGTON – On Thursday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released the following:

Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the next step in the agency’s accelerated review of public health risks from fluoride in drinking water: the agency’s release of the “Review of Science on Fluoride in Drinking Water: Preliminary Assessment Plan and Literature Survey.” This fast-track effort marks a critical step in Administrator Zeldin’s April 2025 directive to expedite EPA’s next fluoride health assessment under the Safe Drinking Water Act schedule, while adhering to gold-standard scientific methods and radical transparency. This action utilizes data sharing, peer review, and interagency collaboration as the agency supports a whole-of-government approach to address public concerns with fluoride, particularly those outcomes related to childhood development and maternal and infant health.

“Making America Healthy Again is a top priority, especially when it comes to concerns about what is in our water,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “Every American should be able to count on safe, healthy drinking water when they pour a glass to drink or use it to cook a meal, especially for a child. The Trump EPA is working in lockstep with Secretary Kennedy and following gold standard science to guide our next steps to protect drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act.”

""Science is always evolving, and our policies should too,” said U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. ""A growing body of evidence indicates that ingesting fluoride can cause neurological harm, and other adverse effects. By contrast, fluoride's benefits to teeth come almost entirely from topical contact, not from ingestion. Most of Europe has already moved away from water fluoridation in favor of topical products such as toothpaste, and it may well be time for the U.S. to follow suit.”

Rather than conducting a fluoride risk evaluation under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the agency determined that a review under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), led by the Office of Water, is the most appropriate regulatory pathway for addressing fluoride as a drinking water contaminant. This decision reflects SDWA's specific statutory framework for protecting public health from contaminants in drinking water systems.

The Preliminary Assessment Plan and Literature Survey announced today outlines the transparent and systematic approach EPA intends to follow in evaluating scientific studies of fluoride health effects. The plan describes the key science issues EPA will consider, including sensitive populations such as infants and children, and compiles a literature survey of relevant health effects studies to be evaluated in the assessment. Releasing this plan for public comment is a critical step next step in developing a new, comprehensive health assessment on fluoride in drinking water.

The assessment will reflect a comprehensive, current, and accurate review of the best available scientific data on fluoride exposure and health effects, conducted with external peer review and public input to inform potential revisions to federal drinking water regulations that bring the nation closer to evidence-based standards that protect future generations. EPA will use gold standard scientific practices, draw on expertise across the federal government, and will not prejudge any outcomes of the assessment.

EPA’s role under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is to limit the amount of contaminants in drinking water provided by public water systems to protect public health. EPA previously set the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for fluoride at 4.0 milligrams per liter, a standard designed to prevent known or anticipated adverse health effects that was set in 1986 and most recently reviewed in 2024. Under normal SDWA timelines, the next comprehensive analysis of new scientific information on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water would not be due until 2030, but EPA has accelerated this work to deliver updated science to the public sooner while maintaining rigorous review and quality controls.

Decisions on whether to add fluoride to drinking water are guided by public health recommendations from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and have ultimately been made at the state or local level. U.S. Public Health Service has issued Recommendations for Fluoride Concentration in Drinking Water for the Prevention of Dental Caries, otherwise known as tooth decay. CDC’s Community Water Fluoridation Program recommends amounts of fluoride in drinking water to best prevent cavities. Their recommended optimal level of fluoride is 0.7 milligrams per liter. These recommendations are just that – recommendations that are advisory and do not alter EPA’s legal role under the SDWA.

The federal regulatory standards set by EPA apply regardless of whether fluoride is naturally occurring in a system’s source water or is intentionally added by the water system. EPA’s responsibility is to ensure that overall fluoride levels remain within health-protective limits, but the agency does not make policy recommendations to state or local systems to add fluoride to drinking water.",https://goldrushcam.com/sierrasuntimes/animated_favicon1.gif,N,,2026-01-24 07:57:39.945592

Under the purview of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, these lease sales allow companies to explore and drill for oil and gas found in America’s Outer Continental Shelf.

Buckingham wrote in her letter sent to the BOEM that she appreciates the opportunity to comment on yet another proposed lease sale, set for March, which will have a direct impact on funding public education through the Texas Permanent School Fund (PSF).

PSF is the largest owner of mineral rights in Texas.

According to Buckingham, nearly $6.2 billion has been generated for PSF through oil and gas production, sales, leases, and land transactions since 2023, with $1.6 billion received this past year alone.

“As the steward of the land and mineral estate dedicated to the PSF, I celebrate all efforts to expand energy production in the Gulf of America,” said Buckingham. “Texas is the energy capitol of the world, and we–the State of Texas and the Federal government–must continue to take advantage of our vast resources and offshore capabilities to benefit all U.S. citizens.”

The sale of offshore sale of oil and gas leases comes after the passing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which requires the Department of the Interior to hold 36 offshore oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of America and Alaska’s Cook Inlet until 2040 and puts the BOEM in charge of the project.

ComEd President and Chief Executive Officer Gil Quiniones said the company learned a lot from the process of filing and refiling its first grid plan.
“CUB is disappointed to see ComEd come in with another bloated, expensive grid plan,” CUB Executive Director Sarah Moskowitz wrote in a statement.
Energy demand also grew in part due to increased electric vehicle demand as the state tries to reach its goal of one million registered electric vehicles by 2030.
In its filing, ComEd said it experienced higher demand primarily concentrated around 55 of its substations.","CHICAGO — Electric utility Commonwealth Edison has asked regulators to review a $15.3 billion, four-year grid plan that it says will help meet growing energy demand and protect infrastructure from severe weather events.

The filing is part of the state’s grid planning process laid out in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, a landmark decarbonization bill that passed in 2021. It details the technology and infrastructure investments ComEd hopes to make from 2028 to 2031 to promote grid reliability.

But the plan will not be without a cost to ratepayers, and the consumer advocates who successfully championed a reduction to ComEd’s initial plan in 2023 are already pushing back against this year’s filing. It will undergo an 11-month review by the state’s utility regulator, the Illinois Commerce Commission.

If the investments proposed are approved in full by the ICC, ComEd expects residential customers to see an increased average cost of between $2.50 to $3 per month starting in 2028.

This would be separate from delivery rate increases, including a $243 million rate increase approved by the ICC in December that raised bills for its customers by a little over $3 per month. ComEd delivers electricity to over 4 million customers in northern Illinois.

The company says the plan is intended to account for increased energy demand from electric vehicles, data centers and more people choosing to heat their homes with electric heat rather than natural gas. The plan is also meant to accommodate new interconnections for renewable energy sources as consumer demand for solar increases.

“I’ve been in this industry about 22, 23 years, and I’ve never seen the amount of change that we are experiencing right now,” said Melissa Washington, senior vice president of customer operations at ComEd. “Most of the pace of change that we’re seeing has come about in the last three years and it’s continued to grow.”

The plan also doesn’t prevent ComEd from filing a standard rate request in future years. Company officials say they expect to file a new rate request in January 2027 that, if approved, would go into effect in January 2028 — the same year as the grid plan investments are expected to start.

Regulatory framework

CEJA’s 2021 passage required the state’s major electric utilities to prepare grid plans that outline how they will integrate new renewable energy resources and meet decarbonization requirements while prioritizing affordability, especially for low-income communities.

ComEd filed its first four-year grid plan request in 2023, but the ICC sent it back after deciding the company had failed to meet the standards set under CEJA. The company refiled a slimmed down spending plan the following year, and the commission ultimately approved a version that reduced spending on system improvements by about 25%, according to the commission.

ComEd President and Chief Executive Officer Gil Quiniones said the company learned a lot from the process of filing and refiling its first grid plan.

“We’ve applied all of the learnings from those experiences to this one, and we are confident that we’re putting a plan that is in alignment with the statute but also in alignment with the expectations of the commission,” Quiniones said.

Utility watchdog and consumer advocacy groups, however, expect to fight for similar reductions to this proposed plan. While most agree that some investment is needed, they argue it is not necessary now and could be implemented over coming years instead.

The Citizens Utility Board, an independent utility watchdog created by the Illinois legislature, said its lawyers are reviewing the filing to identify and push back on any “wasteful, inefficient and unnecessary spending.” The latest filing is over 800 pages.

“CUB is disappointed to see ComEd come in with another bloated, expensive grid plan,” CUB Executive Director Sarah Moskowitz wrote in a statement. “Everyone supports a strong distribution system, but ComEd has a responsibility to maintain its grid in a way that benefits customers and doesn’t bankrupt them.”

CUB will have the opportunity to submit testimony to the ICC opposing the grid plan, as will the attorney general’s office, environmental advocates and other stakeholders.

Increased energy demand

ComEd says the planned investments will allow the company to respond to increased consumer demand for electricity caused by factors ranging from electrification of homes to data centers and artificial intelligence. Energy demand also grew in part due to increased electric vehicle demand as the state tries to reach its goal of one million registered electric vehicles by 2030.

Over a third of the planned spending would support system reliability, including preventative maintenance and replacement of aging equipment, according to the filing. The plan also outlines investments in grid management, customer operations, new business and facility relocation and information technology architecture.

The plan proposes installation of three new substations across Chicago and two elsewhere in northern Illinois, while also adding new capacity at more than 70 of its substations. Substations are a part of the electricity transmission and distribution system that are key to lowering voltage to safe and usable levels before it enters homes and businesses.

In its filing, ComEd said it experienced higher demand primarily concentrated around 55 of its substations. Data center energy needs accounted for over 47% of that new substation demand, according to the filing.

The ICC and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are currently reviewing separate proceedings filed by ComEd last year that would require high energy-use applicants like data centers to make a financial commitment to meet certain transmission service thresholds. The company says this is designed to ensure that the cost of upgrades made to accommodate electricity use by those users is not passed on to other customers.

The attorney general’s office filed objections to the FERC request, writing that the proposed agreements fail to adequately protect other customers.

Gov. JB Pritzker recently signed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act into law, setting new requirements for battery storage and so-called “virtual power plants.” Senior ComEd officials said the grid plan factored in some of those elements but acknowledged it might need adjustments as they learn more about the law.

Affordability

Affordability and cost efficiency are key requirements under CEJA.

To be considered affordable, electricity costs must not account for more than 3% of average household income, or 6% for those who heat their homes with electricity.

Under the plan, average residential customers would devote 1.41% of their household income to electricity in 2028, up from 1.23% in 2026. By the third year of the plan, it would grow to 1.48%, which the company says is still lower than the national average of around 3%. ComEd said the average bill for its customers is currently around $106 per month.

CEJA also requires that at least 40% of grid modernization and clean energy investments benefit communities that have historically faced exclusion from economic opportunities or have faced disproportionate environmental burdens from pollution. ComEd estimates that 1.7 million customers, or approximately 42% of its customer base, fall within that classification, according to the filing.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WQAD/images/bb9be890-d0de-4ff2-9197-75ac2fe04055/20260123T202024/bb9be890-d0de-4ff2-9197-75ac2fe04055_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 23:58:54.606944

Indiana is moving forward with a massive water project that could cost over a billion dollars to supply the LEAP tech district in Lebanon, Indiana. Citizens Energy Group will pipe 25 million gallons daily from Central Indiana sources like Eagle Creek Reservoir through 52 miles of new transmission lines, seven storage tanks, and expanded treatment plants. The major concern with this plan is that wastewater will flow back south into Eagle Creek, raising concerns among residents about contamination and transparency. Officials promise residential ratepayers won’t see higher bills. They assure residents that businesses in this tech district will take on these costs.

Unfortunately Eli Lilly is the only business to have actually broken ground there. To cover the gap until more companies move in, the state deposited $50 million from the Indiana Finance Authority, using bonds that typically support community water infrastructure, to reside in a trust for the cost coverage. Critics question whether funding a massive corporate tech park contradicts the program’s original purpose of supporting communities in need. This initiative is setting a precedent for how states prioritize water resources—especially when rural communities across Indiana still struggle with basic water quality, availability, and wastewater needs.

More than half the world’s economy depends on nature, yet forests, pollinators, and clean water are often excluded as factors in financial decision-making. But nature’s just gotten a team of accountants. Environmental economists are calculating nature’s actual contributions through natural capital accounting and the numbers are staggering: pollinators contribute $800 billion globally each year, mangrove forests prevent $65 billion in property damage annually, and a 2022 U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service report showed that birders alone spent over $107 billion in a single year.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates that the endangered North Atlantic right whale generated $2.3 billion in sales for the whale-watching industry in a single year. Conservation groups often use these analyses to make the case for protection of plants and wildlife. And countries around the world are using these calculations to inform development decisions, while businesses increasingly face pressure to disclose biodiversity risks.

Although there are upsides to this approach, Indigenous leaders and some environmentalists argue that assigning dollar values to nature commodifies our relatives and sources of life, treating ecosystems as products rather than recognizing their intrinsic worth. Supporters insist that while it’s not perfect, speaking in financial terms gets decision-makers to actually pay attention and factor these natural considerations into the bottom-line equation. As one researcher put it, many of nature’s values only become apparent once they’re lost—and by then, the economic damage runs into trillions annually. This matters because how we value nature can fundamentally shape whether we protect or destroy it.

A federal judge ruled that a nearly-complete offshore wind farm off Rhode Island can resume construction, handing the industry a victory against the Trump administration’s efforts to shut it down. Revolution Wind was nearly 90% finished when the Trump administration halted it just before Christmas, citing national security concerns. The project’s attorney argued the delay costs more than $1.4 million daily, and specialized vessels had limited time to install remaining turbines. Judge Royce Lamberth questioned the government’s motives, especially after Trump called wind farms “losers” that lose money and kill birds.

This marks the second time a judge has overturned a stop-work order on this same project. Four other major offshore wind projects remain stalled, with hearings scheduled this week. Connecticut officials estimate the state could lose $500 million annually if the project were permanently blocked. These battles will shape America’s clean energy future and could determine whether billions already invested in offshore wind pay off or become stranded assets.

Meat’s on the menu at Tufts University, where—though a $2.1 million state grant—an innovation hub for lab-grown foods will open this year. The center will bring together scientists, food policymakers, and entrepreneurs to accelerate the development of “cellular agriculture”—meat grown from cells in bioreactors rather than produced from the traditional meat industry.

For years, meat production has been linked to antibiotic resistance, deforestation, and climate change, issues many vegetarians and vegans cite as reasons for their dietary lifestyles. Proponents say that cultivated (or lab-grown) meat could offer a solution to the rising global demand for meat—potentially reducing animal suffering without proposing an entire shift away from meat. Tufts already offers the world’s first undergraduate degree in cellular agriculture and this new hub will include lab equipment, a test kitchen, and an open-access bank where researchers can access cultured cells to develop products.

Despite all of this progress, the industry of lab-grown meat has seen a lot of resistance. It is banned in Florida and Alabama, and many consumers remain skeptical. From the environmental realities of expanded laboratories to the debate over hormones and growth factors in cultivated meat, this technology continues to drive questions about how to best treat our planet and its inhabitants.",https://wfhb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WFHBshowgraphics_square-crop.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 21:59:40.291213

No longer. I recently attended an event at GA Tech in Atlanta to discuss strategies to strengthen the state's battery manufacturing and mineral processing industries.

The data does not lie, and it is dismantling these beliefs one by one to leave a single truth: electric cars break down less, are more reliable, and are even repaired faster than gasoline or diesel cars.
Mechanically, an electric car is much simpler.
And the fewer things that move, the fewer things break.
That said, one of the most common issues is still the 12 volt auxiliary battery, the same one used in traditional combustion cars.","Electric cars still cause a bit of fear. There are still people who think they will end up stranded in the middle of the road, that they will have to deal with rare and very strange breakdowns. But the reality is exactly the opposite. The data does not lie, and it is dismantling these beliefs one by one to leave a single truth: electric cars break down less, are more reliable, and are even repaired faster than gasoline or diesel cars.

The stories we have been told for years no longer fit with the reality of the automotive world, so stop chasing ghosts, because we are going to tell you why it really is a good idea to switch to an electric car.

They have fewer parts

It is that simple. The fewer parts there are, the fewer things that can break, right? Organizations such as ADAC or Autotrader are analyzing millions of real roadside assistance cases to verify these data, yes, real cars, and they are reaching the conclusion that electric cars fail less, especially in their first years of life.

Mechanically, an electric car is much simpler. No oil changes, no clutch, no exhaust. And the fewer things that move, the fewer things break. It is that simple.

Faster repairs

According to AA records, when an electric car has an issue, the chances that it can be fixed on the spot, and without the need for a tow truck, are much higher.

That said, one of the most common issues is still the 12 volt auxiliary battery, the same one used in traditional combustion cars. They could not have everything. At least the clutch does not break.

“Okay, but what about the big battery?”

An awkward silence. The usual question. For years it was believed that the battery was the problem, that it degraded very quickly, that the car could end up dead in just a few years. Almost the same thing people say about iPhone batteries. But life has moved on, and modern batteries can last hundreds of thousands of miles at optimal levels. They also have next generation sensors and software that help take better care of them.

Batteries are no longer a problem. They are now a guarantee of long life, even if ten years ago that seemed unthinkable.

But then, why does it not start?

Because despite all the evidence we have that the future will be electric, and despite all the improvements this sector has seen, many people still think EVs are fragile, unreliable, or not ready yet. What more do they want?

Most of these fears come from old experiences or early generations, even though we do not doubt that many people have not experienced them firsthand. The current reality is very different.

In fact, running out of battery is less common than suffering a serious mechanical failure in a combustion car, but that does not make the news.

A change in mindset

It is time to accept that our present has to change in order to have a good future. Talking about electric cars is already talking about reliability. It is important for people to stop being afraid of these cars, because otherwise all we do is delay the transition. And trust us when we say that we need this transition now, we cannot keep destroying the planet with combustion.

Many may still doubt it, but you know it is a reality that EVs are much more robust and reliable day to day. So why do we keep doubting when we have so much evidence that this is the case?",https://www.blanquivioletas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/electric-cars-charging1500x900-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 20:59:50.419437

Speaking in Detroit on January 13, Trump said to “let China come in,” indicating he would not block them from manufacturing in the US.
Chinese automakers could start making cars in the US, the engineer said.
The Chinese company is considering using Volvo production facilities in the US for its expansion into the country.
Although the US now levies a 100% tariff on Chinese vehicles, automakers there have models that could double in price and still come in below USD 30,000.","Ahead of the Detroit Auto Show, US President Donald Trump paid a visit to the city, declaring that he was “standing up for the American auto worker like no president has ever stood up before.”

Stocks tied to the automotive sector were not in a welcoming mood. Between January 9 and 15, General Motors slid 3%, Ford Motor fell 4%, and Stellantis dropped 11%, due in large part to announced losses related to electric vehicles following the Trump administration’s turn away from EVs.

At the show, the main topic of conversation on the floor was not Trump, but the question of when Chinese automakers will arrive in the US.

The discussion was spurred by the CES technology show held a week earlier in Las Vegas.

The event had enough Chinese automakers to feel like a car show, despite the fact that they do not make or sell vehicles in the US An executive at major Chinese EV company Geely said the company is weighing an expansion into the US, with an announcement expected to come in the next 24–36 months.

Speaking in Detroit on January 13, Trump said to “let China come in,” indicating he would not block them from manufacturing in the US.

The show, by contrast, felt as if it was keeping China out. EVs were scarce, and many US automakers put non-electric models front and center. But consumers seem to have their sights set further out.

BYD cars are everywhere in Brazil, said an engineer in the country who came to Detroit to see GM models that use parts he worked on. Chinese automakers could start making cars in the US, the engineer said.

BYD already dominates EV sales in Brazil, accounting for 72% of the total in 2025. It opened its first South American plant there in July.

Joe McCabe, CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, argued that it is only a matter of time before Chinese players come into the US, saying that it is consumers who decide whether products are good.

Much like how Japanese and South Korean automakers emphasized the quality of their cars when they first entered the country, Chinese companies are scrambling to figure out how to connect with consumers to gain market share, McCabe said. That led them to exhibit at CES despite the tensions between China and the US.

There are vehicles in the US that consumers know well without realizing their connection to China. A prime example is Sweden’s Volvo, which is owned by Geely. The Chinese company is considering using Volvo production facilities in the US for its expansion into the country.

One word Trump kept coming back to in Detroit was “affordable,” which in the US denotes cars prices around USD 20,000–30,000.

Although the US now levies a 100% tariff on Chinese vehicles, automakers there have models that could double in price and still come in below USD 30,000. The fact that they are produced in China is what makes those low prices possible, but if these companies can manufacture in the US as well, they could pose a threat.

According to Peipai Zhao, president of the North American operations of Chinese LiDAR (light detection and ranging) sensor maker RoboSense, Chinese automakers considering entering the US are weighing three options: improving quality to attract consumers, partnering with US companies, or setting up a different company with no connection to China. Either way, affordability looks likely to be key.",https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EV-1.png,N,,2026-01-23 20:59:47.082608

What to know - The Bristol Edition,"David Fortier, John Moritz",,,,,https://www.bristoledition.org/blog/2026/01/23/still-interested-in-solar-despite-expiring-tax-credits-what-to-know/,"As of Jan. 1, the federal government is no longer offering tax credits worth up to 30% of the cost of a new solar residential system.
Those tax credits were enacted under President Joe Biden’s administration and eliminated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald J. Trump in July.
Those rules are expected to increase the price of panels, in addition to the loss of any available tax credits.
Their legislation, Senate Bill 4, was passed before the changes to the federal tax credits.
PURA did increase price caps and other incentives for non-residential solar systems in 2026 in order to account for the loss of the federal tax credits.","Big changes are underway for Connecticut’s residential solar market as a result of recent policy shifts at both the state and federal level. What that means for homeowners interested in going solar depends on the type of system they’re interested in, household usage and personal finances.

As of Jan. 1, the federal government is no longer offering tax credits worth up to 30% of the cost of a new solar residential system. Those tax credits were enacted under President Joe Biden’s administration and eliminated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald J. Trump in July.

With a typical rooftop solar setup in Connecticut costing upwards of $30,000, those credits were worth $9,000 or more on a system purchased up front by a homeowner.

Systems that are leased or subject to third-party power purchase agreements are still eligible for a separate, commercial tax credit until Dec. 31, 2027.

However, in order to qualify for those incentives, solar systems will have to comply with new rules put in place by the OBBA limiting the amount of foreign-manufactured parts from countries like China. Those rules are expected to increase the price of panels, in addition to the loss of any available tax credits.

How has the loss of the federal incentives impacted the solar market in Connecticut?

Jason Calabrese, the operations manager at Middlebury’s Ion Solar Pros, predicted that sales would drop between 20% and 25% in 2026 as a result of those changes and the uncertainty they have brought to the solar market.

“A good portion of it’s based upon customer confusion,” Calabrese said. “Some people think that solar is ending altogether, that there’s no opportunity now to go solar. It’s created some uncertainty in the marketplace, which uncertainty in any marketplace is not good for sales.”

In the aftermath of the OBBA’s passage, several solar installers and financiers around the country shut down or filed for bankruptcy. In Connecticut, the fallout has been limited to two companies — PosiGen and Sunnova — according to Mike Trahan, the executive director of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association.

Trahan noted that even before the law, more than two-thirds of new solar systems being deployed in Connecticut were owned by third parties. For those residents who still want to own their own systems, Trahan said the loss of the federal tax credits had forced developers to work with banks to create new financing options.

“It’s become an interesting time, I’ve been hearing from people and how they are trying to figure out new products, new lending, loan and sales products, to consumers,” Trahan said.

What state-level policies are changing?

In addition to the loss of federal tax credits, Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority in December approved several changes to its residential and commercial solar programs. One of the most notable changes was a 704% increase in the charge assessed on the output of residential solar systems, from half-a-cent per kilowatt hour to more than 4 cents a kWh.

That increase was dictated, in part, by state lawmakers in order to better align the cost of rooftop solar incentives with the state’s rising price of electricity. Their legislation, Senate Bill 4, was passed before the changes to the federal tax credits.

While PURA did consider offering additional incentives for individually-owned systems to offset the loss of the federal tax credits, the commissioners ultimately opted not do so due to the cost and administrative effort required to create those incentives for a limited time period.

Trahan said that he is planning to ask PURA to reconsider its decision in early 2026.

If the new state charges go into effect along with the loss of federal tax credits, the result for system owners is that it could take another four or five years to recoup their initial investment, according to Sean Riel, the director of residential sales at Ellington’s Earthlight Technologies. Still, he said he remained optimistic that leasing would be seen as viable alternative for customers over the next two years.

“If you’re going with a lease, the pitch there remains the same: that you’re going to be locking in a lower rate for power through purchasing solar energy versus paying the utility,” Riel said.

PURA did increase price caps and other incentives for non-residential solar systems in 2026 in order to account for the loss of the federal tax credits.

Another change taking effect on Jan. 1 is a new state law dictating that most condo complexes can no longer “prohibit or unreasonably restrict” owners of single-family, detached units from installing solar panels on their roofs. Complexes that wish to opt out of the new requirements must do so by Jan. 1, 2028 with a three-quarters vote of their board.

Andrew Belden, vice president for renewable programs and strategy at Eversource, said that it remains to be seen how customers and the solar industry react to the shifting state and federal policies.

“The industry hasn’t metabolized a change like this, ever,” Belden said. “So, 2026 will be a year when we’re going to find out a lot about how the market is going to react to changes. What we always suggest for customers is to treat solar installation as you would any other home improvement project: shop around, ask questions. There are likely good deals to be had, but there are also challenges.”

,Texas American Energy ,2026-01-24 00:28:31+00:00,Los Angeles Times,California's fight with offshore oil firm escalates with lawsuit against Trump administration,"Grace Toohey, www.latimes.com, grace-toohey",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-23/california-battle-offshore-oil-rigs-escalates,"For more than a year, a Texas oil firm has clashed with California officials over controversial plans to restart offshore oil operations along the Santa Barbara County coast.
Now, California’s feud with Sable Offshore Corp. has escalated further, and involves the Trump administration.
The Trump administration didn’t immediately get involved, but it did signal its support for the project last year, as part of its goal to increase U.S.-made oil.
But in December, PHMSA officials reclassified the onshore pipelines as “interstate” pipelines, citing their link to offshore rigs along the Outer Continental Shelf in federal waters.
That step, which is key to restarting the offshore oil production, has remained stalled because Sable has repeatedly clashed with state and local officials.","For more than a year, a Texas oil firm has clashed with California officials over controversial plans to restart offshore oil operations along the Santa Barbara County coast.

Now, California’s feud with Sable Offshore Corp. has escalated further, and involves the Trump administration.

On Friday, California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta announced that he had filed suit against the federal government, alleging that the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration had usurped the jurisdiction and regulatory authority of Sable’s oil pipelines in an “unlawful power grab.”

“California has seen first-hand the devastating environmental and public health impacts of coastal oil spills — yet the Trump Administration will stop at nothing to evade state regulation which protects against these very disasters,” Bonta said in a statement Friday. “California will not stand idly by as the President endangers California’s beautiful coastline and our public health to increase profits for his fossil fuel industry friends.”

The attorney general’s petition, filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, challenges PHMSA’s attempt to federalize oversight of two onshore pipelines and its recent approval of Sable’s plan to restart the lines. Along with the Office of the State Fire Marshal, the agency that had been working to review Sable’s restart plan, the attorney general argued that PHMSA’s decisions violate the Administrative Procedure Act and asked the court to overturn them.

A spokesperson for the federal pipeline agency, which falls under the U.S. Department of Transportation, disputed California’s challenge, pointing out that the pipelines were “regulated for decades, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, as an interstate pipeline.”

The lines were “redesignated as intrastate in 2016 when ... taken out of service,” a statement from the PHMSA spokesperson said. “Based on the facts presented by Sable in their letter to us last November, PHMSA agreed with the operator that returning the pipeline to our jurisdiction was appropriate.”

Restarting the pipelines “will bring much needed American energy to a state with the highest gas prices in the country,” the statement said. “We look forward to a swift resolution in this case to provide the operator with regulatory certainty and Californians with affordable American energy.”

Representatives for Sable did not respond to a request for comment on the case.

Approvals for these pipelines have become a major sticking point in the Houston-based company’s plan to revive three drilling rigs in federal waters off Santa Barbara County’s coast.

The pipelines are part of a network of offshore and onshore lines. The two lines in question are located onshore and run through Santa Barbara and Kern counties. A corroded section of one of them burst in 2015 near Refugio State Beach, causing one of the biggest oil spills in the state’s history.

The former owner shuttered operation after that spill, but Sable announced in 2024 that it planned to restart oil production — a move that sparked fear and concern among locals, environmental activists and state and local regulators.

The Trump administration didn’t immediately get involved, but it did signal its support for the project last year, as part of its goal to increase U.S.-made oil.

But in December, PHMSA officials reclassified the onshore pipelines as “interstate” pipelines, citing their link to offshore rigs along the Outer Continental Shelf in federal waters.

Soon after that, the federal agency approved the pipelines for a restart, shocking many who had been working for more than a year to ensure Sable’s compliance with state and local laws.

Bonta on Friday called both those findings from PHMSA incorrect and illegal, saying the federal agency had “no right to usurp California regulatory authority, pointing out that the pipelines “originate and terminate within California.” That is how they were described and mapped in the federal consent decree reached after the 2015 spill.

“The law is clear. These pipelines are in California’s jurisdiction,” Bonta said Friday morning at Dockweiler State Beach. Bonta said the beach was just one of many stretches of California coastline that President Trump and the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration are putting at risk.”

“The federal administration has no right to usurp California’s regulatory authority,” he said. “We are taking them to court to draw a line in the sand and to protect our coast, beaches and communities from potentially hazardous pipelines.”

While Bonta was clear that his office’s latest lawsuit doesn’t directly address whether the the pipelines should, or can safely, restart, he said the current approvals from PHMSA mean the company might do so “in short order.”

But despite the green light from federal officials, Sable representatives told a Santa Barbara County judge this month that it hasn’t yet started transporting oil through the two pipelines in question.

That step, which is key to restarting the offshore oil production, has remained stalled because Sable has repeatedly clashed with state and local officials.

Last year, the California Coastal Commission found that Sable had failed to adhere to the state’s Coastal Act despite repeated warnings and fined the company $18 million. In September, the Santa Barbara County district attorney’s office filed criminal charges against the company, accusing it of knowingly violating state environmental laws while working on repairs to oil pipelines that have sat idle since a major spill in 2015.

The company also remains entangled in several ongoing lawsuits, including one brought by the Central Coast Water Board — represented by Bonta’s office — that alleges the company repeatedly failed to follow state laws and regulations intended to protect water resources, repeatedly putting “profits over environmental protections.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/057fd50/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F42%2F45%2F9d633fdb432f8de0cf504b048218%2F1539201-me-federal-offshore-oil-platforms-lawsuit008.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 19:58:34.499421

TOP NEWS IN ENERGY AFFORDABILITY

STATE NEWS

STATE LEADERS DELIVER ON CAMPAIGN PROMISES: In their first few days in office, newly elected governors in New Jersey and Virginia and utility commissioners in Georgia took decisive action to lower energy costs, hold utilities accountable for rising prices, and to expand clean energy initiatives. New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill signed two executive orders to freeze electricity rates and accelerate clean energy solutions that lower costs for New Jersey families, while Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger pledged to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). In Georgia, Dr. Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard were sworn into the Public Service Commission and are immediately working to focus their efforts on utility rate relief. The swift actions of these newly elected leaders reflects the clear message from voters last November, who supported candidates ready to address high energy costs and push for clean energy solutions.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of State Policy and Advocacy Bill Holland said, “These rapid, immediate actions to address costs follow the clear message from voters last November. They supported clean energy champions who were ready to address high energy costs and build more clean affordable energy. With overwhelming results in key races like Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial elections and Georgia’s Public Service Commission, voters rejected the Trump Administration’s policies that ban clean energy and prop up dirtier, more expensive sources.

“In just their first days in office we are already seeing new leaders deliver on election promises for real action to lower bills, build more clean energy, and take on utilities raising rates.”

NEW JERSEY LCV TAKE: New Jersey LCV Interim Executive Director Allison McLeod said, “Governor Sherrill is wasting no time in delivering on her promise to make New Jersey more affordable for New Jersey’s working families. By taking strong executive actions on her first day, she is taking a holistic approach to the energy crisis: providing an immediate rate freeze for families while simultaneously clearing the path for the long-term clean energy solutions that will permanently lower rates.

“We look forward to working closely with the Governor to build on this momentum. We know clean energy like solar is the cheapest form of energy available, the fastest to deploy and can create high-quality, local union jobs right here in our communities. Today’s actions prove that we can protect our environment and the pocketbooks of working families at the same time.”

VALCV TAKE: Virginia League of Conservation Voters Executive Director Michael Town said, “Governor-elect Spanberger is wasting no time delivering on her promises to cut energy costs for Virginians. The agenda she laid out today goes a long way toward getting more clean, affordable energy online, holding utilities and big corporations accountable, and cutting energy bills. We look forward to working with lawmakers to pass this ambitious agenda in the coming legislative session as part of a larger effort aimed at securing a clean, affordable energy transition that puts Virginians first.”

GCV TAKE: Georgia Conservation Voters Executive Director Brionté McCorkle said, “The message of this election is unmistakable: Georgians demand an end to utility bill rate hikes and corporate politics as usual on the PSC. Georgia Conservation Voters and our affiliated entities invested over $3 million in these elections, marking our largest investment ever because we had to make sure voters knew the stakes at the ballot box – from utility bills to corporate polluters.”

NATIONAL NEWS

HOUSE DEMOCRATS LAUNCH CONGRESSIONAL LOWERING UTILITY BILLS CAUCUS: Representative Josh Riley (NY-19) and more than a dozen House Democrats are launching a new Congressional Lowering Utility Bills Caucus to address rising electricity, gas, and water costs nationwide. The caucus aims to focus on legislative strategies to rein in utility monopolies and reduce energy costs for consumers.

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS

HOUSE OVERTURNS PROTECTIONS FOR BOUNDARY WATERS FROM TOXIC MINING: The House passed a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution of disapproval to overturn popular protections for the headwaters of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Voyageurs National Park, and the surrounding Superior National Forest from toxic copper-nickel sulfide ore mining. Republicans are trying to use the CRA for purposes outside of its statutory text; this illegitimate resolution is the first time a public lands withdrawal has been challenged through the CRA.

OUR TAKE: LCV Conservation Program Director America Fitzpatrick said, “The Trump administration and its Republican allies in Congress are once again prioritizing polluter profits over people by attempting to sell off our treasured public lands to foreign mining interests. Rolling back protections that safeguard the headwaters of the Boundary Waters, the most visited wilderness area in the country, ignores decades of science and hundreds of thousands of public comments from across the country that shaped and supported safeguards for this beloved place. The use of the CRA to unwind a withdrawal and strip these protections from toxic mining would not only cause irreparable harm to the surrounding ecosystems, but would set a dangerous precedent for Congress to target public lands withdrawals as rules under the CRA. We cannot allow this administration to ignore science and democracy to destroy our public lands for the benefit of Big Polluters.”

CONSERVATION MINNESOTA TAKE: Conservation Minnesota Executive Director Paul Austin said, “The Boundary Waters are part of who we are as Minnesotans—a place where generations have learned to paddle, fish, and fall in love with clean water and wild spaces. Protecting them means protecting our shared heritage. The Boundary Waters wilderness area is also an economic engine for Minnesota, generating $1.1 billion annually, including 17,000 jobs across the tourism industry. Sulfide-ore copper and nickel mining carries far greater risks to water quality than traditional iron mining, and those risks are simply too high for a place this special. We have a responsibility to protect the Boundary Waters for generations to come.”

LCV RELEASES MEMO ON HOW TRUMP’S COAL OBSESSION IS DRIVING UP OUR COSTS: LCV released a memo detailing how the Trump administration is driving up energy costs by forcing outdated and expensive coal plants to stay open. These plants were scheduled to retire due to their high operating costs, frequent breakdowns, and crumbling infrastructure, but the administration plans to prop them up with millions of taxpayer dollars, ignoring the public’s demands for affordable, clean energy.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Director of State Climate and Equity Policy Lashelle Johnson and LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis said, “We know that clean sources like wind and solar are now the fastest and cheapest way to get more energy onto the grid. As energy demand ramps up significantly, blocking wind projects, cutting clean energy tax incentives, and pulling dedicated funding have dramatically reduced the supply of new energy, making prices continue to rise. This latest coal plant campaign is their most egregious example yet. Holding these dilapidated dying plants open costs us millions, all while we could be connecting and building more clean, affordable energy. The public needs to see the coordination. They must understand the corruption. And they have to know who is to blame.”

ICYMI: STATE NEWS

VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE SENDS RESTORATION OF RIGHTS TO THE BALLOT: The Virginia Legislature passed resolutions in both chambers to send a constitutional amendment to the voters this fall that would restore the right to vote to returning citizens. Virginia is the only state that permanently and automatically bans anyone with a felony conviction from voting and requires them to individually petition the governor to get their voting rights restored. This law is a remnant of Jim Crow, aimed at diminishing the rights and powers of Black Virginians.

VALCV TAKE: Virginia LCV Chief Program and Communications Officer Lee Francis said, “Passage of these amendments is a huge step forward for a healthier democracy in Virginia as we work toward ending more than a century of constitutionally enshrined disenfranchisement in the Commonwealth. We look forward to working to get this ballot measure across the finish line this Fall and securing a democracy that works for all Virginians.”

VERMONT LEGISLATURE INTRODUCES STATE VOTING RIGHTS ACT: This week, Senate Democrats introduced a state Voting Rights Act to codify voting rights into state law and protect Vermonters from Trump’s attempts to disenfranchise large swaths of eligible voters. Vermont Conservation Voters led the charge on getting the VRA drafted and introduced. The bill, S. 298, is sponsored by 18 of the state’s 30 state senators, and includes tripartisan support.

VCV TAKE: Vermont Conservation Voters Political Director Justin Marsh said, “Environmental protection and voting rights are inseparable. By passing a state Voting Rights Act, Vermont can once again show that democracy and environmental leadership go hand in hand. Because when more people can safely and fairly participate in elections, we make better decisions for our climate, our communities, and future generations.”

LCV, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS CALL ON CONGRESS TO HOLD ZELDIN ACCOUNTABLE: LCV joined Mom’s Clean Air Force and 197 additional organizations to call on Congress to hold EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin accountable for abandoning EPA’s mission to protect public health and the environment.

COALITION TAKE: From the letter, “Our organizations are concerned that EPA is pursuing an aggressive deregulatory agenda that has resulted in a massive increase in health-damaging air pollution, toxic chemicals, and climate-heating greenhouse gases. These actions put our children’s lives in danger and will harm the health of people in the U.S. for generations.

“EPA’s only job is to protect human health and the environment. Congress has tasked EPA with clear mandates to achieve this goal through laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.

1. Supreme Court will not hear Duke Energy’s appeal in anti-monopoly case — The Carolina Journal

Duke Energy has long dominated the Carolinas’ wholesale electricity market, including service to Fayetteville, North Carolina. When Fayetteville’s long-term power contract came up for renewal, a rival company, NTE Carolinas, tried to enter the market with a cleaner and cheaper natural gas plant. According to NTE, Duke couldn’t match the offer through ordinary competition, so it allegedly coordinated anticompetitive tactics. NTE said Duke’s actions were intended to deter the city from switching suppliers and sued the utility for anticompetitive behaviors.

Duke argued its actions were lawful business behavior, but after the Fourth Circuit revived NTE’s case, Duke petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review that ruling. The court declined to hear the appeal.

2. Soaring Electricity Costs Are Now a Hot Political Issue — The Wall Street Journal

US electricity costs are outpacing inflation, pushing utility bills into the political spotlight ahead of the midterms after rising 6.7% in December and about 38% since 2020. Much of the blame is falling on energy-hungry data centers, prompting bipartisan concern from governors and lawmakers who argue that households shouldn’t shoulder the costs of expanding power infrastructure for big tech.

Trump administration officials have pressed the nation’s largest grid operator to hold an emergency power auction and are pushing tech companies to supply their own power or pay for new generation for new data centers. At the state level, elected officials from both parties are challenging proposed utility rate hikes, citing affordability concerns among consumers.

3. Trump Is Obsessed With Oil, but Chinese Batteries Will Soon Run the World — The New York Times

Despite the global push for electrification and reduced fossil-fuel use, Mr. Wang writes President Trump has a hunger for natural resources from abroad and the power they could grant him. His gamble is that countries will still want to buy US oil for cars, trucks, ships and planes.

China on the other hand wants to substitute electricity for oil to solve its own problems, while selling batteries and other electric products abroad. Canada is its newest buyer of EVs after cutting its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products.

4. Solar Projects Face Turmoil Under Trump, but Big Business Is Still Banking on Them — The Wall Street Journal

Despite the administration’s phaseout of clean energy tax credits, large corporate energy buyers are still attracted to solar’s low-cost and speed to deployment.

Deutsche Bank recently backed Aspen Power with a $200 million capital raise, and major brands and tech companies including Tapestry, Meta, Google, and Apple are signing solar deals to meet carbon pollution targets and keep pace with rising electricity demand from data centers.

The administration itself surprised the industry by allowing Nevada’s Libra Solar Project to proceed, even as it attempted to halt offshore wind projects.

Industry leaders and some bipartisan lawmakers argue that market forces, not federal policy, are now driving solar’s momentum.

5. What’s a Human Life Worth? The E.P.A. Says Zero Dollars. — The New York Times

The EPA has stopped assigning a dollar value to lives saved in cost-benefit analyses for major air pollution rules, effectively treating the value of human life as zero when weighing new regulations.

By counting only compliance costs to industry, and not monetized public health benefits, the shift could justify weaker limits on deadly pollutants like fine particulate matter and ozone. Critics say this abandons a decades-old tool that helped defend strong clean-air rules and could lead to dirtier air and more premature deaths, while the agency argues the health impacts are too uncertain to monetize right now.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/maxresdefault-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 20:59:54.181775

Earlier today, I spoke to Caroline Fountain, a spokeswoman for the power company.

Who says they are constantly watching the forecast for the entire state.

Starting tonight, they will have those 18,000 crew workers and their trucks stationed at 22 base camps across the state.

Here in Eastern Carolina, we won't be heavily impacted by snowinstead, ice, which Fountain says is one of the reasons they’ve called in the extra personnel.

It takes up to six inches of wet, heavy snow in order to start to impacting and breaking tree limbs that could fall on our power lines. It only takes about a quarter inch of ice to do the same thing. And then once you get to a half inch of ice that can actually start to impact our powerlines themselves.

We’re encouraging our customers to prepare for what could potentially be widespread power outages.

With the potential impact, crews have begun trimming trees and vegetation in targeted areas to reduce potential damage to power lines.

As of now, the western part of the state is expected to see more of an impact than we are here in the East, but Fountain says that it is still important to get prepared now.

That means having a backup plan in case of power outages, water, non-perishable food items, a flashlight, extra batteries, you name it.

The company highlighted that an efficient energy transition was the need of the hour to meet the growing power demands of data centers.

Energy Transition

Nxtra’s energy transition strategy centers on reducing reliance on conventional grid power and progressively increasing the integration of cleaner energy, supported by an efficiency-first design.

The company increased renewable energy usage by 14.5% in FY25 compared to the previous fiscal year. It also transitioned 49% of total electricity consumption in the core data centers to renewable energy and contracted 482,800 MWh of renewable energy so far to power operations across 65+ facilities.

Source: Nxtra

Nxtra has become the first data center company in India to join the prestigious RE100 initiative, pledging to source 100% of our electricity from renewable energy.

The company is aligned with the broader goal of achieving Net Zero emissions by 2031. It has already made substantial progress on this journey, contracting 482,800 MWh of renewable energy to date and significantly reducing our emissions footprint.

Carbon Emissions

The company measures and reports its greenhouse gas emissions in line with GHG Protocol requirements, covering data collection, consolidation, and verification through structured internal controls.

Its carbon reduction strategy continues to evolve in response to the growing climate ambitions of our clients, many of whom are prioritising supply chain decarbonisation and greater transparency.

In FY25, Nxtra adopted a refined emissions boundary methodology to improve the accuracy and consistency of its greenhouse gas accounting, particularly for energy consumption associated with client operations.

Nxtra’s emissions disclosures for FY25 were independently assured by TÜV Rheinland, which concluded that the reported data present a fair and balanced view of the company’s sustainability performance.

Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency remains the primary lever for reducing Nxtra’s environmental footprint. The company focuses on optimizing power usage effectiveness through advanced cooling technologies, efficient electrical systems, and real-time monitoring of energy performance across data centres.

Continuous tracking of energy intensity per MW of IT load allows Nxtra to benchmark performance against global best practices and identify efficiency gains as capacity expands.

Green Buildings

The report highlights Nxtra’s emphasis on sustainable design and green building practices, including energy-efficient architecture, optimized cooling layouts, sustainable materials, and integrated environmental controls.

It has selected all core and subcomponents, including electrical, mechanical, control systems, and telecom equipment, with a focus on operational efficiency and minimising physical footprint.

Green building principles are applied at the design stage to reduce lifecycle environmental impact, improve energy and water efficiency, and enhance resilience of facilities operating in resource-constrained regions

Climate Strategy

Nxtra positions climate action as a core business imperative, driven by the rapid expansion of energy-intensive data centre infrastructure. The company integrates climate risk assessment into site selection, capacity planning, and operational decision-making, particularly regarding water stress, energy availability, and extreme weather risks.

Last October, Nxtra announced that it would procure power from a 13.2 MW solar project in captive mode from AMPIN Energy C&I Sixteen’s project in Maharashtra.

Earlier, Nxtra had signed a new power wheeling agreement with AMPIN for the supply of 125.65 MW of solar-wind hybrid energy.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2306905657-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 19:00:07.381194

“From the outset of this case, we have been clear that executive branch agencies have no authority to cancel entire grant programs mandated by Congress.
Nineteen plaintiffs, including CleanAIRE NC, the Organic Association of Kentucky and the Bronx River Alliance, sued the Trump administration last March.
“We have clear evidence that this administration terminated not just individual grants but entire grant programs, like the Environment and Climate Justice block grant program,” Meyer said.
“We look forward to following the Fourth Circuit’s direction to present this evidence to the district court, and requesting the funding be restored.”","Six cities and 13 nonprofit groups still cannot recoup millions of dollars after the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals this week overturned a lower court’s ruling that forbade the Trump administration from terminating or freezing grant funding for environmental justice, agricultural and climate programs.

The three-judge panel—Paul Niemeyer, Allison Rushing and Toby Heyten—concluded that “the district court abused its discretion” in issuing injunctions against the administration.

Niemeyer was appointed to the bench by President George H.W. Bush; Rushing by President Donald Trump; and Heyten by President Joe Biden.

The restoration of specific grants could now be decided by the federal Court of Special Claims, which hears contract and monetary disputes with the U.S. government.

A U.S. District Court could still hear broader questions regarding the legality of the Trump administration’s elimination of entire congressionally approved programs, said Kym Meyer, senior litigation director for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is representing several plaintiffs.

“From the outset of this case, we have been clear that executive branch agencies have no authority to cancel entire grant programs mandated by Congress. Nothing in today’s opinion alters that long-held understanding of the law and our constitutional order,” Meyer said.

The Trump administration paused or terminated the grants a year ago as part of a sweeping review and elimination of equity-related programs, including those addressing environmental injustices.

Nineteen plaintiffs, including CleanAIRE NC, the Organic Association of Kentucky and the Bronx River Alliance, sued the Trump administration last March. They argued that, since Congress had appropriated funding for the environmental and climate grants in the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the administration’s actions were unconstitutional.

The plaintiffs also argued that the government’s actions were “arbitrary and capricious” and violated the Administrative Procedures Act, which dictates how federal agencies develop and issue regulations.

U.S. District Court Judge Richard Gergel of South Carolina ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in May and directed the government to immediately restore funding for 32 of 38 programs.

In June, lawyers for the administration successfully appealed to the Fourth Circuit for a stay, which put a hold on the district court’s ruling. The Appeals Court heard the case in October.

The Justice Department, representing the administration, has consistently framed the dispute as a contractual matter , not a constitutional one. The appellate judges largely agreed, writing that there is no statute requiring the government to contract specifically with the plaintiffs.

CleanAIRE NC, based in Charlotte, is among the plaintiffs. The nonprofit received a $500,000 Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving grant from the EPA in June 2024 to monitor air quality in four underserved communities in northern Mecklenburg County.

The grant would have also allowed CleanAIRE NC to train community health workers to track air quality and conduct a health impact assessment with several local health departments and North Carolina State University.

“This ruling is a deeply frustrating setback for north Mecklenburg residents who have waited decades for basic transparency about the air they breathe,” said Jeffrey Robbins, CleanAIRE NC’s executive director. “However, this is not the end of the road. While the court blocked the immediate return of individual grants, it left open a path for us to challenge the legality of the government’s wholesale cancellation of the entire grant program. Our coalition remains committed to this fight and is hopeful the courts will ultimately deliver the resources our communities were promised.”

There could be an opportunity for the 19 plaintiffs in this case to challenge the reasoning behind the Trump administration’s broad grant cancellations in federal district court.

The appellate judges cited a key U.S. Supreme Court decision published last August. In National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association, the Supreme Court ruled the federal district courts had no jurisdiction to hear cases about the administration’s cancellation of research-related government grants.

However, Justice Amy Coney Barrett broke from the other conservative justices on whether the government’s guidance that informed the cancellations could be challenged in traditional federal courts.

“We have clear evidence that this administration terminated not just individual grants but entire grant programs, like the Environment and Climate Justice block grant program,” Meyer said. “We look forward to following the Fourth Circuit’s direction to present this evidence to the district court, and requesting the funding be restored.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Zeldin-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 19:00:37.911522

Many of their sports cars are in such high demand that they often sell for well above MSRP. If any company could build an EV sports car that enthusiasts want to own, it would be Porsche. However, that isn’t the case with Taycan sales down 22% last year.

Porsche is not alone in their struggle to find EV sports car buyers. Ferrari and Lamborghini are also delaying the launch of their EV sports cars. These are iconic manufacturers with millions of loyal fans all around the world. You would think that buyers would be beating down the dealership doors right now to get their hands on an EV sports car built by either Porsche, Ferrari, or Lamborghini.

EVs can be blindingly quick. The 1,234-horsepower Lucid Air Sapphire can hit 60 mph in less than two seconds, run the quarter mile in nine seconds, and has a top speed over 200 mph. Even the most jaded performance car enthusiast must admit those are staggering numbers. The lack of EV sports car demand can’t be chalked up solely to a lack of performance. In fact, it can’t be attributed to any one thing.

Lack of emotion and engagement

EVs are quick, but speed and power are not enough

EVs have the speed and power, but not the emotion that a combustion-powered sports car can offer. The engine noise and vibration, the ability to manually shift gears, and the sound of the exhaust. These are attributes that car enthusiasts hold near and dear. Without these sensations, many enthusiasts are simply not interested.

Let’s take the Dodge Charger Daytona as an example. In 2024, Dodge sold nearly 35,000 gasoline-powered Chargers. In 2025, they sold about 7,400 EV Chargers. That is a 79% decrease. Dodge fans showed little interest in the EV Daytona even though Dodge went to great lengths to make it as engaging as possible.

They went so far as to develop a Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust that mimics the sound of a traditional HEMI V8 engine, and it actually sounds pretty convincing. You know it is fake, but that isn’t the end of the world.

In The Matrix, there is a scene where Cypher is enjoying a delicious steak he knows isn’t real, but he doesn’t care because it tastes so good. The simulated exhaust sound is not a dealbreaker; neither is the nearly three-ton curb weight. The problem is that Dodge may have made the car a bit too good.

Dodge muscle cars have never been light, nimble, quiet, or point-and-shoot type of machines. They are the polar opposite of the sports cars created by Lotus. Dodge muscle car owners know the limitations; they know what they are signing up for. What matters to them is that the car is a bit unhinged. If you aren’t careful, it will spit you into the woods.

In the film The Fast and the Furious, Dom admits to never driving his dad’s 1970 Dodge Charger R/T because it scares him. That is what Dodge muscle is all about. It needs to be a bit bad to be good. The EV is big, heavy, quick, and sounds decent, but it doesn’t have that muscle car edge.

In a traditional Dodge muscle car, you slam your foot down on the gas, and all hell breaks loose. That is what Dodge fans want, and Dodge plays up to that. Their brand ambassador program is called “Badassador.” Yet on the Charger Daytona EV, there is a PowerShot mode and a Drift/Donut mode that might be a bit too techy and cutsie for traditional muscle car fans.

Different from the Chargers of the world, some sports car enthusiasts love the wind-in-the-hair sensation that can only come from a convertible. Mazda is a good example here, having sold over 1.2 million Miatas since 1989.

It is one of the most beloved sports cars of all time and the best-selling roadster ever. It is not the most powerful or the fastest. But it has one of the best manual transmissions ever, and the manual soft top is a cinch to use. The term Jinba-ittai was coined during the development of the Miata. It translates to “horse and rider as one.” That is the feeling you get behind the wheel of the Miata. There is currently no EV convertible on the market that provides this type of driver and car interaction.

Not modification-friendly

EVs don't offer as many options

The appeal of an EV is that it has fewer moving parts and is thus easier to maintain. But there is a flip side to that. People love to modify their vehicles. In 2024, the global car modification market was worth over $60 billion.

The options for modifying an EV are limited. Sure, you can wrap it, install new wheels, add a body kit, and change the suspension. But gasoline-powered cars offer far more options. Everything from simple air filters to LS-swaps are open to owners of gasoline-powered performance cars. Installing a new exhaust, headers, cams, and turbos are all part of the sports car experience. EV owners are largely shut out.

Go to any car show, from a local Cars and Coffee to a major Concours d’Elegance, and what do you see? Many cars with their hoods up. When you walk around these shows, you will hear people asking all the time something along the lines of “what does she got in there?” To which the owner is all too happy to explain that the engine started out as a Chevy 350 but now is a 383 stroker with a four-bolt main, forged con-rods and pistons, a hydraulic roller camshaft, and so on.

If an EV is at the same show with the hood up, you assume they are just getting their lunch out of the frunk. The EV might have a custom body kit and some cool aftermarket wheels, but you won’t be discussing battery packs and electric motors because nobody is modifying those.

High MSRP, repair costs, and range anxiety

A trio of bad news for car buyers

According to a AAA study in 2025, the interest in buying an EV fell to its lowest point since 2019. Only 16% of U.S. adults report being “very likely” or “likely” to purchase an EV as their next vehicle. Some of the most common reasons given for the lack of interest were high battery repair costs, range anxiety, and the perceived inconvenience of using an EV for a long trip.

No doubt respondents in the AAA study have been paying attention to the market, and they can see that EVs are expensive (and especially now that federal tax credits have expired). Beyond the purchase price, there is depreciation to consider. A study by iSeeCars showed that EVs lose the most value after purchase, falling almost 60% in five years.

Let’s use Porsche as an example. A combustion-powered Porsche 911 loses just 19.5% of its value after five years. That equates to an average loss of $24,428. The Porsche Taycan EV loses 60.1% of its value after five years. That equates to an average loss of $59,691. Losing an extra $35,000 in depreciation is a hit to the wallet that no sports car buyer wants to experience.

Enthusiasts will buy EV sports cars once they offer everything they want

Given all the above, the EV sports car must fundamentally change. They need to become less expensive and not depreciate as quickly. The infrastructure needs to change to make charging faster, easier, and more convenient. Solid-state batteries could go a long way towards making EVs more appealing to enthusiasts as well as the general car-buying public. They can increase range and decrease charging times.

Simulated gear shifts and engine sounds are a start in terms of driver enjoyment, but the tech to make an EV more engaging needs improvement. In addition to technological leaps, we need to see enthusiast models, such as convertibles, being built. Many traditional sports cars today are not always practical and efficient, and that is okay because they offer an overwhelming amount of fun. EVs need to raise their fun quotient. If/when that happens, enthusiasts will take notice and be willing to add an EV sports car to their garage.",https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/porsche-taycan_turbo_gt-2025-hd-c1472d941bed7881c1905b21b6afc33e9566942db.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-23 19:00:03.543463

U.S. Department of Transportation, a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful freeze of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program—a $5 billion federal initiative to build reliable, high-speed electric vehicle charging infrastructure along America’s highways.

The Court’s order represents a complete victory for plaintiffs, ensuring that States can move forward with building NEVI-funded charging infrastructure. The order permanently bars the U.S. Department of Transportation from withdrawing States’ funds, canceling implementation plans, or otherwise interfering with the program in violation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

The case was originally brought by 17 States, led by Washington, Colorado and California. The Sierra Club, together with NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Climate Solutions, Plug In America, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, West End Revitalization Association, and CleanAIRE NC, then joined the case as plaintiff-intervenors to represent the interests of their members harmed by the freeze, particularly to protect affordable charging access in the nearly three dozen States that did not join the litigation as plaintiffs.

The Sierra Club and NRDC are represented by in-house counsel. Climate Solutions is represented by Earthjustice, which also provided local counsel. Plug In America, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, West End Revitalization Association, and CleanAIRE NC are represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center.

The relief granted by the Court will protect NEVI funds across the country, allowing long-delayed charging projects to move forward and directly improving the lives of the public by making the charging network safer and more reliable, enabling longer-distance EV travel, expanding access to lower-cost EV driving, and reducing harmful air pollution in the communities where people live and work.

QUOTES FROM ORGANIZATIONS:

“We’re glad to see the Court put an end to the chaos and uncertainty created by the Trump administration’s unlawful actions,” said Sierra Club Senior Attorney Joe Halso, who presented oral argument on behalf of the plaintiff-intervenors at a hearing on January 13. “The administration illegally froze the NEVI program and halted critical EV charging projects for months, delaying and denying our members’ access to infrastructure Congress had already funded. Our goal all along has been simple: restore NEVI and ensure states can build the nationwide charging network Congress envisioned. Today’s decision delivers that result.”

“The NEVI program is an essential element in the national transition to electric vehicles. It creates a national network of high-speed highway charging from coast to coast,” said Joel Levin, Plug In America Executive Director. “We’re pleased that the Judge’s final decision creates some certainty at last and allows states to move forward and get their highway charging up and running.”

“Today’s decision means states can build the EV charging infrastructure America needs to clean our air and keep up with the rest of the world. We’re grateful the court put a stop to the reckless chaos fomented by the Trump administration when they tried to interfere with Congress’s power of the purse,” said Jan Hasselman, senior attorney with Earthjustice. “These NEVI funds are critical for building out a brighter future across the states.”

""Congress created this program for drivers everywhere, to give them access to a reliable, nationwide network of chargers. Today's decision is great news for the states relying on these funds, and the drivers who need access to these chargers,” said Tom Zimpleman, senior litigating counsel at NRDC.

“For people across the nation, this decision clears the way for long-delayed EV charging to finally be built,” said Megan Kimball, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “NEVI-funded stations will make long trips and everyday travel safer and more reliable —especially in places that have too often been passed over for infrastructure investment.”

“People want clean, fast and affordable ways to get around now. The Trump administration tried to bend to the fossil fuel industry but could not withhold long-promised federal funds for EV fast chargers,” said Meredith Connolly, Director of Strategy and Policy with Climate Solutions. “Up and down the West Coast, this decision means commuters, rural folks, and road trippers can now get reliable and fast EV charging every 50 miles. Thank you to our Attorneys General Brown and Rayfield and partners doing all they can to stop this road-block to building out the clean energy future we need.”

“The court’s decision is a victory for environmental justice,” said Ayo Wilson, Co-Director of the West End Revitalization Association. “It protects EV charging nationwide and affirms that communities—especially communities of color long overburdened by pollution—are not sacrifice zones for fossil fuel profits. We thank the court for ending this unlawful attack and standing up for the health of American communities.”

""Allowing NEVI to move forward strengthens the EV market in the Southeast—a critical manufacturing hub for electric vehicles—by supporting current EV drivers' charging needs and building consumer confidence for prospective buyers,"" said Stan Cross, Electric Transportation Director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. ""As a region manufacturing EVs for the nation, we need a reliable charging network that matches our production capacity. This is especially important now when many Southeastern families face affordability challenges. Access to reliable charging infrastructure removes a key barrier to EV ownership, and EVs offer a clear affordability solution—cheaper to operate and maintain than gas cars.""

“This ruling affirms that communities overburdened by transportation pollution deserve investment, not delay,” said Jeff Robbins, Executive Director of CleanAIRE NC. “NEVI-funded charging is critical for ensuring that the transition to clean transportation reaches underserved and historically left-behind communities across North Carolina.”

Facing a challenging federal landscape and an increasingly urgent climate crisis, Berkeley Law’s Center for Law, Energy & the Environment (CLEE) strengthened its capacity to deliver effective and equitable policy solutions by welcoming three highly-respected leaders — Dan Adler, Craig Segall, and Alexis Pelosi ’00 — as new affiliate advisers.

With deep expertise in areas spanning climate finance, electric vehicle policy, and equitable housing, they will help CLEE continue to turn research into action, ensuring that California’s pioneering work serves as an actionable model for states across the U.S.

Eager for efficiency

Pelosi is a land use law attorney with over two decades of experience in the private and public sector, including serving as a senior advisor for climate at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Biden Administration.

Providing consulting services and strategic advice to companies and nonprofits on climate resiliency and sustainability in the built environment, she has spent most of her career focused on infill development — working with developers and communities to build location-efficient housing that reduces vehicle trips and invests in urban centers.

“We can address our housing crisis and our climate crisis at the same time by focusing on how we build and where we build,” says Pelosi, noting that an estimated 30% of all emissions come from the built environment. “At a time when we may not be reducing emissions in other sectors, we have an opportunity in the built environment to lean in and show how, through energy efficient housing and retrofits, we can meet our climate goals.”

Highlighting California’s work on building efficiency, she is excited to help CLEE share those lessons nationally to help reduce building emissions.

Climate resilience is a key priority for Pelosi, whose post-wildfire work in Los Angeles underscores how extreme weather driven by climate change is devastating communities. “We lose one month of new housing construction every year to extreme weather,” she says. “It’s time to prioritize resilience, reduce risk, and invest in our communities before disaster strikes.”

Working across sectors, Pelosi is interested in how innovations in finance, insurance, and the built environment can reduce risk, strengthen municipal finance, and protect communities, businesses, and residents. CLEE, Pelosi says, is in a unique position to help tackle these challenges: “I’m happy to be here and think strategically about different ways to approach old problems, new problems and help build a more equitable and resilient future.”

Climate strategist

Adler, a Harvard Kennedy School of Government graduate, has served in executive positions at multiple climate and clean energy organizations. He previously spent four years working in state government as a senior advisor and deputy director in the field of climate finance.

“I found that CLEE was driving some of the most sophisticated and integrated thinking, taking the best of academia and think tanks but also making it really policy-relevant,” Adler says. “When I left the government, I wanted a chance to make a contribution in some of the detailed policy areas that needed support, and CLEE is a great place to do it. I love the team, so when the chance emerged to find a footing here, I was very keen to take it.”

Adler has been a leader in the climate strategy space, encouraging practical economic benefits on a statewide level to support clean energy, development, and environmental projects.

“I was working on infrastructure development strategies for climate solutions, including green banks,” he says. “A lot of that work involved partnering with nonprofits, and some were engaged with CLEE around how to build the transmission grid more cost effectively, how to drive for more equitable development in the electric vehicle space, and how to do more clean energy charging across the grid.”

Adler is now the executive director of U.S. Green Bank 50, developing a financial framework to support crucial climate initiatives at scale.

“There’s a lot of smart thinking out there around climate and there’s obviously an incredible amount of technology innovation going on. We need the connectivity, we need the translational research — and the policy- and market-actionable insights at a moment when folks can do stuff with it,” he stresses. “CLEE puts the ‘do’ in the think-and-do tank, and I’m excited to help support it.”

California connection

Segall, a Stanford Law graduate, has lent his expertise to leadership roles across multiple prominent climate organizations, including the California Air Resources Board and Evergreen Action, and was instrumental in shaping California’s statewide electric vehicle policy.

Working with CLEE Executive Director Louise Bedsworth on issues from geoengineering to governance to California state policy, he calls his new role at the center “a great chance to engage with a really effective policy center.”

“I’ve been appreciative that Louise and CLEE both think outside of just pollution regulations,” says Segall, also an advisor to the Federation of American Scientists and NYU Law’s State Energy & Environmental Impact Center. “It’s really important to think about the climate crisis as an actual problem of government capacity. Louise and the CLEE team are thinking a lot about supporting the next round of political leaders in California with new ideas, and I think that’s really important.”

Noting that California is the world’s fourth-largest economy but that its emissions are a very small percentage globally, Segall sees the main goal as making things better for Californians in ways that are self-sustaining.

“The future most people actually want is: your kids can afford school, your rent doesn’t rise every year, ideally you don’t have a gas stove in your house that’s giving your kid asthma, and you don’t need gas to drive because the bus comes on time. California has the chance to do this,” he says.

In the face of political tension, climate doomerism, and federal overhaul, Segall points out that globally emissions have continued to fall in major developed economies for years, with promising trends in heavy-hitter countries like India and China, and that 95% of new additions to the U.S. grid in the last three to four years have been wind, solar, or battery.

“There’s always ways to keep making things better, and a lot of the ideas to do that come out of universities. The great public research institutions have always been like the backbone of the state and the country’s economic growth and social mobility,” Segall says. “CLEE is a vehicle on the path to make the state work better for everyone and the right kind of institution to do it, because it’s rooted in this tradition of actually supporting the infrastructure.”

Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to repeal the “endangerment finding.” The endangerment finding—the agency's own ruling that ...,"January 23, 2025 – Documents released by environmental groups Thursday shed new light on the process the Trump administration used to create the report that supported the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to repeal the “endangerment finding.”

The endangerment finding—the agency’s own ruling that greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change and therefore endanger human health and the environment— has enabled the government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The ruling has direct implications on both emissions from, and the stability of, the food system.

When the EPA proposed getting rid of it in July, the agency relied heavily on a new report produced by a Climate Working Group consisting of five “independent scientists.” In a press release from the Department of Energy at the time, agency officials said the report found “U.S. policy actions are expected to have undetectably small direct impacts on the global climate and any effects will emerge only with long delays.”

Environmental groups sued the agencies, and the documents released yesterday came out of that lawsuit.

In a summary posted to their website, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) said the documents show the DOE emphasized the process should be secret, despite the law requiring federal advisory committee meetings to be public. They also said the records show that group members “recognized their objective was to ‘call into question’ the basis for EPA’s long-standing determination that greenhouse gas pollution endangers public health and welfare.”

Emails released by the EDF show group members discussing the fact that they barely examined human health or welfare impacts during the process. Internal reviewers at the DOE also identified many issues with the scientific rigor of the report, but their comments were mostly ignored.

“With court-mandated government disclosure of these records, it is clear that the Trump Administration unlawfully pursued a secretive effort to develop a fatally tainted report, abdicating its responsibility to protect public health and well-being,” Erin Murphy, EDF Senior Attorney and Director of Clean Air and Energy Markets, said in a statement.",,N,,2026-01-23 20:59:35.543636

The Energy Department said Thursday that its Loan Programs Office — now called the Office of Energy Dominance Financing — also plans to revise another $53 billion of funding.

In a statement, the department said it has eliminated about $9.5 billion in financing for wind and solar projects as part of the adjustment and plans to redirect the funding toward natural gas and nuclear projects.

The Energy Department, which didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, didn’t provide specific details on which other deals were affected.

The Energy Department’s loans office swelled into a $400 billion green bank under Biden, partly due to an infusion in funds from his signature Inflation Reduction Act. The office has been used to finance Tesla Inc.’s Model S sedan and some of the first new nuclear reactors built in the US in decades by Southern Co. But the program drew criticism from Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who said the department closed or offered $85 billion of financing in the final months of the Biden presidency after Donald Trump’s election.

“We found more dollars were rushed out the door of the Loan Programs Office in the final months of the Biden Administration than had been disbursed in over 15 years,” Wright said in Thursday’s statement.

While Trump once proposed killing the Energy Department program — arguing during his first term that the government had no business picking winners and losers — his administration later sought to tap the bank to pay for its own energy priorities.

Completed projects are already producing real-world results, creating jobs, delivering clean power, reducing costs, and protecting the environment.

The path forward is far from smooth. The sector is facing turbulence, including federal stop work orders, permitting delays, market uncertainty, political attacks, and widespread misinformation. These challenges put at risk the progress made so far and test the resilience of an industry essential to America’s clean energy future.

At the same time, this moment presents a crucial opportunity. How the offshore energy sector responds now will determine whether it can fully realize its potential as a driver of economic growth, energy security, and environmental progress. Strengthening supply chains in steel, shipbuilding, and manufacturing, reforming permitting processes, and building durable bipartisan support are critical steps. Ensuring that decisions are guided by data, science, and real-world results rather than politics and misinformation will determine the sector’s trajectory.

In New York, these stakes are especially clear. Offshore wind is essential to keeping the grid reliable, affordable, and resilient. Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind together would power over 1 million homes and meet 10 percent of the combined electricity demand of New York City and Long Island. Fully permitted 25-year contracts with fixed prices offer stability for energy bills and help reduce price volatility. According to a 2025 Aurora Energy Research analysis, once New York’s first three offshore wind projects are operational, they could save New Yorkers 77 million dollars during a single cold, high-cost month.

Halting these projects would threaten grid reliability, with the NYISO’s Short-Term Assessment of Reliability warning of Downstate deficiencies if Empire and Sunrise do not come online as planned. Beyond energy, these projects are already supporting 7,500 U.S. workers, including nearly 2 million New York union labor hours, and are projected to generate more than 2.5 billion dollars for New York’s economy by 2030.

The challenges and opportunities facing offshore energy will be explored in depth at the International Planning Forum (IPF) 2026, where NYLCV President Julie Tighe will join the panel “Playing the Long Game: Preparing for the Next Chapter of Offshore Energy.” This session will discuss how to navigate turbulence, strengthen supply chains, counter misinformation, and build durable support for offshore energy. Drawing on lessons from completed projects, the panel will highlight how offshore energy delivers real economic, environmental, and energy security benefits while preparing the industry for the next wave of development.

To date, BOEM and the U.S. Department of the Interior have refused to clarify or identify any project-specific national security threat posed by Vineyard Wind.
As a result of the arbitrary work stop order, Vineyard Wind has incurred losses of approximately $2.0 million per day in direct and indirect costs, including insurance, monthly interest, personnel expenses, and logistical setup.
The Vineyard Wind Project is also critical to meeting Massachusetts’s legal obligations to procure offshore wind energy, increase reliance on renewable energy sources, and reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions.
In May 2025, AG Campbell co-led a coalition of attorneys general in successfully suing the Trump Administration over its unlawful attempt to freeze the development of wind energy.","BOSTON — Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell today filed an amicus brief in support of Vineyard Wind in its lawsuit against the Trump Administration for attempting to halt construction on the nearly complete Vineyard Wind project, which is expected to provide power to more than 400,000 homes in the Commonwealth. In her brief, AG Campbell argues that the completion of the Vineyard Wind project is critical to meeting increased energy demand with affordable, reliable energy, protecting the state’s economy, and achieving Massachusetts’s clean energy goals. The brief encourages the Court to grant Vineyard Wind’s motion to temporarily block the federal government’s stop work order as the company’s case proceeds.

“Just weeks away from completion and already partially operational, the Vineyard Wind Project is a critical source of clean, reliable, and affordable energy for Massachusetts residents. The completion of this project is essential to ensuring our ability to lower costs, meet rising energy demand, advance our climate goals, and sustain thousands of good paying jobs,” said AG Campbell. “My office fully supports Vineyard Wind as it seeks to challenge the Trump Administration’s baseless and arbitrary directive–which is plainly aimed at undermining the growth of the clean energy sector and further jeopardize the health and wellbeing of our communities.”

On December 22, 2025, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued an Order suspending ongoing activities related to the Vineyard Wind 1 Project for at least 90 days. The Order was based on a directive from the U.S. Department of Defense requesting an assessment of the national security implications of offshore wind projects, alluding to an unspecified and vague harm. To date, BOEM and the U.S. Department of the Interior have refused to clarify or identify any project-specific national security threat posed by Vineyard Wind.

The Vineyard Wind Project, which began construction in 2021 and was scheduled for completion by March 31, 2026, was supposed to consist of 62 wind turbine generators with an 800-megawatt capacity, enough to supply power to approximately 400,000 homes. At the time the Order was issued, the project was 95 percent complete and partially operational, already capable of delivering 572 megawatts of power to the New England electric grid. As a result of the arbitrary work stop order, Vineyard Wind has incurred losses of approximately $2.0 million per day in direct and indirect costs, including insurance, monthly interest, personnel expenses, and logistical setup.

In her brief, AG Campbell argues that if the BOEM’s Order is not enjoined, Massachusetts and its residents would face serious economic harm, undermining the Commonwealth’s ability to plan for and secure lower-cost, reliable energy for ratepayers and jeopardizing the creation of good-paying jobs. In just the last week, Massachusetts ratepayers have lost over $2 million in benefits from the project as a result of the Order. If the Order is enjoined, the project will reduce electricity bills by approximately $252 per year.

The Vineyard Wind Project is also critical to meeting Massachusetts’s legal obligations to procure offshore wind energy, increase reliance on renewable energy sources, and reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions. Without the Project, Massachusetts would lose an important tool for protecting residents and the environment from the significant public health and environmental harms caused by pollution from fossil fuel energy sources.

This action is AG Campbell’s latest effort to protect the offshore wind industry from the federal government’s attacks. In May 2025, AG Campbell co-led a coalition of attorneys general in successfully suing the Trump Administration over its unlawful attempt to freeze the development of wind energy. Yesterday, Attorney General Campbell led a coalition of 20 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia in filing an amicus brief in defense of the states’ decades-long investments in large-scale wind and solar energy projects as a means of ensuring reliable, clean, and affordable electricity for their residents.

It also comes as Biden-era clean energy tax credits that spurred billions of dollars of public and private investment in clean energy projects were phased out by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans via the tax and spending law they passed this summer.
The institute has produced climate jobs plans for 10 other states, including Washington, Colorado, Texas and New York.","On the side of a rural highway in north central Oregon sandwiched between rolling hills of volcanic rock and high desert dotted with livestock, solar and wind farms, about two dozen members of Oregon construction, electrical and ironworkers unions came together to launch a new labor coalition.

Climate Jobs Oregon has been more than a year in the making, union leaders announced at a news conference Wednesday along state Route 19 amid a patchwork of clean energy projects south of Arlington and the Columbia River Gorge. Ten construction industry unions are represented in the coalition, including Oregon AFL-CIO, a statewide federation of unions covering more than 300,000 members in the construction, education, health care and manufacturing industries.

The coalition’s pitch is that in order to lower Oregonians’ utility bills and meet Oregon’s clean energy targets, including 100% clean electricity by 2040, the state needs hundreds of thousands of workers on clean energy projects, and the stability, wages and training that unions offer.

“To meet our climate goals, Oregon needs a massive increase in workers, and those workers must be trained to the highest caliber, and safety standards, where they have a meaningful voice on the job, where they have career pathways for advancement and they have wages, benefits and a retirement plan to support their families and get them into the economy long term,” said Graham Trainor, president of the Oregon AFL-CIO. “Let’s be crystal clear: Those are union jobs.”

It comes in the wake of two recent executive orders from Gov. Tina Kotek meant to accelerate the state’s transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels by making clean energy project siting and permitting easier to execute. It also comes as Biden-era clean energy tax credits that spurred billions of dollars of public and private investment in clean energy projects were phased out by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans via the tax and spending law they passed this summer.

Creating a coalition

Having experienced clean energy projects hitting federal headwinds under Trump’s first term, Trainor and other union leaders began working with Cornell University’s Climate Jobs Institute in 2023. The institute has produced climate jobs plans for 10 other states, including Washington, Colorado, Texas and New York.

Researchers at the institute spent more than a year studying Oregon’s policy, economic and labor environment, conducting interviews and collaborating with the unions to produce 18 climate jobs policy recommendations for the state and unions to advance.

Those include investing in union apprenticeship programs to provide the workforce training needed to more than triple the clean energy produced in the state and nearly double the energy storage and transmission capacity in the state by 2040. Doing so could create up to 200,000 direct jobs and 40,000 construction trades jobs in the next five years alone, said Reyna Cohen, a research and policy development associate at the Climate Jobs Institute who worked on the policy recommendations.

Others include getting the state to collaborate with labor unions on policies that would expedite site permitting for clean energy development, piloting a central energy project procurement system that would set site developers up with the labor they need and promoting union-built solar installations, energy storage and efficiency upgrades in public buildings and public housing.

Tiffany Wilkins, eastern Oregon representative of the Local 701 chapter of the International Union of Operating Engineers and a resident of Arlington, said every wind and solar project in Gilliam County has been built with union labor.

“You can turn around to all these windmills, the solar, and say ‘I helped build that. I was on that project. And my brothers and sisters here were on it with me.’ It’s the kind of opportunities we need more,” she said.

Ivan Maldonado, a member of the Local 737 chapter of the construction and general labor union Laborers’ International Union of North America, or LiUNA, began his career in construction on oil projects in Texas. Now he works as a foreman on solar projects.

“Joining a union and learning a trade changes lives,” Maldonado said. “I see it in younger workers everyday. Climate Jobs Oregon will help more people change their lives for the better.”

Trainor said the coalition hopes to get union labor on a higher number of clean energy projects to reach and exceed the proportion that typically works on fossil fuels projects. Although fossil fuels-powered energy industries don’t employ a huge proportion of union workers — roughly 9% on average across fuel types, according to a 2020 report by the National Association of State Energy Officials — it was still about double the proportion of union labor employed on solar and wind projects, according to the report.",https://corvallisadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC06421-2048x1361-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 17:59:20.261514

This storm also brings with it memories of Winter Storm Uri, which affected tens of millions of people and much of the U.S. energy industry in 2021. While the effects of Uri led numerous states to improve their energy infrastructure, Winter Storm Fern has BTU Analytics closely watching the elements below.

Power

For the past few weeks, the U.S. power sector has largely been dominated by moderate temperatures leading to moderate loads and pricing. However, over the past week, winter weather alerts have been issued by several grid operators across the path of the storm. This includes the three largest ISOs (PJM, MISO, and ERCOT), which together accounted for approximately 46% of U.S. Lower 48 load in 2025. While the grid is expected to operate adequately during winter weather alerts, freezing temperatures will drive up electricity demand and potentially cause an energy emergency if infrastructure, such as natural gas power plants, wind turbines, or transmission lines, is unable to operate or becomes damaged during the storm. We will pay close attention to ERCOT in particular throughout the weekend, as it is about to see one of its largest winter tests since Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, when blackouts were needed to avoid a complete grid shutdown. Currently, ERCOT is forecasting to have adequate reserves throughout the storm, but the ISO will likely face its biggest test at 8 am CST on Monday, January 26th, when forecasted load peaks at what would be a new winter record of 84.5 GW and forecasted reserve capacity will be at only 6.3 GW.

Production

Beginning today, the majority of natural gas production will begin to be exposed to freeze‑off risk, including production in Appalachia, the Eagle Ford, Permian, SCOOP/STACK, and Haynesville production regions. In all, this equates to over 90 Bcf/d of natural gas production, respectively, at risk.

While the greatest operational vulnerability remains in the southern basins, where infrastructure is generally not hardened for prolonged subzero exposure without operational interruptions, there is still a possibility that freeze-off risk could extend into the Northeast and affect production in the Marcellus and Utica. However, based on the current storm track, the likelihood of significant impacts in the Northeast remains uncertain.

Dry natural-gas production across the Lower 48 has averaged 108.9 Bcf/d so far in January. During Winter Storm Uri, U.S. production was impacted for 14 consecutive days and bottomed out just under 70 Bcf/d on February 16, roughly a 20% decline. If Winter Storm Fern has a similar impact on production, we could see as much as 15–25 Bcf/d come offline for several days.

LNG

U.S. LNG export volumes will face significant risks as Winter Storm Fern makes its way eastward. Freeze-offs due to extremely cold temperatures have the potential to interrupt natural gas production, while increased stress on pipeline infrastructure and potential power outages could further restrict feedgas deliveries to LNG facilities. LNG feedgas deliveries were reduced by 55% the week following Winter Storm Uri when compared to the January 2021 averages. As more LNG export capacity has been added along the Gulf Coast, with current feedgas deliveries averaging 19.5 Bcf/d month-to-date, LNG facilities could experience impacts similar to those seen during Uri. If this occurs, U.S. LNG feedgas volumes could drop by 9 Bcf/d, with daily volumes potentially falling even lower.

Pricing

Given the above risks, it remains uncertain how high prices could climb if this storm unfolds as expected. During Winter Storm Uri, natural gas spot prices for Henry Hub surged to a record high, over $20/MMBtu, when extreme cold weather led to significant supply disruptions. With Henry Hub spot prices now above $8/MMBtu, spot LNG volumes could be at risk if domestic gas prices reach double digits while global prices stay unchanged. If this happens, higher U.S. prices could temporarily diminish the economic incentive to export LNG.

Summary

With the potential for production freeze-offs and increased stress on natural gas pipeline infrastructure, BTU Analytics will be closely monitoring how the energy sector handles the extreme cold from Winter Storm Fern and the resulting impacts on pricing and downstream demand.

For example, New York’s EV sales rose 21.1 percent in the first three quarters, while Colorado posted a 30.1 percent increase.
On average, EVs make up 13 percent of new car sales in ZEV states.
EV sales also rose sharply in many non-ZEV states during the same period.
In ZEV states, there’s approximately one public charging point for every 880 people.","After years of leading the national shift toward electric vehicles, California may be approaching an inflection point. For the first time since the pandemic, EV sales in the state are expected to dip in 2025, even as several other states report a sharp rise in adoption.

Read: California Has A New Way To Make EV Owners Pay

Data from JATO Dynamics shows that during the first nine months of 2025, before the federal EV tax credit ended, roughly 302,000 electric vehicles were sold in California. That figure represents a 1.4 percent decrease compared to the same period last year, hinting that the state’s EV market could be nearing saturation.

We don’t have figures for the last quarter of the year, but given the elimination of the $7,500 federal tax credit on September 30, it’s safe to assume the final numbers will look worse, unless buyers suddenly developed a taste for paying more.

Despite this, California remains well ahead of the pack. EVs now account for 21 percent of new vehicle sales in the state, placing it above the District of Columbia (19 percent), Colorado (19 percent), Washington (17 percent), Nevada (16 percent), and Oregon (13 percent).

ZEV States Surge

Several of these ZEV states saw marked gains last year. For example, New York’s EV sales rose 21.1 percent in the first three quarters, while Colorado posted a 30.1 percent increase. On average, EVs make up 13 percent of new car sales in ZEV states. In contrast, non-ZEV states average just 6 percent, contributing to a national average of 8 percent.

EV sales also rose sharply in many non-ZEV states during the same period. Florida, in particular, recorded an impressive 33 percent jump between January and September 2025, reaching 109,000 units, which now represent 9 percent of new vehicle sales.

That jump in Florida is notable not only for its scale, but also because it comes without the backing of ZEV mandates or aggressive state-level incentives. In a politically conservative state where environmental policy isn’t front and center, the increase suggests that consumer demand, not legislation, is doing the heavy lifting.

Texas followed with a 16.7 percent rise to 77,000 units. Illinois saw a 36.2 percent increase, reaching 32,000. Georgia posted a 23.3 percent bump to 28,000, while Michigan led in growth rate, soaring 90.7 percent to 31,000 EVs sold.

“The rapid uptake in BEV sales in Michigan is a clear example of why growth in traditionally non-ZEV states presents such a valuable opportunity for domestic brands,” JATO analysis and reporting specialist Anthony Puhl said.

“While it is possible for a brand to break into a new market, as Tesla has done on a national level, we expect BEV sales in other states to come from brands with which the population is already familiar.”

One of the key hurdles for EV adoption in non-ZEV states remains charging infrastructure. In ZEV states, there’s approximately one public charging point for every 880 people. In non-ZEV states, that number jumps significantly to one for every 2,216 people, highlighting a critical gap in support systems for EV owners.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mercedes-Benz_launches_first_EV_charging_hub_in_North_America_Network_aims_to_deliver_a_fast_reliable_premium_charging_experience_for_drivers_of_all_EV_brands.-copy.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 17:58:59.915603

But this budget fails to advance the bold policies and investments New Yorkers desperately need for affordable clean energy and environmental protection.
Earthjustice is supportive of this concept; however, we urge the Governor and Legislature to detail the program in program text within the budget.
EmPower+ Program — Earthjustice urges the Governor and the Legislature to include at least $200M for EmPower+ in the SFY2027 budget.
We wield the power of law and the strength of partnership to protect people's health, to preserve magnificent places and wildlife, to advance clean energy, and to combat climate change.","—

This week, New York Governor Kathy Hochul released her SFY2027 Executive Budget proposal.

The following statement can be attributed to Liz Moran, New York policy advocate for Earthjustice:

“New Yorkers can’t afford business as usual anymore. Our state’s dependence on gas is driving energy costs higher and higher, but the Governor’s proposed budget falls short of what’s needed to tackle this challenge. The Governor acknowledges the need for affordable clean energy and meaningful environmental protections in the face of dangerous federal rollbacks and continues funding for important programs like Empower+ and the Environmental Protection Fund. But this budget fails to advance the bold policies and investments New Yorkers desperately need for affordable clean energy and environmental protection. We are prepared to work with the Governor and the legislature to ensure the 2026 session provides the leadership this moment calls for on energy affordability and environmental and public health protections.”

Here’s Earthjustice’s initial assessment of the SFY2027 Executive Budget:

Sustainable Future Program — Disappointingly, the Governor neglected to include an additional $1 billion towards the Sustainable Future Program, which provides key funding for energy affordability and climate measures. As the federal government cuts funding and basic clean air protections, and in the absence of regulations to implement New York’s climate law, maintaining this program to cut energy costs and invest in clean energy technologies is especially important. Earthjustice urges the Legislature to include at least $1 billion for this program in their respective one-house budgets.

Excelsior Power — The Governor’s proposal includes $33 million for a new program to incentivize grid flexibility through the adoption of smart thermostats and other technologies. According to the Governor’s State of the State Address, this program would give utility customers who opt to have smart meters installed credits of $25 per month; however, this program has not been detailed in any of the Governor’s budget bills. Earthjustice is supportive of this concept; however, we urge the Governor and Legislature to detail the program in program text within the budget.

EmPower+ Program — Earthjustice urges the Governor and the Legislature to include at least $200M for EmPower+ in the SFY2027 budget. As the Governor rightfully notes, EmPower+ is a critical, and oversubscribed, program that helps low and moderate-income households reduce their energy costs and make their homes more comfortable while cutting emissions. We are pleased to see the Governor propose an increase of $50 million in funding towards this program, but given the severity of the energy affordability crisis and the popularity of this program, far more is needed.

State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) reform for housing — Environmental review under State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) remains a critical tool to highlight and mitigate potential environmental harms from various projects. Earthjustice agrees SEQR should not hold up housing development in the circumstances set forward by the Governor, or the narrow set of beneficial infrastructure projects outlined like new parks and green stormwater management. But we must get the details right, and changes to SEQRA must remain narrow and protective. Earthjustice looks forward to working with the Governor and Legislature to strike the right balance.

Environmental Protection Fund (EPF) — Earthjustice applauds the Governor for her inclusion of $425 million for EPF, which provides critical funding to protect New York’s precious air, water, and land while creating thousands of good jobs and boosting our economy. We urge the legislature to support this funding in their respective one-house budgets, and note the particular importance of maintaining funding for the Climate Resilient Farming and Agricultural Non-Point Source Control programs.

Clean Water Infrastructure Act (CWIA) funding — We are pleased that funding was maintained for the CWIA however, despite the Governor’s messaging, the program did not receive any additional funding. The CWIA, which has been funded at $500 million annually for nearly a decade, provides funding for numerous essential and oversubscribed programs. It has been estimated that New York has over $80 billion in drinking and wastewater infrastructure needs alone, which doesn’t include the many other important programs that receive funding from the CWIA, like lead service line replacements and treatment technology for PFAS. The legislature should place as much as possible of the $250 million the Governor set aside for new water infrastructure into the CWIA.

EV Charging Sales Tax — We welcome the proposal to exempt commercial EV charging from sales tax, which will further enhance the overall financial benefits of EVs over combustion cars.

Solar in public schools — The Governor is right to identify the urgent need — and enormous untapped opportunity — of greening New York Public Schools. We support the Governor’s proposal to adjust the School Building Aid rules to include renewable energy projects. We encourage the Legislature to take this further by including $1 billion for the Sustainable Future Program and allocating, at a minimum, another $50 million for Green Schools funding.

Tackling Utility Costs — We applaud the Governor for taking steps to protect more tenants from utility shutoffs, and appreciate her acknowledgment that more must be done to protect consumers from skyrocketing utility bills and hold utilities accountable. As Earthjustice continues to evaluate these proposals, we encourage the Governor and Legislature to consider measures such as a Utility Intervenor and a Utility Intervenor Fund, a model that has been successful in other states that would enable ratepayers to have a voice in rate cases. Additionally, New York must do more to enforce its policy for the Energy Affordability Program and adopt policies to avoid unnecessary spending on costly fossil fuel infrastructure, which is the main driver of rate increases.

Data Centers — Though the Governor discussed the importance of making data centers pay their fair share for their astronomical energy and electric infrastructure demands to prevent other ratepayers from being saddled with higher costs, no policy was included in her budget proposal to tackle this. Earthjustice looks forward to working with the Legislature to pass legislation that addresses data centers before they become New York’s next energy affordability and environmental crisis.

Hatch, the project engineering partner, brings expertise in chemical processing facility design and rare earth separation technologies, providing technical validation for the processing approach.
Electric vehicle adoption rates, wind energy deployment, and defense modernisation programmes represent the primary demand drivers for heavy rare earth consumption.
Environmental Compliance Framework Heavy rare earth separation involves chemical processing with environmental oversight requirements for air emissions, water usage, and waste stream management.
According to Opportunity Louisiana, Aclara's investment will create the nation's first facility dedicated to heavy rare earth separation, marking a significant step towards domestic supply chain security.","The development of a heavy rare earths separation facility in Louisiana represents a pivotal moment in American industrial strategy, addressing decades of supply chain vulnerability in critical materials processing. Furthermore, this ambitious project promises to reshape domestic capabilities for producing dysprosium and terbium, elements essential for permanent magnet applications across defense, automotive, and renewable energy sectors. The establishment of this facility directly supports critical minerals energy security objectives whilst creating new opportunities for industrial ecosystem development.

The strategic significance extends beyond traditional economic development metrics, addressing systematic vulnerabilities that have emerged from concentrated overseas processing capabilities. Moreover, Louisiana's emergence as a processing hub leverages existing chemical infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to establish domestic production capacity for heavy rare earth elements.

How Will Louisiana's Heavy Rare Earth Facilities Transform U.S. Supply Chain Independence?

Domestic Processing Capacity Development

The establishment of processing infrastructure in Louisiana addresses a critical gap in domestic mineral security. Current U.S. consumption of dysprosium and terbium relies almost entirely on processed materials from overseas facilities, creating supply chain vulnerabilities that extend across defense, automotive, and renewable energy sectors.

The $277 million investment by Aclara Resources represents the largest single investment in heavy rare earth processing infrastructure in North America. Consequently, this facility is designed to process feedstock from Brazilian and Chilean ionic clay deposits, targeting production of high-purity dysprosium and terbium oxides essential for permanent magnet manufacturing.

Key capacity metrics include:

Target market capture of 75% of U.S. dysprosium and terbium supply

Processing capability for multiple HREE products beyond dysprosium and terbium

Feed material sourcing from established South American mining operations

Integration with existing Gulf Coast chemical processing infrastructure

These developments align with broader CRM facility insights that demonstrate the growing importance of regional processing capabilities in strategic materials supply chains.

Geopolitical Risk Mitigation Framework

The concentration of rare earth processing in Asia has created systematic supply chain risks that extend beyond typical commodity market volatility. However, historical export restrictions and trade policy changes have demonstrated the vulnerability of industries dependent on single-source suppliers for critical materials.

Louisiana's processing facilities address these risks through several strategic approaches. Supply source diversification involves feedstock sourcing from Brazilian and Chilean operations, which reduces dependency on single-country suppliers whilst leveraging established mining operations with proven ionic clay reserves.

Processing proximity through domestic separation facilities reduces transportation risks and provides greater supply chain visibility for downstream manufacturers in automotive and defense sectors. Additionally, strategic stockpiling capability enabled by domestic processing allows for the development of strategic reserves for critical applications.

Timeline and Implementation Strategy

The phased development approach reflects the complexity of establishing separation capabilities for heavy rare earth elements. Project completion is targeted for 2027, with feed material processing beginning in mid-2028.

This two-year operational preparation period accounts for commissioning and testing of separation equipment, quality certification processes for defense and automotive applications, supply chain optimisation between South American mining operations and Louisiana facilities, and workforce training for specialised chemical processing operations.

Hatch, the project engineering partner, brings expertise in chemical processing facility design and rare earth separation technologies, providing technical validation for the processing approach.

What Economic Impact Models Predict for Louisiana's Rare Earth Processing Hub?

Investment Capital Analysis and Multiplier Effects

The economic impact of heavy rare earth processing extends beyond direct capital investment through industrial ecosystem development.

The issue drew widespread attention in January 2024, when some Chicago-area Tesla owners found their EVs' batteries had died in subzero temperatures. Other EV owners have posted online about their vehicles' shorter ranges in winter.

Cold weather can slow an EV battery's chemical and physical reactions, reducing vehicle power. And unlike conventional cars with an internal combustion engine, an EV can't tap its motor's heat to warm the interior. Instead, EVs must tap their batteries to provide cabin heat, which can sap their range, according to Consumer Reports.

At 16 degrees Fahrenheit, EVs lose about 25% of their range when driving at about 70 mph, versus their range when driving at the same speed in mid-60-degree temperatures, Consumer Reports found in road testing.

EV owners could be tested this weekend as extreme cold temperatures spread across the U.S., along with freezing rain, snow and rain. Thermometers in the Minneapolis area plunged to 21 degrees below zero on Friday morning, with wind chills making it feel even colder.

Temperatures through the weekend are expected to sink to record lows across parts of the Southern Plains and Mid-Atlantic states.

Are newer EVs better at handling the cold?

Car manufacturers have made some changes that mean newer EVs perform better in cold temperatures, according to the Zero Emission Transportation Association, or ZETA, an industry trade group.

Newer EVs have heat pumps and better battery encasements that can help improve battery efficiency, ZETA noted. South Korean automaker Kia says that its new EV models include advanced heat pumps, which extract heat from the outside air, even in cold weather, and transfer it to the cabin, leaving the EV with more energy available for driving.

Other EVs with heat pumps include the Acura ZDX and Volvo EX40, according to a list published by electric-vehicle research firm Recurrent.

How do EV owners in cold-weather places cope?

Subzero weather isn't a deterrent for drivers in countries with cold climates — that includes Norway, where EVs accounted for 96% of all new car sales last year.

“CUB is disappointed to see ComEd come in with another bloated, expensive grid plan,” CUB Executive Director Sarah Moskowitz wrote in a statement.
Energy demand also grew in part due to increased electric vehicle demand as the state tries to reach its goal of one million registered electric vehicles by 2030.
In its filing, ComEd said it experienced higher demand primarily concentrated around 55 of its substations.","CHICAGO — Electric utility Commonwealth Edison has asked regulators to review a $15.3 billion, four-year grid plan that it says will help meet growing energy demand and protect infrastructure from severe weather events.

The filing is part of the state’s grid planning process laid out in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, a landmark decarbonization bill that passed in 2021. It details the technology and infrastructure investments ComEd hopes to make from 2028 to 2031 to promote grid reliability.

But the plan will not be without a cost to ratepayers, and the consumer advocates who successfully championed a reduction to ComEd’s initial plan in 2023 are already pushing back against this year’s filing. It will undergo an 11-month review by the state’s utility regulator, the Illinois Commerce Commission.

If the investments proposed are approved in full by the ICC, ComEd expects residential customers to see an increased average cost of between $2.50 to $3 per month starting in 2028.

This would be separate from delivery rate increases, including a $243 million rate increase approved by the ICC in December that raised bills for its customers by a little over $3 per month. ComEd delivers electricity to over 4 million customers in northern Illinois.

The company says the plan is intended to account for increased energy demand from electric vehicles, data centers and more people choosing to heat their homes with electric heat rather than natural gas. The plan is also meant to accommodate new interconnections for renewable energy sources as consumer demand for solar increases.

“I’ve been in this industry about 22, 23 years, and I’ve never seen the amount of change that we are experiencing right now,” said Melissa Washington, senior vice president of customer operations at ComEd. “Most of the pace of change that we’re seeing has come about in the last three years and it’s continued to grow.”

The plan also doesn’t prevent ComEd from filing a standard rate request in future years. Company officials say they expect to file a new rate request in January 2027 that, if approved, would go into effect in January 2028 — the same year as the grid plan investments are expected to start.

Regulatory framework

CEJA’s 2021 passage required the state’s major electric utilities to prepare grid plans that outline how they will integrate new renewable energy resources and meet decarbonization requirements while prioritizing affordability, especially for low-income communities.

ComEd filed its first four-year grid plan request in 2023, but the ICC sent it back after deciding the company had failed to meet the standards set under CEJA. The company refiled a slimmed down spending plan the following year, and the commission ultimately approved a version that reduced spending on system improvements by about 25%, according to the commission.

ComEd President and Chief Executive Officer Gil Quiniones said the company learned a lot from the process of filing and refiling its first grid plan.

“We’ve applied all of the learnings from those experiences to this one, and we are confident that we’re putting a plan that is in alignment with the statute but also in alignment with the expectations of the commission,” Quiniones said.

Utility watchdog and consumer advocacy groups, however, expect to fight for similar reductions to this proposed plan. While most agree that some investment is needed, they argue it is not necessary now and could be implemented over coming years instead.

The Citizens Utility Board, an independent utility watchdog created by the Illinois legislature, said its lawyers are reviewing the filing to identify and push back on any “wasteful, inefficient and unnecessary spending.” The latest filing is over 800 pages.

“CUB is disappointed to see ComEd come in with another bloated, expensive grid plan,” CUB Executive Director Sarah Moskowitz wrote in a statement. “Everyone supports a strong distribution system, but ComEd has a responsibility to maintain its grid in a way that benefits customers and doesn’t bankrupt them.”

CUB will have the opportunity to submit testimony to the ICC opposing the grid plan, as will the attorney general’s office, environmental advocates and other stakeholders.

Increased energy demand

ComEd says the planned investments will allow the company to respond to increased consumer demand for electricity caused by factors ranging from electrification of homes to data centers and artificial intelligence. Energy demand also grew in part due to increased electric vehicle demand as the state tries to reach its goal of one million registered electric vehicles by 2030.

Over a third of the planned spending would support system reliability, including preventative maintenance and replacement of aging equipment, according to the filing. The plan also outlines investments in grid management, customer operations, new business and facility relocation and information technology architecture.

The plan proposes installation of three new substations across Chicago and two elsewhere in northern Illinois, while also adding new capacity at more than 70 of its substations. Substations are a part of the electricity transmission and distribution system that are key to lowering voltage to safe and usable levels before it enters homes and businesses.

In its filing, ComEd said it experienced higher demand primarily concentrated around 55 of its substations. Data center energy needs accounted for over 47% of that new substation demand, according to the filing.

The ICC and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are currently reviewing separate proceedings filed by ComEd last year that would require high energy-use applicants like data centers to make a financial commitment to meet certain transmission service thresholds. The company says this is designed to ensure that the cost of upgrades made to accommodate electricity use by those users is not passed on to other customers.

The attorney general’s office filed objections to the FERC request, writing that the proposed agreements fail to adequately protect other customers.

Gov. JB Pritzker recently signed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act into law, setting new requirements for battery storage and so-called “virtual power plants.” Senior ComEd officials said the grid plan factored in some of those elements but acknowledged it might need adjustments as they learn more about the law.

Affordability

Affordability and cost efficiency are key requirements under CEJA.

To be considered affordable, electricity costs must not account for more than 3% of average household income, or 6% for those who heat their homes with electricity.

Under the plan, average residential customers would devote 1.41% of their household income to electricity in 2028, up from 1.23% in 2026. By the third year of the plan, it would grow to 1.48%, which the company says is still lower than the national average of around 3%. ComEd said the average bill for its customers is currently around $106 per month.

CEJA also requires that at least 40% of grid modernization and clean energy investments benefit communities that have historically faced exclusion from economic opportunities or have faced disproportionate environmental burdens from pollution. ComEd estimates that 1.7 million customers, or approximately 42% of its customer base, fall within that classification, according to the filing.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2026-01/240215-comed-aa1.jpeg?h=0caf38e4&itok=o3Uhkm0w,N,,2026-01-23 17:01:13.452428

To say that Hoosier author and environmentalist Gene Stratton-Porter was a prolific writer is an understatement. The author published a dozen best-selling novels, as well as several nonfiction nature studies, and books of poetry and children’s literature. But beyond all these works, she also wrote – frequently – in various national nature magazines, as well as many popular periodicals of the time. It is in many of these magazine columns where Gene strongly preaches to her readers the importance of wildlife conservation. She often read the Transcendentalists like Whitman, Emerson, Thoreau and Margaret Fuller. She was also moved by the efforts of environmentalists like John Muir and President Theodore Roosevelt.

During her heyday in the early 1920s, there were several scholars and literary critics who compared Gene Stratton-Porter’s powerful environmental messages to those of the former American President. Author and editor Grant Overton noted, “Each (Gene Stratton-Porter and Theodore Roosevelt) has swayed the millions. Each, beyond all possible question, has influenced human lives.” And the celebrated scholar and critic William Lyon Phelps stated, “I have no doubt that she has led millions of boys and girls into the study of natural objects…She is full of energy as Roosevelt, and as hearty an American. She is a public institution, like Yellowstone National Park.”

We will soon be featuring these various perspectives of Gene’s “scripture of nature” with a national PBS audience in the new WTIU documentary production: Gene Stratton-Porter: Music of the Wild, premiering in November 2026. In the show, we will share many of Stratton-Porter’s first-person observations in nature, along with additional views from her daughter Jeannette, and many other early environmental pioneers. Even in her works of fiction, the environment is as much a character as the humans she presents in her books. Her theory was that if a reader could understand and sympathize with various flora and fauna, then more and more people would come to closely identify with that “character” and thus be more compelled to observe it and preserve it.

In the documentary, we, of course, will be highlighting many of the colors and textures of the Limberlost Nature Preserve in the northeastern edge of the state, as well as the gardens of her second home in Rome City, Indiana. We will also be taking viewers to various state and national parks and other sacred spaces all over the U.S. Some of the areas in which Gene’s story is tied include the Great Elk Refuge near the Teton Mountain Range in Wyoming, Muir Woods and San Juan Capistrano in California, the Upper Mississippi River Basin in Minnesota, and even a trip to the Tongue Mountain range in New York’s Adirondacks, where an entire grove of white pine trees was dedicated to Gene Stratton-Porter for her environmental work.

The way that we can pay to document such important historical landscapes is through member support from viewers just like you. In PBS we like to say that “You’re the Public in Public Broadcasting.” Foundation support, corporate support and individual donors help us meet and exceed production goals. We also remain steadfastly committed to our audience and present more important documentaries that help celebrate Indiana’s rich history and share that story with a national PBS audience.

We will continue to share behind-the-scenes stories from the filmmaking process each month before the premiere of the film this November.

In 2025, Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LFP) prices in China crashed to $44/kWh due to massive overcapacity. Sodium-Ion, despite lacking the same scale, is hovering at $59/kWh.

LFP Cost (2025): $44-$52/kWh

Na-ion Cost (2025): ~$59/kWh

The Friction: Sodium is currently more expensive than the lithium incumbent it was meant to replace.

But cost is only half the story. Sodium-Ion represents a geopolitical hedge. By deploying Na-ion via brands like CATL's ""Naxtra,"" China has effectively destroyed the pricing power of lithium miners. If lithium prices spike, the world's largest manufacturer simply flips a switch to sodium.

The West is playing for performance... China is playing for control.

Subsidy Lifelines

For the survivors in the U.S., the business model is no longer about selling batteries-it is about harvesting tax credits.

Section 45X of the IRA has become the primary revenue driver for firms like Peak Energy and Lyten. The credit provides 10% of the production cost for ""electrode active materials."" Because the legal definition is chemistry-neutral, it doesn't matter if the cathode is made of expensive lithium or dirt-cheap Prussian Blue.

The Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules have created a ""supply chain wall."" Because China controls 80% of the lithium refining capacity, standard Li-ion batteries are increasingly ineligible for U.S. consumer tax credits.

This has created a desperate demand for ""FEOC-compliant"" alternatives.

Sion Power: Secured $75M in Series A funding led by LG Energy Solution.

The Logic: LG isn't buying a chemistry; they are buying a 50 Amp-hour large-format cell production line in Arizona that doesn't rely on Chinese precursors.

The Shift: Hiring former GM executive Pamela Fletcher as CEO signals that the ""science experiment"" phase is over.

You don't hire an automotive veteran to run a lab... you hire them to manage a supply chain.

A Solid-State Stalemate

If Sodium-Ion is the hammer, Solid-State is the ghost. Toyota, the undisputed leader in solid-state patents, has moved the goalposts again. Mass production, once promised for 2025, has been pushed to 2027 and beyond.

The technical friction remains the ""yield"" bottleneck.

Ceramic separators are brittle. In a laboratory, a 90% yield is a triumph. In a gigafactory, a 10% scrap rate is a financial death sentence. This is why companies like Solid Power (NASDAQ: SLDP) have pivoted to a capital-light licensing model. They are letting BMW and SK Innovation take the hit on the CAPEX-heavy manufacturing while they collect royalties on the sulfide electrolytes.

The market has bifurcated into two distinct spheres:

The China-Sphere: Focused on LFP and Na-ion, driven by TWh-scale manufacturing and low-cost exports.

The Western-Sphere: Focused on High-Nickel and Solid-State, propped up by Section 45X subsidies and trade barriers.

The ""PowerPoint Engineering"" era is dead. The ""Balance Sheet Engineering"" era is here.

The winners of 2026 are not the companies with the highest theoretical energy density... they are the ones with the smartest tax lawyers and the highest manufacturing yields.

Project supports large-scale restoration of domestic uranium enrichment capability

OAK RIDGE, Tenn. – Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, Deputy Gov. and Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Stuart C. McWhorter and Centrus Energy President and CEO Amir Vexler announced today that Centrus (NYSE: LEU) plans a major expansion in East Tennessee, transitioning its Oak Ridge facility to a high-rate manufacturing plant.

As part of the expansion, Centrus plans to create nearly 430 new jobs and invest more than $560 million in Anderson County over the next several years to support both the growth in workforce and investment in the production of thousands of advanced centrifuges.

Today’s announcement supports Centrus’ recently announced plans for a major expansion of its Ohio uranium enrichment plant, which will help the company meet America’s commercial and national security requirements. The first new centrifuges produced in Tennessee are expected to come online in Ohio in 2029.

Centrus’ Technology and Manufacturing Center in Oak Ridge is the only uranium enrichment centrifuge manufacturing facility in the U.S. The company recently was awarded funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to expand its uranium enrichment plant in Ohio with centrifuges produced in Tennessee.

Centrus is the eighth company to utilize funding from Tennessee’s Nuclear Energy Fund. The $50 million fund was in Gov. Lee’s recommended 2023-2024 budget and approved by the Tennessee General Assembly. An additional $10 million was allocated and approved in the state’s budget during both the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions, bringing the fund’s total to $70 million since its inception.

Michigan has a rare opportunity to lead, but only if it reorients its approach to economic development.

After a series of high-profile setbacks and missed opportunities, Michigan’s strategy is under scrutiny. Some argue the state should abandon incentives altogether; others, including the Mackinac Center, want to dismantle the Michigan Economic Development Corp. Those debates are understandable, but they miss the more important question: What is economic development actually for?

At its best, economic development turns a state’s underlying strengths into durable growth that creates jobs, expands opportunity and sustains local communities. Michigan has those strengths: world-class engineers, deep manufacturing expertise, strategic supply chains, and leading universities. What we’ve lacked is a repeatable way to translate those strengths into high-growth industries that attract sustained investment. That’s the North Star Michigan should focus on.

Michigan has been treating growth like a zero-sum game: We beat Ohio for this project, or Indiana beats us for that one. That mindset results in outsized spending on one-off deals, sometimes for companies that would have landed in the state anyway. Winning in the current environment of rapid innovation and global competition requires a shift from one-off wins to building a repeatable growth engine that compounds over time.

At Newlab, we call this Precision Attraction: an offensive approach to economic development that leverages a place’s strengths to target emerging sectors where it has a clear right to win. Precision Attraction is about building future industries — not buying individual projects — using a diversified toolkit to make strategic bets in growth sectors that have the potential to generate long-term value for the state.

Michigan is uniquely positioned to benefit from this approach. Its combination of engineering talent and manufacturing depth creates a rare environment where next-generation industrial technologies can be designed, tested, and scaled in the same place. That’s why Newlab chose Detroit as its second U.S. home.

Since opening in 2023, Newlab Detroit has attracted hundreds of startups by marketing Michigan’s advantages. But nearly every win has been hard-fought.

Competing states are investing aggressively with flexible, faster-moving capital, subsidized infrastructure, and execution support - and too often, they’re winning. North Carolina recently announced Vulcan Elements’ would build a $1 billion first-of-a-kind rare earth magnet facility in the state on the heels of entering into a $1.4 billion partnership with the United States Government. Fleet Zero, a developer of modular propulsion systems for hybrid and electric maritime vessels, recently announced it would be developing a new manufacturing and R&D headquarters in Houston after closing a $43M Series A round. Both of these companies had strong interest in Michigan, but couldn’t find a viable pathway to land here.

Gov. Whitmer has consistently used policy to stake a position in key sectors. Michigan established the Office of Future Mobility and Electrification to retain leadership as mobility evolved. More recently, she has implemented Executive Directives focused on driving statewide coordination in advanced aerial mobility and geologic hydrogen — two emerging sectors where Michigan has a clear edge.

These policy signals will cause industry leaders to look toward Michigan. They may even look to invest. But without execution capacity and competitive tools, Michigan won’t convert that interest into real outcomes. We should use the opportunity created by the governor’s initiative on these emerging sectors to prototype a new delivery model.

High-growth companies win or lose on time-to-market. To attract and retain them, Michigan must pair policy action with a repeatable playbook built for precision and speed — empowered cross-agency delivery teams and the tools companies need: deployable grants, shared testing and pilot infrastructure, plug-and-play industrial space, flexible growth capital, and customer networks. The playbook should also hardwire policy levers that cut risk and timelines: site readiness, fast-tracked permitting, and demand catalysts.

The next decade will determine where the most valuable industries are built, and who benefits. Done right, Precision Attraction will position the state to capture growth will benefit all Michiganders:

• High-growth companies will create high-wage jobs.

• A broader tax base will support roads and schools with less pressure on households.

• Growth sectors will expand supply chains and create career pathways that scale across regions and communities.

• When Michigan wins in growth sectors, talented people can build careers and lives here because the opportunities are as strong as the talent.

Michigan has the raw advantages to build the next generation of industries here. The question is whether we’ll adopt a new economic development approach with the tools and execution capacity to turn those strengths into sustained, broadly shared growth.

Dive Brief:

The Center for Biological Diversity and a coalition led by the Southern Environmental Law Center filed separate lawsuits this week to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from weakening standards that limit water pollution, including the release of mercury, selenium and arsenic, from coal-fired power plants.

The EPA issued a final rule in December extending compliance deadlines for effluent limitations as much as five years, until Dec, 31, 2034, giving coal-fired plants more time to assess potential pathways “to continue producing low-cost electricity into the future while meeting wastewater standards,” the agency said in the rule summary. The agency said extending the deadline is necessary “to affordably meet the nation’s growing electricity demand, including for data centers and manufacturing.”

“Arsenic and mercury from coal-fired power plants can be stopped by readily available water pollution controls, but this administration wants these dirty, outdated plants to keep dumping their toxic pollution into our rivers and lakes for years to come,” Nick Torrey, senior attorney at the SELC, said in a statement. “Our communities can’t afford more cancer-causing pollution in our waterways.”

Dive Insight:

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in September that the agency planned to give coal-fired plants compliance extensions for what he called “heavy-handed regulations” the Biden administration issued in 2024 to stop wastewater discharges from coal-fired power plants, including limitations on wastewater and coal ash that can contain selenium, mercury, arsenic and nickel.

The EPA in September also requested information on “technology-based implementation challenges” related to the 2024 rule that it will use “to support a future rulemaking to support practical, feasible, on-the-ground implementation of wastewater pollution discharge limits,” it stated.

The Center for Biological Diversity’s lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, seeks review of the EPA’s deadline extensions, which it published in the Federal Register on Dec. 31, 2025.

“Under the Clean Water Act, coal plants are supposed to be required to use the most modern and effective pollution control technology available before discharging toxic wastewater,” according to a Center for Biological Diversity press release. “The Trump action delays a 2024 Biden-era rule that would have brought nearly all power plants into full compliance with the Act no later than 2029 or required retirement of coal plants that could not meet the standards of the Act.”

The SELC’s lawsuit, filed in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on behalf of Appalachian Voices and the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League, will be part of a lottery process under the Clean Water Act to determine where all challenges to the EPA’s weakening of the rule will be heard, according to an SELC press release.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/JdK9U6DiFNv60E2hgAskDO3v1pdbu3b1g8hkcxTvEoQ/g:nowe:123:556/c:2272:1515/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9LaW5nc3Rvbl9jb2FsX2FzaF9zcGlsbC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-23 17:00:21.098766

“These baseless lawsuits are a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America’s economy, and is actively reducing emissions.","Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, and the American Petroleum Institute on Friday.

The lawsuit alleges the companies violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, and the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act, saying the defendants acted as a cartel in an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade to forestall meaningful competition from renewable energy in order to maintain their dominance in the transportation energy market and primary energy markets.

This, according to Nessel, was done in order to reap windfall and illegal profits, causing Michigan residents to suffer artificially high home and transportation energy costs.

Nessel's lawsuit details what she called coordinated efforts by defendants and other co-conspirators to:

abandon renewable energy products

use patent manipulation and litigation to hinder market competitors

suppress information concerning the once-hidden costs of fossil fuels and the viability of alternatives

infiltrate and knowingly mislead information-producing institutions

surveil and intimidate watchdogs and public officials

use trade associations to coordinate market-wide efforts to divert capital expenditures away from renewable energy

According to Nessel, the defendants have reduced the production of renewable energy for transportation and home heating and cooling, and needlessly reduced choices and inflated energy prices for Michiganders.

Shell did not respond with a comment, while representatives from two defendants slammed the lawsuit as baseless.

“This lawsuit is baseless as demonstrated by multiple related court dismissals. Federal and state courts have dismissed lawsuits seeking climate-related damages in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, and South Carolina.

Meanwhile, three national forests in eastern Oregon’s Blue Mountains (the Malheur, Umatilla, and Wallowa-Whitman) are undergoing their own plan revisions.
For example, rather than having an office in Portland to oversee Washington and Oregon’s 17 national forests, the Trump administration is proposing to consolidate research and management staff in Colorado.
For much of our history, Oregon Wild has focused on efforts to add lasting protections for wild places, rivers, and wildlife.
Using the Wild & Scenic Rivers Act, we’ve helped secure protections for wild river corridors along 2,400 miles winding across the state.","Recognized as a State Scenic Waterway and, in places, a federal Wild & Scenic River, the Nestucca River flows through Bureau of Land Management lands and the Siuslaw National Forest as it cuts through the Coast Range and makes its way to the ocean. Its waters are home to steelhead, cutthroat trout, chum, Coho, and Chinook salmon, Pacific lamprey, and other native fish.

Rising above it is Mount Hebo, one of the largest remaining intact forest areas in the Coast Range – nearly 14,000 acres are designated as a roadless area. Headwater streams that feed the Nestucca originate on the mountain’s north side. Trails through the area have been used by Indigenous people as well as settlers for thousands of years, connecting the northern Coast Range and the Willamette Valley.

Many of the forests in this part of the Coast Range have recovered naturally from large fires in the early 20th century, but remnant mature and old-growth forests remain around Mount Hebo, providing important habitat for threatened northern spotted owls and marbled murrelets, rare red tree voles, and elusive amphibians. The summit of Mount Hebo is also home to the largest population of threatened silverspot butterflies in Oregon – for whom Oregon Wild worked to secure federal protection.

The Oregon dunes stretch across the central coast of Oregon, forming a dynamic landscape that depends on shifting sand to sustain its native ecology. In 1972, Congress designated this 31,500-acre section of the Siuslaw National Forest as a National Recreation Area in recognition of its unique ecological and recreational value. Four blocks of the dunes area totaling 26,000 acres are also designated as roadless areas protected by the Roadless Area Conservation Rule.

As one of the world’s largest temperate coastal dune systems, it attracts thousands of visitors each year for camping, hiking, paddling, and off-road vehicle riding; and it provides habitat for a variety of plants and animals—some found in few other places. This native ecosystem is threatened today due to introduced beach grass that has stabilized and changed the dunes, leading to the decline of some native species.

Restoration of the Oregon dunes has been a priority for the Forest Service for several years, and Oregon Wild has worked to support these efforts as well as seeking protection from development strains. Several streams that flow lazily through the dunes, like Takenitch Creek and Tenmile Creek, are proposed as Wild & Scenic Rivers under the River Democracy Act.

The tallest trees on Earth, coast redwoods are the ultimate ancient trees, sometimes living more than two thousand years. Most people think of the towering coastal redwood forests of California, but these mighty trees also sneak into Oregon at the northern limit of their range, within the coastal fog zone in the lower Chetco River and Winchuck River watersheds.

Oregon’s redwoods faced near extinction from logging in the 1970s and 1980s, but thanks to Wendell Wood and other forest advocates who drew attention to the plight of Oregon’s redwoods at that time, additional logging plans were dropped. Today, a mere 1300 acres of small groves are scattered on the western edge of the Siskiyou National Forest, on some BLM lands, and in the Alfred A. Loeb State Park. Some can be found in designated roadless areas that surround Emily Creek and the Winchuck River. Some short trails along the Chetco River and on Peavine Ridge help visitors access Oregon’s redwoods. The Northwest Forest Plan’s designations for threatened species habitat protect most of these forests today, but perhaps not for long.

The landscape that surrounds Rough & Ready Creek in southwest Oregon is part of a complex of intact roadless appendages that wrap around the existing Kalmiopsis Wilderness, making this expanse of wild lands the state’s largest. A tributary to the Wild & Scenic Illinois River (and proposed for such designation itself), Rough & Ready Creek runs wild and clear through a unique and ancient geologic wonderland of serpentine soils, rare and endemic plants, and rugged ridges. Native chinook salmon, steelhead and cutthroat trout that have adapted to the naturally high summer water temperatures in this watershed thrive here, and rare yellow-legged frogs flourish in this pristine habitat.

Despite its unique and outstanding botanical diversity, geology, water quality, and wildlife values, the streams in this roadless area are threatened by exploitative nickel mining. Efforts to protect this area from such threats are ongoing on multiple fronts. Currently, the temporary 20-year Southwest Oregon Mineral Withdrawal prevents new mining claims in the Rough and Ready Creek watershed, but existing federal mining claims within the withdrawal area could be mined if found to be “valid.” RNR Resources continues to hold active mining claims in the Rough and Ready Creek area, in what has become Oregon’s longest-running struggle between the protection of beloved public lands and the proponents of the antiquated 1872 Mining Law.

Lost Lake’s resort and campgrounds on the north side of Mount Hood are a favorite destination for families and others seeking tranquil waters for nonmotorized boating, classic views, and pure mountain air. Hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail get a great view of the lake and Lost Lake Butte from the forested ridge to the west, which divides the Hood River drainage from the Bull Run watershed just to the west—the source of Portland’s drinking water.

However, as the drive to the lake reveals, private land in the area is managed exclusively for timber production through clearcutting. The unlogged public forest lands around Lost Lake are vital for species that require intact forests, and for nearby communities that depend on clean water and the economic benefits of recreation.

Development at Lost Lake is currently limited to the existing footprint due to restrictions under the Roadless Rule and on logging old forests under the Northwest Forest Plan. This helps ensure that the old-growth forests that surround the lake and offer such spectacular views and recreation remain standing.

The McKenzie River is one of the most iconic in the state for recreation, scenery, and water quality. The Mckenzie River provides clean drinking water to Eugene and other local communities, and its headwater streams and crystal clear water springs are buffered from annual precipitation and temperature fluctuations so they are a reliable source of plentiful cold water. These streams are surrounded by mature and old-growth forests, along with some previously logged plantations, home to native wildlife, including threatened northern spotted owls. They are designated critical habitat for ESA-listed bulltrout, a fish that relies on especially cold water, as well as spring Chinook salmon. Several of the McKenzie’s headwater tributaries are proposed for additional Wild & Scenic River protections under the River Democracy Act, which will enhance the river’s important values and expand benefits for fish, ancient forests, historical and cultural areas, and floodplain and other habitat restoration.

Despite its importance, the McKenzie River watershed has had more than its fair share of aggressive logging. Clearcuts on the Willamette National Forest here began in the mid-19th century, fragmenting much of the expansive ancient forest. The Northwest Forest Plan helped curb this abuse, but today, many forests in the McKenzie River watershed remain open to logging. The planned Flat Country Project would have logged native, mature forests in the vicinity of these headwater areas, degrading habitat for threatened northern spotted owls and other species, and putting at risk the water quality that make these streams so special. While important for fish and wildlife habitat and water quality, many of these tributary streams are not protected from logging outside the core riparian buffer.

The Newberry Volcanic National Monument was designated in 1990 and includes over 54,000 acres of the still-active shield volcano and its past lava flows. The Newberry Caldera (or Crater) section rises above the surrounding valley, and Paulina and East Lakes fill in a few of the craters at the top of the monument. Paulina Peak rises to nearly 8,000 feet high on the old caldera’s rim. In the surrounding national forest, you’ll find obsidian lava flows, pumice flats, and ancient forests and rare vegetation that thrive in the harsh environment.

Recreation is front and center at Newberry Crater, with a small resort, campgrounds, hiking trails, waterfalls, and motorized and non-motorized winter sports. Because of the shallow magma chamber sitting before this still-active volcano, geothermal activity can be found through natural vents and warm springs.

This geothermal activity is also interesting to energy development companies who have long sought access to this heat source. The National Monument’s management plan and protections under the Roadless Area Conservation Rule currently prevent damaging infrastructure development to facilitate energy production, and help maintain the unique scenic, geologic, and ecosystem values in this area.

The forests of the Ochoco National Forest have been heavily impacted by human management—from the obvious effects of logging to the less obvious results of livestock grazing and suppression of natural fire cycles. Logging here included “high-grading,” which removed the biggest, oldest trees across the landscape, leaving true ancient forests with all of their components as a rare feature in Central Oregon.

Lookout Mountain lies at the heart of a vast wild landscape of ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests, grasslands and meadows, and streams that is ideal for all forms of backcountry recreation. Conservationists have long sought to codify the protections for the designated roadless area and add other protections, including designating Brush Creek and Canyon Creek as Wild & Scenic Rivers under the River Democracy Act.

At a combined 45,000 acres, the rugged, remote roadless areas in the northeast corner of Oregon are rich in water, wildlife, and cultural values. The streams that flow into and form Joseph Canyon and the nearby Wildhorse Roadless area are vital headwaters of the world-famous Grande Ronde River, recognized by their inclusion in Senator Wyden’s River Democracy Act. A connector between the Rocky Mountains and Cascades, scientists have identified the area as a wildlife connectivity corridor of global importance – home to elk, bear, bighorn sheep, grey wolves, deer, and even moose. The area is also being considered as a reintroduction site for California Condor by the Nez Perce Tribe.

The area has significant cultural and religious value to the Nez Perce Tribe. It is the birthplace of Chief Joseph, dense with archeological sites, hunting, fishing, and gathering grounds, and is adjacent to the tribally managed Precious Lands.

Unfortunately, even the remote backcountry is constantly threatened with proposals for logging, livestock, mining, and road-building in this area.

From “Unleashing American Energy” (Executive Order 14154) to “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production” (Executive Order 14225) President Trump wasted no time in issuing executive orders (EOs) to dramatically expand mining, oil & gas extraction, and logging across federal public lands in his second term. Both orders direct federal agencies to dismantle regulations and policies that protect the environment and public interest in favor of a dramatic expansion of timber harvest and oil, gas, and nuclear energy production from public lands. These changes are to the benefit of wealthy corporate interests and at the expense of public involvement.

A follow up memo in April from Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins (Memorandum 1078-006 entitled “Increasing Timber Production and Designating an Emergency Situation on National Forest System Lands.”) directs the Forest Service to use emergency declarations under the guise of wildfire and insect control to cut corners when it comes to following environmental laws and doing environmental impact assessments when planning and implementing logging projects.

By fabricating these emergencies, the Trump administration is laying dangerous groundwork to further bypass critical environmental laws and long-standing public safeguards. Coupled with legislation, rollbacks of environmental laws and policies, and cutting out public input, these orders could have devastating effects as they take effect.

The threats to public lands are not limited to Trump’s direct orders. Members of Congress have also been trying to reduce public oversight and even, at one point last year, to sell off public lands altogether.

The public lands sale provisions, led by Utah Senator Mike Lee, were initially included in the “Big Beautiful Bill”, but failed thanks to a huge public backlash. Other provisions in the final budget bill, enacted in July 2025, advance Trump’s agenda, including increasing timber production by a minimum of 250 million board feet over previous years’ sale volume for the Forest Service and 20 million for Bureau of Land Management. This arbitrary increase in logging will occur regardless of the impacts it could cause, be it worsening wildfires due to clearcutting or reducing our federal forests’ climate and clean water benefits.

Other legislative efforts attempting to diminish public involvement and expedite public land exploitation are also advancing in Congress.

The so-called Fix Our Forests Act (S. 1462), for example, would severely limit citizens’ ability to comment on and influence how public lands are managed. It would also reduce the amount of environmental review for logging projects up to 15 square miles in size by expanding the use of categorical exclusions. These exclusions were originally intended for small or emergency purposes but are increasingly used to avoid public scrutiny on commercial projects.

Despite claims that the bill addresses wildfire, its main purpose is to increase logging. It provides no safeguards for old-growth forests or clean water and weakens the Endangered Species Act, making it arguably the most damaging logging bill since the 1995 “Salvage Rider.”

Other dangerous bills continue to be introduced as well.

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has long been a scapegoat for industry claims that considering environmental impacts and public input hold up logging, mining, drilling, and other development projects. Under Trump, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior have both been directed to strip important NEPA provisions applied to our public lands. Rule changes implemented in July limit public involvement and agency transparency when developing projects.

For example, these changes allow for declaration of an emergency to allow projects to move forward before NEPA’s required environmental analysis is completed.

Through a series of Executive Orders and direction to federal agencies, the Trump administration is also laying waste to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). These actions first resulted in changing the definition of “harm” to species to exclude habitat modification. This change makes it easier for activities such as logging and mining to destroy the places where fish and wildlife feed, shelter, and reproduce. It also continues the long-term trend of shifting responsibility for protecting species from the federal government to the states, which often have fewer resources and, in some cases, open hostility to conserving native species.

An additional rule change proposal would eliminate the US Fish and Wildlife Service’s long-standing “blanket rule” which extends protections to newly listed species while more concrete habitat protection and recovery plans are being developed. And new requirements for officials to consider economic impacts of protecting critical habitat would increase industry influence and reduce the role of science in agency decisions.

The result of these changes is that species already on the brink of extinction will be subject to even more activities that push them closer to the edge and make it harder to reverse that trajectory.

Forest management plans help guide decisions around where logging and other activities can take place in national forests, including delineating sensitive habitats, buffers for streams, and areas of old growth. In western Oregon, the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) overlays seven national forests and is one of the most comprehensive wildlife and habitat conservation plans in the U.S. It was created due to the urgent need to protect our remaining old-growth forests and recover a landscape devastated by widespread ancient forest clearcuts.

An amendment proposal for the NWFP that began under the Biden administration in 2024 would have allowed increased logging of mature forests and freeze progress toward recruiting future old growth. Under the Trump administration, even these rollbacks are not considered sufficient. At the behest of the logging industry, officials have announced that they will reopen the proposal for further weakening, with a draft release date in the fall of 2026.

Meanwhile, three national forests in eastern Oregon’s Blue Mountains (the Malheur, Umatilla, and Wallowa-Whitman) are undergoing their own plan revisions. Unfortunately, the Forest Service has spent the last six years working with an exclusive group of interests primarily aligned with extractive industries. All signs point to another proposal to weaken existing environmental protections or make them unenforceable. Previous proposals have downplayed the conservation opportunities that scientists say are necessary to achieve climate and biodiversity goals and a just transition to more sustainable economies that are better for local communities and the environment. It also seems likely that the long-standing “eastside screens” that protect large-diameter trees throughout eastern Oregon will be discarded in the new forest management plans, opening up the most carbon-rich and fire-resilient forests to increased logging.

In eastern Oregon, decades of reckless and nearly unconstrained old-growth logging left the region with a deficit of large and old-trees. That trend was slowly reversing under the Eastside Screens, a policy put in place in the early 1990s in an effort to protect the largest trees left on the landscape in eastern Oregon and Washington. This policy prohibited the logging of trees over 21” in diameter. A rushed effort by the first Trump administration to revoke these protections was ultimately found to be illegal, and the protections remained in place after the 2024 court ruling. However, the Trump administration is now looking to reinitiate the effort to remove protections for large trees.

Reducing the federal workforce and restructuring federal agencies has been another priority of the Trump administration through his Department of Government Efficiency and other policies. Many career biologists and public lands managers were forced to take early retirement, others were flat-out fired. This purge has led to a loss of capacity to provide expertise and oversight on our public lands. The US Department of Agriculture has reportedly lost around 20,000 from its workforce. Of those, the Forest Service lost the most employees: 5,860, about 16 percent of its total workforce. The Fish and Wildlife Service, under the Department of the Interior, has also experienced a 20 percent reduction in its workforce, with a significant number of those employees being biologists.

This loss of institutional knowledge, expertise in science and research, and skilled project managers familiar with the landscape and laws and policies that protect sensitive areas and wildlife is just the most obvious consequence of the cuts.

Federal funding cuts for restoration and conservation projects also mean that efforts to aid salmon recovery and reduce fuels through prescribed fire are being sidelined.

Proposed reorganization and relocation of Forest Service and BLM offices also means a loss of public accessibility and local knowledge. The proposal would consolidate nine regional offices into five, and all research stations into just one location. For example, rather than having an office in Portland to oversee Washington and Oregon’s 17 national forests, the Trump administration is proposing to consolidate research and management staff in Colorado.

While Senator Lee’s public lands sale proposal was defeated last year, some politicians are still attempting to advance public land disposals. Even when proposals don’t appear to sell public lands outright, the ultimate purpose is to turn over management authority to bypass public transparency and accountability. For example, Curry County in southwest Oregon introduced a resolution in 2025 – blatantly tied to President Trump’s executive order on logging – with a bid to “lease” 80,000 acres of federal public land in the county for the purpose of producing timber and funds for the county.

A bill heard by the Oregon State legislature in 2025, and championed by Representative Vikki Breese-Iverson, would have leased the entire Ochoco National Forest to the Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF). If enacted and approved by the federal government, the lease would double the number of acres managed by ODF, which manages to a significantly lower environmental and public process standard than the Forest Service, even under the Trump administration. The bill’s sponsors were uninterested in the fact that ODF is underfunded and ill-equipped for the demands of managing such a vast, multi-use forest, or the complicated legal implications the lease would bring; they merely wanted more logging.

Creating a workforce crisis at the federal level by cutting agency staff and resources plays into another means towards privatizing the management of public land. Authorities that allow for outsourcing analysis, implementation, and oversight of public land projects like logging, such as the Good Neighbor Authority, have been championed by industry interests for years. The Trump administration’s direction to prioritize such authorities, coupled with cuts to federal resources, all but guarantees that the mandated increases in timber output will be met by private contractors or more local agencies like the Oregon Department of Forestry.

For much of our history, Oregon Wild has focused on efforts to add lasting protections for wild places, rivers, and wildlife. Using the Wilderness Act, we’ve permanently protected more than 2 million acres of Oregon’s most iconic wild landscapes – from Mt. Hood to the Eagle Cap to Diamond Peak. Using the Wild & Scenic Rivers Act, we’ve helped secure protections for wild river corridors along 2,400 miles winding across the state. And procedural rules like the long-standing Roadless Rule seemed to offer the durable protections important to keep more than 2 million acres of wild lands safe from development.

Under the Trump administration, even our most protected areas aren’t safe.

Take the old-growth forests that line the Wild & Scenic Salmon River as it tumbles out of the Salmon-Huckleberry Wilderness in the Mt. Hood National Forest. While commercial logging goes directly and overtly against the purposes for which these lands were granted Wilderness protections by Congress, the Trump administration’s maps released to support Executive Orders on increased logging, target several Wilderness areas, including pieces of the Salmon-Huckleberry. The towering giants along the Salmon River Trail and the Wild & Scenic River could even be felled. This ancient forest is currently protected under the Roadless Rule and as a Late Successional Reserve under the Northwest Forest Plan, but with proposed rollbacks to these protections, this forest isn’t safe.

Even the Bull Run, Portland’s drinking watershed and long protected from human incursion in order to avoid contamination, is targeted by Trump’s orders. Logging was specifically identified as a threat to the watershed in the past, prompting action from the Portland city council and federal protections. But Trump’s logging maps, if allowed to proceed, could reintroduce this threat to the watershed and put clean drinking water at risk.",https://oregonwild.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cropped-site-icon-661810671497d-32x32.webp,N,,2026-01-23 19:00:41.843178

The company accounted for 9.9% of all vehicles registered in the state last year, down from 11.6% in 2024, according to Experian data published by the California New Car Dealers Association. The drop was more than three times that of Stellantis NV’s Dodge brand, leaving Tesla as the No. 3 auto brand in the state in 2025, after trailing only Toyota Motor Corp.’s namesake unit the prior year.

The downturn echoes Tesla’s struggles in other markets around the world. The company’s aging lineup and its slow-selling Cybertruck faces growing competition from fresher EVs offered by mainstream carmakers, while the loss of federal tax credits for US EV purchasers has put more pressure on demand that was already faltering. Tesla has also contended with a consumer backlash to Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s political activities.

Tesla registrations in California fell below 180,000 vehicles last year, down from nearly 203,000 in 2024. The decline was enough to put the state’s overall EV market into retreat, with total zero-emission vehicle registrations falling by about 7,300 cars to a little more than 378,000.

Still, Tesla’s most-popular models remained among the state’s top-selling vehicles. The Model Y SUV remained the best-selling EV in the state and was the No. 1 light truck of any type. Tesla’s Model 3 sedan was the state’s second-best selling passenger car, trailing the Toyota Camry.

When it comes to state politics, 2026 is already in full swing. As legislators reconvene and new governors are sworn in, it’s becoming clear that leaders will focus on one energy issue in particular this year: affordability.

While last year’s elections didn’t bring any major changes to the White House or Congress, skyrocketing energy prices played an undeniable role in propelling Democrats to victory in state elections across the country.

Take a look at New Jersey, where Democratic Gov. Mikie Sherrill was sworn in this week after campaigning on a promise to lower power prices while building out clean energy. She took her first steps in that direction on Tuesday, signing executive orders to accelerate solar and storage development, consider freezing electricity rate hikes, and expand utility bill credits for customers.

Those credits will be funded in part by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, an East Coast carbon market that saw good news with the inauguration of Virginia Democratic Gov. Abigail Spanberger this past weekend. Spanberger is already moving to rejoin RGGI, with an assist from the state’s Democratic-controlled legislature, after the previous Republican governor pulled Virginia out of the program back in 2023. On her first day in office, Spanberger also directed state agencies to find ways to curb energy and other household costs.

Affordability is sure to continue to dominate politics this year in Virginia, also known as the data center capital of the world, clean energy advocates recently told Canary Media’s Elizabeth Ouzts.

“Oftentimes, I go into a legislative session sort of just guessing what people are going to care about,” said Kendl Kobbervig of Clean Virginia. Not this year.​“No. 1 is affordability, and second is data center reform.”

Massachusetts’ legislature shares that priority, reports Canary Media’s Sarah Shemkus. But even though the statehouse remains firmly in Democratic hands, lawmakers aren’t aligned on how to curb costs in the long term. Some are targeting volatile natural gas prices and the cost of replacing aging pipelines, others say clean energy and transmission construction are to blame, and still others are homing in on utility profit margins.

The reality is that the energy affordability crisis isn’t a problem with just electricity prices or natural gas prices; both are rising at rates higher than inflation across the country. And so it’s going to take strong, and perhaps creative, solutions to keep them in check.

More big energy stories

Trump’s year of energy upheaval

It’s been a year since President Donald Trump took office for the second time, and there’s been no shortage of energy-industry shake-ups in the months since.

On his first day in office, Trump called out rising power demand and declared a national emergency on energy, which he has since used to justify keeping aging coal plants open long past their retirement dates.

His signature spending law, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, gutted tons of clean energy tax incentives. And that’s not to mention the administration’s decarbonization funding clawbacks, its holdup of renewables permitting, and its relentless attacks on the nation’s offshore wind industry.

Trump’s year-two agenda is already starting to take shape. Expect to see his administration order more coal plants to stay open, cancel additional clean energy funding, and throw up hurdles we can’t even imagine yet.

Geothermal is having a moment

As clean energy sources like offshore wind and solar struggle to snag a foothold in the new, post–tax credit world, geothermal proved this week that it still has the juice.

A wave of announcements from pioneering geothermal startups began on Wednesday, with Zanskar announcing it had raised $115 million in a Series C funding round. It’ll use the infusion to expand its AI software, which it used to uncover an untapped, invisible geothermal system in Nevada last year. Also on Wednesday, Sage Geosystems announced a more than $97 million Series B round, which will fund its first commercial-scale power generation project, slated to come online this year.

Fervo Energy completed the trifecta as it quietly filed for an IPO, Axios Pro reported on Thursday. The company hasn’t shared details about the filing, but said in December that it had raised about $1.5 billion so far in its quest to build a massive enhanced geothermal system in Utah.

Because when utilities build new power plants, everyone pays for them, whether they use the power or not—and utilities earn a guaranteed profit on top.
And Michigan utilities are still responsible for keeping the lights on.
SB 272 offers a more immediate, practical option: Let the large energy users that want to pay for their own power do it.","Indiana’s electric system is changing—but not because of any one event or decision. Many of the power plants that serve Hoosiers today were built decades ago, and a large share of them are scheduled to retire over the next 10 years. Even if no new data centers or large factories were coming to the state, Indiana would still need to replace aging power plants and plan for steady growth in electricity use.

At the same time, electric bills are already rising. Since 2008, Indiana’s electric rates have gone up 60%, one of the fastest increases in the country. Yet during that same period, utilities added relatively little new power generation. Looking ahead, Indiana will need a significant amount of new electricity—about 60% more by 2035—and building that power will be expensive. Current plans could require billions of dollars in new utility-owned power plants, paid for by customers through higher monthly bills.

That reality is why lawmakers should consider practical solutions that help control costs without disrupting the entire system. One such option is Senate Bill 272, called the Energy Freedom & Fairness Act and sponsored by Sen. Stacey Donato.

This proposal does not upend the system or change how most Hoosiers get their electricity. Instead, it makes a small, targeted adjustment: allowing a limited number of very large businesses to buy their electricity from private power providers instead of the utility.

Why does that matter? Because when utilities build new power plants, everyone pays for them, whether they use the power or not—and utilities earn a guaranteed profit on top. If some large users pay for their own power needs and shoulder the investment risk, utilities don’t need to build as many new plants, and that helps keep costs down for everyone else.

This isn’t a silver bullet. It won’t solve every energy challenge Indiana faces. But it does reduce pressure on the system and helps slow the pace of future rate increases. And it can be done right away.

This approach already works. In fact, 24 states already allow some large businesses to purchase electricity from private suppliers. Importantly, 10 of those states still have traditional utility monopolies, just like Indiana.

Michigan is a good example. Since 2008, Michigan has allowed a limited share of large customers to shop for electricity. That program has been full ever since it started, serving more than 5,000 businesses, with thousands more waiting to participate.

The results are indisputable.

Utilities in Michigan avoided building nearly 3,000 megawatts of new power plants and are preventing billions of dollars of investment risk from being placed on all ratepayers.

In just one year alone, Michigan businesses saved more than $150 million compared with utility rates.

And Michigan utilities are still responsible for keeping the lights on. Reliability hasn’t suffered.

Indiana’s energy challenges won’t be solved overnight. But many proposals on the table today rely on years of construction and billions in new utility spending—costs that ultimately land on Hoosier electric bills.

SB 272 offers a more immediate, practical option: Let the large energy users that want to pay for their own power do it. By reducing how much utilities need to build, the state can limit future rate increases, encourage private investment and preserve flexibility as demand grows.

This isn’t a dramatic overhaul. It’s a targeted adjustment with real benefits—and a sensible step for Hoosier families already feeling the impact of rising energy costs.•

Shipments are being received at EMCO’s Noblesville, Indiana site and include batteries sourced from both domestic and international suppliers. According to the company, the materials span multiple lithium-ion chemistries, including lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and nickel- and cobalt-bearing systems, reflecting the growing diversity of batteries entering end-of-life across EVs, energy storage systems, consumer electronics, and manufacturing scrap streams.

EMCO’s role in the process centers on aggregation, conditioning, and preprocessing rather than final refining. The company uses proprietary conditioning methods to prepare recovered battery materials for downstream refinement, focusing on elements such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt. Those conditioned materials are then supplied to ReElement Technologies Corporation, which converts them into high-purity products suitable for reuse in manufacturing.

Together, the two operations form a domestic recycling-to-refining pathway designed to reduce reliance on foreign-controlled processing capacity. While the announcement emphasizes scale-up potential, the current development reflects early-stage operational throughput rather than a major capacity expansion.

The timing aligns with a broader increase in battery volumes reaching end-of-life, particularly as early electric vehicle deployments and stationary storage systems begin cycling out of service.

The expiring tax breaks apply beginning with the 2025 tax year and include many touted by President Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign, including breaks for taxes on overtime, tips, and Social Security.

While Congress could always extend the new provisions beyond 2028, there is some question as to whether it will have the political will to do so. The new tax breaks are expected to cost the federal government billions of dollars in lost revenue, and setting an expiration date helped Congress reduce the OBBBA’s long‑term budget impact. Concerns over cost could lead Congress to simply let them expire at the end of 2028.

Which Tax Breaks Will Expire?

There are 10 temporary tax provisions in the OBBBA, but these six federal income tax benefits that will decrease the tax liability of many Americans are the most notable:

Senior deduction: Often referred to as “no tax on Social Security,” the $6,000 additional senior deduction for single filers ($12,000 for married filing jointly) is available for taxpayers who are 65 and over. The deduction is available to both seniors who itemize and those who claim the standard deduction. The additional senior deduction starts to phase out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $75,000 and eligibility phases out completely for MAGI above $175,000 ($150,000 and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly).

No tax on overtime: A new deduction for taxpayers who receive overtime pay that qualifies under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The deductible amount for federal tax is the “half” portion of the time-and-a-half required by law. The maximum amount of qualified overtime compensation that can be deducted each year is $12,500 ($25,000 for joint filers). The deduction phases out for taxpayers with MAGI of over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers).

No tax on tips: Employees and self-employed individuals may claim a tax deduction for qualified tips if they are in professions the IRS lists as customarily receiving tips. The maximum annual deduction is $25,000 for employees and can’t exceed the annual taxable income of self-employed individuals. The deduction phases out for taxpayers with MAGI over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers).

No tax on car loan interest: Individuals can claim an interest deduction of up to $10,000 annually for interest payments on a new vehicle purchased after Dec. 31, 2024, for their personal use. The vehicle must be a new car, minivan, SUV, pickup truck, or motorcycle with a gross weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds and have undergone final assembly in the U.S. The deduction phases out for individuals with MAGI of over $100,000 ($200,000 for joint filers).

Expanded charitable deduction: For tax years beginning in 2026, non-itemizers can claim an additional $1,000 deduction ($2,000 for joint filers) for charitable contributions. Previously, taxpayers claiming the standard deduction could not claim a charitable deduction. The OBBBA put a floor on deductions for taxpayers who itemize and donations below 0.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI) will not be deductible.

Temporary SALT deduction increase: The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) limited the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $10,000. The OBBBA temporarily increased the deduction cap to $40,000 for 2025 and then gradually reduces the cap each year by formula until it returns to $10,000 in 2030. The enhanced deduction begins phasing out for taxpayers with MAGI over $500,000, with the phase‑out thresholds adjusted slightly upward each year.

TCJA’s temporary changes made permanent

In addition to providing new tax breaks, the OBBBA made many of the temporary changes to tax law that were included in the TCJA permanent. Many of TCJA provisions in the tax reform bill were set to expire at the end of 2025. The tax changes made permanent include:

Individual income tax brackets with tax rates 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37% that reduced income tax rates for individuals

Increased standard income tax deduction

Increased child tax credit

Doubling of the gift tax and estate tax exemption

Increased exemption amounts for the alternative minimum tax (AMT)

Eliminated the 2% floor for miscellaneous itemized deductions

Tax benefits for investments in qualified opportunity zones

Energy savings incentives removed

The OBBBA didn’t just add benefits to the tax code, it removed some tax benefits that were implemented with the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. This included the removal of provisions providing clean vehicle credits. It also removed energy tax credits that encouraged taxpayers to update buildings and homes to make them more energy efficient.

Assessing the Impact of the OBBBA Changes

Since some of the tax benefits included in the OBBBA expire at the end of 2028 and 2029, taxpayers may want to talk to a tax attorney about how to structure their finances to take advantage of them before they disappear. A tax attorney can also make sure you are taking advantage of the tax provisions in the TCJA that were made permanent and help in reassessing planned investments in energy efficient vehicles, homes, and buildings in light of the repeal of related tax breaks.

Global Forces Still Matter U.S. energy markets are no longer insulated.","Americans were promised cheaper energy. Instead, they're getting higher bills — just as a brutal winter tightens its grip.

Natural gas prices are surging at a historic pace, utilities are approving rate hikes, and households are bracing for higher heating and electric costs nationwide. The spike comes despite President Donald Trump‘s pledge on the campaign trail to cut U.S. energy prices in half — a reminder that energy markets often respond less to political promises than to weather, infrastructure limits and global supply dynamics.

State Street Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLE) is climbing. See the chart and price action here.

What’s At Stake?

Energy prices are rising, impacting most Americans but mostly low- and middle-income families, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).

“These increases may be an inconvenience for higher-income households, but for low- and middle-income families they are devastating,"" Wolfe said in a Jan. 20 report. “Millions of households that were getting by are now being driven into utility debt and toward shutoffs because they cannot afford to keep their homes warm.”

Home heating costs are projected to rise 9.2% this season, the NEADA projects. That’s more than three times the rate of inflation, as higher electricity and natural gas prices collide with colder-than-average weather.

In Detroit, for example, wind chills are expected to drop to -25°F on Saturday, Jan. 24. High temperatures will stay far below normal, reaching only 9°F on Saturday, and 16°F on Sunday, compared with the January average of 32.3°F

The average U.S. household will spend roughly $995, up $84 from last year, with electric-heated homes seeing the steepest jump at 12.2%, and natural gas households up 8.4%. Heating oil and propane users are seeing smaller changes, as lower fuel prices offset the chill.

Is Extreme Cold Overwhelming The System?

Basically, yes. Short-term energy prices are largely governed by physics, weather and markets — not executive orders.

The U.S. is experiencing an exceptional cold wave across roughly 40 states, pushing heating demand sharply higher.

Natural gas fuels about 40% of U.S. electricity generation and heats more than half of American homes.

When temperatures plunge, gas demand spikes simultaneously for homes, power plants and industry.

That sudden, synchronized demand is why Henry Hub futures surged past $5 per MMBtu — an extraordinary weekly move.

The Trump administration’s anti-renewable policies can exacerbate this by forcing heavier reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets, rather than mitigating peak demand with solar, wind, or storage. Just yesterday, the Energy Department confirmed it was either revising or outright canceling more than $83 billion in loans for clean energy technologies.

Natural Gas Supply Can't Ramp Up Overnight

Despite record U.S. production, natural gas is not infinitely flexible.

Wells take time to drill and complete.

Pipeline capacity is fixed in the short term.

Storage withdrawals accelerate in extreme cold, tightening markets quickly.

Who Benefits From Higher Prices?

Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG)

TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE)

Freeport LNG (NASDAW: FLNG)

ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM)

Chevron (NYSE:CVX)

Natural gas prices follow a boom-and-bust cycle typical of commodity markets. When prices rise, producers drill aggressively, boosting supply. Eventually, the market becomes oversupplied, prices fall, and unprofitable projects are shut down.

Over one to two years, reduced production combined with recovering demand pushes prices back up, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. Henry Hub natural gas is a clear example of this pendulum-like behavior.

Infrastructure Bottlenecks Amplify Price Spikes

In many regions, especially the Northeast:

Pipeline constraints limit how much gas can reach population centers.

Power grids rely on gas plants that compete with homes for fuel.

Cold weather increases the risk of equipment failures and outages.

This is why regions like New York and Connecticut often see disproportionately higher costs, even when national supply looks ample.

Utility Rate Hikes Reflect Past Costs

Take Con Edison’s increases approved in New York. In addition to this week's cold snap, factor in:

Rising labor and maintenance costs

Grid hardening and climate resilience investments

Inflation-driven equipment and financing expenses

In the meantime, weather and markets rule.

Global Forces Still Matter

U.S. energy markets are no longer insulated.

LNG exports link domestic gas prices to global demand.

Europe and Asia compete for supply during winter.

Any geopolitical disruption tightens markets further.

To sum up: The U.S. may be energy-rich, but it is not energy-isolated.

In 2024, data show Europe (including Türkiye) remained the top destination for U.S. LNG exports, accounting for 53% of total shipments. Exports to Asia grew from 26% in 2023 to 33% in 2024. Other regions — including the Middle East, North Africa, and Latin America — also saw rising imports, accounting for 14% of U.S. LNG exports, up from 8% in 2023.

Because U.S. LNG exports connect domestic natural gas prices to global markets, higher shipments can tighten local supply and push prices up. Export-related withdrawals can leave less gas for heating and power generation, further increasing energy bills.

Over the long term, higher prices can spur more production, but in the short term, exports can raise costs for U.S. consumers.

Background

The Climate and Clean Energy Equity Fund (Equity Fund) is a trusted and strategic collaborative funder and movement-builder whose focus is to lift up the leadership and organizing of multiracial, working-class communities to drive equitable climate action and clean energy policy. The Equity Fund’s work is grounded in climate equity, strategies that mitigate climate change, rectify racial and economic injustices, and thereby create the political will needed to propel the transition to clean energy. The Equity Fund is strategically building power by:

Investing in the leadership and organizing of diverse communities (Black, Latinx, AAPI, Indigenous people, and communities bearing the brunt of climate change);

Engaging voters in these communities through nonpartisan civic engagement campaigns; and

Winning climate and clean energy policy solutions that reflect the priorities of communities and advance racial, economic, and environmental justice.

Founded in 2016, the Equity Fund partners authentically with community-based organizations in 14 states (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia), to build power in communities, transform public narratives about climate change, and build political will for lasting public policies.

Grassroots groups advocating for and organizing communities of color, Indigenous, working class and rural communities – often people hit hardest by climate change – are accomplishing critical work to build the collective power of communities. These communities are often the strongest supporters of climate policy and are a key political force to advance community demands and win durable policy change. The Equity Fund serves as a conduit for foundations and donors to partner with and support these grassroots organizations across the country. Because of Equity Fund’s expertise and deep relationships with community-led groups working at the intersection of climate change and economic, racial, and environmental justice, the Equity Fund can identify and nurture local grantee partners that have large-scale bases of members and track records of winning policy victories in their cities and states. The team then works to synthesize and share lessons learned from their grantee partners so that foundations and donors can better understand how grassroots groups can more effectively build power to advance climate solutions and then develop and coordinate funding strategies that will have the greatest results.

Some buyers have been taking the view that the prospect of higher gas prices made assets attractive at current valuations.
The position for US oil assets is somewhat different.
Wood Mackenzie’s Randall Collum suggested the weather could cause “the most impactful freeze-off” of US gas production in history.
Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, said the government would not provide on-the-ground security for oil companies operating in Venezuela.","“America is another name for opportunity,” the essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson said in 1844. Nearly two centuries later, it is still true in oil and gas.

Mitsubishi last week became the latest Japanese company to announce a deal for US gas assets, agreeing a US$7.5 billion deal to acquire Aethon, a Haynesville shale producer. The deal follows similar moves by Tokyo Gas and JERA in the past nine months.

In oil, meanwhile, Harbour Energy of the UK announced a US$3.2 billion deal to buy LLOG Exploration, a Gulf of America E&P business, shortly before Christmas. The deal is Harbour’s first move into the US, solidifying the Americas as its growth engine.

The interest in US assets from foreign companies is driven by some fundamental trends in the industry. More deals are likely in the months and years to come.

Mitsubishi’s strategy for the US is to build an integrated value chain, from upstream gas to power, data centres and chemicals.

It already has positions in LNG exports through the Cameron LNG plant in Louisiana, and electricity through its California-based Diamond Generating Corporation, an independent power producer.

JERA, which is Japan’s largest power generation company and one of the world’s largest LNG buyers, similarly cited diversification across the gas value chain as a key factor in its US$1.5 billion acquisition of assets in the Haynesville last October.

TG Natural Resources, which is majority-owned by Tokyo Gas, has also been doing deals to strengthen its integrated value chain in the US. Last year, it took a 70% stake in Chevron’s east Texas gas assets, for US$75 million in cash and US$450 million capital carry to fund development in the Haynesville formation. It first entered the play through its acquisition of Rockcliff Energy in 2023 for US$2.7 billion.

The Harbour/LLOG deal is different in that it is not gas-focused. Nor does it involve a Japanese buyer seeking upstream assets to balance a strong position in LNG. But it does reflect the attractiveness of US assets. Harbour is acquiring assets in the Gulf of America with high operating cash margins and low emissions, exactly the types of advantaged resources that companies want.

In his speech at the World Economic Forum this week, President Donald Trump hailed the gas investments and LNG contracts agreed with Japanese and South Korean companies as an example of the economic successes of the first year of his administration.

It is a trend that is set to continue into 2026.

The Wood Mackenzie view

The combination of soaring power demand from data centres for AI and a surge in construction of new LNG export facilities has led Wood Mackenzie to forecast rising US gas prices over the long term. And as Wood Mackenzie’s Greig Aitken and Scott Walker put it in a note published last week: “Where opportunity flows, deals follow.”

M&A activity in US gas has returned to levels last seen in the boom years of the early 2010s. Spending on North American unconventional gas assets last year reached its highest level since 2011, in nominal terms.

Some buyers have been taking the view that the prospect of higher gas prices made assets attractive at current valuations.

Some that are structurally short on North American gas – because they have committed to purchase LNG under long-term agreements – have been buying upstream assets to hedge against the risk of higher Henry Hub prices.

For these buyers, the Haynesville shale in Louisiana and eastern Texas is particularly attractive because it is close to many of the LNG export facilities of the Gulf coast. Wood Mackenzie estimates that once the Mitsubishi/Aethon deal closes, Japanese companies will control about a third of the production in that formation.

The position for US oil assets is somewhat different. Expectations that US liquids production will hit a plateau in the next 10 years or so may temper the enthusiasm of potential new entrants into tight oil plays, especially at the valuations seen in recent oil-weighted deals. Several US E&Ps have been looking abroad for long-term growth prospects.

The picture is similar offshore. Wood Mackenzie analysts commented that one of the attractions of LLOG for Harbour was that its portfolio “is one of the few in Gulf of America with a credible path for sustained growth” into the 2030s.

The queue of projects in the Gulf waiting for a final investment decision is thin. LLOG stands out because it has several viable projects in its portfolio that can contribute to production in the 2030s.

However, the scale and capabilities of the US industry mean that some acquisitions in US oil will make sense, both onshore and offshore.

Late last year, Japan Petroleum Exploration (JAPEX) announced a US$1.3 billion deal to buy Colorado-based tight oil producer Verdad Resources. JAPEX said the assets could support future growth opportunities, including gas development and potential collaboration with LNG projects.

The Haynesville play is a good example of how assets that might seem unattractive can be turned around. Its production rose rapidly in the first phase of the shale revolution, peaked around 2012 and declined into what looked like long-term stagnation.

Then, in 2017, operators mastered the techniques needed to unlock higher volumes from the formation. Output started to surge, and by 2023 was more than double its previous peak. Haynesville assets became the hot property they are today.

Similar breakthroughs to transform the prospects of other North American unconventional plays are still possible.

“That’s the great thing about US shale gas and tight oil,” says Robert Clarke, Wood Mackenzie’s vice president of Upstream research. “Once production gets going, it’s like a freight train. These plays have a tendency to overperform on volumes.”

In brief

US natural gas prices surged higher during the week, as weather forecasts projected a severe and prolonged winter storm across much of the country from Texas to New York. Henry Hub front-month gas futures were trading at about US$4.90 per mmbtu on Friday morning, up from about US$3/mmbtu a week ago. Wood Mackenzie’s Randall Collum suggested the weather could cause “the most impactful freeze-off” of US gas production in history.

The National Weather Service warned people to expect “crippling ice and sleet” in portions of the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley, and heavy snowfall northwards from the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and New England.

Venezuela’s legislature has been making progress on reforms intended to encourage international companies to invest and help revive the country’s ailing oil industry. A proposed revision to the hydrocarbons law – allowing foreign companies to operate oil and gas assets, market their own production and collect the revenues – won enough votes to proceed to a second vote. Reforms to strengthen legal protections for international businesses were also supported by lawmakers.

Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, said the government would not provide on-the-ground security for oil companies operating in Venezuela.

When Darren Woods, CEO of ExxonMobil, discussed prospects for investing in Venezuela two weeks ago, he said legal changes – including reform of the hydrocarbons law and durable investment protections – would be essential for making the country investable. He also added that security guarantees would have to be in place for ExxonMobil to put a team on the ground there.

Quote of the week

“We will quickly lose even the social permission to actually take something like energy, which is a scarce resource, and use it to generate these tokens, if these tokens are not improving health outcomes, education outcomes, public sector efficiency, private sector competitiveness across all sectors.”

Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos about the need for “tokens”, the units of data processed by AI models, to be used efficiently and with positive impacts on society.

These crises revealed that building energy resilience through on-site renewables and microgrids is a direct investment in patient safety.
A growing number of health systems are proving that these imperatives go hand-in-hand.
Finally, hospitals are discovering that their purchasing power is one of their most effective tools for climate action.
Ultimately, energy resilience and climate responsibility are not competing goals.","Hospitals are sanctuaries of care, but they are also among society’s most energy-intensive institutions. In the United States, the healthcare system accounts for 8.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Hospital operations–specifically scope 1 and 2 emissions–make up roughly one-third of that footprint. Operating rooms must be kept at precise temperatures, ventilation systems must sterilize the air around-the-clock, and heavy machinery like MRI scanners draw enormous loads of electricity–one scan alone can consume the daily power of an average American home.

However, the broader challenge lies in the supply chain. Only about 20% of the sector’s emissions come directly from on-site energy use, while the remaining 80% are scope 3 emissions embedded in the manufacturing, transportation, and disposal of everything from syringes to surgical gowns.

A common criticism often emerges in healthcare sustainability discussions: Hospitals have a duty to protect patients, and that should be the only priority when selecting materials like anesthetics or energy sources. While patient safety is indeed the primary mandate, the “do no harm” principle now requires looking beyond the hospital walls.

Energy resilience and decarbonization are not competing goals; they are two sides of the same coin. The growing frequency of severe storms and wildfires has exposed how fragile our dependence on centralized, fossil-fuel-heavy grids can be. After Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, hospitals were forced to run on diesel generators for months, leaving critical care units vulnerable during fuel shortages. Similar scenes played out during California’s wildfires and the 2021 Texas winter freeze. These crises revealed that building energy resilience through on-site renewables and microgrids is a direct investment in patient safety.

A growing number of health systems are proving that these imperatives go hand-in-hand. Kaiser Permanente became the first carbon-neutral health system in the U.S. by investing in renewable energy contracts and on-site solar. Gundersen Health in Wisconsin generates more energy than it consumes via biogas and wind. Montefiore Medical Center in New York uses microgrids and battery storage to “island” itself from the grid during outages, ensuring lifesaving equipment stays powered when the local infrastructure fails.

In recent years, federal policy has accelerated these transformations. A key catalyst has been the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, specifically its “direct pay” provision. This allowed non-profit hospitals to receive cash refunds for clean-energy tax credits, making solar panels and geothermal systems financially viable for institutions operating on narrow margins. By 2026, these programs will have demonstrated remarkable durability. Despite shifts in the political landscape, these incentives have survived due to their bipartisan appeal: they reduce operational costs for local employers and increase the reliability of community infrastructure during disasters. This survival highlights a pragmatic recognition that a resilient hospital is also a more secure hospital.

Finally, hospitals are discovering that their purchasing power is one of their most effective tools for climate action. By forming strategic purchasing consortia, hospitals can leverage their combined scale to demand innovations that an individual facility could never mandate on its own.

A primary target of this shift is the elimination of high-impact greenhouse gases, such as low-emission anesthetics. A transition away from gases like desflurane, which has a global warming potential thousands of times higher than CO2 per unit mass, is being achieved without any loss in care quality. Similarly, by prioritizing renewable-powered medical devices and sustainable packaging, hospitals are forcing manufacturers to decarbonize their own operations to remain competitive.

Ultimately, energy resilience and climate responsibility are not competing goals. As health systems confront the intertwined crises of climate change and public health, they can embody a broader kind of healing that protects the patient in the bed while simultaneously protecting the planet they call home.",https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iStock-2205851008-1-aspect-ratio-1280-225-2-1200x630-c-default.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 15:59:39.448686

EV batteries are battery packs made up of multiple “modules” or identical parts that contain many electrochemical cells. These cells contain layers (anode, cathode, and separator layers) that are in contact with an electrolyte (typically a liquid), and those components are then stacked or rolled together in steel or aluminum, making up a cell. Different chemicals can be used in the cathode of batteries, but lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide chemistries are more frequently used in EV batteries due to their relatively high energy storage capacity to support propulsion, with lithium-ion batteries being the most common. There are, however, competing alternatives, including lead acid, nickel metal hydride, and others. Materials used for the manufacturing of EV batteries (if variably) tend to be costly and environmentally intensive to mine and refine. In addition to these chemistries, cells may contain other materials such as copper, plastics, manganese, and graphite. EV batteries drive a significant portion of the market for some of these materials. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), “in 2022, about 60% of lithium, 30% of cobalt and 10% of nickel demand was for EV batteries.”

EV Battery Reuse and Recycling Markets To Date

EV battery reuse and recycling market estimates have varied considerably but generally reflect significant US and global market growth in recent years and projected growth over the next five to ten years. One report, for example, estimated that this market was expected to grow globally from $8 billion in 2024 to over $28 billion in 2029. If improperly managed, used EV batteries can leach harmful chemicals, cause fires, and waste valuable materials. But, if properly managed, they may improve the economic and environmental sustainability of the EV market as a whole. EOL EV batteries have generally been exported for processing. One study estimated that in 2019, about 44.5 percent of lithium-ion batteries generated in the US were exported, while only about 9 percent were recycled domestically.

Due to recent investments made for recycling in the US, however, that balance has begun shifting. In 2023, US battery recycling facilities had the capacity to reclaim over 35,000 tons of materials, with roughly 175,000 additional tons reclaimed at intermediate processing facilities. In 2024, the Department of Energy projected that planned facilities over the following few years would add 76,000 tons more of capacity at recycling facilities to reclaim materials, and 197,500 tons more at intermediate processing facilities.

Researchers have noted in recent years that while states and the federal government have implemented policies to support further manufacturing and information about EOL batteries, “compared to other countries, the US lacks a mechanism to ensure that batteries will be collected and recycled.” Existing measures and current proposals at the state and federal level have not only included those aimed at driving broader EV markets, infrastructure, and manufacturing, through mechanisms like tax incentives, but on waste disposal requirements and guidance, including the implementation of extended producer responsibility policies. However, more recent federal policy shifts have begun to roll back some of those efforts, including the ending of tax credits for EVs and transitioning fleets to lower-emissions vehicles. Consequently, some researchers and stakeholders have raised concerns about how this will impact the availability of EV batteries and, therein, broader investments in reuse and recycling.

Federal Policies and Regulations:

In 2021, under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), roughly $7.5 billion in funding was provided to expand EV charging infrastructure, and $5 billion was provided for EV and low-emissions school buses.

In 2022, the US Department of Energy provided a $2.5 billion loan for lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facilities in Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan.4 It also provided $2.8 billion in grants towards building out the battery mineral and material supply chain.

In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provided tax credits of $7,500 for the purchase of new EVs, and $4,000 for used ones through 2032.

EPA issued a memo in 2023 clarifying that most EOL lithium batteries are hazardous waste and can be managed under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements for “universal waste.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) ended the federal tax credit for EVs under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as of September 2025, which (while recent) has reportedly contributed to a battery surplus and divestment in related manufacturing that may also impact reuse and recycling markets.",https://www.rockinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_187267636-social.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 12:58:09.736972

Job opportunities in the renewable energy sector continue to expand globally. The 2025 edition of Renewable Energy and Jobs, produced by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in collaboration with the International Labour Organization (ILO), estimates the sector supports at least 16.6 million jobs worldwide. The figure underscores the industry’s role as a driver of economic and labor growth.

In this context, engineer Emilio Buitrago took a career turn in 2010, entering the field of wind energy. Sixteen years later, he describes himself as an enthusiastic advocate for the opportunities the sector offers and shares his experience to encourage other professionals to explore careers in renewable energy.

What led you to explore this new career field?

Curiosity, a desire to learn, adaptability, and a sense of purpose led me to pursue a career supporting alternative energy, modernizing power grids, and managing large-scale infrastructure projects.

Are there specific professional skills that helped you stand out in this field?

Being bilingual is an essential and highly valued asset. The renewable energy industry is global. In my experience, speaking both English and Spanish allowed me to meet with clients, negotiate contracts, and communicate requirements to teams in Spain, facilitating projects in Wyoming, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The ability to connect cultures and markets is incredibly valuable.

Besides engineering, what other professions are in demand in this industry?

Opportunities exist not only for engineers but also for environmental policy lawyers, financial analysts, scientists and researchers, sales and marketing specialists, and international business development managers. Technical roles such as electricians, welders, and maintenance personnel are also in high demand.

What would you say to those interested in entering the field but lacking experience?

Many employers offer training programs, as was the case when I moved from telecommunications to renewable energy. One of the most in-demand jobs in the U.S. is wind turbine technician, responsible for maintaining wind turbines. You do not need to be an engineer, as many companies train their staff directly.

It is also crucial to stay up to date. The industry is constantly evolving, and knowing the latest trends and technologies is always an advantage for entering and advancing professionally.

Employment growth in the sector has been steady. Do you think this trend will continue?

Absolutely. The energy transition is accelerating, and net-zero targets are no longer abstract. At the same time, technologies such as smart grids, energy storage, advanced controls, clean hydrogen, and AI-driven demand growth are reshaping the energy industry.

Any final advice for those considering these career opportunities?

My main advice is simple: network. Connections open doors. Introducing yourself, having conversations, and participating in events can make a difference. Alongside that, apply basic principles: continuous learning, adaptability, aligning skills with meaningful impact, and keeping a future-focused perspective.",https://volofoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Emilio-Buitrago-Article-Image.png,N,,2026-01-23 17:00:06.765349

Policies are key to further growth - IEA,Not Available,,,,,https://www.iea.org/commentaries/investment-in-next-generation-geothermal-is-surging-policies-are-key-to-further-growth,"Geothermal energy harnesses naturally occurring heat found beneath the Earth’s surface to provide heating and cooling, electricity and energy storage.
Next-generation geothermal technology developers are seeking to overcome these limits by drilling deeper and harnessing heat from hard-to-reach reservoirs.

Recent advancements in next-generation geothermal are promising and the potential they open is enormous, particularly as global electricity demand continues to grow.
In general, next-generation geothermal projects remain too big for venture capitalists alone and too risky for established corporate energy players.","Geothermal energy harnesses naturally occurring heat found beneath the Earth’s surface to provide heating and cooling, electricity and energy storage. As global electricity demand rises and power systems place a growing premium on firm supply, geothermal energy’s ability to provide an around-the-clock, low-emissions source of power is attracting renewed attention. However, easy-to-access conventional geothermal resources are relatively rare and mostly confined to a small number of shallow geothermal hotspots globally, accounting for only about 1% of global electricity demand today.

Next-generation geothermal technology developers are seeking to overcome these limits by drilling deeper and harnessing heat from hard-to-reach reservoirs. Operators can either circulate fluid through fractures that have been induced (through what is known as enhanced geothermal systems) or transfer heat to the surface through closed-loop circuits. These technologies are advancing quickly, potentially enabling economically-viable geothermal development nearly anywhere in the world. The IEA’s Future of Geothermal Energy report, published in late 2024, estimated that with continued technology improvements and reductions in project costs, next-generation geothermal could meet up to 15% of global electricity demand growth to 2050.

According to IEA analysis of new data – including exclusive data shared by Underground Ventures, a firm that invests in next-generation geothermal – financing for the sector reached nearly USD 2.2 billion in 2025, an 80% increase year-over-year and up from just USD 22 million in 2018.

Mature conventional geothermal attracted strong investment as well. Funding for conventional geothermal power projects reached nearly USD 5 billion in 2025 – a four-fold increase from 2018 – while geothermal heating projects, such as those used for district heating, secured over USD 11.5 billion in 2025 alone.

In another sign of growing investor confidence in the sector, the global share of equity financing declined from 70% between 2018 and 2020 to just over half between 2023 and 2025, as companies were increasingly able to secure debt alongside data centre power and critical mineral supply agreements. Debt-based financing now accounts for nearly 30%, with financing terms expected to improve further as risks continue to fall.

While public funding is essential to incubate and reduce the financial risks of next-generation technologies, overall, its relative share in total financing is relatively low. Publicly-sourced grants are currently about 9% of next-generation funding globally, down from 12% between 2018 and 2020. The United States leads in the number of grants awarded, though the European Union provides the largest share of total public funding by value.

The increase in financing has been underpinned by rapid technological progress, with new innovations and knowledge from other parts of the energy sector helping next-generation geothermal projects move closer to commercialisation. Recent advances in subsurface engineering – many of them driven by techniques pioneered in the shale oil industry – have been particularly important, helping to accelerate project development and reduce costs.

The US Department of Energy’s Utah Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) has showcased the benefits of knowledge sharing from the oil and gas sector. FORGE drilled its first wells in 2021, and by 2024 had successfully demonstrated enhanced geothermal systems in practice, nearly doubling previous drilling rates from 8 meters per hour (m/h) to almost 15 m/h, with peak rates reaching nearly 26 m/h. FORGE collaborator Fervo, a US enhanced geothermal company that raised over USD 1 billion between 2022 and 2025, has achieved drilling rates of 30 m/h. Several companies have now demonstrated similar performance, including Mazama Energy’s recent high-temperature well construction demonstration at its 15 megawatt (MW) enhanced geothermal pilot in the US state of Oregon.

As technological advancements continue, geothermal’s ability to deliver reliable, around-the-clock baseload power is drawing growing interest. This is proving particularly attractive to the data centre industry, whose global electricity consumption is set to surge by more than 300% by the end of this decade – creating a group of long-term paying customers that are helping push financing to new levels.

Geothermal projects, whether producing heat or electricity, usually sell their output through long-term contracts. These include heat purchase agreements or power purchase agreements with utilities or industrial customers, which provide stable income to facilitate debt financing. Until 2023, most next-generation geothermal project developers could only secure electricity price guarantees equivalent to solar and wind projects, or about USD 30-60 per megawatt-hour. But as electricity demand grows strongly in major markets – including in the United States, where data centres are helping lift power consumption for the first time in two decades – geothermal developers have begun securing significantly higher contract prices, in some cases reaching about USD 130 per megawatt-hour.

In 2024, Google and NV Energy signed a power purchase agreement for electricity from Fervo’s 115 MW Corsac project, while Meta committed to sourcing 150 MW from Sage Geosystems starting in 2027. This shows that companies are willing to pay a premium for clean, dependable power that can operate continuously, even for the first projects that may have the highest unit costs.

Efforts to build out critical mineral supply are also giving next-generation geothermal a lift. Geothermal energy projects can serve as a source of lithium, demand for which is expected to grow strongly in the next decade under all IEA scenarios.

Lithium that is dissolved in geothermal brine can be obtained via a direct extraction method. This process has the potential to require less water, land and energy use than traditional hard-rock mining, while providing developers with an additional source of revenue.

Geothermal projects currently under development in the European Union and the United States could yield 47 kilotonnes of lithium per year by 2035, which would meet 5% of global demand based on today’s policy settings. Vulcan Energy’s Phase 1 Lionheart project in Germany, which fully secured financing in 2025, not only has offtake agreements with local district heating and industry consumers for power and heat, but also with Glencore, Stellantis, LG Corp and Umicore for lithium. Similar integrated geothermal‑lithium developments are actively underway across Europe and the United States, demonstrating the potential for this model to bolster growth.

Recent advancements in next-generation geothermal are promising and the potential they open is enormous, particularly as global electricity demand continues to grow. Combining new drilling and materials technologies with real-time downhole sensor data has cut well costs by up to 30% and may extend asset lifetimes beyond 25 years. Further cost reductions are anticipated as developers gain experience through construction and operations and as multiple players continue to compete.

Even so, large-scale geothermal projects face major challenges that could stymie future progress. These include exploration and upfront financial risks, as well as those related to execution. In general, next-generation geothermal projects remain too big for venture capitalists alone and too risky for established corporate energy players. This “missing middle” – also known as the “the technology valley of death” – is where governments traditionally step in. While some energy customers, primarily data centres, are now willing to pay a premium to see if the technology can work at scale, this demand alone appears insufficient to move the technology towards widespread commercialisation.

Given this backdrop, government support remains vital to the sector’s ongoing development. By setting targets and roadmaps that raise awareness, pursuing permitting reform, implementing risk-mitigation schemes, and ensuring power-market designs that make it easier to sell on the electricity produced directly to offtakers, they can help next-generation geothermal move through this “technology valley of death.” Encouraging examples include the US Department of Energy's geothermal R&D funding, Germany's new accelerated permitting law combined with drilling risk-insurance, and risk-mitigation facilities in the Philippines, Germany and East Africa. The EU’s forthcoming Geothermal Action Plan is another welcome step towards giving geothermal the dedicated policy attention it has long lacked, and can realise its full potential only by covering both conventional and next-generation geothermal technologies.

Delivering on the promise of next-generation geothermal everywhere will also require economic conditions that make projects both viable and scalable, alongside supportive policies, strong market design and investment incentives. Additionally, growth in the sector – especially growth that supports new demand sectors and sparks fresh innovation – will be amplified if companies can share their learnings through government programs or industry organisations, such as Geothermal Rising, Project InnerSpace, Clean Air Task Force Superhot Rock Initiative and the European Geothermal Energy Council.

The IEA will continue to provide data and analysis to support these efforts, including through a forthcoming publicly accessible global database on geothermal projects. This will provide comprehensive, up-to-date tracking of conventional and next-generation geothermal, alongside the broader assessment of progress via the Races to First data tool.",https://iea.imgix.net/91c6bf1b-ad4e-4f20-b8bc-06eba67abfbb/geothermal_shutterstock_2403311211.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=min&h=600&q=80&rect=27%2C44%2C764%2C382&w=1200,N,,2026-01-23 14:59:38.729219

In those conditions, other products — calcium chloride, magnesium chloride — release heat that helps the salt work better, Tirado said.
Calcium chloride and magnesium chloride can cost at least twice as much as rock salt.
Calcium manganese acetate is one of the tamest de-icing products out there, developed specifically to replace rock salt and be more environmentally friendly.
Pamela Bennett, a horticulture professor at Ohio State, said rock salt is the worst for plants.","Winter has its fans, but even those who enjoy playing in the snow probably dislike the chore of clearing up after a big storm that dumps several inches or even feet of snow and ice.

It’s easy to dash to the closest hardware store to grab a bag of salt, but experts say there are a lot of environmental and other factors to consider when tackling all that ice and snow.

Here’s what to know.

What kinds of salt are out there?

Rock salt, also known as sodium chloride, is the cheapest and most commonly used product. But it’s not great for the environment and it’s not the most effective option out there.

“There’s a chart we reference that’s chemical effectiveness at certain temperatures. And really, when you get to about 15 degrees or colder, you can keep applying more and more rock salt and it’s not going to do any more than it already does,” said Martin Tirado, CEO of the Snow and Ice Management Association, a trade group for industry professionals.

In those conditions, other products — calcium chloride, magnesium chloride — release heat that helps the salt work better, Tirado said.

The different formulations vary in other ways, too, including how quickly they work, their corrosiveness and how they interact with moisture. Calcium chloride and magnesium chloride can cost at least twice as much as rock salt.

But all contain chlorides that can pollute fresh water, damage shrubs, trees and grass and crumble concrete sidewalks, stoops and driveways.

Blends and coatings can reduce the corrosive nature and environmental hazards of these salts, experts say.

Calcium manganese acetate is one of the tamest de-icing products out there, developed specifically to replace rock salt and be more environmentally friendly. It is biodegradable, a corrosion inhibitor, and typically used as a liquid. But it is much more expensive and can still create issues with dissolved oxygen on bodies of water.

What about those environmental effects?

Pamela Bennett, a horticulture professor at Ohio State, said rock salt is the worst for plants. It gets them in two ways: through the roots and through the air.

Salt percolates through the soil. When plants start to draw in salty water in the spring, that dries roots, leading to dry leaves. Brown tips on leaves indicate the soil might have gotten too salty.

Salt can also reach plant foliage — in the winter, that’s evergreens — directly when it’s carried by mist and spray. That’s an issue that’s worse on major roads as a lot of traffic moves quickly.

“When you have a lot of road salt on the highways, cars are splashing and wind blows it. That salt turns into what looks like a burn,” Bennett says.

What about my pets?

Most people walking their dog in snowy places have seen what happens when they walk across a heavy salt treatment — stopping suddenly and lifting a paw as if in pain.

“Their paw pads get dry or they get little cuts because those crystals are sharp, and then they’re chewing them because that’s the only way they know to make it feel better,” said Alison Manchester, an assistant clinical sciences professor at Cornell University. If they swallow enough salt, it can lead to vomiting, too.

For some people, animal safety is a strong reason to look to a nonsalt option against ice and snow.

So what are my nonsalt alternatives?

Abrasives such as gravel and sand can help with grip, so pedestrians and tires are less likely to slip. But they also come with their own problems.

Sand that runs off into freshwater bodies — lakes, streams and rivers — can kill natural growth, Tirado said.

Sand can also accumulate in your soil, eventually becoming a problem for plant growth. It can even make a type of concrete when it mixes in clay-heavy soils, experts say.

Unconventional solutions are out there. You can buy a de-icer that wraps its chlorides in beet juice or beet extract that coats the granules for a variety of benefits, including melting ice faster, working in colder temperatures and staying where it’s put. And a Korean company, Star’s Tech, is working with material taken from invasive starfish to produce a de-icer that it says more slowly releases chloride material and thus avoids some of the corrosion and environmental problems of salt.

Be ready to shovel more than once — and don’t over-apply

Experts say preparation and strategy can make clearing ice easier. That starts with watching forecasts to see how much snow is expected.

“People wait until after the storm to start shoveling,” Tirado said. “That’s fine if you’re having 1 to 2 inches. If you start getting 3, 4 or more inches than that, you can’t wait … you need to go out multiple times. That way it keeps the paved surface more clear in a productive and proactive manner.”

Ground temperature matters. If it’s warmer, you may be able to use less than you think you need. Colder ground temperatures might require more.

Proper application of whatever you put on your sidewalk or driveway is important, too.

“The key here is to not use too much and scatter it too much,” said David Orr, director of the Local Roads Program at Cornell. “We also do probably need to get into the habit that it may not be perfectly bare and that can be OK.”

As part of the expansion, Centrus plans to create nearly 430 new jobs and invest more than $560 million in Anderson County over the next several years to support both the growth in workforce and investment in the production of thousands of advanced centrifuges.

Today's announcement supports Centrus' recently announced plans for a major expansion of its Ohio uranium enrichment plant, which will help the company meet America's commercial and national security requirements. The first new centrifuges produced in Tennessee are expected to come online in Ohio in 2029.

Centrus' Technology and Manufacturing Center in Oak Ridge is the only uranium enrichment centrifuge manufacturing facility in the U.S. The company recently was awarded funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to expand its uranium enrichment plant in Ohio with centrifuges produced in Tennessee.

Centrus is the eighth company to utilize funding from Tennessee's Nuclear Energy Fund. The $50 million fund was in Gov. Lee's recommended 2023-2024 budget and approved by the Tennessee General Assembly. An additional $10 million was allocated and approved in the state's budget during both the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions, bringing the fund's total to $70 million since its inception.

For all the excitement over the up-and-coming generation of new energy storage technologies, good old fashioned pumped hydro still accounts for about 95% of utility-scale storage in the US, and its footprint is still growing. In the latest news, the Florida-based pumped storage firm Rye Development has just received a 40-year license for the proposed 1.2 gigawatt Goldendale Energy Storage Project in Washington State.

Long-Duration Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

Pumped hydropower does just what it says. During periods of low electricity demand, water is pumped to a reservoir at a higher elevation. When demand rises, water flows by gravity to a power station below. Pumped hydro can operate under a fossil energy scenario, but wind and solar offer a more sustainable, and economical, alternative.

Pumped storage facilities can run on an open-loop basis, charging and discharging a single reservoir from a nearby river. Or they can deploy two reservoirs in a closed-loop system, helping to alleviate concerns over water availability.

Rye Development has both kinds of pumped storage facilities in its portfolio. The Goldendale Energy Storage project is a closed-loop system and it checks more than a few sustainability and economic development boxes:

Redevelops a brownfield privately owned property, the site of the former Columbia Gorge Aluminum smelter plant;

Deploys existing road and transmission infrastructure associated with the existing 136.6-megawatt Tuolumne Wind Farm;

Delivers electricity for 12 hours;

Adds zero emission grid capacity to a region where electricity demand is expected to grow 30% in 10 years;

Creates 3,000 construction jobs over 3-5 year period;

Adds $10 million annually to Klickitat County revenue for schools and other civic infrastructure

The 12-hour period also supports long-duration energy storage, which the US Department of Energy has identified as a critical need for a future grid saturated with wind and solar power. The Energy Department defines long duration as meeting a 10-hour floor, with some future technologies reaching into multiple days, weeks, and whole seasons (see more long-duration background here).

Why Pumped Storage

The long duration future is already here with pumped storage, and new systems are also emerging. The California startup Noon Energy, for example, just reached a key milestone towards commercializing a 100-hour energy storage system based on fuel cell technology, and the Massachusetts firm Form Energy is looking forward to the first commercial deployment of its 100-hour iron-air battery at the Great River Energy project in Minnesota, an effort almost six years in the making.

Against this backdrop, it’s fair to ask why more pumped hydro facilities are needed to fill out the nation’s long duration energy storage profile. One answer is that pumped hydro is a long-established industry in the US, deploying proven materials and systems. The first utility-scale pumped storage facility was constructed in Connecticut in 1929.

As illustrated by the Goldendale’s 3-5 year construction time, some pumped hydro projects can be up and running faster than a typical fossil energy project. The opportunity to deploy existing brownfields, roads, and transmission infrastructure is another positive, alongside additional opportunities for floating solar power plants.

Under the current state of technology, some analyses also indicate that pumped hydro has a lower global warming impact than other forms of energy storage, in terms of emissions related to construction and materials. “Researchers found that PSH, on average, offered the lowest GWP when compared to compressed-air energy storage, utility-scale lithium-ion batteries, utility-scale lead-acid batteries, and vanadium redox flow batteries,” the Energy Department noted in a report posted in 2024, referencing data collected in 2022 and 2023.

More Pumped Hydro For The US

That doesn’t mean the end of the road for other systems. A movement is afoot to pair pumped hydro with other forms of energy storage to achieve additional flexibility and responsiveness. A new report from the Energy Department, for example, indicates that hydropower operators can earn new revenue, and save wear and tear on their turbines, by investing in on-site battery energy storage systems. The researchers found significant results when they modeled a 60-megawatt lithium-ion battery array with a duration of just two hours at an existing hydropower dam in Missouri.

The Energy Department plans to model the hydro-plus-battery combo at additional sites, firming up the case for both hydropower and energy storage in the nation’s power generation profile.

That raises the question … why is the Energy Department lending its seal of approval to renewable energy? After all, during the second term in office of US President Donald Trump, the Energy Department has shifted priorities in favor of nuclear and fossil energy. Nevertheless, the “American Energy Dominance” policy articulated by the White House does make room for some renewables, including biomass and geothermal as well as hydropower and related technologies.

Next Steps For US Hydropower

Over the past 30 years, the US hydropower industry has turned its attention away from new, Hoover-style hydropower dams, preferring to focus investor dollars on upgrading existing resources. Considering the age of the nation’s hydropower dams and pumped storage fleet, there is plenty of room to produce additional clean kilowatts by upgrading old turbines. Adding new turbines to existing dams is another potential opportunity.

Redeveloping brownfields for new pumped storage facilities aligns with the focus on re-using existing sites. Rye, for example, has also been working on the 266-megawatt coalfields-to-energy Lewis Ridge Pumped Storage Project in Kentucky. The Lewis Ridge project reached a key milestone last summer, when Rye submitted its Final License Application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

Rye is also the firm behind the proposed 400-megawatt Swan Lake Energy Storage project in Oregon, and the 500-megawatt Western Navajo 1 Pumped Storage project in Arizona.

The Western Navajo project is of interest because it will be located on Tribal land in the vicinity of the 2.25-gigawatt Navajo Generating Station, a coal power plant that shut down in 2019. Once notorious as one of the nation’s largest single sources of greenhouse gas emissions, NGS is not likely to make the Energy Department’s growing list of aging coal power plants to be supported. The facility was largely demolished in 2020 and the grounds were re-seeded, leaving only a few buildings behind. Converting the site to other uses has been challenging, though its railway infrastructure is a potential attraction.

Another Navajo Nation pumped storage project to keep an eye on is the proposed 1.5-gigawatt, 70-hour Carrizo Four Corners Pumped Storage Hydropower project in New Mexico, a collaboration between the Navajo Nation and New Mexico State University, with other partners. The 70-hour duration is aimed at alleviating seasonal swings in electricity demand and water availability, while filling in during periods when solar and wind generation are reduced.

Also, thought I'd find out where pOwned comes from and got this summary from my ai.

“pwned” (often written jokingly as pOwned) has a fun, very internet-y origin — and it long predates US politics. The short version pwned started as gamer slang meaning utterly defeated or humiliated It came from a typo of “owned” Politics borrowed it later, especially in online culture wars The origin story 🎮 In late 1990s–early 2000s online gaming (Warcraft, StarCraft, Counter-Strike), players would trash-talk by saying someone got “owned” — meaning dominated. On QWERTY keyboards: P is right next to O So “owned” often got mistyped as “pwned” Instead of correcting it, gamers kept the typo because it sounded funny and became insider slang. Pronunciations varied: “powned” “pawned” or just “owned but harder” By the early 2000s, pwned = totally embarrassed, destroyed, no comeback possible. How it jumped into politics 🏛️ Mid-2000s internet culture (blogs, forums, early social media) started using gamer language for debate: “Facts and logic” “Owned” “Epic fail” “Mic drop” Conservatives and liberals alike used it, but right-wing online spaces leaned into “owning the libs” as a rhetorical goal: Not persuading Not debating Just humiliating the other side publicly So “pOwned” became a stylized way of saying: We didn’t just win the argument — we made them look stupid.

Townsend said the bill is “refocusing a lot of [EERE] funding to better support baseload generation.”","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

An appropriations bill passed by both houses of Congress awards $3.1 billion in funding to the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy instead of the White House’s requested $880 million, and provides funding for its solar and wind energy programs, which the administration had requested zero funding for.

The bill constitutes an overall decrease from EERE’s 2025 funding level of $3.46 billion, but increases EERE’s budget for solar from $41.9 million to $220 million and wind from $29.8 million to $100 million. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the appropriations bill into law ahead of the Jan. 31 funding deadline, law firm Holland & Knight said in a Jan. 16 blog post.

The congressional report on the bill also states that the agency can’t terminate a federal award, or require a renegotiation or rescoping of it, on the basis that the federal award “no longer effectuates program goals or agency priorities.”

Dive Insight:

DOE announced an updated organizational chart in November which removed the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, consolidating it into the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation, but the budget doesn’t address this.

“Nearly every line item in the appropriations bill for DOE is higher than what was in the President’s budget request,” said Brad Townsend, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions’s vice president for U.S. policy and outreach. “EERE, which no longer even exists in the org chart, still got more than $3 billion in funding, which I think is an example of Congress working to assert its power over the purse.”

Congress drawing a line about the termination of federal awards also reflects this, Townsend said, but “it’s going to depend on what that looks like in practice, and how DOE actually follows those guidelines.”

Some grant awardees who received funding from the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act are still fighting those cancellations in court.

The bill reallocates around $5.1 billion in unobligated funds from Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provisions, including several carbon capture programs. About $3.1 billion of the reallocated funding will go to the Office of Nuclear Energy for its Advanced Reactor Deployment Program, and $375 million will flow to Grid Deployment for programming to enhance the domestic supply chain for grid components.

The reallocation toward the nuclear office “makes sense, because it’s continued funding for safeguarding the U.S. nuclear fuel supply for the grid, continuing research in that particular realm,” said Max Pyziur, a research director with the Energy Policy Research Foundation. “And probably there’s a veiled component meaning that it helps support the national labs, which overall is very important work and very useful work.”

In 2025, the Trump administration laid off workers at DOE’s national labs, including 114 National Renewable Energy Laboratory workers, and the budget cuts it proposed for DOE last July would have resulted in thousands more layoffs – a scenario this appropriations budget averts.

The layoffs were “a DOGE priority, and a lot of people were sounding alarms off about — one, you would lose the research, and the other thing is you would lose the employment and consequently the tax base,” Pyziur said.

Townsend said that despite the funding contained in this bill, a sense of instability could lead to brain drain for those labs. “Ultimately, [they’re] competing for talent with the private sector,” he said. “If I were a person finishing up a doctorate degree and thinking about where to work, I don’t know that this appropriations bill would dissuade me from looking at private sector options.”

Pyziur noted that the bill meets White House’s proposed funding for geothermal technology programs and exceeds what it requested for water power programs. Geothermal received $487.9 million in 2025; the Trump administration requested $150 million this year and is set to receive exactly that. Water power received $300 million last year, while the Trump administration requested $90 million this year and is set to receive $220 million.

Both are dispatchable resources which support the energy policy articulated by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, he said, while funding solar and wind contradicts Wright’s stated goals.

The 2021 plan had envisaged battery cell manufacturing capacity of 50 GWh by 2026.
The other beneficiaries are yet to commission their ACC battery manufacturing facilities.
“India lacks a mature cell manufacturing ecosystem, including critical mineral refining and cell component production, which leaves the industry almost entirely dependent on imports from China.
“There is a substantial gap between the intended and actual outcomes of the ACC-PLI scheme.","Delays in visa approvals for Chinese technical specialists, requirements that mandate local manufacturing, and the lack of critical technologies threaten the government’s ambitious Advanced Chemistry Cell Production Linked Incentive (ACC-PLI) scheme, says a report by the research firms Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research and Analytics released earlier this week.

The scheme was launched in October 2021 to catalyse domestic, next-generation battery manufacturing.

As of October 2025, however, only 1.4 gigawatt-hour (GWh) worth of battery cells have been commissioned on time, while 8.6 GWh is under development but delayed. The 2021 plan had envisaged battery cell manufacturing capacity of 50 GWh by 2026.

Advanced Chemistry Cells are the components of modern batteries using technologies such as lithium-ion to run electric vehicles and are different from the classical lead-acid batteries that start a car or run inverters.

The ACC-PLI scheme, launched by the Ministry of Heavy Industries in October 2021, promised emergent battery manufacturers, who won an auction, a certain amount of money for every battery they sold, as a way to incentivise investment in the sector.

The government’s scheme also aimed to build a local battery supply chain (cathode, anode, electrolyte) to reduce import dependence, mobilising private investments and global tech partnerships, lowering battery costs, and accelerating electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage adoption.

Currently, China is the dominant supplier of such cells, and one of the aims of the scheme is to reduce India’s dependence on the country. With an outlay of ₹18,100 crore ($2.08 billion), the ACC-PLI sought to attract large companies by mandating a minimum investment of ₹1,100 crore ($129.3 million).

In return, companies would receive a maximum subsidy of ₹2,000 per KWH. Another mandate was that companies should ensure 25% of the manufacturing was local within two years, and 60% within five years.

While several companies flocked to bid for 50 GWh capacity in the initial round of auctions, only 30 GWh was effectively allotted.

Ola Electric, Reliance New Energy, Hyundai Global, and Rajesh Exports emerged as the selected beneficiaries, though Hyundai Global eventually dropped out. None of the selected companies actually had expertise in battery manufacturing. Companies that had such experience — Amara Raja and Exide Industries, though the traditional lead-acid ones — were priced out of the auction. “The high net-worth requirement (a minimum of ₹2.25 billion per GWh) further restricted participation to large corporates,” the report notes.

Because none of the three companies have started selling batteries, zero incentives have been disbursed to any beneficiary against the targeted ₹2,900 crore by October 2025. Ola Electric has also scaled back its expansion plans and now aims to install only 5 GWh by financial year (FY) 2029. The other beneficiaries are yet to commission their ACC battery manufacturing facilities. Rajesh Exports lags the most, with progress limited to land acquisition, while reports of financial discrepancies have further raised concerns about its ability to commission the facility in the near term, the report notes.

“India lacks a mature cell manufacturing ecosystem, including critical mineral refining and cell component production, which leaves the industry almost entirely dependent on imports from China. Industry stakeholders also highlight delays in visa approvals for Chinese technical specialists required for equipment installation, further slowing progress.

“In addition, scheme-related issues such as an aggressive two-year installation timeline and high domestic value-ad requirements pose significant challenges for PLI beneficiaries with no prior experience in battery manufacturing,” the report underlines. “There is a substantial gap between the intended and actual outcomes of the ACC-PLI scheme. Against an estimated 1.03 million jobs, the scheme has generated only 1,118 jobs (0.12%).”

Stakeholders across the U.S. electric sector are preparing for Winter Storm Fern, which is expected to impact an area stretching from Texas to New York, as far north as the upper Midwest and into parts of the Southeast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration anticipates the storm to begin today and run through Sunday.

Anticipating widespread power outages, local distribution utilities have been activating recovery plans and warning customers to be prepared. The North American Electric Reliability Corp. says it is “encouraged that industry has taken actions to prepare for what appears to be a very challenging winter storm system.”

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has asked grid operators to be prepared to utilize up to 35 GW of backup generation.

Dive Insight:

In a Thursday letter to reliability coordinators and balancing authorities, Wright called for the Department of Energy to “prepare to issue orders” under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to “ensure that the tens of gigawatts of available backup generation, which would otherwise stand idle, is available during emergency conditions.”

When notified, “even merely by phone call ... I will review the facts and, if appropriate, authorize the Reliability Coordinators and Balancing Authorities to direct backup generation facilities to run as a last resort before declaring an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) 3, thereby avoiding potential blackouts,” Wright said.

The letter offered few details about the 35 GW of backup generation, and DOE did not immediately respond to questions.

According to Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, the units are diesel generators located at data centers and commercial properties.

“As the order recognizes, most of these units are not grid connected, and so have no utility or coordination abilities to address a system emergency,” Slocum said in a statement. “Unmentioned in the order is the massive harm to public health stemming from long-duration operations of these polluting units.”

The Winter Storm Fern has been compared to Winter Storm Uri, which caused power outages across the country in 2021 and was particularly harsh in Texas, where almost 250 people died. The catastrophe led to reforms across the Texas utility sector, and in other areas.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas issued a weather watch Wednesday noting the possibility for higher electrical demand and the lower reserves during Winter Storm Fern. However, grid conditions “are expected to be normal,” it said.

The Lone Star State grid operator also said it is “coordinating preparation efforts with the Texas Energy Reliability Council, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the Texas Division of Emergency Management, and other state agencies, as well as with Market Participants.”

CenterPoint Energy, which serves the Houston area, said it has approximately 3,300 employees and contract workers ready to support “storm preparation and potential restoration” across its territory. The utility serves approximately 2.7 million customers across the Houston area and surrounding communities.

Utilities around the country have signaled to customers they are prepared for the storm and recovery. In New Jersey, PSE&G said it is ready for “significant snowfall and extended frigid temperatures,” and warned customers that “snow and ice can bring hazards that disrupt power.” The utility serves about 2.4 million electric customers and 1.9 million gas customers.

“Our crews are ready 24-7 to restore power outages and handle increased requests to repair heating systems for our customers,” John Latka, PSE&G senior vice president of electric transmission and distribution, said in a statement.

In South Carolina, Dominion Energy said customers “should take steps now to prepare and keep themselves and their families safe.” The utility serves electricity to 3.6 million homes and businesses in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and regulated gas service to 500,000 customers in South Carolina.

“We’re closely monitoring the forecast calling for a mix of wintry precipitation, and that kind of weather can create significant challenges for our crews,” Keller Kissam, president of Dominion Energy South Carolina, said in a statement. The utility has activated an emergency operations center from which to respond, Kissam added.

The New York grid operator has adequate generation in place under forecast conditions, but said it would be keeping a close eye on fuel supplies.

We’ve “seen generators in recent winters challenged with accessing adequate fuel capacity during very cold conditions,” Aaron Markham, vice president of operations for the New York Independent System Operator, said in a statement. “We continue to work closely with power producers, utility companies, and neighboring grid operators to assess the status of generating and transmission capacity in advance of the cold snap.”

While most of the storm preparation focus is on grid reliability and its impacts on residential consumers, financial analysts have also keyed in on potential business impacts.

“More data center, more renewables, & less coal creates a vulnerable situation,” Jefferies equity analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith wrote in a Thursday note.

“We view reliability and resource adequacy shortfall events as key negative tail risks for independent power producers,” Dumoulin-Smith said. “High profile power outages in data center markets like [Texas] would lead to further stakeholder push-back on data center demand outpacing supply additions.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/GgNGSnc12_xmmdjaCFcEjhpBxkAzw92hFEBnUqPYUdU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzAyODU3MTA4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-23 12:40:59.079820

Dive Brief:

The Center for Biological Diversity and a coalition led by the Southern Environmental Law Center filed separate lawsuits this week to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from weakening standards that limit water pollution, including the release of mercury, selenium and arsenic, from coal-fired power plants.

The EPA issued a final rule in December extending compliance deadlines for effluent limitations as much as five years, until Dec, 31, 2034, giving coal-fired plants more time to assess potential pathways “to continue producing low-cost electricity into the future while meeting wastewater standards,” the agency said in the rule summary. The agency said extending the deadline is necessary “to affordably meet the nation’s growing electricity demand, including for data centers and manufacturing.”

“Arsenic and mercury from coal-fired power plants can be stopped by readily available water pollution controls, but this administration wants these dirty, outdated plants to keep dumping their toxic pollution into our rivers and lakes for years to come,” Nick Torrey, senior attorney at the SELC, said in a statement. “Our communities can’t afford more cancer-causing pollution in our waterways.”

Dive Insight:

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in September that the agency planned to give coal-fired plants compliance extensions for what he called “heavy-handed regulations” the Biden administration issued in 2024 to stop wastewater discharges from coal-fired power plants, including limitations on wastewater and coal ash that can contain selenium, mercury, arsenic and nickel.

The EPA in September also requested information on “technology-based implementation challenges” related to the 2024 rule that it will use “to support a future rulemaking to support practical, feasible, on-the-ground implementation of wastewater pollution discharge limits,” it stated.

The Center for Biological Diversity’s lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, seeks review of the EPA’s deadline extensions, which it published in the Federal Register on Dec. 31, 2025.

“Under the Clean Water Act, coal plants are supposed to be required to use the most modern and effective pollution control technology available before discharging toxic wastewater,” according to a Center for Biological Diversity press release. “The Trump action delays a 2024 Biden-era rule that would have brought nearly all power plants into full compliance with the Act no later than 2029 or required retirement of coal plants that could not meet the standards of the Act.”

The SELC’s lawsuit, filed in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on behalf of Appalachian Voices and the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League, will be part of a lottery process under the Clean Water Act to determine where all challenges to the EPA’s weakening of the rule will be heard, according to an SELC press release.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/F_X1hHmu1X7-mp1PNnsfWpgHt9JzeVLgb0lOVDnG7GE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE5MTc0OTY1X2FNajFOT1IuanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-23 11:58:38.737232

McKinley Gray, III",,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/top-wheel-conversation-north-carolina-labor-commissioner-luke-farley,"invited North Carolina Labor Commissioner Luke Farley to share how employers can navigate the shifting landscape of workplace regulations, along with his vision for the future.
If you favor one side or the other too much, everything gets thrown out of balance,” commented Commissioner Farley.
“I am an optimist,” and “see the folks that don’t look after their employees as a minority,” Commissioner Farley observed.
The structure of the North Carolina Department of Labor also impacts the type of services it provides to employees and employers.
“What this means is the federal government makes the regulations, but the elected Labor Commissioner enforces them…we’ve opted out of federal enforcement,” explained Commissioner Farley.","At its annual Employment Law Symposium, Ward and Smith, P.A. invited North Carolina Labor Commissioner Luke Farley to share how employers can navigate the shifting landscape of workplace regulations, along with his vision for the future.

Commissioner Farley is the youngest Labor Commissioner to be elected in a century and the youngest sitting member of North Carolina’s Council of State. His mission is to make North Carolina the safest place to work and the best place to do business – creating an environment where, in the words of North Carolina’s State Toast, “the weak grow strong and the strong grow great.”

Before entering public service, Commissioner Farley spent 14 years in private practice, focused on workplace safety law. A graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill and Wake Forest University School of Law, he is committed to protecting workers and creating more job opportunities across the state.

The discussion was moderated by Avery Locklear, a labor and employment attorney, and Will Oden, a North Carolina Board Certified Specialist in Employment Law.

“I am always impressed when someone leaves a thriving career to enter public service,” said Oden. “What inspired you to do that?”

“I spent thousands of hours building my practice and enjoyed being an attorney, but I felt there was a higher calling for me,” Commissioner Farley explained. “I wanted to do something with my life that would have a bigger impact on the state and society as a whole, and public service was the way to do that.” When discussing the role of Labor Commissioner, he stated that he “thought it was important for someone with real-world experience to be in the role,” and that he “could bring a unique insight to the position.”

Growth vs. Enforcement

The North Carolina Department of Labor has to maintain a delicate balance between enforcing regulations and the need to create an environment where the economy can thrive. “Businesses create jobs, but the workers keep businesses running. If you favor one side or the other too much, everything gets thrown out of balance,” commented Commissioner Farley.

Farley, drawing on his private and public sector experience, volunteered that many employers that fail to follow the rules and regulations do so due to a lack of awareness. “I am an optimist,” and “see the folks that don’t look after their employees as a minority,” Commissioner Farley observed.

The complexity of state and federal regulations presents an obstacle for many employers. “Especially for small businesses, many just don’t have the resources,” explained Commissioner Farley. “My role is to connect them to the resources they need and achieve compliance. We educate before we regulate, however, for the bad apples that are out there, we are not afraid to issue citations.”

Nuances of Public Sector Leadership

Commissioner Farley is looking to infuse the culture of the Department of Labor with a service-oriented approach. “The employees we protect and the businesses we regulate are essentially customers of the department,” he said. “The workers are protected by regulations, and the employers can benefit from taking advantage of our educational programs.”

Motivating employees can be a challenge, as unlike the private sector, performance-based incentives do not exist. Further, the process for terminating an employee can be extremely lengthy and bureaucratic.

“I’m working on instilling a sense of mission into our workforce. Part of this means being present for everyone, so I’ve been traveling around the state to chat with people,” added Farley. “This also means I want to know if our employers or stakeholders have an interaction that is less than professional.” Commissioner Farley then provided his personal cell phone number to audience members for that purpose.

The structure of the North Carolina Department of Labor also impacts the type of services it provides to employees and employers. North Carolina is one of only four states in the nation with an elected labor commissioner; it is the only independent Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) State Plan state with an elected labor commissioner.

“What this means is the federal government makes the regulations, but the elected Labor Commissioner enforces them…we’ve opted out of federal enforcement,” explained Commissioner Farley. “That’s great for our businesses, because instead of dealing with bureaucrats in Atlanta or Richmond, you can talk to me. You have my cell phone.”

Consultative Services

“I like the ‘educate before regulate’ idea,” said Locklear.

“The on-site consultative services program is the best tool we have at the Department to build safer workplaces. It’s free, and there’s a firewall between our investigators and the consultative services arm. Basically, we want people to feel comfortable using the service, so that it will not result in a compliance inspection,” Commissioner Farley added.

Employers can take advantage of the consultative services offering by inviting NCDOL to their workplace. While there, department staff evaluate the workplace to identify potential issues that are not up to standards. If an identified issue is corrected within a certain time frame, there is no citation.

“I know from my private practice that the idea of inviting the Department of Labor into the workplace may sound a little crazy,” joked Commissioner Farley. “But I think about it like you can do something the easy way or the hard way. OSHA can randomly show up and issue a citation if something is wrong, or you can be proactive and reach out to consultative services.”

Commissioner Farley is focused on partnering with businesses to remedy potential hazards: “We are more interested in building collaborative relationships instead of something more adversarial.”

Oden: “For employers that participate in the consultative services program, do they receive any sort of safe harbor protection?”

“There’s not a legal safe harbor if there is a violation that occurs after a consultative visit; however, there is a credit provided for citations and penalty amounts,” explained Commissioner Farley. Arranging for a consultative services visit is treated as a show of good faith. “We want to incentivize the use of these programs,” added Commissioner Farley.

In addition to on-site consultative services, Commissioner Farley mentioned the Carolina Star Program. The Carolina Star Program is a safety recognition and certification program that does provide safe harbor for employers that participate. Only 146 employers have earned the certification out of a total of around 300,000 employers across the state, making it the Department of Labor’s highest level of recognition.

Because the process to receive the certification is extremely rigorous, employers that make it into the program are exempt from random inspections. “This is great PR,” notes Commissioner Farley, “since it shows you value your employees and are going above and beyond to ensure their safety.”

Informal Conferences

However, if employers are ever investigated and subsequently cited by the Department of Labor, participating in an informal conference is another strategy that employers should consider. The term refers to an opportunity to have a discussion with the Department after receiving a citation.

“Avery and I always recommend doing this. If nothing else, it’s a great education,” advised Oden, and “[i]t helps with building relationships” with the Department personnel.

Commissioner Farley has a strong belief in the value of informal conferences: “I told my staff they should make all reasonable efforts to resolve matters in an informal conference, and that every settlement offer proposed by an employer should get a response.”

In the past, settlement offers would not receive a counter if the terms were too far away from what the Department viewed as reasonable. “We respect it if someone makes a settlement offer and responds with a counter,” Commissioner Farley commented. “Employers should take advantage of this opportunity, especially under my administration. It can help avoid costly litigation.”

Future Goals

Moving forward, Commissioner Farley would like the Department to be viewed as a fair, balanced agency – one that listens to the concerns of both employers and employees. Providing exceptional customer service to all stakeholders is another strategic objective.

Reducing fatality rates is paramount to Commissioner Farley and the Department. Currently, the number one cause of workplace fatalities are workers being struck by equipment, a statistic that Commissioner Farley believes may be due to the rise of warehousing and e-commerce in North Carolina.

“To reduce those injuries, we’re starting an alliance program with key industry partners,” Commissioner Farley explained.

Employers may be able to sleep more easily knowing it is unusual for the Department to share information with other agencies. “I don’t go out of my way to share and I don’t think OSHA matters should be tied up in some other matter,” mentioned Commissioner Farley. “Of course, if I have a legal obligation to provide information, I will provide it.”

Essential Guidance

Commissioner Farley’s advice for employers is to be cooperative, collaborative, and transparent. “If the OSHA investigators get the sense you’re hiding something, their approach to the matter will change,” he commented. “Our inspectors are passionate about workplace safety. They will push very hard to find something if they think you’re being evasive, and I don’t restrain them from that.”

Further, Commissioner Farley wants people to know the Department is focused on being collaborative and promoting common sense regulations: “My job is to protect workers, but workers are only workers if they have jobs.”

The proposal would create a 9.25% income tax for those earners.
Therefore, many small businesses would pay the higher rate under the proposal.
Gretchen Whitmer is spending the week in Davos, Switzerland, her office announced Monday, and she participated in a panel on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum with further speaking engagements scheduled later this week.
“I’m excited to tell Michigan’s story this week and build relationships directly with global leaders at the World Economic Forum.","A proposal to implement a 5% surcharge on high earners and send that money to schools would increase costs on small businesses, reduce jobs and shrink the state’s economy, an analysis from the Tax Foundation said Wednesday.

Invest In MI Kids is collecting signatures to put a graduated income tax on the ballot. Under the proposal, Michigan residents earning $500,000 per year if filing taxes individually and $1 million per year if filing jointly would pay an additional 5% in income taxes with the additional money going to schools.

The proposal would create a 9.25% income tax for those earners.

In an analysis released on Wednesday, the Tax Foundation said the higher income tax rate would reduce jobs by 43,000, cut wages by 1%, and reduce Michigan’s overall economy by $8.5 billion.

It would also lead to individuals leaving the state, the analysis said.

“As a tax on high earners, only a small share of Michigan’s population would pay the tax directly, as proponents are keen to point out. But the economic ramifications of such a high-rate tax would touch the lives of far more than those subject to the new rate,” the analysis says. “By adopting a 5% surtax and transitioning to a progressive income tax structure with a top rate of 9.25%, Michigan would immediately become an outlier regionally and nationally.”

The paper says because the vast majority of small businesses are pass-through businesses, the individual income tax is the tax that small businesses pay. Therefore, many small businesses would pay the higher rate under the proposal.

Further, the paper argues that a top marginal rate of 9.25% – higher in Detroit, Lansing,=and the 22 other cities with a local income tax – would undermine Michigan’s competitiveness in the region and the country.

“Most states are cutting income tax rates in response to greater economic mobility for both individuals and businesses, with the goal of growing their economies and encouraging in- rather than out-migration,” the paper says. “If Michigan instead chooses to follow the path of states like California, New Jersey, and New York, the result would be fewer jobs, lower pay, a higher cost of living, a smaller economy, and growing brain drain as people leave for better opportunities elsewhere.”

A joint statement from the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, Small Business Association of Michigan, Business Leaders for Michigan, Michigan Manufacturers Association, Grand Rapids Regional Chamber, Home Builders Association of Michigan, and Michigan Realtors said the business community supports investing in the state’s future, including schools.

“But how we fund those priorities and outcomes matters. This independent analysis shows the proposed graduated income tax would not stop with a small group of high earners – it would gravely affect small businesses that employ millions of Michiganders and have significant consequences for jobs, wages, and our state’s competitiveness,” the groups said in the statement. “Major tax changes should be evaluated based on real-world facts and impacts, not slogans.”

Jess Newman, Invest in MI Kids steering committee member, panned the Tax Foundation analysis in a statement, and said Michigan residents are fed up with the status quo.

“Michigan currently has a projected $1.1 billion gap in revenue, and Michigan schools stand to lose nearly $280 million in Federal investments. Millionaires currently have a lower effective tax rate than plumbers, cashiers, and teachers,” Newman said. “And Michigan students are paying the price. Families in our state are fed up with chief executive officers and politicians endlessly repeating the same baseless lines to try to protect Betsy DeVos’s fleet of yachts at the expense of our schools. Invest in MI Kids is a common sense solution that would raise over $1 billion in K-12 education by taxing less than 1% of the wealthiest individuals in Michigan. It’s 2026. No one is falling for the same billionaire-commissioned misinformation that gets trotted out every time the ultra wealthy are worried they might no longer get to pay a smaller share in taxes than everyone else.”

Touting the legal victory for House Republicans during a press conference on Wednesday, House Speaker Matt Hall said the administration needs to have a better accounting of how departments are spending money when it comes to work projects.

“The biggest problem here is the Whitmer administration doesn’t have a clue how much money there was. They’ don’t know what they’ve encumbered. They don’t know what they haven’t encumbered,” he said. “We’re in February, and they should have known this information in November when they gave it to us.”

Last Friday during the Court of Claims hearing for House v. Department of Technology, Management, and Budget et. al, the attorney for the state departments said that about 70% of the $645 million in work project funding disapproved by House Republicans was encumbered before Sept. 15, 2025, and the end of the fiscal year.

That would mean only about $200 million was left unencumbered, which is significantly less than what House Republicans thought it was.

House Republicans were granted a preliminary injunction that prevents departments from spending any of the money left unencumbered after Sept. 15.

The fact that the total was far less than what House Republicans thought it was is inconsequential, Hall, R-Richland Township, said.

“We need better financial practices,” he said. “The reason we needed a preliminary injunction is because, it’s pretty clear to me, they’re trying to shove as much of this money out of the door.”

Hall said that even $1 saved for the state would be worth it.

“And I think we can all agree it’s much more than $1,” Hall said. “So, whether it’s $100 million, or $600 million, whatever we can get from last year … I think it’s going to be better for the state.”

Hall went on to say that this was especially important in light of the January Consensus Estimating Revenue Conference, which projected lower revenue for the state in coming years.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is spending the week in Davos, Switzerland, her office announced Monday, and she participated in a panel on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum with further speaking engagements scheduled later this week.

Whitmer said the trip to the World Economic Forum is functioning as a trade mission to promote Michigan’s economic assets on the world stage.

“I’m excited to tell Michigan’s story this week and build relationships directly with global leaders at the World Economic Forum. On issues like innovation, workforce talent, and manufacturing, we are building a bright future and making a difference for Michiganders,” she said in a statement. “We’re creating opportunity and helping workers get the skills they need for good-paying jobs. We’re building vibrant communities with bustling main streets and downtowns. I’ll keep working with anyone to grow our economy, strengthen our defense and manufacturing industries, and help more families ‘make it’ in Michigan.”

Michigan Economic Development Corporation Chief Executive Officer Quentin Messer is also on the trip, which will include meetings with international investors, senior executives, and industry leaders aimed at “expanding company footprints in Michigan, attracting new foreign direct investment, and reinforcing Michigan’s position as a trusted partner in global defense and security supply chains.”

“These investment missions allow us to present our ‘Make It in Michigan’ economic development strategy to business decision-makers in critical markets and global government leaders who are actively considering places like Michigan to expand, innovate and invest,” Messer said in a statement. “With the continued federal policy focus on accelerating foreign direct investment into the US, Team Michigan’s presence in Switzerland and at WEF is about turning relationships into results for Michigan employers, workers, and communities.”

Whitmer participated in her first panel of the forum on Tuesday, which was a discussion on electric vehicle dominance alongside former General Motors Chief Economist Elaine Buckberg and business leaders from China and Brazil.

On Wednesday, Whitmer will join Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt in a forum of American governors. Later that day, she’s scheduled to have a press conference alongside American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, business leaders, and Beshear. Whitmer and the rest of the group are slated to “pledge to enable one million young people to acquire the skills needed to power the future of advanced manufacturing and supply chains by 2035.”

During the Tuesday panel, Whitmer said frequent policy changes at the federal level in the U.S. have made it more difficult for auto manufacturers to sustain the type of electric vehicle markets that are growing in Europe and Asia. When policies on incentives or tax subsidies for EVs can be rolled back or significantly altered with each new Congress or presidential administration, she said, manufacturers have a harder time maintaining consistency in their own contributions to the market.

“I think the back-and-forth policies at the national level have made it more difficult for industry to go all-in and ramp up the way that that some of the Chinese companies have been able to, and I think that’s something that we’re working to overcome,” she said. “But alas, I am the governor of Michigan, not the president of the United States, and so I think that that’s something we’re trying to de-risk but has been something that set us apart and made it harder in the states.”

Whitmer’s appearance on the panel at WEF comes just days after her address to the Detroit Auto Show on a chaotic year in U.S. trade policy, where she sharply criticized the way President Donald Trump has wielded tariffs during his first year back in office.

Whitmer echoed her statements from last week’s speech in Detroit when asked whether Trump’s tariffs have had the unintended indirect effect of benefiting China’s electric vehicle industry.

“There is no question that the chaotic policies that we’ve been seeing coming out of Washington DC have created a lot of hardship, not just in the auto industry, but for consumers in the United States, and obviously for relationships globally,” she said, stopping short of saying whether she believes the policies have had a positive effect on China while stifling American automakers. “I think there’s a lot of downsides to the way that they’ve been implemented in the last 12 months.”

The panelists discussed consumer culture narratives surrounding EVs and how a combination of buying trends and lackluster policy tools put the U.S. behind most of the rest of the world in electric vehicle production and sales. Buckberg said Americans’ driving habits and propensity for purchasing larger vehicles than much of the world has meant EV alternatives to the country’s most beloved cars are significantly more expensive than gas-powered standards – but new tech developments could see that price gap shrink in the coming years.

“In the U.S., we’re really spread out in our suburbs; we do more road trips because we have relatively poor rail, the use case is different. People want bigger vehicles, bigger ranges, and that just means closing that price gap between EVs and (internal combustion engine vehicles) is hard, but I think it’s the technology,” Buckberg said, noting new battery technology that’s hitting the market this year. “That’s what will be game changing … that technology change makes EVs a more perfect substitute for the internal combustion engine vehicle.”

Once prices and policy in the U.S. catch up with its automaking counterparts around the world, the experts said, the country could truly be competitive with China when it comes to EV production and use – if consumer attitudes shift alongside the industry.

When asked if she drives an EV, Whitmer laughed.

“I haven’t driven in eight years,” she said. “(But) yes, (an EV or a hybrid is) going to be the next car that I buy when I’m back to being a private citizen next year.”

The introduction of artificial intelligence in the workplace is going to “cure the illness of being unproductive,” one economics expert said at the Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference on Friday.

The only thing stopping rises in GDP and increases in work output, said Justin Wolfers, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, is the adoption of AI technology without focusing on its shortcomings and the unstable regulatory environment.

The improvement in productivity if companies adopted AI use widely could increase by around 56%, while typically, productivity gains are only improving 1% per year nationally, Wolfers said.

In case studies in the workplace, AI use made tasks 56% faster to complete and professional writing assignments were completed 40% faster. Some studies, according to Wolfers, have found 80% of U.S. workers could have more than 10% of their tasks affected, while 50% of U.S. workers could have more than 50% of their tasks affected.

Other case studies have found that the use of AI for 20% of all tasks could result in a 1.2% reduction in labor costs and a 0.66% in production costs, Wolfers said.

While studies range across formulas of how many tasks companies could utilize with AI, the average productivity growth in a company is around 3.1% and the effects on U.S. gross domestic product in 10 years’ time is 12%.

Wolfers said if AI follows other technological advances, it will take time to see the benefits play out.

“I think people are talking as if this is something that plays out in a very short period of time,” Wolfers said. “History suggests that’s a little bit optimistic, but there are reasons to be optimistic about this.”

However, there are still policy issues that remain around AI including chip shortages in manufacturing, energy bottlenecks due to the high energy burden data centers, and the lack of regulation slowing the adoption of AI.

Only 10% of businesses across the country have adopted AI, and 14% intend to. Michigan is slower than the national average, with 7.9% adopting AI use, and 12.4% intending to.

When it comes to Michigan’s largest industries, manufacturing and health care, Wolfers said health care is one of the only industries moving quickly towards AI integration, and modern manufacturing is seeing automation moves, changing the face of the workforce to one of more skilled labor.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Michigan-State-Capitol.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 12:58:14.531746

""Let’s be clear, this bill is about funding FEMA disaster relief, about stopping child trafficking and the spread of fentanyl in our communities and strengthening our cybersecurity and law enforcement,"" Gillen said. She also supported the immigration enforcement ""and common sense guardrails"" that are in the bill.

A bundle of three other 2026 spending measures was also passed in the House Thursday — and all four now await Senate approval to keep government funded through Sept. 30. The four bills total about $1.2 trillion in spending.

The Homeland Security bill was, like the others, negotiated in bipartisan fashion.

The bill reduces funding ICE and removal operations by $115 million, while keeping the overall budget for the agency flat at about $10 billion. It also reduces the number of ICE detention beds by 5,500 and cuts Border Patrol funding by $1.8 billion.But many Democrats and their top leaders, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-Brooklyn), demanded broader cuts and guardrails on ICE since a federal agent’s killing of Renee Good in Minnesota, prompting mass demonstrations and tense standoffs between agents and protesters.

Those steps include preventing U.S. citizens from being detained or deported, including a judicial warrant requirement, a prohibition on the use of excessive force, enhanced agent training, a body camera mandate and a mask ban.

""We will continue to support FEMA, we will continue to support the Coast Guard, we will certainly continue to support the TSA,"" Jeffries said. ""But we are not in the position to support the lawless behavior of ICE to use taxpayer dollars to brutalize American citizens.""

Jeffries declined to criticize Democrats who planned to vote for the bill, however. ""You get unanimity when you are a cult,"" he said. ""And that’s what you have on the other side.""",https://suozzi.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-23 17:59:31.479687

Partnership with the EU can support India’s ambition to become a global clean-energy manufacturing hub. It will also help India diversify its export markets, while strengthening domestic value chains across clean tech supply chains.

The economic opportunity is substantial. India’s clean-technology market could reach USD90–135 billion by 2030 across solar, wind, batteries, hydrogen, electric vehicles and grid equipment.

These benefits can be catalysed by a robust EU-India partnership that allows each side to play to their existing technological and sectoral strengths, creating a stable framework for trade and investment that supports jobs and growth.

“Over the past year, the energy department individually reviewed our entire loan portfolio to ensure the responsible investment of taxpayer dollars,” said Secretary Chris Wright. “We found more dollars were rushed out the door of the Loan Programs Office in the final months of the Biden administration than had been disbursed in over 15 years. President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy. Thanks to the Working Families Tax Cut, the newly re-structured Energy Dominance Financing is playing a key role in fulfilling that mission.”

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Jan. 23, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- With Winter Storm Fern expected to move into the Carolinas this weekend, Duke Energy crews and support teams are completing their preparations and urging customers to finalize their own storm plans.

Forecasts point to dangerous travel conditions and outages that could last several days in the hardest‑hit areas.

Our view

Rick Canavan, Duke Energy storm director:

""Forecast models continue to shift, and both precipitation type and amounts may change as the storm approaches.""

""We're making our final preparations to ensure our 18,000 crew members have everything they need to assess damage, clear trees and restore power as soon as conditions are safe.""

""Freezing rain is going to be our enemy over the days ahead. It will build up on tree branches until the weight causes them to break – bringing down power lines and poles. The freezing rain and ice will also make roads extremely difficult for our crews to navigate, slowing power restoration efforts.""

""Winter storms like this can create serious challenges. I urge customers to ready themselves and their families for outages that could extend into next week – and check in on neighbors to make sure they're prepared, too.""

The latest

Meteorologists continue tracking Fern as it approaches from the west. Snow, sleet or freezing rain could begin as early as Saturday, with ice accumulation posing the greatest risk of extended outages.

Ice buildup of a quarter inch can bring trees and branches onto power lines. A half inch or more can pull down the lines themselves.

Tree and vegetation crews are completing targeted trimming today to help reduce outage risks ahead of the storm.

More than 18,000 restoration workers will be in position across the Carolinas by Friday night.

These include Duke Energy and contracted lineworkers, vegetation specialists and storm support staff from 27 U.S. states and Canada.

Duke Energy serves about 4.7 million electric customers in the Carolinas – about 3.8 million in North Carolina and nearly 860,000 in South Carolina.

What Duke Energy is doing

Tracking the latest updates from internal meteorologists.

Positioning crews, equipment and materials in locations that may experience the most severe weather.

Standing up 22 basecamps across the Carolinas where out‑of‑state crews park their trucks, pick up supplies and equipment, eat meals and board buses to nearby hotels where they sleep.

Preparing to deploy damage assessors, lineworkers and vegetation crews once travel conditions allow.

Trimming trees and vegetation in targeted areas to reduce potential damage to power lines.

Coordinating closely with state and local emergency management officials.

What customers should do right now

Review emergency plans and supplies: Charge phones, gather flashlights and extra batteries and take steps to stay ready.

Use the American Red Cross Emergency app: The app, sponsored by the Duke Energy Foundation, offers emergency checklists, maps of open shelters and tools to monitor multiple locations for weather alerts.

Download or update the Duke Energy app: Available through the Apple Store or Google Play.

Confirm your Duke Energy account login: Log in through My Account or the mobile app to check contact information and communications preferences.

Sign up for outage alerts: Receive updates by text, phone or email.

Know how to report an outage: Report online, through the mobile app, by texting OUT to 57801 or by calling 800.POWERON (800.769.3766).

What customers should know

Safety hazards: Stay away from downed power lines and storm debris. Use generators safely and follow the manufacturer's instructions.

Grid improvements: Upgrades such as stronger poles, undergrounding and self‑healing technology will help reduce some outages and speed restoration.

Extended outages remain possible: Freezing rain and ice can cause dangerous road conditions, which can slow repairs – especially in rural or heavily treed areas.

Restoration will begin as soon as conditions allow: Crews will assess damage, prioritize critical facilities and restore power as quickly and safely as possible.

In some areas, restoration may be delayed due to blocked roads, hidden damage or hazardous travel conditions.

,Indiana American Energy ,2026-01-23 15:02:09+00:00,CNN,Big tech is increasingly promising to pay for spiking power costs. But there's not much to enforce it,Ella Nilsen,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/climate/big-tech-warren-electricity-data-centers,"Around the country, certain areas where data centers were built saw electricity costs jump as much as 267% compared to five years ago, a 2025 Bloomberg News analysis found.
“These commitments do not explain how Big Tech companies – not American consumers – will bear the full cost of data centers,” Warren said in a statement.
It is exceedingly difficult to know exactly how much big tech companies are actually paying electrical utilities for the power they consume.
That would essentially ensure the world’s largest companies pay for their future power needs, and the region could depend on that money to pay for power for a long period of time.
“I think that a lot of parties were in denial about this; particularly the data center industry was absolutely in denial about this.”","As an electricity crunch drives bills higher around the country, big tech companies building power-hungry data centers are increasingly offering to pay for more of the energy they consume, so everyday people don’t get stuck with the bill.

At least, that is the message from seven large tech companies in new letters responding to three Senate Democrats’ investigation into how data center buildout nationwide is impacting electricity prices. But while these companies can make commitments, there are few regulations to ensure those promises are kept.

In mid-Atlantic states especially, a sudden boom in data center growth combined with a lack of new power to supply them has caused sharp electricity bill spikes in states including Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. Around the country, certain areas where data centers were built saw electricity costs jump as much as 267% compared to five years ago, a 2025 Bloomberg News analysis found.

Seven companies, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Coreweave, Equinix and Digital Realty, responded to questions from the senators on how many data centers they had, how much power those facilities needed, and how they plan to procure and pay for that power.

Some companies made commitments to foot the bill. In its letter to Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Google said it would pay for all of the electricity it would use to power its fleet of data centers and would make changes to how it manages and pays for energy use when the grid’s power usage is at its highest, a time period when data center power use can drive up prices for other customers.

Similarly, Meta said it pays for the “full costs for energy used by our data centers” as well as funding “new and upgraded local infrastructure,” and adding new power to the grid, in a statement to CNN.

“We’ve been committed to these principles for many years and welcome recent pushes from other companies,” Ryan Daniels, a Meta spokesperson, told CNN.

Microsoft made similar commitments last week.

In addition, several other tech companies wrote that they would support being put into a different class of electricity ratepayers that would be charged more for power than residents or other smaller commercial customers.

But the letters, provided first to CNN, offer few specifics on how exactly companies will implement these promises. Data companies are optimistic. Representatives from both Digital Realty and Equinix told CNN that they were looking forward to collaborations with elected officials, as well as the public and private sector, that would make positive change happen.

But details remain thin. “These commitments do not explain how Big Tech companies – not American consumers – will bear the full cost of data centers,” Warren said in a statement.

It is exceedingly difficult to know exactly how much big tech companies are actually paying electrical utilities for the power they consume. That’s because there are often secret contracts inked between utilities and data centers, rather than a public rate case, said Ari Peskoe, director of the Harvard Law School’s electricity law initiative.

“The devil is really in the details here,” and consumers don’t have much protection with the current system, Peskoe told CNN.

Warren and the other senators argued in statements that even after companies’ responses, there are a lot of unknowns, including how much they are paying towards the massive electrical infrastructure that connects data centers to the grid.

“If these companies are serious about paying their fair share, at a minimum they’d be more transparent about their data centers’ operations instead of forcing local communities to sign NDAs,” Warren said in a statement.

Google, in its letter, wrote that it was signing binding contracts that would ensure it sticks to the agreement to pay for its power, as well as paying for new infrastructure that is “directly attributable to our growth, protecting communities and ratepayers from bearing the burden.”

Likewise, Amazon wrote the company would “pay the full cost of the electricity we use and make substantial investments in new generation and transmission infrastructure that benefit all ratepayers,” but did not detail exactly how it would determine how much to pay for transmission infrastructure.

While there is a patchwork of states trying to adopt rules around data center companies paying higher electricity rates, there is currently no federal equivalent.

Van Hollen, whose home state of Maryland has seen neighboring Virginia’s massive data center buildout show up in residential electricity bills, has introduced a federal bill requiring companies to cover their energy costs.

“Big tech companies are finally beginning to acknowledge that their data centers are saddling consumers with higher electricity costs and straining our power grid – but they still refuse to take full responsibility for these problems they are creating,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “Without action from Congress, they will continue to evade accountability.”

Under the aggressively pro- AI and data center Trump administration, federal policy so far has been aimed at getting data centers built as fast as possible, even bypassing state and local laws meant to discourage data center growth.

However, there are signs that the public outcry over costs has reached the White House. Last week, President Donald Trump teased an announcement from Microsoft that it would cover the cost of its electricity and help update the grid, acknowledging the public concern over high electricity prices.

“We will have much to announce in the coming weeks to ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their POWER consumption, in terms of higher Utility bills,” Trump said in a Truth Social post last week.

On Friday, a group of northeastern governors and the Trump administration announced they were asking PJM, the country’s largest electrical grid operator, to hold an emergency power auction focused on getting big tech companies locked into 15-year contracts to pay for the power costs to feed their data centers. That would essentially ensure the world’s largest companies pay for their future power needs, and the region could depend on that money to pay for power for a long period of time.

Peskoe said it’s a sign that companies and the administration are taking the issue seriously – but it’s no guarantee progress will happen.

“What I think is positive is they are acknowledging there is a problem here that needs to be solved,” he said. “I think that a lot of parties were in denial about this; particularly the data center industry was absolutely in denial about this.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-12-05t145744z-1108987844-rc274ha9nd8h-rtrmadp-3-aws-20260122163628306.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-23 10:59:51.030070

,North Carolina and Evs,2026-01-23 15:00:53+00:00,News From The States,Newsom wants $200M for EV rebates. Experts say it's not enough to fix California's slump,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/newsom-wants-200m-ev-rebates-experts-say-its-not-enough-fix-californias-slump,"The Newsom administration’s budget proposal — rolled out after President Donald Trump dismantled federal electric vehicle incentives and blocked California’s clean-vehicle mandate — would cover rebates for only about 20% of last year’s EV sales.
But the limits of the governor’s $200 million EV proposal become clear in the numbers.
Nationally, the loss of the uncapped, popular federal tax credit has accelerated manufacturer write-downs and sales declines as automakers adjusted to a tougher EV market.
The Newsom administration will likely lay out the details of its proposal in a draft bill tied to the state budget.
As the state moved from budget surplus to deficit, the Newsom administration and lawmakers never adequately funded it, advocates say.","California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s $200 million plan to revive the state’s stalling electric-car market faces several fundamental problems: It isn’t enough money, it may not reach consumers quickly enough and the state hasn’t decided whether to subsidize – or exclude – wealthier buyers.

The Newsom administration’s budget proposal — rolled out after President Donald Trump dismantled federal electric vehicle incentives and blocked California’s clean-vehicle mandate — would cover rebates for only about 20% of last year’s EV sales. That CalMatters estimate assumes the state follows the model of the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which offered rebates of up to $7,500 toward some electric and hybrid cars before the California Air Resources Board ended it in 2023.

So far the administration has released few details about the proposal, leaving experts and lawmakers circling a basic question: Who should get the money?

“It is better than nothing, which is what a lot of things are getting right now,” said Mars Wu, a senior program manager with the Greenlining Institute, which advocates for investments in communities of color. “How far that $200 million goes really depends on how the program is going to be structured.”

A small incentive in a huge market

California’s electric car market is one the governor celebrates on the world stage. While at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland earlier this week, Newsom highlighted that California has surpassed 2.5 million clean car sales, saying the achievement came after the state “invested in this future when others said it was impossible.” He framed the number against a modest goal to get 1.5 million clean cars on the road, set more than a decade ago.

California officials remain confident the state’s policies will succeed in pushing the transition to electric cars. Even as sales have slipped, EVs will drive future electricity demand, according to a long-term forecast approved Wednesday by the California Energy Commission.

But the limits of the governor’s $200 million EV proposal become clear in the numbers. A CalMatters analysis found the incentive would cover only one out of every five EV sales, assuming similar sales to last year, and the same average rebate level as the state’s last mass-market rebate program.

Advocates are also raising concerns about how quickly the money can get to consumers. Christopher Chavez, deputy policy director at the Coalition for Clean Air, a California-focused advocacy group, warned that the proposed rebates may not reach consumers until 2027, given how long it takes to approve the budget and to set up a new program. If the funding only lasts a year, the program would leave out buyers who need time to plan or save, he added.

“It’s not going to be enough — just to be blunt about it,” Chavez said. “Two-hundred million for a mass-market program will go very quickly.”

The proposal comes as the latest sales numbers show an electric car market slump. Nationally, the loss of the uncapped, popular federal tax credit has accelerated manufacturer write-downs and sales declines as automakers adjusted to a tougher EV market.

In California, the slowdown has pushed the state further off course from its climate goals: even before Congress and President Trump blocked its vehicle mandate last year, California was struggling to hit a requirement that 35% of new cars sold in 2026 be zero-emission. Last year electric and other zero emission cars made up about 23% of new car sales in 2025, down from roughly 25% the year prior, California Energy Commission data shows.

Sales slowed down dramatically at the end of the year, when EVs and other clean cars accounted for just under 19% of new car sales in the fourth quarter of 2025 — the lowest quarterly share since mid-2022.

The Newsom administration will likely lay out the details of its proposal in a draft bill tied to the state budget. The Clean Vehicle Rebate Program would be “the foundation we’d be building from,” wrote Lindsey Buckley, an air board spokesperson, in an email, adding that the goal would be to deploy the $200 million “as soon as possible to support the market.”

Buckley said it is “speculative” to predict the impact of a new EV incentive or how quickly the money would reach consumers.

With limited funding, advocates say the question of who qualifies for the rebates becomes critical.

“What we really don’t want to see is that money going towards higher-income folks for whom it would just be kind of like a bonus coupon,” said Wu, of the Greenlining Institute.

Fast or targeted: lawmakers face a choice

How the Newsom administration and lawmakers design the state’s next EV incentive will determine how quickly the air board can deliver rebates — and whether the program avoids recreating past inequities. California ended its last, broad EV rebate program in 2023 over concerns it benefited higher-income buyers. Targeting lower-income drivers delivers the greatest benefits because they tend to drive the most, and switching to EVs saves them money on fuel and maintenance, said Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley.

But income-based “means testing” can slow programs down, requiring income verification and layers of bureaucracy that eat up funding and discourage participation.

That’s a critique of one California program aimed at low-income buyers, Clean Cars 4 All, which offers grants to help drivers trade in older, more polluting vehicles for cleaner alternatives. As the state moved from budget surplus to deficit, the Newsom administration and lawmakers never adequately funded it, advocates say.

Lawmakers provided no new funding in the 2024–25 budget year, and in the current budget cycle, the state provided only about $45 million through a combination of funds and one-time budget actions, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office. That falls well short of a sustained, long-term commitment, said Chavez, of the Coalition for Clean Air.

“It’s become — especially as the budget has become more difficult — more of a secondary priority, which is unfortunate,” he said.

Competing ideas, no clear consensus

California’s EV problem has no shortage of potential solutions — only disagreement over which one to choose.

Some policy analysts argue the state should focus on first-time adoption. A recent brief from Atlas Public Policy found that incentives are most cost-effective when they bring a household’s first electric vehicle into the garage — because once a family owns one EV, it is far more likely to buy another.

Elkind, of UC Berkeley, said a simpler approach — a point-of-sale rebate tied to lower-priced vehicles — would be easier for the air board to administer while avoiding subsidies for high-income buyers.

“If it’s just tied to the price of the vehicle, that’s pretty straightforward,” Elkind said.

Some lawmakers told CalMatters the air board should tightly target the rebates to communities most affected by pollution and transportation costs. State Senator Ben Allen, a Democrat from El Segundo, said incentives should focus on communities that suffer the most from air pollution, “so as to increase the bang for air quality buck.”

Senator Josh Becker, a Democrat from Menlo Park, said new incentives should go to the people “who are most burdened by transportation costs and drive the most.”

Fewer easy EV buyers in California

California needs to design its next rebate program well because its most eager EV buyers are gone and the state now faces a harder, more price-sensitive market, experts said.

“California is one of the first states to sort of get into that mainstream market: and it’s a harder market to convert,” said Loren McDonald, a Danville-based EV analyst. Potential buyers now expect seamless charging and balk at waiting 30 to 40 minutes. They also are not keen to install home chargers or pay more upfront. Many, he says, stick with traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.

“We burned through the innovators and the early adopters — those people who want to save the planet, those people who make good money,” McDonald said.

Investors see Bloom's solid oxide fuel cell as a robust source of power for the surging energy demand caused by the expansion of AI data centers. Bloom's cells operate independently of traditional power grids. They are also highly efficient, emitting only heat and clean water, according to the company.

↑ X NOW PLAYING How The AI Arms Race Is Redefining The Energy Sector In 2026

In its earlier iterations Bloom Energy was viewed as a green energy company, with promising tech, but it struggled with the same skepticism from investors as other climate stocks. However, the continued proliferation of AI has seen it find a new source of demand for its fuel cells.

Now, Bloom Energy is rapidly scaling its manufacturing capacity from 1 gigawatt currently to two gigawatts by the end of 2026, with its existing footprint capable of holding up to five gigawatts of capacity. Analysts see Bloom Energy, and its growing capacity, as a major player in powering data centers amid an expected energy shortfall.

""The company is viewed as an attractive, highly reliable time-to-power solution that will drive rapid volume growth, offering one of the fastest paths to power with the lowest execution risk for AI and data center customers,"" Morgan Stanley analysts noted on Jan. 18.

Bloom Energy did not respond to a request for comment.

Accelerating Profit Growth On These Tailwinds

In late October, the San Jose, Calif.,-based fuel cell manufacturer easily topped third-quarter earnings as revenue swelled 57% vs. a year earlier to $519 million. Adjusted earnings were 15 cents a share vs. a 1-cent loss a year earlier.

Bloom Energy is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings and revenue in early February. Analysts forecast earnings declining 30% to 30 cents per share with sales totaling $647.3 million, up 13.2% vs. a year ago, according to FactSet. However, for the full year, Bloom Energy profit is predicted to grow 93% to 54 cents a share with revenue increasing 30% to $1.91 billion.

""This seminal year for Bloom positions us for an even stronger 2026 and beyond, with higher growth and more profitability,"" Bloom Energy founder and Chief Executive KR Sridhar said on the Oct. 28 third-quarter earnings call.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Sridhar added there are three major tailwinds that Bloom is benefiting from today that have ""created a once-in-a-generation opportunity for us to become the global standard for on-site power generation.""

The CEO said these tailwinds are the AI buildout, federal policy that is pushing the U.S. to win the AI race and the fact that Bloom Energy's product innovation is ""advancing at a pace more akin to semiconductor evolution than to that of traditional industrial products.""

""Bloom is now positioned to become the standard in on-site power, which many of us believe will be a $1 trillion market,"" Sridhar said.

With this backdrop, analysts expect Bloom Energy's 2026 earnings to soar 293% compared to 2024 levels. Through 2030, the Street view has annual profit growing at a steady pace, hitting $6.36 per share at the beginning of the next decade.

Capitalizing On AI Data Center Deals

In 2025, Bloom Energy inked major deals with Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), Oracle and the data center company Equinix (EQIX).

In October, Bloom Energy announced that Brookfield Asset Management will invest up to $5 billion to deploy its fuel cells at AI data centers. Bloom Energy and Brookfield are actively collaborating on the design and delivery of AI factories globally. Brookfield is one of the world's largest AI infrastructure investors and has already invested $50 billion in AI opportunities while tripling the size of its AI strategy over the next three years.

Best IBD 50 Stocks To Watch

CEO Sridhar says Bloom Energy will be the preferred on-site provider for Brookfield's infrastructure portfolio of AI factories, data center operators, corporate facilities and other factories.

The announcement with Brookfield came after Bloom Energy cut a deal in late July with Oracle to supply fuel cell technology for that hyperscaler's AI data centers. Bloom Energy successfully delivered volumes to its first Oracle site within 55 days of the deal announcement vs. a 90-day target commitment.

Bloom Energy Stock Performance

Propelled by these deals, Bloom Energy stock surged nearly 300% last year. Through Jan. 21, Bloom shares have soared 73.3% in the 2026 stock market, leading the way in Investor's Business Daily's Energy-Alternative/Other industry group. The group's 54 stocks have collectively advanced 11% so far in 2026, good for 81st out of the 197 industry groups ranked by IBD.

Bloom Energy is currently trading near record highs and is just below a buy zone from a cup base with a traditional 147.86 buy point, according to MarketSurge charts.

In the past 12 months, dating back to Jan. 21, 2025, Bloom Energy is up almost 485%. For comparison, in that time frame Nvidia is up 30% while Oracle has gained less than 1%. Fellow Big Tech hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are up 3.6% and a fraction, respectively, since Jan. 21, 2025.

Bloom Energy stock has a nearly perfect 98 Composite Rating. The AI data center energy play also has a 99 Relative Strength Rating and an 80 EPS Rating.

""We have strong traction across all channels of the AI ecosystem,"" Sridhar said on the third-quarter earnings call. ""As we continue to penetrate new geographies and verticals, success builds upon itself and should make each new market entry easier than the first. The opportunity is vast and we are still in the early innings.""

Bloom Energy Starts 2026 With A Bang

The strong Bloom stock move to start 2026 comes as a Wyoming data center project won a key approval earlier this month.

Laramie County commissioners on Jan. 6 reportedly approved site plans for a 1.8-gigawatt data center in Wyoming. Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro wrote on Jan. 8 that the proposed project includes 900 megawatts of power generated by fuel cells, with Bloom Energy named as the potential fuel cell provider.

Clean Energy Stock Up 410% In 2025 Jumps After Earnings Beat

The project is expected to start construction in the first quarter of 2026. Arcaro said that 900 megawatts would equate to around $3 billion in product revenue for Bloom Energy vs. the expected 2025 product revenue of $1.45 billion.

Importantly, an unregulated subsidiary of American Electric Power (AEP) executed an unconditional purchase agreement on Jan. 4 to acquire a substantial portion of its option for solid oxide fuel cells to develop and construct a fuel generation facility for about $2.65 billion, according to an AEP regulatory filing. The filing showed there is a 20-year offtake agreement with a ""high investment grade third party consumer"" for 100% of the output of the fuel cell generation facility planned for Cheyenne.

American Electric Power previously partnered with Bloom Energy to deploy up to 1 gigawatt of Bloom's solid oxide fuel cell generators, primarily to power Amazon Web Services data centers.

Analysts' Take On Bloom Energy

Following American Electric Power's key regulatory filing, Clear Street raised its price target on Bloom Energy to 68 from 58, keeping a hold rating on shares. The firm noted that Bloom Energy sales ""should benefit strongly"" this year from a recent customer order of solid oxide fuel cells for a power generation plant in Wyoming.

Meanwhile, Evercore analysts wrote on Jan. 8 that the American Electric disclosure is a ""meaningful positive"" for Bloom Energy as it sheds light on the demand for its product. The firm has an outperform rating and a 152 price target on Bloom shares.

On Jan. 18, Morgan Stanley analysts also compiled a list of 18 ""high conviction thematic stock ideas"" across the U.S. and Latin America. Bloom Energy is one of the stocks.

Morgan Stanley sees Bloom Energy as playing a ""pivotal role in the future of energy, particularly as an enabler of AI infrastructure and a solution to the emerging power bottleneck for data centers.""

According to Morgan Stanley research, there could be a power shortfall of around 45 gigawatts for U.S. data centers through 2028. This is likely to lead to a substantial ramp in data center power demand with lengthy grid interconnection delays with some regions already experiencing five- to seven-year wait times, Morgan Stanley forecasts.

""As grid interconnection times lengthen and traditional power access becomes more constrained, Bloom's fuel cell technology represents a scarce resource in the market alongside U.S.-based solar panels and gas turbines, positioning it as a key beneficiary of the structural shift in how power is delivered to energy-intensive applications,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.

“Farm groups and Midwest ethanol advocates blasted the decision to form a task force instead of passing legislation, calling it a blow to American farmers already stung by low prices, uncertain global trade, and a lack of clarity over U.S. biofuels policies,” Reuters reported. “Farm interests want year-round sales of E15 – which has higher ethanol content than the E10 now widely available at the pumps. The move would boost demand for corn, ethanol’s primary ingredient. Oil refiners have resisted increased biofuel blending mandates in the past, citing higher costs.”

“E15 sales are currently limited during summer months due to air quality regulations,” Reuters reported. “The compromise deal would establish a so-called ‘E-15 Rural Domestic Energy Council’ to investigate topics including the sale of E15, U.S. refining capacity, biofuel blending credits and other issues and to recommend legislation by mid-February, according to a copy of the draft provision seen by Reuters.”

Ethanol, Farmer Groups Outraged

Agri-Pulse’s Kim Chipman, Oliver Ward, and Lydia Johnson reported that “ethanol industry backers expressed anger and frustration Thursday after House leadership decided to create a study council for biofuel issues rather than including a year-round E15 provision in a fiscal 2026 spending package.”

“‘We are very disappointed that Congress has again failed to adopt a simple technical fix that would have made lower-cost, American-made E15 available to consumers nationwide all year long,’ Renewable Fuels Association President Geoff Cooper said, adding that a compromise deal had been broadly backed by farmers, ethanol makers, large oil refiners and several small ones,” Chipman, Ward and Johnson reported.

“‘Congress picked foreign refiners over American farmers and drivers today. What a travesty,’ said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor,” according to Chipman, Ward and Johnson’s reporting. “‘E15 delivers cost savings for consumers and generates long-term demand for American agriculture. These have been the facts during the 12-year-long debate over the simple act of allowing consumers the choice to buy a better value fuel year-round. Failure to act will now lead to farmers missing out on a critical market during the worst farm crisis in 40 years.’”

Progressive Farmer’s Chris Clayton reported that “the president of the National Corn Growers Association vented farmers’ frustrations Thursday after learning House leadership not only prevented year-round E15 from being included in a must-pass funding bill, but instead created a council of House members charged with reexamining the Renewable Fuels Standard and helping oil refiners.”

“‘Corn growers are disgusted, disappointed and disillusioned that after spending years of calling for passage of E15, Congress has again punted, and it has done so in a spectacularly weak and offensive way,’ said Jed Bower, president of NCGA and an Ohio farmer,” Clayton reported.

Some Lawmakers Express Optimism

“Still, some Midwest Republicans expressed optimism about the outcome in the House,” Agri-Pulse’s Chipman, Ward and Johnson reported. “Iowa GOP Rep. Zach Nunn, who led the push for the E15 provision, told reporters that the measure’s backers have a ‘firm commitment from the speaker’ to work with the Trump administration ‘to be able to make sure that this is a priority to be able to get done in February.’”

“‘We’ve been working for three years on the farm bill to make this happen, and it’s something that has to pass before March 1, when both growers, blenders and the American public need to have an answer on this,’ said Nunn,” according to Chipman, Ward and Johnson’s reporting.

“Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., called the study council ‘a huge step forward,’” Chipman, Ward and Johnson reported. “‘We’re going to have the House on record that E15 needs to be done by Feb. 25.

The decarbonization of California’s power grid has been driven by huge growth in solar and battery capacity in recent years.
Much of this fossil fuel displacement is happening in the afternoon and evening hours when electricity demand is highest.
Batteries that charge up on abundant solar power during the day now discharge during these evening peaks when natural gas peaker plants would otherwise fire up.
California’s real test will come when its electricity demand begins to rise again—which is likely in the near future.","Earlier this month, I wrote a story about how electricity emissions rose in the US last year, amid rising electricity demand. The growth in emissions was widespread. Power plants pumped out more carbon pollution everywhere from Texas to the Northeast.

But there was one notable exception: In California, carbon emissions fell by 8%.

The decarbonization of California’s power grid has been driven by huge growth in solar and battery capacity in recent years. The state has added more than 300 large-scale solar projects and more than 200 large-scale battery projects in the last 5 years, according to Cleanview’s project tracker. Small-scale solar and battery adoption has also been significant.

The growth of solar and batteries is now cutting into the state’s fossil fuel power plant generation. Since 2023, natural gas generation has fallen by 10%.

Much of this fossil fuel displacement is happening in the afternoon and evening hours when electricity demand is highest. Batteries that charge up on abundant solar power during the day now discharge during these evening peaks when natural gas peaker plants would otherwise fire up.

The state still has a long way to go in its efforts to reach 100% clean power, but the trends are going in the right direction. That wasn’t true as recently as just a few years ago. The state’s electricity emissions were stubbornly flat for much of the last decade.

The growth of solar and batteries wasn’t the only factor behind California’s decline in emissions last year though. Falling electricity demand also helped. Homes and businesses consumed 2.4% less electricity in 2025 than they did the year before.

Here the state was an outlier, too. On every other major US electric grid—in Texas, in the Midwest, in the Northeast—electricity demand rose. In Arizona, it rose by a staggering 8%. That demand growth, which was driven in many places by data centers, meant that coal and gas plants had to run more frequently.

In California there’s been very little growth in data centers or other industrial sources of electricity demand. The state’s high electricity prices and slow permitting process have made it unattractive to hyperscale data center developers. (Slow permitting has also plagued renewable projects for decades, slowing the energy transition).

Here’s a map showing all the planned data centers in the US from our project tracker at Cleanview. Note how few are in California relative to places like Texas, the Midwest, and the Mid-Atlantic.

California’s real test will come when its electricity demand begins to rise again—which is likely in the near future.

The state has ambitious plans to electrify its transportation and buildings, putting millions of electric vehicles on the road and heat pumps in homes. That electrification will be essential to cutting emissions economy-wide, but it will also mean more demand on the grid.

Once demand starts climbing again, California will face the same challenge every other US grid struggled with last year. To decarbonize in that environment will require deploying clean energy even faster.

Baton Rouge, La. – Governor Jeff Landry today unveiled the Whole-of-Louisiana Energy Strategy, a comprehensive framework for aligning state agencies, regional and local partners, regulators, utilities, and private industry around a shared vision to unleash statewide energy dominance and elevate Louisiana’s standing as a national and global energy leader.

“Energy has always shaped Louisiana’s economy, and under President Trump’s leadership, it is once again driving America’s future. With record investment and the creation of high-wage jobs, energy is at the center of Louisiana’s economic momentum. This Whole-of Louisiana Energy Strategy brings clarity and coordination to the assets that make our state exceptional, while reinforcing our shared commitment with the President to American global energy dominance and long-term opportunity for our citizens.”

Governor Jeff Landry

The strategy builds on the unprecedented economic growth under the leadership of Governor Landry and focuses on eight statewide priorities intended to accelerate investment and innovation, position communities for long-term growth, and unleash Louisiana’s full energy potential:

Expand Louisiana’s industrial base and drill, baby, drill

Win global investments to grow local communities

Accelerate market-driven infrastructure development

Deliver strategic energy solutions

Align state services with the speed of business

Strengthen community confidence in major investments

Unleash energy innovation

Establish Louisiana as the nation’s industrial power leader

Statewide priorities are supported by Regional Opportunity Frameworks that identify how region-specific infrastructure, workforce, natural resources, and institutions align with market demand and long-term growth trends. The frameworks are designed to help prospective investors, regional partners, and local stakeholders understand how to streamline pathways for energy, industrial, and innovation-driven growth opportunities.

“Our strongest year of economic development results confirmed what happens when vision is matched with disciplined execution. This strategy builds directly on that momentum by aligning regional strengths within a clear, statewide framework for energy investment, innovation, and high-wage job creation. Through a Whole-of-Louisiana approach, LED and our partners are positioning the state to lead globally while delivering real opportunity for Louisiana workers and communities.”

LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois

The Whole-of-Louisiana Energy Strategy builds on ongoing efforts to streamline and align state government around shared priorities. LED’s 2025 Strategic Plan and 9×90 Workplan, alongside the Department of Conservation and Energy’s (C&E) new organizational model and strategic framework, provide a clear foundation for coordinated action. These efforts are strengthened by an interagency agreement between LED and C&E on state energy development and planning, and accelerated by Governor Landry’s Louisiana Lightning Speed Executive Order, which formalizes a whole-of-government approach to move projects forward with greater speed, certainty, and coordination.

“This strategy allows LED and other state partners seeking to build the state’s energy economy to provide clear guidance on permitting processes and greater predictability for companies investing here. By safeguarding the resources and communities that make growth possible, we are strengthening Louisiana’s energy leadership and future while protecting our shared environment.”

Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson

The strategy reflects a coordinated effort to ensure Louisiana capitalizes on its momentum, assets, and proven execution capability to remain a location of choice for energy production, investment, and innovation, reducing foreign energy dependence and advancing U.S. energy dominance across the world.",https://press-herald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-7.47.35-AM.png,N,,2026-01-23 10:39:54.972764

The UK Gigafactory Commission, backed by the Faraday Institution, has published a sweeping set of recommendations aimed at accelerating battery investment, protecting more than 200,000 automotive-linked jobs and safeguarding the UK’s industrial competitiveness.

Its central message is stark: without faster, more coordinated government intervention, the UK risks being overtaken by rivals in Europe, the US and Asia.

A narrow window for investment

Global competition for battery manufacturing is intensifying as countries race to secure supply chains for electric vehicles and energy storage.

While the UK has made progress through initiatives such as the Battery Strategy, the Industrial Strategy and targeted funding programmes, the Commission concludes that incremental progress is no longer enough.

Chaired by former Business and Defence Secretary Lord Hutton of Furness, the Commission argues that Britain is at a critical inflexion point.

Major automotive manufacturers are making long-term decisions now about where to locate production, and the availability of domestic battery supply is becoming a decisive factor.

Without new gigafactory capacity, the UK’s automotive sector faces declining exports, weaker energy security and the risk of losing production overseas.

Lord Hutton commented: “The UK is at a pivotal moment for its automotive and battery industries. This Commission sets out a practical plan for securing a new gigafactory by anchoring it to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) demand, matching international investment incentives, and fixing long-standing barriers around energy costs, planning and grid access.

“If the government acts on these recommendations in the next 12 to 18 months, the UK can protect hundreds of thousands of jobs, rebuild investor confidence and remain a serious competitor in the global race for electric vehicle manufacturing.”

The case for a more interventionist state

At the heart of the report is a call for a shift in mindset at the top of government. The Commission urges ministers to move from a reactive approach to a mission-led industrial strategy, with clear accountability for landing major investments.

One of its headline proposals is the appointment of a named Cabinet-level minister responsible for securing a new gigafactory, an EV manufacturing plant and associated battery supply chains.

This role would be supported by a dedicated Cabinet sub-committee and a small delivery team, creating a single point of leadership to cut through departmental silos and speed up negotiations.

Anchoring demand to unlock UK gigafactories

The report places particular emphasis on securing a major global automotive OEM as a demand anchor for future UK gigafactories.

According to the Commission, guaranteed demand from an OEM with near-term EV expansion plans is essential to make large-scale battery investment commercially viable.

To achieve this, it recommends senior-level government engagement, tailored incentive packages and the rapid availability of pre-approved industrial sites.

These measures would allow the UK to compete more effectively with international rivals offering generous subsidies and ready-to-build locations.

The Commission also calls for a benchmarked, investor-ready support package covering grants, energy costs and site preparation, enabling faster and more credible discussions with battery manufacturers.

Strengthening the domestic supply chain

Beyond cell manufacturing, the report highlights the importance of building resilience across the battery value chain.

It urges greater investment in domestic cathode and anode materials production, aligned with the UK’s Critical Minerals Strategy, to reduce reliance on imports.

Battery recycling is another priority. Expanding “black mass” processing and advanced materials recovery would not only improve sustainability but also strengthen supply security for future gigafactories.

Delivering genuinely shovel-ready sites through an expanded Strategic Sites Accelerator – with grid connections, water access and planning permission secured in advance – is described as essential to winning investment at pace.

Policy reform to boost competitiveness

The Commission warns that industrial competitiveness depends as much on policy certainty as on funding. It calls for action to reduce industrial energy costs by widening relief schemes for energy-intensive industries, a key concern for battery manufacturers.

It also recommends adjustments to the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate to maintain ambition while avoiding penalties that could deter growth, and urges the government to seek flexibility on the 2027 Rules of Origin deadline, given limited UK and EU capacity in battery materials.

Skills and innovation for the long term

Finally, the report stresses that people and innovation will underpin the success of UK gigafactories. It proposes a high-profile national skills campaign, inspired by the Destination Nuclear programme, alongside expanded apprenticeships, curriculum reform and industry-led training.

To keep the UK at the cutting edge, the Commission also calls for faster scale-up of next-generation battery technologies such as solid-state and lithium-sulphur, with a strong focus on manufacturability and cost reduction.

Taken together, the recommendations paint a clear picture: the opportunity is still there, but the clock is ticking.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2333774641-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 09:40:21.768762

After losing over 40% of its value from January 2025 to April 2025, the stock finished the year strong, up around 11.4%.

Although Tesla underperformed the S&P 500, it was a much better performance than many anticipated mid-year. It didn't come without disappointing news at the end of the year, though.

A core business headed in the wrong direction

Unfortunately, 2025 was a record-breaking year for Tesla for all the wrong reasons. The company only delivered around 1.63 million vehicles in the year, 8.5% fewer than in 2024. This was the biggest year-over-year drop in its history.

In the fourth quarter, deliveries fell 16% year over year, and for the first time ever, it's no longer the world's top electric vehicle (EV) seller. That distinction now goes to Chinese automaker BYD, which sold around 2.26 million battery EVs in 2025.

Part of the reason for the decline is the emergence of lower-cost options around the world (such as BYD and Geely), as well as the expiration of government tax credits that had lowered Tesla prices for many consumers. The $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit expired at the end of September 2025.

Tesla's future rides on robotaxis becoming a thing

Auto sales account for close to three-fourths of Tesla's revenue, but its long-term investment case hinges on the company's ability to deliver on its robotaxi ambitions. In an ideal world, robotaxis would give Tesla a high-margin business that operates more like a software company than an automaker.

Unfortunately, the stock is priced as an artificial intelligence (AI) company and as if robotaxi commercialization is guaranteed, though that's far from the case. Which brings us to the next point.

Tesla's stock is trading beyond a premium

Even with the question mark surrounding Tesla's current core business, the stock is extremely expensive, currently trading at 201 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months. For perspective, that's more than five times higher than Nvidia, more than 6.5 times higher than Amazon, and nearly 10 times higher than Meta.

Trading that expensively means investors are pricing a lot of growth into Tesla's stock, but its current business performance far from justifies it. Even with meaningful robotaxi progress, it would be extremely hard to justify Tesla's current valuation.

If you're thinking of investing in Tesla, be prepared to wait years (like 10 or more) for its autonomous vehicle plans to become tangible and for the inevitable high volatility along the way.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851144%2Ftesla-sales-center-with-tesla-logo-on-building-for-tesla-sales.png&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-23 09:40:25.430431

Program investments will also create direct construction-related jobs as well as highly skilled roles to operate the regional electricity market.","WASHINGTON, January 22, 2026—The World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors today approved the Regional Electricity Market Interconnectivity and Trade (REMIT) Program, which will be implemented over a 10-year period across three phases to boost energy connectivity in Central Asia. The multi-phase program will establish Central Asia’s first-ever regional electricity market, increase electricity trade, expand transmission capacity, and lay the groundwork for large-scale renewable energy integration.

During the REMIT Program’s first phase, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, as well as the Central Asian Countries’ Coordinating Dispatch Center (CDC) Energia, will benefit from program grants and concessional financing totaling $143.2 million, comprising $140 million from the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) and $3.2 million in grants from the Central Asia Water and Energy Program (CAWEP), to implement their respective activities.

Electricity demand in Central Asia is climbing fast and is projected to triple by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario. As the region’s economies grow, resulting in population growth, more industries, and larger cities, the need for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is becoming more urgent than ever.

Despite its potential to enhance energy security and affordability, electricity trade in Central Asia remains limited, reaching only about 3 percent of total electricity demand. Variable renewables contribute only 4 percent of power generation, even though the region is endowed with abundant and highly complementary clean energy resources that remain underutilized.

The REMIT Program aims to harness the region’s complementary energy assets: hydropower in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, thermal power in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, and the growing solar and wind potential across all Central Asia countries.

Over the next decade, the REMIT Program aims to increase electricity trade to at least 15,000 GWh annually – enough to meet the yearly needs of millions of people across Central Asia, while more than tripling transmission capacity to 16 GW and enabling up to 9 GW of clean energy resources. Strengthening regional integration will support a more balanced and resilient power system, reduce outages, and lower energy costs for households and businesses.

“The REMIT Program supports Central Asian countries’ ambition to deepen energy cooperation and create a regional electricity market. This will enable more efficient use of energy resources, including cross-border deployment of clean energy, improve access to, reliability, and affordability of electricity for people and businesses, and support jobs,” said Najy Benhassine, World Bank Regional Director for Central Asia. “By 2050, stronger electricity connectivity and trade could generate up to $15 billion in economic benefits for the region.”

The REMIT Program has total indicative financing of $1.018 billion across three phases. These funds will help finance the design and operationalization of a regional energy market, strengthen regional transmission capacity, introduce digital systems to improve grid reliability, and enhance regional institutions and coordination. Program investments will also create direct construction-related jobs as well as highly skilled roles to operate the regional electricity market.

“The launch of the Central Asian regional electricity market, underpinned by a strengthened grid, will advance energy security, support large-scale renewable integration, and unlock private investment. The first phase alone is expected to enable about 900 MW of new clean energy capacity, leveraging $700 million in private investments. This will pave the way for a more resilient and interconnected power system across this dynamic region,” said Charles Cormier, World Bank Regional Infrastructure Director for Europe and Central Asia.

Future phases will build on this foundation by expanding the market platform, reinforcing and digitalizing regional transmission networks, and strengthening regional institutions.

CDC Energia, mandated to coordinate power exchanges between Central Asian countries, will implement the market and institutional activities, while national transmission companies will carry out grid investments. A Regional Steering Committee, comprising energy ministries and implementing agencies, will oversee the overall program implementation.",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/photos/780x439/2025/dec/tj-power-grid-780x439.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 11:40:55.213416

This commits both countries to deeper collaboration on hydrogen, CCUS, North Seas energy, energy security, and the green transition.
The offshore wind sector in Germany looks back at a turbulent couple of years: In 2023, bidders in offshore wind auctions were ready to pay billions in ""entry prices"" for building new turbines, while another auction two years later failed to attract any bidders.
With this new impetus in mind, the North Sea Summit has shifted the focus from ambition to delivery, positioning the North Sea as Europe’s self-sufficient green power hub.
Industrial policy choices around offshore wind naturally differ across North Sea countries, reflecting national circumstances and existing industrial strengths.","Crucially, offshore wind reduces exposure to volatile global fossil fuel markets that we do not control. At a time of geopolitical instability, the UK has taken decisive action to secure clean, home‑grown power at prices well below the cost of new gas generation.

Renewables are now the cheapest form of electricity to build and operate. The more we build, the more often clean power sets the wholesale price instead of gas, delivering lower bills, greater security, and long‑term economic stability.

Cooperation between the UK and its neighbours around the North Sea on offshore wind energy has steadily increased in the past years, both at the industry level and among governments. Would you say that offshore wind energy has defied the fallout of the UK's vote to leave the European Union?

The UK is always stronger when it works with its European allies, and our cooperation on offshore wind is an excellent example of this.

As Europe’s two largest offshore wind producers, both the UK and Germany have closely aligned long‑term net zero and energy transition goals and work together through frameworks such as the UK‑Germany Energy and Climate Partnership, signed in 2023. This commits both countries to deeper collaboration on hydrogen, CCUS, North Seas energy, energy security, and the green transition.

The signing of the Kensington Treaty in July 2024 was another positive step towards the UK and Germany realising our shared energy ambitions through its lighthouse project to accelerate practical cooperation across the North Seas.

This cooperation is reflected in a growing number of industry initiatives and partnerships aimed at creating physical energy infrastructure links, including the NeuConnect and Tarchon electricity interconnectors, which are under construction or being planned, respectively. They will directly link our two electricity markets for the first time and anchor collaboration in the day‑to‑day functioning of energy systems.

The launch of the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy in 2025 has also helped maintain momentum, providing long‑term certainty for investors and prioritising clean energy industries.

Does this offer a blueprint for sustaining deeper cooperation in other policy fields?

With the wider EU, we have committed to further our collaboration on energy at the UK-EU summit in May 2025 and have since begun negotiations to pursue the linking of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme and the EU ETS, as well as agreeing to start talks on the UK’s participation in the EU’s internal electricity market.

It’s clear that more efficient electricity trading is vital to unlock growth and private sector investment in the North Seas, and only by working together in the region can we harness the immense renewable energy potential it holds.

The offshore wind sector in Germany looks back at a turbulent couple of years: In 2023, bidders in offshore wind auctions were ready to pay billions in ""entry prices"" for building new turbines, while another auction two years later failed to attract any bidders. How has the sector developed in the UK recently?

The UK also experienced difficulties in the wind sector – Allocation Round 5 (AR5), in which not a single offshore wind project was secured, was a wake-up call. The last auction round, AR6, got the industry back on its feet. Now this latest auction round – AR7 - has secured a record capacity of 8.4GW of offshore wind, the largest auction of its kind in Europe.

How was this turnaround achieved?

Offshore wind is a capital‑intensive, long‑term infrastructure sector, and outcomes can be highly sensitive to broader economic conditions such as inflation, interest rates and supply‑chain constraints. These factors have been felt across the continent and underline why policy certainty and adaptable frameworks are critical for sustaining investment at scale.

In the UK, the offshore wind sector has benefited from the stability and credibility of the Contracts for Difference (CfD) mechanism, coupled with a willingness to refine its design as market conditions change. A number of targeted reforms introduced ahead of AR7 helped maintain strong competition and investor confidence. These included updating parameters to better reflect prevailing cost and financing conditions, improving auction flexibility to support project deliverability and giving clearer visibility of the UK’s long‑term deployment pipeline.

Would you say that a ""best-practice"" approach is pursued around the North Sea in which regulators and companies learn from experiences gained in neighbouring countries?

The UK places strong emphasis on international learning and cooperation. Through the UK‑Germany Energy and Climate Partnership and wider North Sea forums, governments, regulators, and industry share experience on auction design, supply‑chain resilience, grid integration, hydrogen development and hybrid interconnector‑linked wind projects.

While approaches differ between countries, there is a clear and growing practice of exchanging lessons learned to improve outcomes across the sector.

All North Sea countries have ambitions to greatly expand their offshore wind energy capacity in the next years. Would you say that there are already adequate mechanisms in place to ensure that resources are pooled efficiently and spatial and infrastructure planning makes use of synergies or at least avoids interference?

Cross‑border interconnectors, work on hybrid interconnector‑linked wind farms, and closer dialogue on spatial and grid planning are all helping to unlock shared opportunities and reduce the risk of interference between projects. Industry engagement through North Sea cooperation frameworks has also improved visibility of future demand and infrastructure needs.

That said, the speed and scale of expansion now envisaged mean that closer coordination will remain essential to ensure that investment decisions across the region are aligned in time and scale, which is why the North Sea Summit, and the opportunity it provides to discuss these issues face-to-face, remains invaluable.

The North Sea Summit was launched in the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine. Has this forum succeeded in injecting new resolve into wider European efforts to make offshore wind a pillar of greater energy sovereignty, including in the UK?

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the manner in which the energy supply chain was weaponised against the UK and our allies, certainly redoubled our resolve to deliver clean, homegrown power by 2030.

With this new impetus in mind, the North Sea Summit has shifted the focus from ambition to delivery, positioning the North Sea as Europe’s self-sufficient green power hub. At the 2023 North Sea Summit in Ostend in Belgium, heads of state agreed to deliver up to 300 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2050. This year’s summit will deliver on that plan.

Strengthening local manufacturing and keeping out wind turbine producers from China has been a key demand by Germany’s wind industry and many policymakers in recent years, who argue that more sovereignty and security justify higher costs. Would you say that all North Sea Summit governments share a vision of how to develop the industry going forward, or are there marked differences in some key areas?

Industrial policy choices around offshore wind naturally differ across North Sea countries, reflecting national circumstances and existing industrial strengths. In the UK, the emphasis has been on providing stable market frameworks that encourage investment and rapid deployment, while supporting domestic capability through targeted measures rather than prescriptive requirements.

Across the North Sea Summit countries, there is nonetheless a shared understanding that supply chains, skills and manufacturing capacity matter increasingly for energy security as well as economic growth.

If the city’s tiny municipal gas utility uses more gas than its typical daily allotment starting on Thursday, Drake said, it will be charged “an exponentially higher rate” for natural gas on the spot market.

The city is only a couple of years into a 15-year plan to pay off its natural gas bill from 2021, when gas sellers told Drake the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas had jumped from $3 to $200.

“Let’s hope that doesn’t happen again next week,” Drake said Wednesday.

Natural gas prices have already surged this week as the potential effects of Winter Storm Fern — whose name was bestowed by The Weather Channel — started to come into focus. In a post Thursday, the Department of Energy’s statistical agency said the benchmark Henry Hub spot price Wednesday was roughly 59 percent higher than the previous Wednesday.

An enormous front of Arctic air will slam into the central U.S. this weekend and merge with a second, moisture-laden storm system coming through California. The combined storm will move slowly eastward impacting more than 150 million people from Texas to the East Coast, forecasters warn.

Northern Great Plains states are facing temperatures down to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Heavy snowfall extends through the Midwest into New England. Farther south, the storm is poised to bring ice storms and sleet from Texas to Virginia, according to the National Weather Service and other forecasters.

The storm is a “trifecta” danger, said Jim Robb, chief executive of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the interstate grid operations standards organization.

In other words, extreme cold, high winds and blankets of ice, sleet and snow threaten to bring down local power lines and freeze power plants and natural gas production.

And millions of residents are still paying off the massive natural gas price spikes that occurred in during Winter Storm Uri in 2021 in Texas and other states.

Henry hub gas futures traded Thursday around $5 per million British thermal units as numerous utility companies said they would open emergency operations centers to deal with potential power and natural gas outages.

How high gas prices will climb hinges on how much natural gas production freezes and how much demand rises, said Michael Webber, a professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs and the mechanical engineering department at the University of Texas, Austin.

Winter storms caused the largest interruptions to U.S. natural gas production over a four-year period ending in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Mathieu Utting, a natural gas and LNG markets analyst with Rystad Energy, wrote in an email to POLITICO’s E&E News that gas production has already dropped by 4 billion cubic feet a day compared to early last week, “because of wellhead freeze offs or shut-ins in anticipation of extreme winter weather.”

“For the demand side, it depends how cold it is and for how long,” Webber said. “It’s a double whammy, because customers use gas to hear their homes and electricity from gas power plants.”

Utting said the storm is expected to add around 1 billion cubic feet a day of gas demand over the next week.

President Donald Trump campaigned on making energy prices more affordable, but the White House dismissed concerns about rising natural gas prices in a statement on Thursday.

“Instead of fixating on normal market fluctuations that are being driven by a looming winter storm, the media should focus on how American natural gas output is projected to hit a record high this year,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson.

But consumer advocates said the coming winter storm could echo concerns from 2021, when natural gas sellers made massive profits selling gas at high prices as demand surged.

“I am extremely concerned that companies will exploit this cold snap to engage in profiteering, and I think not only is that immoral, but it should be illegal,” said Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at Public Citizen.

An existing energy affordability “crisis” is being driven by higher natural gas prices caused by record liquefied natural gas exports from the U.S., Slocum said Thursday. The natural gas industry has disputed such characterizations and said prices go up when gas supply is constrained.

“We should be regulating and curtailing exports during extreme weather events, during times when we see domestic price spikes or if we see domestic shortages,” Slocum said.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release Thursday he directed regional grid operators to maintain communications with his agency and to be prepared to bring backup power generation online during Fern.

In a related letter to grid operators Thursday, Wright wrote that he has directed DOE to prepare to issue orders that would ensure that “tens of gigawatts of available backup generation, which would otherwise stand idle, is available during emergency conditions.”

It was unclear Thursday evening whether he expected that backup generation to be available by the time Fern arrives this weekend.

Lessons learned

Dozens of lawsuits are still working their way through courts over sky-high natural gas prices that dominated the market during Winter Storm Uri in 2021.

Spot prices at the Henry Hub jumped from $3.76 per MMBtu on Feb. 10, 2021, to $23.86 on Feb. 17, according toEIA.

Some natural gas customers, however, saw much larger increases.

The Oklahoma Corporation Commission reported that prices spiked from around $3 per thousand cubic feet of gas to more than $1,200, ultimately leaving ratepayers on the hook to pay off nearly $5 billion in bonds issued to cover that increase in price, with interest. One thousand cubic feet of gas is roughly equivalent to 1 MMBtu.

Texas natural gas ratepayers now are paying off $3.4 billion in bonds to help natural gas utility companies stay afloat as prices also spiked in that state. That does not include the $2.1 billion in securitization bonds that the state’s grid operator is charging ratepayers to help pay generators for certain “extraordinary costs” incurred during Uri.

Meanwhile, BloombergNEF has estimated that natural gas sellers in Texas alone made about $11 billion during the five days tied to the 2021 winter storm.

While natural gas sales that occur through pipelines that cross state lines are regulated by FERC, those that occur in pipeline systems that stay contained within one state are opaque, Webber said.

Webber pointed to states like Texas, where natural gas companies can both own pipelines and the gas within the pipelines. Regulators there don’t require gas companies to report the prices at which they acquire and sell their natural gas.

“You can own title and transfer so you can control the flow of the gas,” Webber said. “The concern, and the people who feel like they were price gouged, say that the people who are selling and moving gas charge whatever they want — that it’s not a real competitive marketplace because it’s not a common carrier.”

State attorneys general in Oklahoma and Kansas filed lawsuits in Uri’s aftermath, accusing natural gas companies of price gouging.

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond (R) said in a statement that his office would monitor natural gas supplies and market pricing during Winter Storm Fern.

“It is critical that Oklahomans are not exploited, especially during extreme weather events,” Drummond said. “While energy markets can experience volatility during periods of severe cold, those conditions do not excuse predatory behavior or violations of contractual obligations.”

Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach (R) announced last February he would abandon his price gouging lawsuit tied to overcharging during Uri. FERC, meanwhile, launched an investigation into potentially unlawful actions relating to Uri, but last November, it closed the investigation and opted not to pursue enforcement actions.

Now, government and energy industry officials are looking ahead to Winter Storm Fern.

Laura Swett, chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said Thursday that her agency is keeping a close eye on the storm, particularly in terms of electric reliability.

“From every utility that I have spoken to or grid operator, we are benefiting from our lessons learned from past extreme weather events,” Swett told reporters at FERC’s monthly meeting. “Everyone combs over those to see what we can do better next time, so I think we are as best prepared as we possibly could be.”

Learning from past events was a sentiment echoed by the Natural Gas Supply Association, whose members include producers and marketers, or sellers, of natural gas.

The groups’ members have “invested significantly in winterization and system coordination following past extreme weather events,” said Dena Wiggins, the association’s CEO, in a statement Thursday. “The pending storm has the industry laser focused on doing all we can to serve the needs of consumers.”

Storm preparations

Energy industry officials know they can expect drops in gas output as below-freezing conditions spread across the country.

Natural gas production in Texas declined by almost 45 percent during Uri, according to EIA, leading the state’s oil and gas regulator to adopt its first rules requiring natural gas operators to weatherize their equipment.

The Appalachian Basin saw natural gas production sink by more than 6 billion cubic feet a day during Winter Storm Elliott in 2022, when temperatures fell below 0 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of the Northeast.

In an advisory this week, the Railroad Commission of Texas — which oversees the state’s oil and natural gas industry — urged operators under its purview to take steps such as monitoring weather reports, listening to orders from local emergency officials and securing “all personnel, equipment and facilities to prevent injury or damage.”

Officials with the American Petroleum Institute, one of the nation’s largest oil and gas trade groups, said Thursday that the natural gas industry “remains focused on sustaining safe, dependable operations while protecting worker safety throughout this cold weather event.”

Meanwhile, concerns are growing for the grid as Fern approaches.

The storm will test the winter storm defenses installed by power plant and gas infrastructure owners and operators since Uri in 2021 and Elliott in 2022.

Grid coordinators have called on power plant operators to be at maximum readiness by delaying maintenance outages, according to NERC’s Robb.

NERC said in a winter readiness report in November that New England, the Carolinas, parts of the Tennessee Valley region and most of Texas were at an “elevated risk” of power emergencies in extreme storms.

Power plant winterization standards developed by NERC and ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have been added and strengthened over the past three years. Although final actions won’t be complete in every case for two to four more years, Robb said protections are definitely stronger.

“The surface equipment in the electric sector should be well prepared for this event,” Robb said. “The issue is that those requirements don’t extend into the fuel supply because we don’t have authority to do that. So we’re banking on the gas industry doing the things that they’ve committed to do voluntarily to keep gas flowing during very cold periods.”

State regulators and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state’s main power grid operator, made sweeping changes after Uri, when much of the state was plunged into darkness for days and more than 200 people died.

The rules require power plants to winterize their facilities, for example.

ERCOT officials said this week that they expect there will be enough generation “to meet demand this winter.”

“We are continuing to monitor the weather conditions throughout this week and keep Texans informed through our communications channels,” the grid operator said in a statement. “ERCOT will continue to deploy all available resources to manage the grid reliably and coordinate closely with the Public Utility Commission, generation providers, and transmission utilities.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/96/70/90408c6741759f5111f3c1b5fd27/transco-pipeline-32881.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 07:39:13.759843

One analysis found that bills from Indiana’s five investor-owned electric utilities shows went up 17.5% in one year, or $28 a month on average statewide.

So, I was excited to hear that House Republicans would be tackling utility affordability.

But the bill won’t help all Hoosiers.

The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission oversees eight electric utilities and 17 natural gas utilities in the state, according to the commission. However, more than 100 municipal and Rural Electric Membership Cooperatives have withdrawn from the commission’s rate jurisdiction. That includes my provider.

No shortage of suggestions heard to improve electric service affordability measure

Kerwin Olson, executive director of the consumer-focused Citizens Action Coalition, estimates up to 20% of Hoosiers aren’t protected by regulators — about one in five Hoosiers.

“The rationale is largely that those customers are taxpayers and constituents or voting members and can take complaints directly to the utility. Their only recourse really is common courts if they are not satisfied,” he said.

Olson thinks it’s fair in the context of investor-owned utilities needing more oversight. He does wish some of the state rules on deposits, late fees, reconnect charges and efficiency programs applied to all utilities.

But that’s a fight for another day.

Legislative efforts

The rest of you should be watching House Bill 1002.

Most of the bill doesn’t do anything to reduce or control your gas and electric bills. It instead provides ways to cope with them. But that doesn’t mean those provisions aren’t important.

The bill would do the following:

Require an electricity supplier that is under the jurisdiction of the IURC to offer a low-income customer assistance program that provides financial assistance to low-income residential customers for the payment of monthly bills for utility service.

Block service shut-offs to those customers during dangerously hot months. This protection already exists for cold-weather months — another time when bills jump but disconnection could harm Hoosiers.

Put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans. These plans level out your monthly bills so that your costs are more consistent. But they don’t control or lower them. And ratepayers could opt out of the program if they want.

The one section that could have a positive future impact is performance-based ratemaking.

It’s a newer concept, under consideration in other states, that would tie future rate increase requests to specific metrics. The Indiana bill would pair the new multi-year rate plans with performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.

Lawmakers may also look at peak load demand or environmental sustainability.

It’s unclear if the incentives would be enough to truly impact future rate increases, and customers wouldn’t see change for several years. But it’s a worthy discussion to have as Hoosiers struggle with higher costs.

Gov. Mike Braun is hoping to move the needle by revamping IURC’s membership and targeting rate hikes that pad company profits at the expense of ratepayers.

“Affordability is why I support Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to hold investor-owned utility companies accountable to provide affordable energy before they can increase their profit margin,” he said during his State of the State speech.

“And it’s why I appointed three ratepayer-conscious members, now constituting a majority, to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission — to make decisions in the public interest to ensure utilities provide service at just and reasonable rates.”

Between the executive and legislative efforts, it’s my hope that Hoosiers will start to see the cost curve bend to a more reasonable level after years of increases.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2157928317-2048x1363.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 11:41:37.558429

Now, one of Tesla’s chief competitors is prepping to take the case to voters.

Electric truck manufacturer Rivian has pledged $4.6 million to get on equal footing with Elon Musk’s EV giant.

A committee calling itself the Washington Coalition for Consumer Choice and Innovation is pushing a ballot measure to open that opportunity to more electric vehicle makers.

State law blocks car buyers from purchasing electric vehicles directly from the manufacturer, so they’re forced to instead buy through dealerships. Tesla has been the sole exception to that law for over a decade. So while Rivian and luxury EV brand Lucid have showrooms in Washington, they can’t sell vehicles through them.

In a statement, the coalition said it “believes that all Washington drivers should have the option to test drive and purchase the vehicle of their choice.”

“We are currently pursuing a November 2026 ballot measure to make these choices available to Washington consumers,” the statement continues. “We believe the majority of voters will agree with us that Washington’s outdated car sales laws should be updated.”

What organizations and businesses make up the coalition is unclear.

The group has brought on California-based Winner & Mandabach Campaigns, a leading consultancy focused on ballot initiatives. The firm has worked on a number of Washington state measures, including the successful opposition to Initiative 1631 levying a carbon fee on emissions. Its website boasts of a 90% win rate for its ballot measure campaigns.

To qualify for the ballot, initiative campaigns must turn in at least 308,911 voter signatures by early July to the secretary of state’s office. The office recommends submitting at least 390,000 signatures to allow for invalid ones. The coalition’s proposal didn’t appear to have been filed with the secretary of state late Thursday.

Last year, legislation to allow companies like Rivian and Lucid to sell directly to consumers stalled in the state House. A coalition of environmental and business groups argued at the time that opening up the market would speed up sales of electric vehicles and help the state meet its goal of reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector.

Car dealers fearful of losing business have strongly opposed these efforts. The 2025 legislation died in a legislative committee chaired by a Democratic lawmaker who owns car dealers, Rep. Amy Walen, D-Kirkland. But Walen said that didn’t play a role in the bill’s demise, saying it just lacked support.

Walen faced a complaint to the Legislative Ethics Board alleging a conflict of interest, but the board found no basis for it, noting a similar bill passed the committee in 2024 while Walen was chair.

“Rather than Respondent favoring her outside employment interests over her legislative duties as is alleged in the Complaint, it appears that there has been and continues to be a general lack of support for these aforementioned bills,” the ethics board determined.

The Washington State Auto Dealers Association declined to comment on the proposed ballot initiative.

In November, voters will also get to weigh in on an initiative seeking to bar transgender athletes from girls’ sports.

Renewable Energy Employment Snapshot

Clean energy jobs are not where you think they are 🤔

Last week, we examined how renewable energy employment is growing globally, even as the nature of that growth changes. Digging on IRENA’s latest review, one pattern stands out: clean energy jobs are not evenly distributed. While capacity is expanding across countries, employment remains concentrated in a limited number of geography. Understanding why this matters is key to seeing where real clean energy career opportunities are emerging.

Despite renewable energy projects appearing worldwide, most jobs remain concentrated in a small number of countries. According to IRENA, five markets alone, China, Brazil, India, the United States and the European Union, account for the majority of global renewable energy employment. China dominates in absolute terms, with more than 7 million jobs in 2024, reflecting its scale in manufacturing, installations and related services, while other regions with growing deployment capture fewer jobs overall.

This concentration is driven less by where capacity is installed and more by where industrial activity takes place.

Solar and wind employment, in particular, is heavily shaped by manufacturing and supply chains. IRENA estimates that China alone accounts for around 58% of global solar PV jobs and over 60% of wind employment, while the top ten countries together capture more than 80% of jobs in these technologies. Countries without domestic manufacturing or strong supply chain integration tend to see renewable employment limited to installation and operations, even as capacity continues to expand locally.

Is the African Giant Taking the Bull by the Horns? 🇳🇬

While most attention on renewable energy employment focuses on established industrial hubs, recent developments in Africa’s largest economy hint at a different terrain. Last week, Nigerian government unveiled a planned $2 billion National Climate Change Fund to support emissions reduction and resilience projects, alongside a $500 million Climate Investment Platform designed to attract further climate capital. These moves are part of a broader bid to mobilise tens of billions in climate finance and align with the country’s Energy Transition Plan, which aims for net-zero by 2060 and universal energy access. Whether this strategy translates into deeper domestic capacity, stronger supply chains or a more substantial position in the clean energy landscape remains to be seen, but it signals how emerging markets are trying to shape their role, rather than simply follow global deployment trends.

The role of industrial policy, domestic manufacturing and supply chains

Where renewable energy jobs concentrate, policy choices are rarely neutral. IRENA highlights that countries capturing the largest share of employment are those that have actively supported domestic manufacturing and supply chain development. China’s dominance is not only the result of deployment scale, but of sustained industrial policy that has built vertically integrated solar and wind manufacturing ecosystems. In 2024 alone, China produced more than 80% of global solar PV modules and held around 70% of global wind turbine orders, anchoring millions of jobs within its borders.

Other countries that appear prominently in the employment data show similar patterns, though at smaller scale 👎. Brazil’s renewable workforce is closely tied to domestic biofuels and hydropower industries, while India and the European Union combine deployment targets with local content rules, manufacturing incentives, and export-oriented supply chains. Where these elements are absent, employment outcomes look very different. Countries relying heavily on imports often see rapid capacity growth without comparable job creation, reinforcing the gap between where clean energy is installed and where its economic value and jobs, are retained.

What this means for job mobility, relocation and regional career strategy?

For workers, this geographic concentration has practical consequences. IRENA’s data shows that most renewable energy jobs are created where manufacturing, engineering services and long-term operations are established, not necessarily where projects are built. As a result, job opportunities are far more abundant in countries with deep industrial ecosystems than in markets focused primarily on deployment. This limits the portability of many clean energy roles and makes relocation a structural feature of career progression rather than an exception.

The implications differ by role and career stage. Installation and construction jobs tend to be local and project-based, while manufacturing, supply chain and engineering roles cluster in a small number of global hubs. IRENA highlights that the top ten countries account for roughly 80–90% of employment in major renewable technologies, leaving limited pathways for sustained career growth in smaller or import-dependent markets. For professionals and employers alike, this reinforces the need to think strategically about location, skills specialisation and long-term mobility, rather than assuming that renewable deployment alone will generate durable local employment.

What This Means for You?

This geography-first reality changes how clean energy careers, hiring strategies and workforce planning need to be approached. Opportunity is no longer defined by where renewables are being built, but by whereindustrial capacity, skills ecosystems and long-term demand are anchored. The most resilient clean energy careers will belong to those who understand where jobs are rooted, build transferable skills and position themselves where that demand is built to last!

Talking about affordability need not negate the focus on the impact of climate change, she said.","One of Congress’ loudest climate hawks is trying to fend off a push within his party to abandon the issue of climate change at a time when left-leaning agenda-setters plot to reclaim both chambers of Congress.

In a long social media thread Tuesday, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) declared that anyone who thinks Democrats should avoid talking about climate change “are wrong about pretty much everything.”

The posts are part of the debate within the Democratic Party about the best messaging ahead of the midterm elections, and as leaders grapple with their 2024 loss to Donald Trump.

“There’s a thing out there called a ‘climate husher,'” Whitehouse, the Environment and Public Works Committee ranking member, posted.

“Anyone who cares about what fossil fuel pollution is doing to Earth’s natural systems needs to ignore these so-called ‘climate hushers’ — people who think Dems should stop talking about climate.”

Immediately after losing the White House and both chambers of Congress, many Democrats said they should have focused more on kitchen table issues and less on progressive causes. Whitehouse argues climate change is compatible with that.

The senator’s lengthy thread notes that people are feeling the economic burdens of climate change throughout the country — from home insurance hikes to drops in property values. And he asserted that congressional Democrats should lean into that message rather than shy away from it.

“When leaders don’t talk about something, enthusiasm falls among voters,” Whitehouse posted. “In politics, you can often make your own wind, or you can make your own doldrums.

“The ‘climate hushers’ are conceding defeat, falling into circular reasoning, asking us to make our own doldrums. Specifically, they ignore the endemic Democratic problem of ‘poll-chasing’: we take a poll, ask where voters are, and then ape what they were thinking when the polls were taken back to them.”

In an interview about the post, Whitehouse said the “climate hushing” narrative has made its way into strategy conversations on Capitol Hill.

Indeed, many congressional Democrats have noticeably narrowed their discussions of climate change to center exclusively on rising utility bills, in response to the Trump administration’s ongoing attacks on renewable energy.

Whitehouse pushed back on this strategy, saying that the party should also continue calling out the harmful impacts of fossil fuel emissions and the influence of oil and gas companies on Trump administration policy.

Republicans have picked up on the shift and have used it to their advantage. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on Fox Business this week: “You actually see on the left, this debate going on right now, where a lot of people within the Democratic Party, they are talking about how they’ve lost the narrative, or the culture war, on climate.”

Left-leaning thinkers and independent analysts have also argued that Democrats may have gone too far in following the lead of environmental groups they say were out of touch with most Americans.

Columnist Matt Yglesias argued in a New York Times op-ed that Democrats should not be hostile to oil and gas. Longtime energy expert Daniel Yergin wrote in Foreign Affairs about the “troubled energy transition” and the need for a “pragmatic path” forward. And Veteran Democratic operative Adam Jentleson started the think tank the Searchlight Institute to curb the influence of the “groups” on party positions, including climate.

But Whitehouse shrugged off this narrative as being fed by pollsters who “don’t even understand the climate problem.”

“I’ve been at polling presentations made to the Senate Democratic Caucus in a so-called strategy retreat that didn’t ask about climate change and didn’t ask about dark money corruption. So there’s this massive blind spot that we have as well,” he said.

Although Whitehouse has acknowledged some shortcomings to Democrats’ past depictions of climate change — “as sort of a moral imperative, as an intangible thing floating out there, something that will affect polar bears” — he has continued to stand out among Democrats on the Hill as someone who thinks policy-makers should be talking about climate change more, not less.

Instead, he has relentlessly argued — 303 times on the Senate floor, in fact — that climate is in fact an economic issue that touches all facets of life for everyone, and that fossil fuel companies are the “villains” behind it.

“Democrats and environmental groups’ climate messaging for years has been crap, and so if you go back to that crap messaging, obviously it’s not going to succeed,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that the alternative is to throw in the towel.”

‘Cheap is clean’

Whitehouse’s fellow congressional climate hawks have mostly embraced the pivot toward talking about energy affordability rather than traditional climate priorities like decarbonization and clean air and water legislation.

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who last year removed “climate hawk” from his bio on X, has spoken explicitly about the need to shift on messaging, arguing repeatedly on social media and in floor speeches that Democrats need to remain focused on costs and shortages if they want their message to resonate with Americans.

“Those of us in the climate community who are used to making a more broad argument about where we are in the sweep of history have to get comfortable making a more immediate argument that says the reason prices are going up is a deliberate policy choice of the Republican Party,” Schatz said last year at an event affiliated with New York Climate Week.

Schatz in a statement this week said that he and Whitehouse were united on their ideas around “climate action.” But he doubled down on the importance of affordability messaging.

“There are think tanks and advocacy organizations that are dedicated to the proposition that climate action is incompatible with affordable energy, but those factional rivalries have been overtaken by events,” Schatz said. “Cheap is clean, and clean is cheap.”

On the House side, recent actions from the Democrats’ Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) have also focused squarely on energy costs and the ability of clean energy to lower Americans’ bills.

At a SEEC press conference last week meant to respond to the last year of energy and environment policy under President Donald Trump, a roster of climate-focused Democrats spoke nearly exclusively about energy prices. “Trump lied; Energy costs are up,” read the main sign at the presser.

It was a striking difference in tone from several years ago when then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019 elevated the “existential threat” of climate change immediately upon retaking the gavel.

That year, the Democrats’ renamed a panel about global warming the “Select Committee on the Climate Crisis,” as progressives pushed the party to highlight the issue with more urgency.

Is Whitehouse alone on an island?

Whitehouse said that the narrative from Democrats around energy bills is entirely compatible with his continued push to talk about fossil fuels; the two should go hand in hand, he said.

But in interviews with a half dozen Democratic lawmakers this week, the conversations revealed many in the party are not particularly worried about leaving some traditional climate change rhetoric behind for the time being in favor of talking nearly exclusively about clean energy prices — begging the question of whether Whitehouse is digging his heels in alone.

“My theory of the case is that the argument that I’ve been making for 30 years is finally breaking through,” said Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.), SEEC’s vice chair and a former clean energy professional.

“The urgency of climate change means that we have to focus on it especially when it’s not as salient with the American people, if we are to be the leaders we claim to be,” he added. “But I think that’s largely a separable conversation from what is the best way to talk about it in any given moment, that has the most ability to move public opinion.”

Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), a Natural Resources Committee member, said in an interview that Democrats need to focus on energy prices because Trump has used that as a justification for executive actions that bolster oil and gas.

“People, when they see the ways in which the energy policies that are serving big oil are hurting their pocketbooks, it makes it more tangible for why folks should care, in addition to the welfare of the planet,” Stansbury said.

And Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce’s Energy Subcommittee, downplayed the notion that congressional Democrats were at odds over how to message on climate. Talking about affordability need not negate the focus on the impact of climate change, she said.

“I think they are one in the same,” Castor said. “Take my community in Florida. We’re still recovering from Hurricane Helen and Milton and people understand that those storms were supercharged because the Gulf was very, very hot, very warm. And the rain was unlike anything we’ve ever seen. So they are trying to afford rebuilding their homes and paying their property insurance and also suffering higher rate increases.”

Whitehouse, for his part, said that he is in step with fellow Democrats focused on climate in raising concerns about new narratives.

“I think most of the what you might call ‘climate hawks’ in the Senate see this the same way: that we fell into a hole that we need to get out of and that there is a winning message,” he said.

The core principle should be that data centers operate on 100% clean energy, not as a slogan, but because it is the lowest-cost and lowest-risk option over time.
That means requiring data centers to pay the full cost of service, powering growth with clean energy first, and protecting water resources and ratepayers from unnecessary risk.","Wisconsin stands at a pivotal moment.

Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and hyperscale data centers are arriving quickly, bringing enormous demand for electricity and water. The real question is not whether these investments will come, but how we manage them and who pays the costs if we get it wrong.

Families want affordable bills. Businesses want reliable power. Communities want clean water and economic opportunity. We need a common-sense approach to guide how we respond to rapid data center growth.

An unprecedented load and a real affordability risk

The scale of proposed data centers is unlike anything Wisconsin has seen.

Just two projects, one in Port Washington and another in Mount Pleasant, have requested nearly four gigawatts of electricity combined. That is more power than all Wisconsin households use today.

Meeting this demand will require massive investments in power plants, transmission lines, substations, pipelines and water infrastructure. But under Wisconsin’s current utility model, these costs are not paid only by the companies driving demand. They are instead spread across all of us who pay electric bills, including families, farms, and small businesses that won’t benefit from data center power.

For small businesses operating on thin margins, even modest increases in electric or water rates affect hiring, pricing and long-term viability. In rural communities with fewer customers sharing infrastructure costs, the impact can be even more severe.

This concern is already becoming real. Utilities are citing data center demand to justify new methane gas plants and delaying coal plant retirements. Utilities doubling down on fossil fuels should give every one of us pause.

Why costly gas is the wrong answer

Building new methane gas plants for data centers would lock customers into decades of fuel price volatility, even though cleaner options have become cheaper and faster to deploy.

Wind, solar and battery storage can come online far more quickly than fossil fuel plants and without exposing families and businesses to unpredictable fuel costs. Battery storage costs alone have fallen nearly 90% over the past decade.

Across the country, these tools are replacing methane gas plants in states as different as Texas and California.

There is also a serious risk that we will pay higher bills for decades, even when data centers stop using those methane gas plants. In Nevada, a major utility has acknowledged that only about 15% of proposed data centers are likely to be built. When speculative projects fall through, all of us are left to pay for infrastructure we actually never needed.

This is not ideology. It is basic financial risk management, and basic fairness.

Clean energy is the lowest-cost path

Wisconsin policymakers and elected officials need to put guardrails in place to protect everyday residents from the AI bubble that’s threatening the state. The core principle should be that data centers operate on 100% clean energy, not as a slogan, but because it is the lowest-cost and lowest-risk option over time.

A smart framework would require developers to:

Supply at least 30% of their power from on-site and Wisconsin-based renewable energy

Offset additional demand through energy efficiency, demand response – at least 25% of peak capacity and smart grid flexibility

Participate fully in utility efficiency and renewable energy programs rather than opting out

Each data center project should require a legally binding Community Benefit Agreement that clearly defines community protections and benefits, negotiated among developers, local governments, neighborhood-based organizations and underserved communities

This approach reduces peak demand, lowers infrastructure costs and protects existing customers while allowing data centers to advance.

Major companies like Microsoft, Google and Meta have already publicly committed to operating on carbon-free energy. We need to hold them to that. Wisconsin risks losing our competitive advantage if we default to gas-heavy solutions instead of offering clean, flexible grids.

Water is a non-negotiable constraint

Energy is not the only concern. Water matters just as much.

A single hyperscale data center can use millions of gallons of water per day, either directly for cooling or indirectly through power generation. In communities with limited water systems, that can crowd out agricultural use and raise residents’ water bills.

Wisconsin should require closed-loop cooling systems, full accounting of direct and indirect water use, and ongoing public reporting to ensure local water supplies are protected.

A practical path forward

Wisconsin does not have to choose between economic growth and affordability. We can do both if we insist on clear guardrails.

That means requiring data centers to pay the full cost of service, powering growth with clean energy first, and protecting water resources and ratepayers from unnecessary risk.

Data centers are coming. The question is whether Wisconsin families and small businesses will be partners in that growth or be left paying higher bills for decades to come.

If we choose smart clean power over costly gas, Wisconsin can lead.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-99/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nj-powerlines-1024x6841769166318.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=yx7lm5Fd,N,,2026-01-23 11:41:13.219635
,Louisiana Environment,2026-01-23 11:04:47+00:00,Verite News,Europe gets 'green energy'. These Southern towns get dirty air. - Verite News New Orleans,Tristan Baurick,,,,,https://veritenews.org/2026/01/23/drax-air-pollution-louisiana-mississippi/,"Gloster has other industrial facilities, but the EPA lists the Drax mill as the region’s only major emitter of toxic air pollutants.
“It’s also mutagenic and neurodegenerative, which is as awful as that sounds,” said Aisha Dickerson, an environmental health researcher at Johns Hopkins University.
Buried several pages into the company’s permit updates, Drax noted that both of its Louisiana mills had exceeded their “minor source” limits for hazardous air pollutants.
One is that air pollution is magnitudes higher in Gloster, especially with VOCs, she said.
Data from dozens of air pollution monitors installed around the town show clouds of pollutants concentrated around the mill and in neighboring residential areas.","This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Verite News and Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to reporting on climate change. This story is the first of a three-part series.

It almost felt like old times for the friends and family gathered at Robert Weatherspoon’s house. The living room couches and chairs were filled, a football game was on the TV, and the aroma of bacon and butter beans drifted in from the kitchen.

What was missing was Weatherspoon’s voice. While his friends usually bring the food or cook during get-togethers, Weatherspoon is counted on to supply the laughs. The 67-year-old with an expressive, cherubic face has a reputation for devastating one-liners, off-color game commentary, and stories — skewed somewhat for comedic effect — about people everybody knows in Gloster, a mill town in southern Mississippi too small to have strangers.

But shuffling from his bed to the living room had left him breathless. Weatherspoon took a puff from his inhaler, but his throat was locked and his chest was tight. He tried a joke on an old high school buddy across the room, and it fell flat, stalled between labored breaths.

His next utterance was darker, whispered to the person with the closest ear. “I thought I was dying last night,” Weatherspoon said. “For 20 minutes, I couldn’t get out of bed, couldn’t move.” An odd thought crossed his mind as he lay there, struggling for air. “I said, ‘Let me write something before I go. I want to tell about my life. I want to put it all down.’”

The story of Weatherspoon’s late middle age might have chronicled an energetic man who still liked to jog, grow okra and peppers in his garden, chase after women, and make his friends laugh. But in 2014, a massive mill that turns trees into peanut-size pellets opened in Gloster, and “everything changed for everybody,” he said.

Operated by the British energy giant Drax, the mill and two newer ones in Louisiana — near Urania in the center of the state and Bastrop near the Arkansas line — churn out billions of pellets each year to meet surging overseas demand for electricity produced by burning wood, what the company markets as “sustainable biomass.” Alongside the mills, in communities of mostly poor, Black residents, the air is tainted with cancer-causing gases and tiny particles that can burrow deep into people’s lungs and trigger a long list of health troubles.

It’s not clear whether Drax’s activity has caused any particular individual’s health problems, but the mills release chemicals at levels federal regulators and scientists say can be toxic to humans.

In living rooms around Gloster, on front porches, and between the crumbling facades and boarded windows along the town’s main street, it’s hard to find anyone who doesn’t believe their life was better before the mill, called Amite Bioenergy.

“When I go out, I can’t hardly catch my breath,” said Helen Reed, a Gloster native. “Everything is worse since Drax came here.”

Tucked into a remote corner of southwest Mississippi, Gloster is exposed to more particulate matter and releases of toxic air than most parts of the country, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Rates of cancer, asthma, and heart disease are substantially higher than the national average. Gloster has other industrial facilities, but the EPA lists the Drax mill as the region’s only major emitter of toxic air pollutants.

Wood pellets have been touted by European countries as a greener, climate-friendly alternative to coal and gas. Made from sawdust and comparatively cheap trees grown in the American South, pellets now power a large share of the United Kingdom’s electrical grid. Drax has turned the U.K.’s largest coal power station, a mile-wide complex in rural Yorkshire, into what is essentially an immense wood stove fueled with Mississippi and Louisiana pine.

Raking in billions of dollars in both profits and government subsidies, Drax foresees substantial growth in the coming years — especially in the U.S., where it’s planning new mills and an ambitious push into the booming carbon capture and storage business.

In Gloster, the industry promised prosperity for the town’s 850 residents when Drax’s mill opened 11 years ago. Gloster, Urania, and Bastrop had once been booming mill towns, producing pulp, paper, and lumber for a global market. When those mills closed in the 2000s, the local economies collapsed. Drax was seen as a godsend — a rejuvenator of the jobs, money, and pride that come with a mill that roars with life. But many people say they’ve received little more than noise, dust, and toxic air: The three nearly identical Drax mills in Mississippi and Louisiana have been forced to pay millions of dollars for hundreds of pollution violations over the past five years.

In Urania, a central Louisiana town about two hours northwest of Gloster, the penalties are having little effect, said Glen Henderson, a longtime Urania resident who lives a mile from Drax’s LaSalle BioEnergy mill. “I was born and raised in the area, and I love it here,” he said. “But if I get a chance, I’m definitely going to move.”

Hassled by the mill’s lights and noise at night and sawdust coating his car in the morning, the peace and quiet Henderson hoped to enjoy in retirement disappeared when Drax opened the mill in late 2017.

“We’ve always been a mill town,” he said. “I worked in the old mill after high school. But the mills we had around here weren’t like this. This is something else.”

Michelli Martin, a Drax spokesperson, said the company is making strides to reduce pollution. “The safety of our people and the communities in which we operate is our priority, and we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously,” Martin said. “As a company dedicated to sustainable energy production, high standards of safety and environmental compliance are always our top priority.”

Drax’s mill has only hastened Gloster’s decline, said Carmella Wren-Causey at her home on the town’s edge, where subsidized apartments abut a dense monocrop of loblolly pines. “We’re being poisoned slowly, right before our eyes,” she said. Tears ran down her cheeks and slid under the plastic tubes funneling oxygen to her nose. Diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Wren-Causey’s breathing has become so difficult that she can barely keep up with her grandson, a toddler who was scooting his bike near her oxygen tank.

“God gave me breath when he gave me life,” said Wren-Causey, who blames the mill for her declining health. “Nobody should tamper with that. But Drax took it away.”

Breaking rules again and again

When Patrick Anderson, an environmental attorney, first tried to convince Mississippi’s environmental regulators that Drax was violating the state’s pollution laws, he boiled things down to a simple equation: 1 = 1.

Because testing showed one large pellet mill in Florida had been emitting about 1,000 tons of volatile organic compounds, known as VOCs, every year, it stood to reason that the virtually identical mill in Gloster was emitting roughly the same amount, he told the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality in 2017.

But Drax was claiming its Gloster mill was keeping its emissions lower than 250 tons per year, the threshold that distinguishes “minor” from “major” sources of VOCs, a classification of pollutants that are harmful to breathe, especially for children, elderly people, and those who suffer from asthma and other lung conditions.

The minor-source designation allowed Drax to avoid more stringent regulations and higher costs associated with installing and maintaining pollution-control technologies. “One of the most troubling trends in the wood pellet industry is that facilities that should face the most rigorous air permitting standards are actually the least controlled and the dirtiest,” Anderson wrote in a 2018 report for the Environmental Integrity Project.

A year after the report, Anderson was proved right. In 2019, Drax disclosed to Mississippi regulators that the Gloster facility had been emitting an average of 796 tons of VOCs per year — more than three times the limit allowed under its permit, according to documents obtained through public records requests.

The revelation resulted in a $2.5 million fine from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality in 2020 and elicited surprise and anger from Gloster’s residents, many of whom said they were unaware the mill posed risks to their health.

“When I first started having trouble breathing, I thought God was punishing me — but it wasn’t God doing that,” said Weatherspoon, who believes the mill’s emissions and his declining health are linked.

In a letter to Mississippi’s regulators a few years later, Drax attributed its underestimated emissions for the Gloster mill to a lack of experience with pellet production. “The pellet production industry is a relatively young industry,” the letter said. “Several wood pellet facilities, not only Amite BioEnergy LLC, initially underestimated emissions in connection with the permitting of these facilities.”

In neighboring Louisiana, state regulators also found that Drax had been breaking air quality rules. Drax’s mill near Bastrop, for instance, was supposed to cap its VOC emissions at 250 tons but had actually been releasing about 1,100 tons per year, according to a company filing with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. In 2022, the state agency reached a legal settlement in which Drax paid $3.2 million but admitted no wrongdoing.

That settlement was the largest in more than a decade for Louisiana’s environmental regulators. But to Anderson, who now works for the Southern Environmental Law Center, it was also the extent of any serious efforts to rein in Drax’s pollution in Louisiana.

When Mississippi determined in early 2023 that the Gloster mill had also far exceeded the allowable limits of what regulators call “hazardous air pollutants,” Anderson asked Louisiana’s regulators if the mills in Urania and Bastrop were doing the same.

It was a question they couldn’t answer. A Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality spokesperson said the agency doesn’t require Drax to conduct routine testing for hazardous air pollutants, which include nearly 190 chemicals known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, and other serious problems, or a similar group of chemicals the agency refers to as “toxic air pollutants.” The state’s regulators also don’t conduct their own testing at Drax’s mills.

In Mississippi, the hazardous pollutants Drax released into the air above Gloster included methanol, acrolein, and tons of formaldehyde, a chemical that’s far worse than being merely carcinogenic. “It’s also mutagenic and neurodegenerative, which is as awful as that sounds,” said Aisha Dickerson, an environmental health researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Formaldehyde has the potential to both mutate human cells and trigger brain disorders, affecting memory, learning ability, and behavior.

Anderson said it’s mind-boggling that Louisiana won’t test for chemicals it knows can cause cancer and a host of other illnesses. In his yearslong campaign to get the state to change its ways, he attempted the 1 = 1 tactic, demonstrating that the Gloster mill is comparable to the Bastrop mill in Louisiana and likely has similar pollution levels.

Drax itself has called the Gloster and Bastrop mills “nearly identical.” In letters to Mississippi’s regulators, the company attempted to avoid additional emissions testing by arguing that the Bastrop mill in Louisiana was so similar to the one in Mississippi that testing from one should apply to the other. “The (Bastrop) facility was built at the same time and is very similar to Amite, such that it has the exact same process design, equipment, production, rates, and the fiber is procured from a similar wood basket,” the company wrote.

In 2024, Drax admitted to what Anderson had been saying for years. Buried several pages into the company’s permit updates, Drax noted that both of its Louisiana mills had exceeded their “minor source” limits for hazardous air pollutants. Drax didn’t say specifically how much it had been violating the 25-ton limit for these contaminants, but the company noted a “proposed emission rate” of nearly 40 tons, according to permitting documents.

Despite Drax’s admission, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has yet to issue fines, and a spokesman declined to say what steps, if any, the agency has taken to get Drax to comply with its emissions rules. The spokesman also did not answer several questions about its enforcement actions and air quality monitoring practices.

Allegations about Drax have also come from within. In 2020, Louisiana regulators received an anonymous complaint from someone with intimate knowledge of Drax’s two mills in the state. It contained a host of allegations about chemical releases, manipulated data, ignored safety testing, and poor wastewater management. The most serious accusation was that “each facility has literally hundreds of hours of uncontrolled venting” of harmful chemicals annually, including episodes that “would easily” exceed limits on acrolein, a chemical that can irritate eyes and lungs and, according to scientists, is “probably carcinogenic.”

“Any mention of these items will cause senior management to threaten termination,” the complaint said. It also alleged that the two mills “manipulate” data “to avoid defined permit deviations.”

When the state’s inspectors followed up, they found no evidence of emissions violations in data and equipment records provided by Drax. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality’s inspection report did not address the alleged threats of firings or manipulated data. Inspectors partially substantiated the allegations about improper waste disposal: During an inspection of the Urania mill, they found that Drax was burning waste sludge without a permit.

Drax denied the allegations, noting that the waste-disposal issue was “not a normal condition” and that the company continually works with regulators to address environmental concerns.

The ultrafine dust expelled by Drax’s mills is another major health concern, Dickerson said. The particles released during a mill’s operations are so tiny that they can slip past the lung’s defenses and penetrate the bloodstream.

“Eventually, these particles can be transported to the brain and other organs,” Dickerson said, listing cognitive impairment and stroke among the problems that can develop. “You may not see symptoms immediately, but constant exposure could mean issues down the line.”

Drax has made several upgrades and changes to reduce emissions, particularly VOCs. In 2021, the company installed a thermal oxidizer at the Gloster mill that breaks down these compounds.

“We care deeply about the safety of our people and the residents of the communities in which we operate, and we take our environmental responsibilities and compliance extremely seriously,” said Matt White, vice president of Drax’s North American operations. “Compliance is at the foundation of everything we do, and we have invested a lot of hours and resources with the goal of continuously improving our operations.”

Despite the upgrades, Drax continues to incur fines for pollution violations. In late 2024, Drax agreed to pay $225,000 for exceeding the Gloster mill’s limits for hazardous air pollutants, particularly methanol. The state also cited Drax for failing to conduct required emissions tests and maintain pollution controls and proper records.

The company’s financial penalties, which add up to about $6 million, are dwarfed by its profits, which have topped $1 billion in recent years. “Drax is so profitable and so subsidized that it powers through all of this,” Anderson said. “The fines don’t hurt their bottom line.”

In April 2025, amid complaints from residents, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, or MDEQ, denied Drax permission to increase its emissions. Six months later, it reversed that decision, allowing the Gloster mill to become a “major source” of hazardous air pollutants. The October 15 permit ruling essentially gives Drax permission to release pollutants at the levels that got it in trouble when it was classified as a minor emitter.

A group of Gloster residents immediately filed a federal lawsuit against Drax, alleging that the company unlawfully exposed people to “massive amounts of toxic pollutants.”

Drax has “consistently failed to meet their legal obligations not to dump pollutants … and have continued to denude U.S. forests, all for the benefit of a British company,” the lawsuit alleges.

In a motion to dismiss the case, Drax’s lawyers argued that the lawsuit fails to show “particularized injury that is traceable to (the Gloster mill’s) conduct.”

A representative from the MDEQ declined to comment on the permit decision and lawsuit but said that “MDEQ takes seriously its obligations to protect human health and the environment.”

A Drax spokesperson said the company was “pleased that (MDEQ) has listened to the clear recommendations of its own technical staff and the voices of Gloster community leaders, local businesses, and a large number of our neighbors in Gloster,” adding that the “permit will allow our plant to continue to operate, enabling us to continue providing much needed well-paying jobs in this rural corner of Mississippi, and support hundreds more across the state’s forestry and lumber industries.”

The spokesperson said that “MDEQ’s conditions, inspection regime, and our commitment to continue to invest in compliance and improving operational standards will ensure that Drax at Amite operates as safely and efficiently as possible.”

The pellet town ‘algorithm’?

Pellet manufacturers seem to have a particular set of criteria that guides them to places like Gloster, Urania, and Bastrop, said Erika Walker, an epidemiologist at Brown University who has been researching the effects of noise and pollution in communities that host pellet mills.

“It’s like there’s an algorithm that tells you where vulnerable communities are, and where people are not going to ask questions,” she said. “If you need to piss on the side of the road, where do you go? A dark area where nobody’s looking.”

Pellet mills in the South are 50 percent more likely to be located in communities with a high proportion of poor and nonwhite residents, according to a 2018 study by researchers from Tufts University and the Dogwood Alliance, a forest conservation group based in North Carolina. Of the 32 mills assessed in nine Southern states, including Mississippi and Louisiana, 18 were in counties or parishes with poverty rates above the state median. Louisiana and Mississippi are tied for the highest levels of poverty in the United States at 14 percent, according to federal data. The national rate is just under 9 percent.

Across the Deep South, state and local leaders are so desperate for economic activity that they don’t ask critical questions about what the facilities may mean for the environment or people’s health, said Dickerson of Johns Hopkins. “These communities all seem to have low-income, historically marginalized residents who might not have the time or resources to fight a permit allowing a pellet mill to come in,” she said.

In Gloster and Bastrop, Black residents make up nearly 80 percent of the population, and more than 30 percet live under the poverty line, making less than $15,650 a year. Urania’s 700 residents are mostly white but look worse off economically. According to census data, the town had a poverty rate of 40 percent and a median household income of $12,400 — about a fifth of the national average.

Martin, the Drax spokesperson, denied that Drax is drawn to areas with few white people and high poverty. “The inference that Drax uses an ‘algorithm’ to take advantage of communities is untrue,” she said. “Drax uses a number of criteria to identify and select pellet mill locations, including proximity to low-grade roundwood and sawmill residuals, transport links, and access to local supply chain.”

Walker said that Drax could alleviate many concerns about pollution if the company built its mills far from where people live. The best place to put a mill is “in the middle of the woods,” she said. The Drax mill near Bastrop may approach this ideal. Located 10 miles north of the town, the mill is surrounded by forested tracts interspersed with logging roads.

“Honest to pea, I didn’t even know it was there,” said Linda Coker, who lives nearly 2 miles from the mill and is one of its nearest neighbors.

In Urania, Drax’s LaSalle BioEnergy sits just outside the town’s limits, but a school, medical center, two churches, and several homes sit within a mile of it.

The facility’s location in Gloster is particularly troubling, Walker said. It abuts a mobile home park and other houses and is about a mile from a children’s day care center. “Literally, my first question when I visited Gloster was, ‘Who zoned this?’” she said. “It’s right out in the open. No acoustical barriers, no buffer of trees. It was shocking to see it operating right in the middle of the community.”

Noise, dust and questions

When the town of Urania was carved out of pine forests more than a century ago, its founder, a timber baron with a visionary streak, promised two often-incompatible things: industry and tranquility.

In the late 1890s, Henry Hardtner knew “the living was really rough” around his expanding lumber mill, so he platted Urania far enough away from his business that his workers could enjoy “a welcome relief” from the noise, dust, and smoke, a local newspaper recounted in 1968. The town, nestled among towering, sweet-scented longleaf pines, was named after the Greek goddess of the stars because, in Hardtner’s view, the site was downright “heavenly.”

Henderson, the Urania resident who lives a mile from the Drax mill, wishes Hardtner could see Urania now. He’d have Hardtner sit with him on his porch at 2 a.m. to listen to the near-constant clanging and banging from the LaSalle BioEnergy mill and see its lights glowing over the tops of an ever-thinning band of trees nearly a mile away. At daybreak, Henderson would show off the powdery substance coating his truck.

“This noise and dust — what are the long-term effects of all that?” he asked. “Nobody seems to know, or they don’t want to know.”

There has been little scientific research into the environmental and health impacts of the relatively new wood pellet industry, but that’s starting to change. In 2024, Walker received a $5.8 million federal grant to conduct the first study of emissions from wood pellet mills on human health in the U.S. Awarded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the grant is funding a research team that’s in the early phases of a five-year study focusing on the noise, particulate matter, VOCs, and other emissions from Drax’s Gloster mill.

The first study by Walker’s team, which includes researchers from the University of Mississippi and Drexel University, found that the noise levels in the small towns with pellet mills approach those of big cities. “The noise pollution in Gloster rivals my neighborhood, which is by an interstate in a big, industrial city,” said Walker, who lives just outside Providence, Rhode Island.

Noise from the Gloster mill’s operations and a steady stream of truck traffic to and from the facility sometimes topped 70 decibels and rarely fell below 41 decibels. The rural Mississippi town of Mendenhall, which is similar in size to Gloster but lacks a pellet mill, was typically 10 decibels quieter. “That’s an enormous difference,” Walker said. “It’s like turning a faucet into Niagara Falls.”

In Urania, Henderson said the mill seems loudest at night and in the early morning, producing a discordant clattering when he’s trying to sleep. It’s especially bad on windy nights.

“Get a north wind, and it’s rockin’ and rollin’,” he said. “It sounds like logs tumbling in a dryer.”

The impacts of noise pollution on human health are often overlooked or ignored, but a growing body of research has linked chronic exposure to high blood pressure, heart attacks, anxiety, and depression.

“Noise disrupts your sleep, disrupts your mood, and sets off a stress response that’s like your ‘fight or flight’ response, which makes your body ready to fight a threat or run from it,” Walker said. “The constant stimulation of that response can cause all kinds of health problems.”

Drax says it follows all federal guidelines on noise abatement and conducts annual surveys of its mills’ sound levels, which it characterizes as no worse than other industrial facilities.

“We also go above and beyond to insulate our buildings to mitigate any noise that would come from the hammermill and help prevent it from being audible beyond the fence line,” Martin said. “The noise from facility operation is consistent with the surrounding industrial plants and does not contribute to significant impacts above existing background noise.”

Walker’s research is ongoing, but a few preliminary findings have emerged. One is that air pollution is magnitudes higher in Gloster, especially with VOCs, she said. Data from dozens of air pollution monitors installed around the town show clouds of pollutants concentrated around the mill and in neighboring residential areas. It also showed unexpected spikes during the night. That matches the experiences of some in Gloster who said they notice foul odors and find it more difficult to breathe after dark. “At night, it’s always worse,” Weatherspoon said. “It smells disgusting.”

This could indicate pollution “dumping” during certain hours when people are less aware of the pollution, Walker said.

Drax denied that the mill releases more pollution at night. “Any suggestion that we manipulate our operations to avoid complaints or detection is completely false,” Martin said.

Another surprising trend was found in Gloster’s children. The closer a child lived to the mill, the heavier their body weight, the researchers found. “That was shocking,” said Walker, who has visited Gloster and communicates regularly with residents. “It fits with some of the things we heard at community meetings. People are steeped in the idea that you don’t want your kids playing outside because the air’s polluted. If they’re staying inside, how are they getting physical activity?”

The widening base of research is leading some residents to think that the pervasive health problems in Gloster may be tied to the air they breathe, said Wren-Causey, who is a plaintiff in the lawsuit against Drax. “It’s not just people’s lifestyles or the work they do,” she said. “It’s about what Drax is putting into the air. Now people are making a ruckus. People are starting to open their eyes.”

Sitting in his living room while his friends watched football, Weatherspoon said witnessing the dual decline of his body and his town has sparked an anger that his doctor warned could further harm his health.

“The doctor tells me, ‘Don’t get pissed off or you’re gonna die,’” he said. A friend nodded in agreement, telling Weatherspoon he really should take it easy. Weatherpoon shook his head. “When I think about what’s happened to me and what’s happening here, I get pissed off in a heartbeat,” he said.

Late in the football game, an out-of-town guest got up to leave. Weatherspoon tossed him a little gallows humor on the way out.

“Don’t come back here if you want to keep living,” he said. “It’s no joke.”

Grid managers have instructed the country’s largest electricity providers to postpone routine maintenance on power plants and lines to ensure that those resources are available during and after the storm. Heavy snow and freezing rain weigh down tree branches and power lines, causing failures that can cripple energy systems.

Frigid cold also drives up electricity demand as heating appliances require more energy and run longer. Extreme winter weather has expanded utility peak demand in the United States beyond summer to include winter. As a result, utilities have less time to maintain and upgrade equipment, making the grid less reliable and raising energy costs for consumers.

“When you get one day of cold weather, it’s not as significant. But we’re talking about three or four days here of very low temperatures,” said Douglas Giuffre, who leads U.S. power and renewables research for S&P Global Energy.

The utility industry has been preparing for extreme weather by, among other things, upgrading equipment and trimming trees around power lines. Ahead of the storm, power companies said they had activated line crews to help restore power when equipment was damaged.

Exelon, a utility with customers from Illinois to New Jersey, said it was prepared. “Exelon is currently investing $38 billion to modernize and harden our transmission and distribution systems to make the grid more resilient, flexible and better able to withstand increasingly severe storms,” said Mike Innocenzo, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Exelon.

The energy secretary, Chris Wright, said on Thursday that the federal government had ordered that unused backup generators at data centers and “other major facilities” be made available to grids to help prevent blackouts.

The coming storm will arrive about five years after a massive winter storm caused extensive blackouts across much of Texas.

The state’s electric grid, which is largely isolated from grids in the rest of the country, was ill prepared for that storm, according to a report published by the University of Texas at Austin. Grid managers did not anticipate the severity of the storm and underestimated how much demand for electricity would rise when the weather turned bad.

All kinds of power sources failed during that storm, but the state’s natural gas power plants and pipelines played a central role. A lot of pipelines and power plant equipment froze or malfunctioned, forcing generators offline and leaving many residents shivering in their homes for days. The state has estimated that more than 200 people died because of that storm.

“We’re better prepared in some respects, but we still could be better prepared in others,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.

Dr. Rhodes remains concerned about the system for transporting natural gas from production sites in West Texas and elsewhere to the power plants that burn the gas to generate electricity. Much like household pipes, natural gas pipelines and other equipment that is not properly insulated can freeze, interrupting the supply of fuel to power plants.

Up to two-thirds of natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin, which lies in Texas and New Mexico, experienced an outage during the winter storm five years ago, the University of Texas report found.

“When it happens to the big guys, that’s when there’s a noticeable loss of gas going to the power plants and people’s houses,” said Suzie Boyd, whose company, Caballo Loco Midstream, operates networks of small natural gas pipelines in West Texas and New Mexico.

Caballo Loco was injecting antifreeze into its systems, wrapping equipment with tarps and preparing to heat pipes if needed to keep them warm through the freezing rain forecast for its area beginning on Friday. Ms. Boyd’s son even planned to sleep on a cot in a field office, she said. “We’re bracing ourselves.”

The potent winter storm that has meteorologists and residents on edge is expected to begin on Friday in the Rocky Mountains and make its way across the country through the weekend, bringing wintry precipitation to more than 160 million people from the Southwest into New England.

Officials in Texas and neighboring states were especially concerned by a forecast for a dangerous combination of freezing rain, sleet and snow that could coat trees, power lines and roads.

Even if electric grids can withstand the bad weather, consumers are likely to feel the impact for weeks to come.

Natural gas prices have already begun to rise. Production often falls during storms like this, sometimes considerably.

“It’s not necessarily the temperature itself, it’s the rate of change of temperature that’s important, and then being able to respond to that,” said Sarah Fenton, an executive vice president at Pittsburgh-based EQT, one of the country’s largest natural gas producers.

The dangerous conditions are likely to take a bigger toll on lower-income Americans, many of whom live in poorly insulated homes and have struggled with rising energy costs. Losing power during a storm could make them even more vulnerable.

“A major storm isn’t just a reliability event — it’s an affordability shock,” said Mark Wolfe, an economist and executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an organization of state officials who administer the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. “Vulnerable families are more likely to face outages, lost wages, spoiled food and higher bills in the weeks that follow, making shut-off protections and bill-payment relief critical to recovery.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/23/multimedia/23biz-storm-power-jpfk/23biz-storm-power-jpfk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 05:39:55.082695

They asked the Public Service Commission to require the groups to consolidate their questions and concerns about the natural gas plant at the beginning of the month, according to docket filings.

Duke Energy applied to build a 1,400 megawatt natural gas plant in Anderson County last summer.","Utilities are using a new South Carolina energy law to justify a request environmental advocates argue will tamp opposition to a proposed massive natural gas plant in Colleton County.

The Sierra Club, a national environmental nonprofit, wants to participate in a Public Service Commission case determining whether a proposed large natural gas plant in Colleton County properly protects the environment and ratepayers. Two local nonprofits, the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, jointly applied to intervene in the same case.

Utilities Dominion Energy and state-owned Santee Cooper argued the environmental groups had similar missions and concerns about the proposed plant. They asked the Public Service Commission to require the groups to consolidate their questions and concerns about the natural gas plant at the beginning of the month, according to docket filings.

Consolidating the groups’ concerns will avoid delays during the permitting process of the plant, the utilities argued in a filing with the Public Service Commission. Plus, a state law signed in 2025 aimed at boosting generation amid skyrocketing demand for power justified the request, Dominion and Santee Cooper argued.

The law changed how rates are set and how energy projects are permitted, in addition to allowing Santee Cooper and Dominion to work together on the roughly 2,200 megawatt Colleton County gas plant. The utilities will split the generated energy and $5 billion cost. Dominion and Santee Cooper asked to build the plant in mid-December, so a decision will be made by the Public Service Commission by mid-June, under the energy law’s six-month deadline

The timeline for intervenors to present their case and the push to consolidate parties “stacks the deck” against them, said Sari Amiel, a Sierra Club attorney assigned to the case.

“It’s making it very hard for us to make arguments that represent the public interest and consumer interests,” Amiel said.

The energy law was intended to cut “red tape” for energy projects to gain approval, said state Rep. Gil Gatch, R-Dorchester. Gatch was a proponent of the bill last year. He said conservation groups sometimes slow down permitting of energy projects or rate cases, costing utilities for delays. The energy law did not prevent conservation groups or other intervenors from fully participating in a permitting case, he said.

“Conservationists, and God love them, but they always, in a litigious way, will hold up siting and all kinds of energy related litigation that goes on before the Public Service Commission,” Gatch said.

“So what it does is it not only makes it more expensive because all those costs get pushed on to the ratepayer, but it also creates a huge lag, which creates more costs,” he continued.

New energy generation, including natural gas, is badly needed in South Carolina as coal plants retire and population grows, Gatch said.

“The Canadys plant, and other plants like it, are important to get up and running to meet the needs and the crisis that’s down the road,” he said.

Allowing the public, including environmental nonprofits, to voice their concerns is important because the Canadys plant will impact ratepayers and the environment, said Taylor Allred, a state energy and climate director at Coastal Conservation League, one of the intervenors.

“This is a very big project, a very consequential project, and it’s going to be a testing ground for kind of how this new framework plays out,” Allred said.

The debate over if the Colleton County natural gas plant is aligned with environmental and consumer interests coincides with a proposal for another gas plant in the Upstate, straining resources further for intervenors, Allred said. Duke Energy applied to build a 1,400 megawatt natural gas plant in Anderson County last summer.

Can utilities combine conservationists?

Dominion and Santee Cooper want two separate parties representing environmental interests to compare their concerns and questions for the Canadys natural gas plant and consolidate any similar issues.

Both Sierra Club and the Coastal Conservation League oppose such a measure, arguing it would compromise their integrity to divulge information to one another.

“This notion is absurd, and it’s simply an attempt to take away time and resources from environmental interveners seeking to represent environmental interests in an environmental proceeding,” Allred said.

“We would have to basically run anything in our case past the other party’s clients as well,” Amiel said. “So it would be limiting our ability to litigate our respective cases.”

Both utilities argued they have a right to request intervenors to consolidate. Santee Cooper spokesperson Mollie Gore wrote in an email the law allows for “robust participation” from other parties.

“The long-held ability to consolidate representation for parties with similar interests provides Commissioners the opportunity to efficiently consider the evidence in reaching a deliberate and thoughtful decision,” Gore wrote in an email.

Where that ability comes from has also been up for debate. When Dominion and Santee Cooper asked for environmental nonprofits to consolidate, they cited the General Assembly’s 2025 energy law.

But the ability for the Public Service Commission to consolidate intervenors at the request of utilities has been in South Carolina’s siting law for decades, which lawyers for the environmental groups pointed out in their response.

The utilities say the energy law’s intention and readoption of the siting code reaffirmed their right to request consolidation.

“Consolidation of parties with substantially similar interests, such as CCL/SACE and Sierra Club, advances that legislative purpose by reducing duplicative discovery, motions practice, and cross-examination, thereby ensuring a prompt and efficient conclusion of this proceeding,” a filing from Dominion and Santee Cooper reads.",https://www.thestate.com/public/latest-news/qbig43/picture285996061/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMG_7289.JPG,N,,2026-01-23 05:40:07.009535

America’s electricity costs have jumped 32% in just the past five years.
But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.
Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.
In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation increased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.","As America moves into 2026, consumers are looking for relief from an ongoing “affordability crisis.” While prices for some key items have mercifully held steady, or even come down, other costs such as rent, dining out, and hospital visits continue to climb unabated.

U.S. electricity, the one sector that affects all consumer industries in some way, is also racing upward. America’s electricity costs have jumped 32% in just the past five years. That’s a major problem for our new digital economy.

Why are electricity prices rising so rapidly? Soaring power demand, particularly from data centers, is colliding with an electric grid already stretched to the limit. Add to that natural gas price volatility and we can see why America’s families are getting squeezed in an “affordability” crunch.

Exacerbating matters is the legacy of the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on America’s coal and natural gas power plants. The Biden team was singularly focused on reducing carbon emissions. But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.

Peak U.S. power demand is expected to jump 166 gigawatts in just the next five years, thanks to the vast needs of artificial intelligence and the data center boom. That’s 15 times the peak electricity needs of New York City.

This is unsustainable without more “dispatchable power,” the reliable, on-demand electricity generation provided by many of the very power plants the Biden administration sought to eliminate.

In parts of the U.S., electricity supplies are now stretched so thin that grid operators and regulators are scrambling to avoid power shortfalls. The nation’s top grid reliability regulator recently called the situation a “five-alarm fire.”

To its credit, the Trump administration is working feverishly to stop the bleeding. Instead of cutting power plants from the grid, the administration is working to rapidly expand the supply of on-demand power in the United States. As a first step, that means retaining the nation’s coal-generating capacity. Doing so could bolster grid reliability and ease some of the current price inflation.

We know this works because America’s coal fleet is already being tapped as a buffer against rapidly rising natural gas prices. Because natural gas is the leading fuel for both electricity generation and home heating, even a small change in prices can have a large impact on consumers. Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.

Fortunately for consumers, low-cost coal generation is still an option amidst rising natural gas prices. In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation increased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.

Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.

The path to lower electricity prices is through abundant, reliable energy. Using policy tools to grow America’s supply of electricity—not tear it down—will be essential to keeping the lights on this winter and taking the bite out of electricity price inflation.",https://thedailyrecord.com/files/2026/01/MBK_Column.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 05:39:58.687914

Rio Tinto and Glencore are back in merger talks that could create a US$260bn mining powerhouse, reshaping global supply of key metals like copper and iron

The global mining industry could be on the brink of major transformation as two of the sector's heavyweights, Rio Tinto and Glencore, have resumed merger negotiations.

Glencore's interest in acquiring Rio Tinto dates back as early as the 2008 financial crash, while the most concrete discussions about a merger took place in 2014, though Rio Tinto rejected Glencore's approaches.

Talks were again abandoned in March 2025, though both companies confirmed last week they are in ""preliminary discussions"" regarding a ""possible combination of some or all of their businesses, which could include an all-share merger"".

Today, with talks back on, it is thought that a deal would create an entity valued at over US$260bn, positioning it among the most influential resource companies in the entire world.

The role the global energy market is playing in these renewed negotiations is profound, with shifting attitudes and outlooks on coal contributing to the amenability of the organisations to a deal.

2. Trump at the WEF: What Did He Say About Energy at Davos?

US President Donald Trump's speech at Davos focused on the future of the US energy landscape, while also criticising the EU and China over energy

When US President Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos this week, his remarks on energy policy sparked immediate controversy among the global elite gathered in the Swiss Alps.

The President's forceful critique of renewable energy initiatives, as well as his departure from the climate consensus that has dominated recent forums, marked a significant shift in transatlantic energy discourse.

When addressing the WEF on 21 January, President Trump wasted no time in outlining his administration's approach to American energy infrastructure.

His announcement that the US would be opening fossil fuel energy plants rather than closing them down represents a challenge to the decarbonisation strategies pursued by many of the world's nations.

Trump framed this move as a matter of economic pragmatism, positioning traditional energy sources as essential to American competitiveness and affordability going forward.

The administration's plans extend beyond merely maintaining existing infrastructure.

The President revealed that his government would be actively removing wind turbines rather than constructing new ones, describing what he termed the ""Green New Scam"" as a misguided consensus that has led countries astray.

This characterisation of renewable energy policy as fundamentally flawed economic thinking set the tone for his broader critique of European energy strategies and aligns with much of his recent criticism of the bloc as a whole.

3. UK Warm Homes Plan: What Homeowners & Businesses Can Expect

The UK Government's Warm Homes Plan targets fuel poverty with solar panels, heat pumps and batteries, backed by Octopus Energy, Centrica and E.ON

The UK has just launched the largest home upgrade programme in the country’s history committing £15bn (US$20bn) in public investment to retrofit up to five million homes with solar panels, heat pumps and battery storage by 2030.

The Warm Homes Plan, which was announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband on 20 January, aims to lift one million families out of fuel poverty while accelerating the electrification of domestic heating.

The initiative comes at a moment when the UK is grappling with the legacy of volatile gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which cost the UK £183bn (US$246bn) according to climate think tank E3G.

The plan is has three main strands:

Direct support for low-income households

Universal access to government-backed loans

New regulations for rental properties

Low-income families stand to receive fully-funded installations worth up to £12,000 (US$16,096), covering solar panels, batteries and heat pumps depending on suitability.

The government plans to focus on neighbourhoods too, rather than individual properties. As such, social housing residents could see entire streets upgraded simultaneously.

4. Shell: What the World's Energy System Will Look Like in 2100

In its 2026 Energy Security Scenarios report, Shell maps out three different routes the energy transition could take in the years leading up to 2100

This month, Shell published the third edition of its Energy Security Scenarios report, a series in which it uses predictive modelling to forecast the future of the world's energy landscape.

In the document, which follows on from instalments in 2023 and 2025, the British energy giant includes three separate scenarios, which it calls 'Archipelagos', 'Surge' and 'Horizon'. Each of these models include different projections of how the planet's energy system will look by the year 2100.

The scenarios try to make sense of the moment the energy world finds itself in, where 80% of global power comes from fossil fuels but where the capacity of renewable sources has grown tenfold in the past decade.

It is not just the flux of the energy system itself that Shell factors into its analysis either. Each of the firm's different timelines synthesise all manner of externalities, including trade wars, AI and climate politics to paint three distinct pictures of the world at the turn of the next century.

Dr Mallika Ishwaran, who is Shell’s Chief Economist and a key member of the Shell Scenarios team, recently appeared on The Energy Podcast, which is produced by Shell, to speak about the company's methodology when creating the scenario reports.

“Scenarios are genuinely a multidisciplinary effort,"" she explains. ""The process of developing the scenarios draws on, firstly, the knowledge and expertise in energy markets and energy modelling.

“It incorporates economics, whether that is the macroeconomic context for the scenarios or the economics around specific technologies, policies or behaviour changes.

“And finally it brings in the geopolitical lens that is so essential when thinking about energy. It is a combination of these different perspectives that provides a richness to our scenarios.”

Limited (CATL) introduced its new Tianxing II battery series for light commercial vehicles on January 22, 2026. The standout of the lineup is the low-temperature sodium-ion version, marking the first mass-produced sodium-ion battery in the industry.

The sodium-ion battery pack offers a capacity of 45 kWh, an energy density of 175 Wh/kg, and an impressive cycle life exceeding 10,000 cycles. It is also the first battery globally to be certified under China’s new GB 38031-2025 national safety standard. Designed specifically for small vans, microvans, and light trucks, this battery targets commercial vehicles operating in demanding environments.

One of its biggest advantages over traditional lithium-ion batteries is exceptional cold-weather performance. Even in extreme conditions as low as -40°C, the battery retains 90% of its usable capacity. It can also be charged immediately when completely frozen at -30°C, effectively eliminating the winter-related operational issues that plague electric commercial vehicles in colder regions.

Beyond performance, sodium-ion technology brings major cost benefits. Sodium is more than 1,000 times more abundant than lithium in the Earth’s crust, and its extraction costs are roughly one-twentieth that of lithium. Over time, this is expected to significantly reduce battery costs and improve the economic viability of light commercial electric vehicles.

In addition to the sodium-ion model, the Tianxing II series includes three lithium-ion variants, each tailored to specific commercial use cases:

– Fast-Charging Version: Equipped with high-rate charging technology, this version can charge from 20% to 80% in just 18 minutes. For a typical 100 kWh electric vehicle, a single fast-charging session can add around 150 kilometers of driving range.

– Long-Range Version: Setting a new benchmark for light commercial vehicles, this variant features a single-pack capacity of up to 253 kWh and delivers a maximum range of 800 kilometers. Designed for long-distance intercity logistics, it uses CATL’s Taishan pack architecture, reducing vehicle weight by approximately 260 kg compared to conventional batteries of similar capacity. This translates into higher payload capacity and lower energy consumption.

Aimed at last-mile delivery fleets and self-owned commercial vehicles in hot climates, this version uses a customized liquid-cooling thermal management system. It ensures stable fast-charging performance and long battery life even in high-temperature environments, making it ideal for short-distance, high-frequency operations such as supermarket deliveries and community distribution.

The Tianxing brand, launched by CATL in July 2024, is dedicated exclusively to commercial vehicle batteries. With the Tianxing II series, CATL is clearly pushing the boundaries of battery technology—especially with sodium-ion chemistry—while addressing real-world challenges faced by commercial electric vehicles.

If you favor one side or the other too much, everything gets thrown out of balance,” commented Commissioner Farley.
North Carolina is one of only four states in the nation with an elected labor commissioner; it is the only independent Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) State Plan state with an elected labor commissioner.
“What this means is the federal government makes the regulations, but the elected Labor Commissioner enforces them…we’ve opted out of federal enforcement,” explained Commissioner Farley.","At its annual Employment Law Symposium, Ward and Smith, P.A. invited North Carolina Labor Commissioner Luke Farley to share how employers can navigate the shifting landscape of workplace regulations, along with his vision for the future.

Commissioner Farley is the youngest Labor Commissioner to be elected in a century and the youngest sitting member of North Carolina’s Council of State. His mission is to make North Carolina the safest place to work and the best place to do business – creating an environment where, in the words of North Carolina’s State Toast, “the weak grow strong and the strong grow great.”

Before entering public service, Commissioner Farley spent 14 years in private practice, focused on workplace safety law. A graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill and Wake Forest University School of Law, he is committed to protecting workers and creating more job opportunities across the state.

The discussion was moderated by Avery Locklear, a labor and employment attorney, and Will Oden, a North Carolina Board Certified Specialist in Employment Law.

“I am always impressed when someone leaves a thriving career to enter public service,” said Oden. “What inspired you to do that?”

“I spent thousands of hours building my practice and enjoyed being an attorney, but I felt there was a higher calling for me,” Commissioner Farley explained. “I wanted to do something with my life that would have a bigger impact on the state and society as a whole, and public service was the way to do that.” When discussing the role of Labor Commissioner, he stated that he “thought it was important for someone with real-world experience to be in the role,” and that he “could bring a unique insight to the position.”

Growth vs. Enforcement

The North Carolina Department of Labor has to maintain a delicate balance between enforcing regulations and the need to create an environment where the economy can thrive. “Businesses create jobs, but the workers keep businesses running. If you favor one side or the other too much, everything gets thrown out of balance,” commented Commissioner Farley.

Farley, drawing on his private and public sector experience, volunteered that many employers that fail to follow the rules and regulations do so due to a lack of awareness. “I am an optimist,” and “see the folks that don’t look after their employees as a minority,” Commissioner Farley observed.

The complexity of state and federal regulations presents an obstacle for many employers. “Especially for small businesses, many just don’t have the resources,” explained Commissioner Farley. “My role is to connect them to the resources they need and achieve compliance. We educate before we regulate, however, for the bad apples that are out there, we are not afraid to issue citations.”

Nuances of Public Sector Leadership

Commissioner Farley is looking to infuse the culture of the Department of Labor with a service-oriented approach. “The employees we protect and the businesses we regulate are essentially customers of the department,” he said. “The workers are protected by regulations, and the employers can benefit from taking advantage of our educational programs.”

Motivating employees can be a challenge, as unlike the private sector, performance-based incentives do not exist. Further, the process for terminating an employee can be extremely lengthy and bureaucratic.

“I’m working on instilling a sense of mission into our workforce. Part of this means being present for everyone, so I’ve been traveling around the state to chat with people,” added Farley. “This also means I want to know if our employers or stakeholders have an interaction that is less than professional.” Commissioner Farley then provided his personal cell phone number to audience members for that purpose.

The structure of the North Carolina Department of Labor also impacts the type of services it provides to employees and employers. North Carolina is one of only four states in the nation with an elected labor commissioner; it is the only independent Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) State Plan state with an elected labor commissioner.

“What this means is the federal government makes the regulations, but the elected Labor Commissioner enforces them…we’ve opted out of federal enforcement,” explained Commissioner Farley. “That’s great for our businesses, because instead of dealing with bureaucrats in Atlanta or Richmond, you can talk to me. You have my cell phone.”

Consultative Services

“I like the ‘educate before regulate’ idea,” said Locklear.

“The on-site consultative services program is the best tool we have at the Department to build safer workplaces. It’s free, and there’s a firewall between our investigators and the consultative services arm. Basically, we want people to feel comfortable using the service, so that it will not result in a compliance inspection,” Commissioner Farley added.

Employers can take advantage of the consultative services offering by inviting NCDOL to their workplace. While there, department staff evaluate the workplace to identify potential issues that are not up to standards. If an identified issue is corrected within a certain time frame, there is no citation.

“I know from my private practice that the idea of inviting the Department of Labor into the workplace may sound a little crazy,” joked Commissioner Farley. “But I think about it like you can do something the easy way or the hard way. OSHA can randomly show up and issue a citation if something is wrong, or you can be proactive and reach out to consultative services.”

Commissioner Farley is focused on partnering with businesses to remedy potential hazards: “We are more interested in building collaborative relationships instead of something more adversarial.”

Oden: “For employers that participate in the consultative services program, do they receive any sort of safe harbor protection?”

“There’s not a legal safe harbor if there is a violation that occurs after a consultative visit; however, there is a credit provided for citations and penalty amounts,” explained Commissioner Farley. Arranging for a consultative services visit is treated as a show of good faith. “We want to incentivize the use of these programs,” added Commissioner Farley.

In addition to on-site consultative services, Commissioner Farley mentioned the Carolina Star Program. The Carolina Star Program is a safety recognition and certification program that does provide safe harbor for employers that participate. Only 146 employers have earned the certification out of a total of around 300,000 employers across the state, making it the Department of Labor’s highest level of recognition.

Because the process to receive the certification is extremely rigorous, employers that make it into the program are exempt from random inspections. “This is great PR,” notes Commissioner Farley, “since it shows you value your employees and are going above and beyond to ensure their safety.”

Informal Conferences

However, if employers are ever investigated and subsequently cited by the Department of Labor, participating in an informal conference is another strategy that employers should consider. The term refers to an opportunity to have a discussion with the Department after receiving a citation.

“Avery and I always recommend doing this. If nothing else, it’s a great education,” advised Oden, and “[i]t helps with building relationships” with the Department personnel.

Commissioner Farley has a strong belief in the value of informal conferences: “I told my staff they should make all reasonable efforts to resolve matters in an informal conference, and that every settlement offer proposed by an employer should get a response.”

In the past, settlement offers would not receive a counter if the terms were too far away from what the Department viewed as reasonable. “We respect it if someone makes a settlement offer and responds with a counter,” Commissioner Farley commented. “Employers should take advantage of this opportunity, especially under my administration. It can help avoid costly litigation.”

Future Goals

Moving forward, Commissioner Farley would like the Department to be viewed as a fair, balanced agency – one that listens to the concerns of both employers and employees. Providing exceptional customer service to all stakeholders is another strategic objective.

Reducing fatality rates is paramount to Commissioner Farley and the Department. Currently, the number one cause of workplace fatalities are workers being struck by equipment, a statistic that Commissioner Farley believes may be due to the rise of warehousing and e-commerce in North Carolina.

“To reduce those injuries, we’re starting an alliance program with key industry partners,” Commissioner Farley explained.

Employers may be able to sleep more easily knowing it is unusual for the Department to share information with other agencies. “I don’t go out of my way to share and I don’t think OSHA matters should be tied up in some other matter,” mentioned Commissioner Farley. “Of course, if I have a legal obligation to provide information, I will provide it.”

Essential Guidance

Commissioner Farley’s advice for employers is to be cooperative, collaborative, and transparent. “If the OSHA investigators get the sense you’re hiding something, their approach to the matter will change,” he commented. “Our inspectors are passionate about workplace safety. They will push very hard to find something if they think you’re being evasive, and I don’t restrain them from that.”

Further, Commissioner Farley wants people to know the Department is focused on being collaborative and promoting common sense regulations: “My job is to protect workers, but workers are only workers if they have jobs.”

The project will be built on private land at the site of a former aluminium smelter near Goldendale, Washington. Once operational, it is designed to provide up to 12 hours of energy storage and generate 1200MW.

“This is a landmark moment for the Pacific Northwest,” said Erik Steimle, Rye Development’s chief development officer. “With electricity demand and energy costs on the rise, this license represents a huge step toward a more reliable grid and affordable energy prices for the region.”

Electricity demand in the Pacific Northwest is projected to increase by more than 30% over the next decade. Developers say pumped storage hydropower can help manage peak demand and improve grid reliability by providing large-scale, long-duration energy storage.

Construction of the Goldendale project is expected to take four to five years and is projected to create more than 3000 jobs during that period, along with dozens of permanent operational positions. The project is also expected to generate more than $10m annually in local tax revenue for Klickitat County.

“The Goldendale Energy Storage Project is a win for middle-class, family-wage jobs and rural communities,” said Heather Kurtenbach, executive secretary of the Washington State Building & Construction Trades Council. “We’re excited to collaborate with Rye Development on what will be one of the largest construction projects southeastern Washington has seen in decades.”

Rye Development has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Washington State Building & Construction Trades Council and the Columbia Pacific Building & Construction Trades Council that requires contractors to hire union labor and prioritize local workers. The agreement also includes apprenticeship opportunities during the construction period.

The project site is located at the former Columbia Gorge Aluminum smelter, a brownfield property within Klickitat County’s Energy Overlay Zone, which is intended to streamline energy development. The project area overlaps with the Tuolumne Wind Farm and is expected to make use of existing roads and transmission infrastructure.

“Redeveloping the Columbia Gorge Aluminum smelter into a clean energy resource has been a longtime vision of this community,” said Richard Foster, economic development director for Klickitat County. “The project revitalises our community with good-paying jobs, stimulates local economic growth and enhances our leadership in renewable energy.”

RISKS

Plug Power recorded $971 million in non-cash impairments and $104 million in inventory adjustments due to ""decision to temper focus on certain products and markets"" and slower than expected industry growth.

Revenue negatively impacted by $22.7 million in customer warrant charges, $8 million of delayed revenue from a material handling customer, a $16 million reduction from not shipping mobile refuelers, and $12 million from production delays in cryogenics—all in the quarter.

Sanjay Shrestha stated, ""it has been slower than anticipated,"" and attributed significant Q4 revenue impacts to customer delays, site readiness, and early-stage market dynamics.

SUMMARY

Plug Power executed a major restructuring, emphasizing cost reduction and narrowed focus on material handling, electrolyzers, and hydrogen production to address a challenging industry and revenue volatility. The company secured policy and financing milestones, including Department of Energy approval for the Texas plant and a $30 million ITC monetization, while setting near-term targets for margin improvement and cash burn reduction. Management provided limited guidance beyond the first quarter, directly attributing this to market uncertainties and execution risks in project timing and customer readiness.

Electrolyzer business is positioned for substantial bookings in 2025, with opportunities in both Europe and North America backed by large institutions and customer offtake agreements.

Material handling remains a core growth driver, supported by confirmed large customer commitments and positive customer feedback on Plug’s sharpened profitability focus.

Plug remains cautious on stationary/data center and H2 Hub opportunities, expecting no material revenue from these segments in the next two to three years.

Green hydrogen production costs at the Georgia plant are currently around $5/kg before PTC, with average daily production mostly in the 11-12 ton per day range and full production achievable as dictated by demand.

Management reported that none of the company’s ATM facility or recent SEPA agreement with Yorkville has been used since mid-November, and existing convertible issuance redemptions were handled in cash, not by share sales.

INDUSTRY GLOSSARY

ITC (Investment Tax Credit): Tax credit earned for investments in eligible energy property or equipment, directly reducing tax liability or monetizable via transfer or sale.

PTC (Production Tax Credit): Tax credit based on the quantity of renewable energy produced and sold by a project; can be monetized or strategically chosen in lieu of ITC based on economics of specific assets.

Electrolyzer: Equipment that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity; used to produce green hydrogen in industrial decarbonization applications.

DOE Loan: Loan guarantee program offered by the U.S. Department of Energy to finance qualifying clean energy infrastructure; typically covers a portion of project costs with stipulated advance and drawdown rates.

Material Handling: Business segment providing hydrogen fuel cell solutions for warehouse logistics and goods movement applications (e.g., power for lift trucks and related equipment).

Gross Margin Inflection Point: The specific period when a business expects its gross profit from operations—net of direct costs—to become positive, signaling core profitability improvement.

Full Conference Call Transcript

Andy Marsh: Good morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter conference call. Last night, we announced significant structural change to streamline our cost base through Project Quantum Leap. Over the coming months, we'll be reducing staff, refining our product focus, and consolidating facilities. These measures are targeted to generate annualized cost savings of $150 million to $200 million. These decisions are not easy, but they are necessary. The slower than anticipated development in the hydrogen market has been influenced by multiple factors, including the pace of policy implementation, global energy and security driven by geopolitical conflicts, the higher cost of project execution and past over enthusiasm in this sector.

However, we remain confident that hydrogen will play a critical role in the future energy mix with many experts projecting, it will eventually contribute 10% to 20% of the world's energy supplies. The projects that will progress the fastest are those with a clear value proposition, strong policy support and a well-integrated value chain. As we assess our businesses, our primary focus moving forward will be on three key areas: material handling, electrolyzers and hydrogen generation to support material handling, as they align best with these attributes. In material handling, we deliver a compelling value proposition by helping customers move goods more efficiently. Plug benefits from three revenue streams in this business: products, services and hydrogen.

In 2024, we have made significant improvements in improving margins for service and hydrogen, expanding them by approximately $120 million compared to 2023, excluding the impact of customer warrant charges. Product margins however are tied to sales and factory utilization. Last year, sales were slower as we worked through price renegotiations with major customers and the transition from PPA to direct sales, that process is now complete and we expect increased deployments this year from both existing and new customers, which will improve our facility utilization and drive positive gross margin.

Additionally, hydrogen margins will continue improving with the launch of our new joint venture facility in Louisiana this month, while service is on track to reach profitability by year's end. Hydrogen production costs are a critical driver of both our profitability and the broader market development for fuel cells. By the end of this month, Plug will have 39 tons per day of capacity, while customer demand stands at approximately 55 tons per day. The DOE approval for our Limestone plant in Texas, a project creating jobs in a deeply conservative district was secured in January.

We’ve already have the necessary equipment to cover our equity investment in the project and are finalizing discussions with an external investors to complete the funding structure. Given the change in administration, we now anticipate a later start in 2025, with project completion expected 18 months to 24 months from the start date. Importantly, we do not plan to contribute additional Plug equity to complete the project and anticipate retaining a 70% to 80% ownership stake once operation. Our electrolyzer business is essential to both our near-term and long-term growth. The primary applications involve replacing gray hydrogen in sectors like refining, green ammonia and methanol production.

Global demand remains strong and we expect significant growth in both sales and bookings this year. Notably, we're executing large scale projects including the 100 megawatt deployment with GALP. Here's why I see -- and this is really important, here's why I see tremendous potential in this market for Plug. Unlike some hydrogen fuel cell market, that face challenges across the value chain such as infrastructure, fueling and financing hurdles for on-road vehicles, the replacement of gray hydrogen with green hydrogen is a much simpler transition. Customers can blend green hydrogen to existing processes without major operational changes, which accelerates deployments, speeds up time to markets and you deliver immediate benefits.

As we move forward from this restructuring and market adjustments, Plug will prioritize material handling, hydrogen production supporting material handling and electrolyzer sales alongside profitable cash generating assets in well-established markets. If the program is not tied to profitability or cash generation, Plug will not pursue the program in the near or long-term. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Sanjay to review our Q4 results, followed by Paul, who will provide insights into our financial outlook.

Sanjay Shrestha: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was a year of recalibration for Plug. It included some successes and some challenges. On a positive front, fourth quarter 2024 marked another quarter of meaningful reduction in cash burn, continued gross margin expansion and another step change in growth of our electrolyzer business. Cash burn for the quarter was down year -- over 70% year-over-year and gross profit improved year-over-year when you exclude the non-cash charges of customer warrant and inventory adjustment. It is important to highlight that this margin expansion was accomplished despite lower revenue year-over-year. Now in terms of challenges, market growth, as Andy touched on it has been slower than anticipated.

Reported revenue for Q4 '24 came in at $191 million and full year revenue of $629 million. We are disappointed with this continuous [indiscernible] revenue despite significant improvement in sales of the electrolyzer business. We believe it is important to highlight a few key items that negatively impacted revenue in the quarter and for the full year 2024. As we highlighted in our press release issued last night, our application business revenue was impacted by a higher than usual warrant charge of $22.7 million and we had another $8 million of revenue that got pushed out related to a specific customer program in our material handling business.

In our cryogenic tanker and trailer business, we actually made a strategic decision not to ship multiple mobile refueler product to a customer in Class 8 truck space given their financial position which negatively impacted revenue by about $16 million in the quarter. In addition, we also had some production delays on few key product line in our cryogenic business that had an impact of about $12 million of revenue in the quarter. Just to reconfirm, this production impact has been already mitigated and will show up as revenue in the first half of 2025.

Despite delivering almost six fold revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 versus fourth quarter of 2023, our electrolyzer business in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by multiple factors, which represented revenue impact of as much as $68 million. We expect some of this revenue to materialize in Q1 of 2025. Majority of this is related to customer delays, site readiness, with some of the projects actually getting pushed to Q2 and Q3 of this year. And frankly, this revenue fluctuation on a quarterly basis in our opinion reflects the early stage of the industry growth as both supplier and customers learn to work together and keep moving projects forward.

This factor has had a total impact of over $120 million of revenue in Q4 of 2024. Just to reiterate, we believe some of the electrolyzer opportunity will contribute to revenue in Q1 '25 and majority of the customer pushout will be revenue opportunities in Q2 and Q3 of this year. Production related delays in our cryogenic business have already been addressed and will contribute to revenue opportunity in the first half of 2025. We also expect the revenue pushout from Q4 '24 in our material handling business to contribute to revenue in Q1 of 2025.

Based on all these items that impacted Q4 '24, overall seasonality in the first half of our business and overall macroenvironment, we believe our Q1 '25 revenue will be in the range of $125 million to $140 million. You should expect to see continued gross margin improvement. We believe the year of 2025 is set up to be a year of meaningful bookings in our electrolyzer business. As Andy highlighted, given the current macroenvironment, we remain focused on driving cost down, expanding margin, and reducing our cash burn. With that, let me turn the call over to Paul to discuss the financial outlook in some more detail.

Paul Middleton: Thank you, Sanjay. Since Andy addressed some of the broader market issues and Sanjay talked about revenues and margins for the quarter, let me jump into a few specific topics. As conveyed in our filings yesterday, Plug recorded non-cash charges in the quarter of approximately $971 million for asset impairments and bad debt and OpEx, and approximately $104 million in COGS for inventory valuation adjustments. These stem from multiple factors, including the decision to temper focus on certain products and markets that are more mid-term opportunities and overall market conditions resulting in slower growth for the industry than anticipated.

In terms of impairments, this relates to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, non-marketable equity investments, and assets associated with power purchase agreements and fuel. As a result of these impairments, it will reduce future amortization and depreciation, including a reduction of $55 million to $60 million in 2025. In regard to cash burn, we were laser focused on margin and cash flow improvement in 2024 and we saw benefits throughout the year and in particular in Q4 '24. These actions included targeted price increases, labor optimization, rooftop consolidations, improvement in production costs and leveraging our hydrogen platform with our new green hydrogen plant in Georgia coming online.

We expect in '25 to include a full year of benefits from these activities undertaken during '24. In addition, we expect initiatives and Project Quantum Leap to provide meaningful incremental improvement in margins and cash flows starting in Q2 of 2025 and building throughout the year. These additional measures will be complemented with the strategic efforts such as our new hydrogen Louisiana plant coming online in Q2 of 2025. We continue to be laser focused on driving deposit margins and cash flows in the near term. In terms of liquidity, we ended 2024 with more cash on hand than we anticipated with over $200 million in unrestricted cash.

We recently closed our first ITC transfer sale for the $30 million benefit associated with the liquefier plant -- liquefier at our Georgia green hydrogen plant, illustrating opportunities to leverage additional ITC assets. We have an effectively unleveraged balance sheet and we are currently working with existing partners on varied capital solutions. These factors, coupled with the focus on improvement in margins and cash flows put us in a strong position to achieve our near and mid-term financial goals and fund the company with the most prudent cost efficient capital solutions. I'll now turn it back over to Andy.

Andy Marsh: Okay. I guess, opening for Q&A to you.

Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.

Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk about the maturity of the financing for a number of the projects that you're talking about in that pipeline? The project financing oftentimes is a key gatekeeper, but just want to get a sense of cash flow supporting all of those projects at this point?

Andy Marsh: Why don't you take that, Sanjay?

Sanjay Shrestha: So Colin, are you referring to some of the opportunities on…

Colin Rusch: The electrolyzers.

Sanjay Shrestha: Yeah.

Colin Rusch: Yeah. Exactly on the electrolyzers.

Sanjay Shrestha: Sure. So again, we are looking at two very large projects here in the near-term. One is in Europe and one is in North America. And the project in Europe actually is going to final investment decision here by the end of the quarter. And look, it's a fully funded project, right, backed by a very large financial institution. So financing and the opportunity set of this project should not be a challenge. And next project in North America is actually related to big methanol opportunity. Again, there was already an offtake for that methanol opportunity.

So in light of that, Colin, the biggest thing in this space, right, is before you get to FID, you got to secure that offtake, really get the financing structure looking a lot like solar and wind from an offtake standpoint. Both of the projects that we're looking at here in the first half of the year have that attribute. So we're really not concerned from an overall financing standpoint. We just want to make sure that we land the project. We've already done the basic engineering design package in this cases and looking forward to moving ahead with the customer.

Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. And then, on the material handling side, obviously, there was a lull in some of the spending in warehouse automation and some of the capacity getting digested in the warehouse space. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from early indications? We saw some green shoots late in '24 on folks starting to spend again. But any material change in some of those spending patterns that you guys are seeing with some of those customers?

Andy Marsh: I think I'll give you one indicator, Colin, is that one of my largest customers put down money to be able to qualify under the old $48 million (ph) to support $200 million worth of business. I think that's a strong statement about their anticipated growth and expansion. We have both -- what we see and we announced, as you may remember in the fourth quarter, expansion with BMW in Germany, just to name a few of the larger customers. I can tell you that this announcement last night helps us with our customers.

I checked in with some of our sales folks who I asked to reach out after market closed to let them know what we were planning to do. What I heard was, we're happy you're going to take the steps to reach profitability. We're glad you're focusing our segment and it makes it easier to do business in the future. So it's a -- these are very, very difficult decisions. But in the material handling market, we expect that this will be well, well received.

I mean, if you take a look back -- and if you take a look back, Colin, I mean, I was just sitting here thinking about, Paul mentioned when you start thinking about the income statement level, depreciation was going to reduce $60 million. We're reducing our annualized cost between $150 million to $200 million. They're big steps to reaching profitability.

Colin Rusch: Super helpful, guys. Appreciate it.

Andy Marsh: Okay.

Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Craig Irwin with ROTH Capital Partners. Please proceed with your questions.

Craig Irwin: Thank you for taking my questions. So Andy, I wanted to ask about the DOE, right, your loan package with the DOE. There's a lot of investors criticism out there and nobody's going to know but you guys about what's actually being discussed with DOE and what the changes are? Can you maybe share with us any content of communications with DOE over the last few weeks? Do you expect this team to continue to support the loan package the way it was written? Are there any changes or updates that you might want to share with us around the loan package that would help investors understand the opportunity?

Andy Marsh: Craig, there has been discussions with the DOE and we're pleased at a working level. The individuals we have been dealing with have remained at the DOE. So we're not going through the process of reeducating the team. I think that's a big positive. I know there's lots of noise, but I can tell you when I became CEO of Plug, the first thing I did was step back and try to figure out everything that was going on. We have had regular conversations with the DOE over the past month. I personally will be spending time with them this week. So from an engagement point of view, and look, we're in very, very red districts.

We're in Texas where we're looking to build this. And I can tell you the local political teams, political folks in that region are strong supporters of this and are reaching out to make sure that this loan is executed on the deal that we came to. Look, obviously, things which are associated with more social oriented issues will be downplayed. During the call, I mentioned -- during the opening statement, Craig, I mentioned how our portion of the equity we already have with equipment, we do have a few funds who want to play side by side with us.

I would expect that construction of this project will most likely happen in the fourth quarter and that you can say 18 months to 24 months before it's completed. And I know you didn't ask this question, but I do want to highlight. We learned a lot from building Georgia, how to build a plant. And I can tell you the Louisiana build was much, much simpler. We actually learned a lot and I don't -- I think the learnings we have as well as the cost reductions it will bring to the business will be really beneficial long term.

Craig Irwin: Excellent. Then, you touched on this in your response and it was going to be my second question. So outside investors for the Texas project, you've already obviously attracted some pretty interesting attention and orders from groups like Fortescue for your Gibson -- for their Gibson island project. Can you maybe frame out for us the character of outside investors that are possible there? I know there's some global funds that are pretty active in evaluating this opportunity that really want the opportunity to invest in hydrogen. But are we looking more at private equity or other institutional investors as probable partners on the Texas project?

Andy Marsh: We are looking at -- and Sanjay and Paul, jump in. I would define most of the folks looking at our infrastructure funds looking to invest. And look, they're looking to invest in a new segment where there's growth potential. And, we have a process that's going on. We've identified two or three folks that we've been talking to. And, I think that -- I think you'll be hearing more about it during the coming months. And look, I think your first question, Craig, is important to this discussion.

Look, people want clarity what's going on with the DOE and that's part of the process in making sure that we can close these funds -- close with these funds in a timely fashion.

Craig Irwin: Thank you for that, Andy. And congratulations on the strong progress with your cash use. It's really pretty dramatic, the changes in this last year.

Andy Marsh: Yeah. Thank you, Craig. And we're looking -- we're going to continue to drive more to make sure, we're -- we have a strong financial position.

Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Saumya Jain with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.

Saumya Jain: Hey, guys. Good morning. Yeah. So how are you looking at data center backup power generation? How do you see Plug benefiting from that in 2025?

Andy Marsh: To be direct, I don't see it as a benefit in 2025. Our view is that, when it comes to hydrogen, one of the biggest challenges to make sure that you can support long duration outages and that requires a great deal of hydrogen storage on site. We think that business opportunity is a '28, '29 opportunity. Really to be successful, we really think you need hydrogen pipelines that you can store hydrogen in. And there are some data centers in Europe that could make sense in the future. But I would not expect revenue from that segment of any size over the next two to three years.

Saumya Jain: Got it. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.

Bill Peterson: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Paul, Andy, and team. Want to maybe take the applications question more broader than just the high power stationary. So I think at this symposium a few months ago, I guess you thought that the materials handling should probably go to 20%, 30% -- 20% to 30% year-on-year growth and now you're kind of expecting 10% to 20%. More broadly, I guess, over the next few years, what is going to drive the applications business? Is it going to be materials handling at this stage, given your comments around stationary power or at least a high power backup, maybe not viable in the next few years? And then mobility appears to be fairly challenged as well.

So what's going to drive the applications business and what's the right way to think about the growth over the next few years?

Andy Marsh: Bill, this is a real important question. I kind of touched on all my remarks. But the material handling business, you have a -- Plug established, what I'll call a micro infrastructure that can support the customer's needs and so the value chain is clear. And you look at markets like on-road mobility and stationary, there's so many other items in the value chain that have to be implemented and be successful for those businesses to grow fast over the coming two to three years. So material handling is one that we can look at and say, the pieces are in place.

It's also -- and you may have heard in my comments, when I talk about the electrolyzer market, it's not going to be folks who are going to dominate who are looking to drive mobility, it is going to be people who are able to put the end product, whether hydrogen or green ammonia or methanol or SAF directly into the value change without too much complication.

I mean, I sat through a -- about three, four months, I sat through a McKinsey presentation in D.C., and I sat back and listened to it and said to myself, they had a matrix of how one should think about markets though they weren't talking about hydrogen, specifically, they were talking about the whole renewable world. And it really was kind of a clarifier to me that you need to develop focus on value chain. And look, our business will grow as we improve. If you're a customer, what's your biggest concern when it comes to Plug? You have a business that improves the productivity of your operation.

You have a company that -- we have fixed the hydrogen issues and risks our customers may have. The biggest risk is, how will Plug perform financially? And the steps we've taken today will actually help us accelerate growth in the market. And I can tell you, I do know of some of our large customers, they're looking to accelerate their growth. If our numbers are lower today, Bill, look, we don't want to over promise. We want to make sure we deliver and so we want to set clear expectations. But I think we see a healthy market. It's why we're laser focused on material handling and why we're going to be laser focused on electrolyzers.

Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your [Technical Difficulty].

Eric Stine: Good morning, everyone.

Andy Marsh: Good morning, Eric.

Eric Stine: Hey. So I can appreciate it sounds like not guiding to fiscal '25 and I know, Sanjay, you gave Q1, but maybe just some commentary on the year. I mean is -- should we expect this to be your typical mix first half versus second half? How do you expect the year to play out sequentially? Any details to fill that in would be helpful.

Sanjay Shrestha: That's right, Eric. Look, I mean, as you -- as I kind of touched on it, so Q1, you have seasonality, right? Then, we are looking at sort of the macro environment that's got a lot of puts and takes, if you would. And there is a benefit, however, though of some push outs from Q4 into Q1. So when you look at this $125 million to $140 million in sales, typically, Q1 has been 10% to 15%, but given some of the push out, you can probably imagine it's more like 15% plus in terms of the revenue mix, 15% to 20%.

So in light of that, that's I think how you should think about the full year for the company at this point in time. And one other thing, we just want to make sure, as Andy touched on it, what we have the strongest visibility on is Q1. We're already obviously sitting here in the month of March. We will do the same thing when we report our Q1 earnings to give you the visibility on Q2. We're really focused on obviously driving that top line, getting the growth for the company in '25.

But the bigger focus you can appreciate hopefully is on reducing cash burn, expanding margin, and really getting to that EBITDA break even territory as soon as we can as company.

Eric Stine: Yeah. No, I totally get that, but those details are helpful. And then, maybe a good segue just on the cost reductions in your plan here in 2025, I mean, you gave pretty good detail there. I'm just curious, how deep you see those. Is there more room to go if necessary? And how do you kind of balance that between as you said, I mean, you've got, even though now you're going to be more focused, material handling electrolyzers, hydrogen, still have a big growth opportunity. So how do you kind of balance your near term objectives while still being able to execute on those longer term growth plans?

Andy Marsh: So Craig, I do believe that the learnings you receive from deploying projects actually have large benefits to other markets. Nothing makes us better at deploying electrolyzers than the fact that we learned how to build plants ourselves. Nothing helps us better for markets that will evolve in applications like stationary than getting our quality and -- of our present fuel cell products better every day. So I think that, some folks -- I'm a power engineer by training and I think a lot like a power engineer about how things scale. But when you think about fuel cells, you're really thinking about probably two, three different power levels of fuel cells.

But learnings at one level translates to the next. So we're -- look, we are making and focusing on activities that will make our financials stronger, which in the long run will really allow us to go into these other markets as they become available. So I guess that's, being successful now will help us a great deal in being successful in the future and that's the decisions we're making.

Eric Stine: Got it. And maybe I'll just sneak in one more, just for the $150 million to $200 million in targeted savings. Can you just give kind of the high level mix between cost of goods and OpEx?

Andy Marsh: I would say I'll let -- I'll take it quick. And Paul, correct me, if you disagree. I would probably say that it's almost 50-50 between COGS and OpEx.

Paul Middleton: That's a good proxy.

Andy Marsh: Yeah. Look, we haven't made -- we're obviously going through the process and I have to be respectful for our employees and others before I kind of say exact numbers.

Eric Stine: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your questions.

George Gianarikas: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions.

Andy Marsh: Good morning, George.

George Gianarikas: Good morning. I'd like to ask Andy about your view on the policy environment in Washington. It's clearly quite confusing and just curious as to whether you can share any details on conversations you've had or your view as to how the next six months or 12 months will look? Thank you.

Andy Marsh: So, we'd say, it's obviously evolving environment and I'm going to be spending some time in D.C. later this week. When I look at the history of fuel cells in hydrogen, the supporters of it, the last time we had a real major fuel cell only bill to support the industry actually happened under President Trump and a pure Republican Congress. I can tell you last week, there was a bill introduced by Representative Tenney, who -- she in a very, very red district, supporting fuel cells and it was her second bill that she introduced in this Congress.

I think that -- look, I've been pretty clear about the fact that we felt that the previous administration implementation of the IRA, especially, when it came to hydrogen tax credits was rather disappointing. And we kind of view the new administration as more business oriented and hydrogen is actually supported strongly by the oil and gas industry, which is beneficial. I suspect there'll be ups and downs. But look, I think this is real important. There is a global market for green ammonia, green methanol. There's needs for hydrogen here in the United States for applications like ours, that's not going away. And this administration is looking for the U.S. to be energy dominant.

And to be energy dominant, you have to meet where the world sees demand and where the world sees new demand. And it is in SAF, it is in green ammonia, it is in green methanol and that's not going to change. So I think it's really important for U.S. to make sure that China doesn't dominate these industries long term. And I think many, many people in the House, in the Senate, as well as the DOE understand, Bergman, I think everybody knows was one of the biggest proponents of the hydrogen hubs. I think it just -- I know this is a long answer, but I think it just needs to settle down.

George Gianarikas: Maybe as a follow-up, I'd love your thoughts also on what's happening in Europe too? Thank you.

Andy Marsh: If I look at Europe, the -- it's one of the reasons I think Sanjay is so positive about the electrolyzer market. So much of what we're working on, for example, is in the hydrogen hubs, Hydrogen valley in Spain, where there's strong, strong support for build outs and deployments. I think that where you're going to see and I think you're going to see Germany continue to support hydrogen deployments. Obviously, the geopolitical tensions at the moment makes things a little tense.

But look, even long-term, we have a panelist who helps us in Europe, who was an ambassador to the EU, told us there could be huge, huge opportunity for projects and deployments like we do in Ukraine once all this is calmed down. So I think, Europe is -- there's certainly lots of nuances with Europe, but you can look at Spain and can see what's going on and say, hey, this is really good for Plug Power. I think you can say the same about Australia. And I think these are markets that are going to be the heart of our electrolyzer business.

And look, you've heard our announcements in Portugal, for example, with GALP, what we're doing there with what we're doing with Iberdrola in Spain. These are projects that are going in the ground now to support the economy, and all of them are supported by the governments at some level.

George Gianarikas: Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next questions come from the line of Sherif Elmaghrabi with BTIG. Please proceed with your questions.

Sherif Elmaghrabi: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.

Andy Marsh: Good morning.

Sherif Elmaghrabi: Good morning, Andy. The Georgia ITC transfer is pretty interesting. Are there other piecemeal opportunities to pull cash out of existing equipment, either Georgia or elsewhere? And is there a reason you recognize the ITC on that particular liquefier rather than the entire plant?

Paul Middleton: Yeah. Andy wants me to answer that one. So this is Paul. The short answer on the first part is, yes. We have as an example, when we turn on our plant in Louisiana, there'll be a ITC credit there associated with the liquefier as well that we can take and we'll share with our joint venture partner there, that could be similar size to what we recognized in Georgia. And then we have some additional assets that we've deployed last year for PPA opportunities that there's ITC benefits on that is probably in the 15 million to 20 million range that we're out.

We're actually working pretty closely right now to closing in the near-term on both of those opportunities. So that's meaningful and helpful in terms of the cash. And then, on the answer on Georgia is that there's a decision to make on the balance of plans as to whether you take PTC or ITC. We've decided to take the PTC benefits. We've recognized those in our results last year. And, we're going to continue to do that. Any plant that we put in place, we go through a cash benefit analysis as to is it better to take the ITC or to do the PTC. And it's -- there's many factors that fall into that.

And -- but that's the choice that we have. So that's where we stand on that for the Georgia plant.

Sherif Elmaghrabi: Thanks, Paul. I realize that was a two-parter, so thanks for taking my questions.

Paul Middleton: You're welcome.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Tsung with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.

Chris Tsung: Hey. Good morning, Andy, Sanjay, and Paul. Looking at your...

Andy Marsh: Good morning, Chris.

Chris Tsung: Hey, Andy. Looking at your care, are there -- just wanted to check, are there new conditions that you need to satisfy in order to receive the DOE loan?

Paul Middleton: I'm not sure. There's not new conditions. The loan was finalized in early January. The only thing that we have to do is, and it's approved, the way it works is the loan itself has been papered, documented and approved. Everything's there. To apply the first project, which is Texas, there's some specific things that we have to put in place in terms of like direct agreements between the DOE and the EPC contractors. An example is just one microcosm example. So those are things that we're working on. We're really close.

And they're not necessarily additional conditions that make it -- any obstacle is just really -- unfortunately, the parties that work on these things that we're working with have done many other deals with the DOE, so they're used to working with the DOE on these kind of ancillary agreements. And so it's more just, I would say, for lack of better words, the bureaucracy of just putting crossing the T's and dotting the I's and putting all those residual components in place to officially kick-off Texas as a project underneath that structure.

Chris Tsung: Great. Thanks, Paul. And just for my follow-up, on that loan, how much are you requesting as part of the first drawdown? And did you – sorry, if I missed this earlier. Did you say you're expecting proceeds in Q4 or is that when construction is expected to restart?

Andy Marsh: So we would -- I would think that Q4 is my best estimate when construction would start. Paul, maybe you can go through the process of how you pull down cash.

Paul Middleton: Yeah. So the way it'll work is, when we get the project approved and kick-off the effort there, which is really getting the EPC guy going again, EPC contractor going, which as Andy said, tentatively would be -- we're thinking would be probably in the fourth quarter. In the first month what happens is, you compile all of the anticipated invoices each month that you expect to pay as part of that project, and you submit that to the DOE and then they advance money against that.

So that's -- we're going to get credit for our equipment that we've contributed to the project, and then they will front money to pay the majority of the bills that we have to pay to construct that project as we move forward. So that's how practically it works.

Chris Tsung: Appreciate it. Thank you, guys. I'll turn it over.

Paul Middleton: Thanks, Chris.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Moore with Clear Street. Please proceed with your questions.

Tim Moore: Thanks for taking my questions.

Andy Marsh: Good morning.

Tim Moore: Good morning. The important watchpoint by investors is the positive gross margin inflection point that investors have been eagerly waiting on. You made some really good progress announcing the cost savings plan. I think your prior guidance at the symposium was the expectation back then was to maybe be slightly positive gross margin exit rate for the year. I'm just wondering now with the significant cost savings plans being rapidly implemented, do you think that exit rate still holds, or do you think you could pull it off in the third quarter for maybe positive third quarter gross margin?

Sanjay Shrestha: I mean, Tim, our goal is always hopefully trying to do things sooner rather than later. But look, given everything and all puts and takes, I think it holds in terms of Q4 of 2025 as a good target that we are looking to turn gross margin positive.

Tim Moore: Great, Sanjay. That's helpful. And the other question I had just on a different topic. Maybe can you speak to maybe the liquid hydrogen appetite and the sentiment? The H2 Hubs network rollout is a little bit behind schedule. Just can you give any color or stories on progress there with some customers and green shoots for takeaway from your production facilities?

Andy Marsh: No. Look, I think the hubs will develop. I never thought the hubs would develop that fast. If you looked at the funding for the hubs, it was years of study and implementation, and that was even under the previous administration. We never -- and I think if you even go back to previous conference calls, we never expected significant near-term or even midterm revenue from the hubs. I think hubs implementation would help the hydrogen industry later in this decade and that's always been our view. And they're just -- I would say this, they never really had a very fast schedule and I don't see them being meaningful to us over the next two to three years.

But if implemented, not only is it a sales opportunity, but really helps to build out the larger hydrogen economy. So we're supportive but probably are not stunned that they have not accelerated as fast as people may have thought. But also quite honestly, they're accelerating at a pace that the government actually laid out there. So that's kind of our thought process there.

Tim Moore: Great, Andy. Thanks for that and that's it for my questions.

Andy Marsh: All right.

Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Samantha Hoh with HSBC. Please proceed with your questions.

Samantha Hoh: Hey, guys.

Andy Marsh: Good morning, Samantha.

Samantha Hoh: I hate to bringing it back to -- hey, Andy. You mentioned a few times about the Texas plant being a very red district that's very pro hydrogen. And the one thing that's really striking me is just how much support the state of Texas has for hydrogen. Like, enthusiasm overall actually is quite palpable. Has there been any conversation in terms of Texas funding in any sort of stimulus or what type of initiatives that they can provide to get the industry -- hydrogen industry really more competitive or just accelerating all the developments there, if the federal government does kind of pull back on their support?

Andy Marsh: I have not -- I will be meeting with people from the Texas delegation this week. I know I have not seen anything. We do have people in Houston. I have not seen anything to date where the Texas delegation can help us the most. And the Texas government is to help move things through the DOE quicker as they learn. And I think you see both representatives and senators willing to help in that area.

Samantha Hoh: Okay. I guess the other thing that I'm kind of curious about is with like potential monetization of the PTC. I realize that, there's still a lot of questions as to what's going to happen with like a potential tax plan ultimately. But what sort of conversations are happening behind the scene in terms of opportunities, potentially monetize those once we have greater clarity? And then I guess what are your thoughts in terms of how quickly that could? Like, what kind of milestones should we be looking at? Like, how quickly can anything on that side that should occur?

Andy Marsh: Do you want to take that, Paul?

Paul Middleton: Yeah. So I guess there's two facets. One is, practically the way it works is, when you file your tax return, it's a direct pay associated with that. So worst case, we file in October like other corporates that are calendar years companies and they pay from that. What we are working with is, the tax equity broker that we used to close the ITC sale in Georgia to see if there's parties that want to discount that. It's only a few months, but it can be meaningful to us to discount and sell it off.

The good news is, we have tax opinions from a reputable big global tax firm, and all of the analysis and things that we need to put that package together and make it a very attractive opportunity to sell it off. And when we establish that, it makes a decision easier to do that for this year and start taking advantage of this year, monetizing this year's as well. So it's a work in process and it's still new. Like any new market opportunity, it takes some time to kind of nurture through it. But we're pretty actually encouraged with the interest level and how we're postured to try and possibly monetize that.

Samantha Hoh: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed with your question.

Amit Dayal: Thank you, and good morning, everyone.

Andy Marsh: Good morning, Amit.

Amit Dayal: Hey, Andy. Just with respect to sort of the macro environment right now and how you're providing guidance, [Technical Difficulty] much of the sales pipeline that was built up until say 2024 is still valid? Can you give us a sense of how that aspect of the execution may have changed a little bit?

Andy Marsh: You want to take that, Sanjay?

Sanjay Shrestha: Sure. Happy to. Hey, Amit. How are you? A couple of things on this, right? So our electrolyzer business in 2025 largely is executing on the existing backlog, that really hasn't changed, right? We're hopeful that we might even be able to do slightly better than that. But it all really comes down to executing on the backlog. And just to put this in context, I mean, electrolyzer business grew about 60% -- more than 60% year-over-year from '23 to '24. We wouldn't be surprised if it's a similar growth rate again in 2025. Now, another piece of our business, which is largely backlog driven as well is our cryogenic tanker and trailer business.

We look that business slowed down a bit year-over-year from '22 to '24, largely because of some of the push out, some decisions even we made on the mobile refueler space, even the collection situation and things like that. So that business, I think, again will grow back up here in 2025 versus 2024 from a revenue standpoint. So short answer to your question, we really don't think there is any risk to that existing backlog. Obviously, we're going to want to book more business here. But one very important point to highlight here is, we talk about potential for pretty big bookings in the electrolyzer business.

Those bookings will really help '26 and beyond, not so much 2025 given the size of the project and when they move and things along those lines. But otherwise, look, we feel pretty good about the existing backlog. It's all about heads down and execute.

Amit Dayal: Thank you, Sanjay. My other questions have already been discussed. I'll take my other questions offline. Thank you.

Andy Marsh: Okay. Thanks.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ameet Thakkar with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.

Ameet Thakkar: Hi. Good morning. Just one quick one for me. Given kind of your kind of path here to positive gross margins at the end of the year and the cost cutting, I was just wondering if you could kind of share with us what your plans are in terms of kind of relying on some of the facilities you have for external equity. How much is kind of baked into the year for that? Thanks.

Andy Marsh: So, I would just say that we have not used any of that since mid-November, any of those facilities. And there is a backdrop to support the business if required.

Amit Dayal: You have utilized the convertible facility, right, for like, I think, let's say two issuances of $22.5 million in, I think, the first two months of the year. Is that separate from that?

Andy Marsh: Yeah. That's actually just payback. Instead of selling stock, we actually execute it by providing cash. Do you have anything else to comment, Paul?

Paul Middleton: Yeah. No, I think just for clarity. So we -- the convertible that we did, the preferred convertible, we did in November, there's been two elements. One is, we had some amortization on that, and then because the stock price hit $2.90, they did convert, I think it was like 10 million shares. But to Andy's point, we have not used either of the ATM facility or the recent SEPA agreement with Yorkville. So, we sit in a good position with ending $200 million in cash end of the year. And, things like the ITC help bring in liquidity. We also get the restricted cash at $50 million a quarter that comes in, in March.

So there's a lot of positive things that are helping us navigate this fiscal year.

Ameet Thakkar: Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.

Kashy Harrison: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions.

Andy Marsh: Good morning.

Kashy Harrison: Good morning. So my first question is on Georgia. You've now had it running for around a year. Just curious where run rate utilization is on the project and how long it took to get there. And the same question for cost of goods sold. I think you guys were thinking about maybe $4-ish per kilo of production costs. But I'm just curious where actual results have landed relative to those expectations.

Andy Marsh: Do you want to take that one, Paul?

Paul Middleton: Yeah. I'd say, as you ramp and commission the plant, obviously the cost per kilogram is higher than what you expected. As we've gone through the year and really worked out the bugs and figured out how to run that plant more smoothly, you get the leverage on it, right? And so, I'd say, we're kind of in that $5-ish kilogram range…

Andy Marsh: Before the PTC.

Paul Middleton: Before the PTC, that's right. And obviously, PTC is super helpful.

Andy Marsh: Which gets it down to the 250 (ph) type range.

Paul Middleton: Exactly. So that's kind of where we're sitting at the moment. And we expect to take the pull. This year will be really good because we'll get the full year benefit of that whereas last year you only got a portion of that because the timing of turning on the plant and the periods of time that we were ramping up that facility.

Kashy Harrison: Got it. And sorry, where is the utilization?

Andy Marsh: Utilization is, we can run it full production. So, it's just based on demand. And so we need to run 15 tons a day. We will run 15 tons a day. I think most days are in the 11 tons to 12 tons per day range.

Kashy Harrison: Got it. Helpful. And then my follow-up question is, just thinking about just forward capacity. I think you talked about 39 tons per day of current capacity, current demand. I believe at 55, you're working on bringing Texas online, which is 45, so you'll have excess capacity once Texas comes online. Just given all the comments around, the slower market development than you anticipated, just wondering where you're envisioning sending those excess volumes to? Thank you.

Andy Marsh: Not exactly wanting to provide information about who we're competing against and where we're looking to provide it. What I would say is, we have a strong sales funnel and a strong sales team working those opportunities. There's big market already for liquid hydrogen. And we have opportunities for people who already buy liquid hydrogen at scale, who are very, very interested in buying scale out of Texas.

Sanjay Shrestha: Yeah. And Andy, maybe one more thing…

Andy Marsh: Yeah. Go ahead.

Sanjay Shrestha: Some of the players have decided they're exiting the green hydrogen space as we bring some of these other plants online. And demand for green hydrogen is a long-term in nature. So that I think puts us in a pretty good position as well. Just to reiterate, as Andy said, look, we even have some discussion with existing industrial gas customers to do swap arrangement.

Andy Marsh: Yeah.

Sanjay Shrestha: It's all about if you have a plant in California, if you have a demand in the east coast or in the southeast, right, then that's where you end up doing a lot of swaps. So look, we work very closely together with many of them and as Andy said, we feel pretty good about demand being there even as we bring our Texas plant online.

Kashy Harrison: Got it. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Andrew Percoco: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning, guys.

Andy Marsh: Good morning, Andrew.

Andrew Percoco: Good morning, Andy. Maybe just to start out, coming back to the DOE loan for a second, I think in the press release you guys cited $400 million of coverage from the DOE loan on $600 million of incremental investment. I mean, that implies about two-thirds coverage on an advance rate. I think you guys had previously talked about 80% advance rates on the DOE loan. So just curious what the delta is there and if there's been a change in maybe the advance rate assumptions that you're having on that facility.

Andy Marsh: Go ahead, Paul.

Paul Middleton: Yeah. There's no change. It's up to 80%. And the dynamics on each project will vary based on the size of the plant and other factors. And we also have some of that is a decent amount of contingency in those assumptions. And so, obviously with the learnings that we've had in Georgia and now Louisiana, we hope that feel like that we're in pretty good position that, we won't use all that. So that's the -- I guess the dynamic, Andrew, in terms of how it plays.

Andrew Percoco: Okay. That's helpful context. And maybe just sticking with CapEx for a second. You quote $250 million that you've already spent on the project, another $600 million that you need to spend gets you to about $850 million all in on a 45 ton per day plant. And if I just do that conversion, it implies like $19 million to $20 million of CapEx per ton per day of production, which I think is actually a little bit higher than Georgia. So just curious, can you just maybe walk through some of your assumptions there? I guess I would have thought it would be lower than Georgia just given some of the learnings that you guys have discussed.

So any color there would be helpful. Thank you.

Andy Marsh: I don't know if the math is right, but Georgia will come in around $800 million with contingency and the contingency is probably 10%, 15%. And so, there's built in contingency in that Texas number. So, overall, I think before the contingency, it'll come in around $700 million.

Andrew Percoco: Okay. Thank you.

Andy Marsh: Okay. Thanks, Andrew. And I think that's it for the day, Teal. Well, thank you everyone for joining the call. And look, we're making the tough decisions to make sure this business is successful long-term. We're laser focused on material handling and hydrogen to support it, which will really help us grow the market long-term. We're laser focused on electrolyzers and especially those applications which can be deployed rapidly.

Reducing losses Despite the current government’s efforts, rising costs continue to dent the power sector’s sustainability.","The power sector’s high reserve margin, capacity payment obligations, and reliance on imported fossil fuels have weakened the Bangladesh Power Development Board’s (BPDB) financial strength. In a bid to urgently address the BPDB’s financial distress, the interim government, after assuming office in August 2024, undertook measures to reduce costs. Yet, the power sector registered a record revenue shortfall in fiscal year (FY) 2024–25, calling for long-term efforts to deliver results.

With the general election scheduled for 12 February 2026, the next government will be well placed to design and implement long-term reforms to steer the power sector towards sustainability while ensuring that the country’s economic growth trajectory remains intact. These reforms must include a rational power demand projection to avoid future overcapacity and associated capacity payments, greater reliance on grid power, reduced use of costly oil-fired power plants, increased renewable energy, and reduced transmission and distribution (T&D) losses.

Realistic demand assessment and power capacity expansion

Bangladesh’s power demand projection — relying on optimistic gross domestic product growth rates — has created several challenges. The power sector faces a high reserve margin, resulting in capacity payments for idle plants and a greater annual subsidy burden.

In FY2024–25, the power system’s reserve margin hovered around 61.3%, based on the maximum peak demand of 17,000 megawatts (MW) against an installed capacity of 27,414MW. While reserve margins typically rise with an increasing share of variable renewable energy (VRE), Bangladesh’s on-grid VRE share remains low. The power system’s reserve margin, excluding the VRE capacity of 762MW registered on 30 June 2025, stood at 56.8% in FY2024–25, substantiating its high surplus capacity. With power plants of a combined capacity of 6,756MW— excluding renewable energy — expected to come online before 2030, concerns remain about the persistently high reserve margin (*installed capacity recorded on 14 January 2026 was 28,909MW; derated capacity: 28,484MW). Accordingly, the next government should project a more rational power demand and refrain from adding new fossil fuel-based capacity to prudently manage the reserve margin, thereby reducing obligations for exorbitant capacity payments for fossil-fuel plants.

Enhancing electrification and modernising the grid

Bangladesh’s industries use gas for both boilers and captive power generation, avoiding significant dependence on grid power. It is a double whammy for the power sector — the surplus power capacity adds to capacity payments and BPDB’s revenue shortfall mounts.

On the other hand, with the deepening piped gas supply crisis, industries are turning to alternative fuels like compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This increases their operational costs, raising business concerns. As CNG stations also face gas supply shortages, CNG is unlikely to fix the problem. Similarly, the recent LPG supply shortage poses a serious challenge to industries.

The next government should consider a two-pronged strategy for electrification to address the industrial energy crisis and the power sector’s concerns. It can encourage industries operating captive generators without waste heat recovery systems to shift to grid power. The cost of electricity produced in a captive power plant with 40% efficiency is about Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) 10.75/ kilowatt-hour (kWh), which is comparable to grid electricity tariffs (this cost is calculated based on a gas price of BDT40/m3 and operational expenses equal to 5% of fuel costs). Likewise, the government can push industries with inefficient gas boilers to switch to electric boilers, thereby driving demand for grid power. The additional electricity sales to high-paying industrial consumers will partially relieve the fiscal burden on the power sector. Higher power demand will also help the government increase the share of on-grid renewable energy.

The success of this electrification will hinge on transforming the national power grid to meet evolving demand and provide reliable electricity, requiring investment to make the grid flexible and modern.

Reducing losses

Despite the current government’s efforts, rising costs continue to dent the power sector’s sustainability. BPDB’s FY2024–25 annual report shows that the power sector’s year-on-year (YoY) expenses swelled by 13.94% as opposed to a 9% rise in sales revenue. The sector’s overall revenue shortfall soared to BDT556.6 billion (USD4.55 billion), marking an 18.3% YoY increase.

One of the key reasons behind the power sector’s dismal performance is its continued reliance on expensive oil-fired plants. Although the current government pledged to minimise the use of fuel oil in power generation, its share fell only marginally from 11.83% in FY2023–24 to 10.73% in FY2024–25. At the same time, power purchases from Independent Power Producers surged 25.61%while the contribution of BPDB’s economic plants declined. As a result, the government’s strategy fell short of delivering the intended results.

Likewise, the power sector’s T&D losses — after showing substantial improvement in recent years — increased marginally to 10.13% in FY2024–25 from 10.06% in the previous year.

The next government should take stock of these challenges and devise concrete strategies to operate economical plants, based on merit order dispatch, and limit T&D losses. In addition to raising the share of BPDB’s economic plants in total power generation, the government should aim to initially bring down the use of oil-fired plants to 5%, supported by renewable energy. With the integration of battery energy storage systems, it should try to limit the use of oil-fired plants. Likewise, the government should first contain T&D losses to the global average level (just less than 8%) and then strive to bring it further down to the average of the advanced economies (just over 6%).

Such interventions are financially compelling. For instance, reducing oil-fired power generation from 10.73% to 5% can help Bangladesh save BDT89.9 billion (USD0.73 billion), slashing the subsidy of BDT386.4 billion (USD3.2 billion) by 23.3%. This estimate is based on total power generation of 101,187 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in FY2024–25, an average oil-fired generation cost of ~BDT25/kWh (USD0.2/kWh) and a weighted average solar tariff of BDT9.5/kWh (USD0.078/kWh) from recently approved projects totalling 918MW. In addition, a 2% reduction in T&D losses could save the country BDT24.5 billion (USD0.2 billion), thus reducing the subsidy burden by 6.34% (average power generation cost of the grid: BDT12.1/kWh [USD0.1/kWh]).

The next government needs to strategically reboot Bangladesh’s power sector to address its persistent vulnerability, which would help contain fiscal pressures. Its efforts must focus on long-term reforms rather than quick fixes to gradually improve the sector’s sustainability.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/bangladesh-electricity.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 03:37:32.880941

The costs of electricity, heating fuels, and transportation fuels — along with the volatile and unpredictable nature of many of these costs — are straining budgets, especially for low- and moderate-income households that already spend a disproportionate share of their income on energy.

Fortunately, a variety of solutions can improve energy affordability. This hub brings together resources from RMI and other organizations that can help decision-makers understand the drivers of the affordability challenge and the tools available to address it across the electricity, buildings, and transportation sectors.

For the average American household, a little over half of energy expenditures go to gasoline, about a third to electricity, and the remainder to home heating fuels. Energy costs within those categories are shaped by multiple factors, including utility investments, fuel price volatility, inflation, housing and transportation patterns that lock in energy use, and the availability of cost-saving incentives and financing options. Understanding these drivers helps identify where interventions can be most effective.

RMI's Affordability Hub can be filtered by characteristics like sector, solution, and decision-maker to help users quickly find insights relevant to them.

A framework for solutions

Addressing residential energy affordability requires a portfolio of solutions that promote cost control, cost distribution, and customer agency:

Cost control: Avoiding unnecessary system cost growth through cost savings and cost efficiencies

Cost distribution: Allocating costs appropriately across the system and seeking alternative sources to pay for those costs

Customer agency: Providing households with choice, control, access, and predictability to manage their energy costs

Across these three solution sets, safeguards protect low- to moderate-income households from undue energy burden.

Dive Brief:

The PJM Interconnection’s board should reject a proposal from NextEra Energy and Exelon to build a $1.7-billion transmission line across central Pennsylvania, partly due to the uncertainty around data center demand forecasts, according to the Pennsylvania ratepayer advocate.

The project is part of PJM’s proposed $11.6-billion regional transmission expansion plan that is under review by the grid operator’s board. The RTEP aims to ensure a reliable grid in 2030 and is based on substantial demand growth from data centers contained in a forecast issued a year ago. A more recent forecast issued this month trimmed those expectations while still projecting growth.

“We believe that likely in-state generation buildouts or faster-to-deploy alternatives utilizing existing [right-of-ways] could solve the problems this line intends to address while imposing lower costs and providing higher benefits to Pennsylvania ratepayers,” the Office of Consumer Advocate, or OCA, said in a letter to PJM’s board on Wednesday.

Dive Insight:

PJM’s annual RTEP comes amid concerns about how data centers could make electricity more expensive for ratepayers.

In PJM, a region that covers all or part of 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states and the District of Columbia, much of the focus has been on how rising capacity prices affect electric bills. The grid operator holds capacity auctions several years in advance to secure supply based on existing and projected loads, leading to price spikes that were heavily influenced by aggressive estimates of future demand.

In PJM’s last three capacity auctions, data centers accounted for $23.1 billion in costs — $21.5 billion of which were for projected data centers that were not online yet at the time of the auctions, the grid operator’s market monitor said in a Thursday presentation to the grid operator’s Members Committee.

As a result, the average cost of wholesale power in PJM jumped 49% in 2025 to $82.67/MWh, according to the presentation from Marketing Analytics. Energy accounted for 60% of that price, followed by transmission at 22% and capacity at 16%.

By comparison, in 2024, the average cost of wholesale power in PJM was $55.52/MWh, with energy accounting for 59%, transmission for 32% and capacity just 7%.

Capacity costs accounted for $13.09/MWh of the overall price of wholesale power last year, up about 260% from $3.61/MWh in 2024. Net transmission costs increased more modestly, from $17.73/MWh in 2024 to $18.53/MWh in 2025.

The Pennsylvania consumer advocate concluded that electric utility customers in that state are paying higher energy prices largely because of increased costs for bulk power grid services “driven by data center and artificial intelligence demand that is outstripping existing and forecasted supply, resulting in higher wholesale supply costs and expensive transmission grid expansion.”

The OCA’s concern centers on a 765-kV project proposed by NextEra and Exelon that would run about 221 miles from Marshall County, West Virginia, to Perry County, in central Pennsylvania. 765-kV is the highest voltage transmission line available and are not widely deployed in the U.S., but several major grid operators are building more.

Residential ratepayers across PJM would pay about $9 billion if the entire $11.6-billion regional transmission plan is approved as proposed, according to the office, which is led by Darryl Lawrence. The lead advocate is nominated by the state attorney general and confirmed by the state Senate.

PJM has said the line — called Project 237 — would help it reliably handle load growth in PPL Energy’s territory and the Mid-Atlantic region in general, according to its analysis. It would also help the grid cope with delays in offshore wind development and future generation retirements by expanding an existing 765-kV backbone into PJM’s eastern region, allowing for more flexibility in serving load, PJM staff said in the report.

But the ratepayer advocate said the approval of the NextEra-Exelon project is premature given “rapidly evolving circumstances around data center AI load, incomplete assumptions, and process concerns.”

Last week, PJM revised down its near-term load growth projections, and the Trump administration and PJM governors and PJM’s board have both called for a backstop or emergency auction to procure more power supplies — though the details of those proposals are unclear and would require regulatory approval.

The advocate said the impact of any changes on transmission needs and planning is uncertain, raising the risk of expensive new projects.

“Project 237 has the potential to become the ‘poster child’ for overbuilding new transmission infrastructure and failure to solve reliability needs with potentially less expensive generation options, storage, demand response and other innovative proposals,” the OCA said.

Previous transmission expansion plans by PJM have sparked conflict. The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, for example, in 2024 challenged the cost allocation for PJM’s $5.1-billion 2022 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan Window 3.

In part, that plan was driven by data center development in northern Virginia. Under a cost allocation proposal approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, ratepayers in Virginia will pay about $2.5 billion, leaving utility customers in Maryland to pay $551 million and other PJM transmission owners paying about $2.1 billion, according to the Maryland OPC.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/7JyyXul1IiKyPW_LFURxDWO1etS86Q7c53S_dQMAhic/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTkxMDE2MTc3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-23 01:37:52.487956

The EPA’s proposal spares roughly 80% of the nation’s protected wetlands for development, potentially putting water quality, coastal flood drainage and wildlife habitats at risk.

“Waters of the United States” Proposed Rule

“Waters of the United States” refers to the federal government’s jurisdiction over the nation’s waterways as outlined in the Clean Water Act (1972). The Clean Water Act grants the EPA and the United States Department of the Army the authority to define what “waters of the United States” are via regulation. The Clean Water Act also manages the amount of pollutants released into the United States’ waters and enforces quality standards for surface water. Under the Clean Water Act, industries must obtain a permit from the EPA before contaminating federal waterways.

The goals of the Clean Water Act were to eliminate the discharge of pollutants into the United States’ navigable waters by 1985 and to provide a level of water quality suitable for protecting marine life and wildlife by July 1, 1983.

Under the Trump administration, however, the goalpost has shifted to favor the interests of businesses, developers and farmers who have lobbied against the Clean Water Act’s regulations.

“No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether the Water of the United States is on their property. EPA is delivering on President Trump’s promise to finalize a revised definition for WOTUS that protects the nation’s navigable waters from pollution, advances cooperative federalism by empowering states, and will result in economic growth across the country,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

Wetlands are areas where water covers the land year-round or for a portion of the year. The new definition, as laid out by the EPA, would exclude streams that only flow for certain parts of the year, typically during “wet season.” It would also strip protection for rain-dependent or ephemeral streams, which flow after precipitation – especially following long periods of rain or hurricanes.

The rule was opened for a 45-day public comment period that ended on Jan. 5, 2026, and a final decision on whether or not to adopt the new proposed definition is expected this year.

Why are Wetlands Important to Coastal Georgia?

Heather Joesting, Ph.D, is a coastal plant ecologist and a professor at Georgia Southern University’s Armstrong Campus, who specializes in ecology and the nursery production of marsh grass.

Joesting emphasises the role of coastal Georgia’s wetlands in pollution attenuation, flood mitigation, juvenile fish habitats, carbon sequestration and biodiversity.

Joesting explained how building developments over marshes result in “coastal squeeze,” which refers to the loss of coastal wetlands as a result of rising sea levels and man-made barriers.

“When you put property in the marsh, the marsh has nowhere to go,” said Joesting. “That can impact the persistence of the marsh and sea level rise.”

“We also often change the hydrology of things when we build, so you change the way creeks divert, or you add more water in. A lot of the water from Savannah kind of drains down into the marsh. So just having coastal communities near the marsh will contribute to pollution,” said Joesting.

Industries and construction create disruption to fragile ecosystems in coastal Georgia, resulting in flooding in residential areas and home damage. According to a recent study published in Nature Communications, extreme coastal flooding is projected to more than double by 2050 due to greenhouse gas production and contamination. Socially marginalised groups of people are likely to be impacted the most.

The Solution: Advocate for Coastal Communities

Because of the drastic impacts that coastal flooding and pollution have on homes and residents, it is important to recognise how environmental justice aligns with human rights.

There are a few things that can be done on a group and individual level to advocate for the protection of coastal wetlands:

Education: Many publications, such as Grist and, more locally, The Current, use science-based data to consistently report on environmental research and policy. However, simply talking to professors or establishing a general understanding of the importance of ecology will allow you to be better informed about your environment.

Support environmental protection organizations: volunteering or donating towards organizations such as 100 Miles, Friends of the Everglades or Point Blue Conservation Science is a practical way to support the cause of protecting local wetlands. Many non-profits also provide information regarding legislative action and host online petitions or on-site protests.

Be an active voter: Perhaps most importantly, vote! Research candidates who align with the values regarding the environment that you believe in and vote in your state and local elections.",https://thegeorgeanne.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC3043.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 00:37:28.641161

Since the Industrial Revolution, human activity, like urbanization and the burning of fossil fuels, has been the main driver of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to rapid global warming.

It’s imperative to increase our understanding of climate change while creating paths to progress and hope. Achieving measurable change is dependent on students overcoming environmental pessimism. Students can be hopeful about their role in protecting Earth’s future because of environmental science education and sustainability initiatives.

A survey on climate anxiety collected the responses of 10,000 people ages 16 to 25 years old from 10 countries, including the United States. Researchers found that 75% of young respondents think the future is frightening, 59% were very or extremely worried about climate change and over 50% report feeling sad, angry and powerless.

“There’s a thought (that) the environment (is) so big, and it’s obviously so beyond us,” said Greg Anderson, assistant professor in the Department of American Studies with an expertise in urban studies and community development.

The threat of environmental degradation is overwhelming, and its emotional toll inclines young people to doubt and disengage from sustainability efforts.

“We’ve got to wake up, pay attention (and) get involved,” Anderson said.

One step towards recognizing how students can positively impact the environment is through education. Replacing pessimistic attitudes with a hopeful outlook also means being able to identify credible climate solutions.

“If there’s a critical enough mass of people (with) optimism, (then) that’s the only way that there could be a good outcome,” said Jay Banner. “The data shows (that if) we undergo a much lower trajectory for carbon emissions then we’re presently (at), the outcomes will be better.”

Banner is a professor in the Jackson School of Geosciences, director of the Environmental Science Institute and co-teaches the signature course, Sustaining a Planet. The course provides an interdisciplinary overview of environmental science while preparing students to evaluate how diverse occupations can contribute to climate mitigation.

“If you care about the future of the planet and our environment … then you could be a part of it without having it be your major or fully your career,” said Banner. “Wherever you’re headed in life, sustainability can matter to you.”

English freshman Mackenzie Wilkey shares that taking the class made sustainability more prevalent in her life. On an individual level, it has been something she’s been able to easily blend into her day-to-day life by visiting a local farm and briefly going vegetarian to reduce her carbon footprint and methane emissions.

“The class is honest. I think we have to be honest with ourselves,” Wilkey said. “Pessimism can only get us so far. If we think too much that there’s nothing we can do, then we won’t do anything,” said Wilkey.

Students may not realize the direct contributions they can make towards mending environmental issues unless they learn how these processes work and how to get involved. UT offers many environmental awareness student initiatives such as The Green Fund, a competitive grant program funded through tuition allocation, where students from any major can propose sustainability-related projects and research.

From widespread student engagement, there’s hope for a positive shift toward environmentally-conscious living. However, if we resign to environmental pessimism, we also give up on any chance of sustaining our communities and planet for future generations. Once we incorporate environmental science education and sustainability initiatives into our everyday practices, we can recognize students’ potential to overcome despair with action.",https://thedailytexan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/11102025-AnushkaDeshmukh-Environmental-Pessimism-WEB.png,N,,2026-01-22 23:38:35.133968
