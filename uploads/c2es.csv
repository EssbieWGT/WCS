FIGURE 6: INNOVATION POLICY MATRIX As the innovation reaches commercial deployment and socio-political support becomes increasingly important, commercial & management risk remain dominant concerns.","The C2ES Innovation Policy Matrix synthesizes and builds on the latest thinking in innovation policy. It incorporates four interrelated components that, when evaluated together, can help policymakers develop a comprehensive understanding of the policy needs for any given technology and the broader innovation ecosystem. The matrix seeks to introduce sufficient complexity to reflect real-world conditions, while maintaining a user-friendly and intuitive four-by-four model: four key risks, four innovation process stages, four ecosystem functions, and four policy design principles (see Figure1). We introduce these concepts briefly here and then elaborate on each of them in the following sections.

Key Risks: Risk is an intrinsic part of innovation, the nature of which changes over time. The federal government has an important role to play as a risk-tolerant supporter of innovation, particularly when technological feasibility and market applications are still unclear. The matrix considers four common key risks. Each risk arises in at least two of the stages of the innovation process and may be managed by two or more of the innovation ecosystem functions. The four risks are:

science risk

engineering risk

financing risk

commercial & management risk.

Innovation Process: As a technology matures from initial concept to commercial scale, it passes through different stages of the innovation process. Each stage presents distinct risks that must be addressed. The process is often non-linear, with lessons from later stages feeding back into earlier steps. Innovation policies should focus on addressing different risks in each stage and evolve alongside the technology. The four stages of the process are:

research & development

prototyping & demonstration

early adoption

commercial deployment.

Ecosystem Functions: The matrix incorporates four key functions of a healthy innovation ecosystem that operate in every stage of the innovation process, albeit in different ways and to varying degrees. Weak performance in any of these functions can hinder innovation. Effective innovation policy can address these functional gaps—either through direct government action or by stimulating other actors to step in and fill them. The four functions are:

resource push

knowledge management

user pull

socio-political support.

Policy Design Principles: An empirically grounded understanding of the key risks, innovation process, and ecosystem functions provides a solid foundation for policy development. Policymakers should consider the four following principles as they develop a suite of policy solutions:

focus on building ecosystems, not picking winners

shoulder risks where private markets cannot

design and sustain policy to crowd in private capital

align policy duration with technology commercialization timelines.

FIGURE 1: OVERVIEW OF THE C2ES INNOVATION POLICY MATRIX

Component One: Key Risks to Innovation

Innovators are constantly navigating risk, from the earliest stages of research, through to large-scale commercial deployment. The nature of risk also changes over time and evolves alongside the innovation. The goal of federal innovation policy should not be to fully shoulder all the risk inherent in innovation. Rather, the objective should be to provide sufficient policy certainty and risk management to make capital investment attractive for private actors when the opportunity is right. The level and type of risk a company is willing to assume depends on its own risk tolerance, business model, and how effectively federal policy mitigates key uncertainties. For example, an institutional investor may be more comfortable taking on financing or commercial and management risks if public policy has already reduced the initial science and engineering risks. The federal government is often better positioned to absorb those initial risks because it operates on longer time horizons and with broader societal objectives than private actors, who typically face shorter payback expectations and fiduciary obligations to shareholders.

The task of policymakers is to support and enable a vibrant innovation ecosystem in which private sector risk-taking is maximized through the public sector appropriately taking on risks the private sector cannot. Additionally, the goal is not for every technology to succeed, but to create an environment in which the best technologies do. This, of course, is easier said than done.

The key risks that must be managed within an innovation ecosystem include:

Science risk refers to the possibility that a technology may prove to be scientifically or physically infeasible.

Engineering risk is the risk that a technology that works under ideal conditions (e.g., in the lab) cannot be reproduced cost-effectively at scale or under real-world conditions.

Financing risk is the challenge an innovative company faces in accessing capital or managing debt effectively.

Commercial and management risk involves the possibility that the innovation will not generate sufficient market demand, fail to be competitive with alternatives, confront supply chain limitations, or otherwise fall short of profitability for a critical mass of market participants.

For the sake of simplicity, this matrix limits its focus on risk to the four listed above and embeds them into the two next sections below.

Component Two: The Innovation Process

Innovations typically proceed through a series of stages as sketched out in Figure2. The process can be very rapid, as is common in the software and internet industries, or it may take many years or even decades, as has typically been the case in capital-intensive heavy industries, like energy, infrastructure, and transportation. This latter type of industry is the focus of our technology working groups, which are all hard-tech innovations that require large-scale development, engineering, and construction.

It is important to note that scaling innovation is often a non-linear process. The learning generated at each stage of the innovation process, represented by the arrows in Figure2, can provide valuable guidance for the others. These different learning cycles—denoted at the bottom of the figure as ‘learning by researching,’ ‘learning by doing,’ and ‘learning by using’—illustrate how knowledge gained in one phase can inform others. For example, the prototyping & demonstration stage may reveal technical challenges that R&D must address before an innovation can advance further. Similarly, as production scales to meet the needs of early adopters, supply chain constraints may reveal that alternative inputs will be needed for successful commercial deployment. Even during commercial deployment, late adopters may uncover new applications that were not anticipated in earlier stages, requiring prototypes to be revisited. These feedback loops create a virtuous cycle of learning that can help drive down costs, create economies of scale, and clarify the long-term revenue drivers and use cases for the innovation.

FIGURE 2: STAGES OF THE INNOVATION PROCESS

Research & Development

The R&D stage of the innovation process involves identifying problems and brainstorming solutions to address them. This stage focuses on conducting scientific, technical, or market research with the goal of developing prototypes to be tested in the next stage of the innovation process, prototyping and demonstration. During the R&D stage, scientists and inventors—whether working in corporate, government, or university laboratories, or independently in the proverbial garage—play a core role. These actors generate new ideas and explore their potential value in practice. While private sector support for R&D is needed, government funding is critical, as it drives progress in areas that may not yield immediate profits for companies but are vital to society, such as national security, public health, and clean energy. Innovation policies supporting this stage of the innovation process include federal funding for R&D projects and testbeds at national laboratories and universities.

Prototyping & Demonstration

Next comes the prototyping and demonstration phase of the innovation process, where ideas developed during R&D are transformed into tangible products, models, or systems for testing. In this phase, prototypes are developed, tested, and refined by entrepreneurs, investors, and builders to evaluate their performance and feasibility. Demonstrations provide proof-of-concept, showing how the innovation works in practice and whether it can meet real-world needs. An example of an innovation policy that supports this stage of the innovation process is cost-shared demonstration projects between the federal government and the private sector. Such policies are designed to bridge the “missing middle”—the gap between early R&D, where public funding predominates, and the later stages of the innovation process, where private capital typically steps in.

Early Adoption

The third stage of the innovation process is early adoption, where proven technologies begin to move beyond controlled prototypes and demonstrations into initial markets. In this stage, early adopters—often niche industries, specialized users, or governments—begin deploying first-of-a-kind commercial-scale projects. While end users play an important role throughout the innovation process, their feedback and support are especially influential in shaping the direction and pace of innovation during this phase. Innovation policies that support early adoption include tax credits, grants, and federal procurement programs, which help reduce costs and build market confidence.

Commercial Deployment

Commercial deployment is the final stage of the innovation process, where technologies move from early adoption into widespread use across mainstream markets. As innovations progress from first-of-a-kind deployment to nth-of-a-kind deployment, they may begin to achieve economies of scale. During this stage, manufacturers and technology users play central roles, addressing remaining challenges in production and application. Their efforts focus on achieving key performance and financial milestones needed for scaling, while also strengthening supply chains and developing new markets. Many policies that support early adoption by creating demand, such as procurement programs and tax credits, also help advance the last stage of the innovation process. Broader demand-side policies, such as carbon pricing and other market-based approaches like clean energy standards, can also support deployment. Actions that provide regulatory certainty, such as streamlined permitting processes, can play a crucial role as well.

Mapping Risks onto the Innovation Process

Each stage of the innovation process carries a distinct risk profile, and well-designed innovation policies can help mitigate these risks (see Figure3). For example, science risk is most prevalent during the R&D and prototyping & demonstration stages, where new ideas and technologies must be proven viable. Engineering risk becomes especially prominent during prototyping & demonstration and continues into early adoption, as technologies are tested, refined, and scaled. Financing risk arises throughout the innovation process but may be particularly severe in the prototyping & demonstration and early adoption stages, where the “missing middle” funding gap occurs. Commercial and management risk is most significant in the early adoption and commercial deployment stages, when innovations must compete in the marketplace, secure supply chains, and demonstrate long-term value.

It is important to note that these risks may also be present outside of the specific stages identified, given the interrelated nature of the innovation process. However, this categorization can serve as a productive initial filter for policymakers as they seek to address the risks impacting technologies at different stages.

FIGURE 3: KEY RISKS ACROSS THE INNOVATION PROCESS

Component Three: Functions of Innovation Ecosystems

The innovation process does not occur in a vacuum and is shaped by broader dynamics and actors in the innovation ecosystem. Federal policy and regulation do not act alone; private markets, information flows, and social norms all inform an innovation’s path toward commercial deployment. Private markets provide financial incentives and encourage competition between firms and individuals participating in the innovation process. Information flows drive the exchange of data and ideas between actors and processes. Social norms can impact adoption by positively or negatively sanctioning users of a given innovation.

It is critical for policymakers to understand these dynamics because they provide valuable information on the behaviors of ecosystem actors and the nature of potential barriers to innovation. Succinctly capturing so much complexity is challenging, but the International Energy Agency effectively characterized these using their “Four Pillars of Effective Energy Innovation Systems.” Each of these pillars represents a distinct function of the innovation ecosystem. When barriers obstruct one or more of the four functions, the innovation process begins to slow or stall. These four functions—resource push, knowledge management, user pull, and socio-political support—are the third component of the C2ES Innovation Policy Matrix (see Figure4).

FIGURE 4: INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS

Resource Push

Resource push is focused on ensuring the sustained provision of resources, education, and skills to support developers along the innovation process. Actors involved in the innovation process need money, equipment, talent, and other resources to do their work. Relatedly, those with resources seek opportunities to advance innovation by supporting technology developers. Private, public, and philanthropic investors who perform the resource push function have different motivations and place different weights on the risks being addressed. For example, public and philanthropic funders may support R&D projects that contribute to public welfare and are happy to absorb science risk, while the limited financial rewards from taking such risks often deter private investors. Public and philanthropic funders may also want to support prototyping and demonstration to reduce engineering and financing risks for later-stage private investors.

Like federal funding for R&D, tax incentives for private R&D spending and public-private demonstration partnerships are innovation policies that allow risks to be shared among types of investors who have different tolerance levels for different risks, but whose combined investments enable R&D and demonstration projects to happen.

Knowledge Management

Knowledge management impacts all the learning feedback loops (i.e., learning by researching, doing, and using) and ensures that new knowledge flows to other users and new products. This function is impacted by norms and laws related to secrecy, disclosure, and property rights, which may incentivize or disincentivize actors to share or withhold knowledge. Some first movers are concerned with carrying out engineering and commercial activities that are costly to them while benefiting fast followers who can learn from the first movers’ successes and failures. This is also known as knowledge spillover. Adjustments to intellectual property or trade secrecy law may remove this barrier.

In other cases, advances that would benefit an entire industry are blocked by antitrust laws that restrict competitors from sharing knowledge. Exceptions to these laws for innovative joint ventures among competitors can enable progress.

User Pull

User pull stimulates both innovators and users to accurately understand the costs, benefits, use cases, and risks of adoption. These factors are often determined by markets, which aggregate individual decisions to inform producers about the scale and type of demand for the innovation. Novel innovations that must compete with legacy incumbents are particularly vulnerable to weak user pull, especially when potential users are cost sensitive and risk averse.

Innovation policies that support this function include tax incentives for customers to help kickstart market demand, government procurement to help shoulder the higher initial costs of new technologies, and regulatory mandates that level the playing field for all users.

Socio-political Support

Socio-political support impacts every stage of the innovation process and every other function of the innovation ecosystem. Such support—or disapproval—may be expressed in the media, public policy, and day-to-day social interactions with knock-on effects on the availability of resources, knowledge flows, and adoption decisions. The socio-political support function tends to come to the fore in later stages of the innovation process, as a much larger portion of the population becomes aware of and may be impacted by the innovation.

Public engagement that provides broad education about the benefits, costs, and risks of the innovation, and allows members of the public to have a voice in the deployment process, may address this challenge. Community benefits plans and public infrastructure funding that shift the balance of benefits, costs, and risks may also deepen socio-political support for an innovation.

Mapping the Risks onto the Ecosystem Functions

These four functions serve as a helpful lens when trying to understand the nature of a given risk from different perspectives in the ecosystem (see Figure 5). When looking at the resource push function, policymakers can consider how to advance the needs of innovators who are doing the hard work of testing and building new technologies (scientific and engineering risk) and trying to secure investors and customers (financing and commercial & management risk). When looking through the lens of knowledge management, policymakers can consider how to accelerate the different feedback loops across the innovation process to drive down all four types of risk. In the user pull function, policymakers take the view of the demand-side actor, and what prospective investors (financing risk) and customers (commercial & management risk) need to feel a technology is sufficiently derisked (engineering risk) so that they can make their own investments. Lastly, the socio-political support lens ensures that policymakers are not just considering policy through the priorities of supply- and demand-side actors, but also through the impact they will have on communities, workforces, and the public as they are financed and deployed (financing and commercial & management risk).

FIGURE 5: KEY RISKS ACROSS ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS

Component Four: Key Principles of Innovation Policy

The following section lays out the final component of the matrix: four key principles of innovation policy, drawing on insights from C2ES’s technology working groups. These are intended to guide federal innovation policy broadly—not only for the technologies featured in our working groups, but for any emerging solution facing similar commercialization barriers. These do not map onto specific functions or stages; rather, they serve as key best practices.

Focus on Building Ecosystems, Not Picking Winners

The role of federal policymakers is not to pick a specific winning company or technology, but rather to foster a robust, and ultimately self-sustaining, innovation ecosystem. Effective policy should unlock both creativity and competition, enabling the best-performing technologies to emerge over time. As developers vie to be selected for limited federal dollars and programs, frontrunners will emerge.

Working group insights

The continuous challenge for policymakers is to strike the right balance between supporting emerging dominant designs while avoiding full technological lock-in. For instance, LDES technologies encompass a diverse range of durations (e.g., inter-day and multi-day) and forms (e.g., electrochemical, mechanical, chemical, and thermal). For this reason, C2ES developed a policy recommendation for the LDES working group on LDES procurement targets. One implementation design option is the establishment of distinct verticals across a range of durations and forms to enable maximum flexibility for utilities, developers, and other power system stakeholders. This policy design enables innovation to progress while avoiding lock-in. This approach also ensures that where there are limited public resources, actors in the ecosystem are competing on comparable performance metrics.

Shoulder Risks Where Private Markets Cannot

The federal government should shoulder appropriate risks—including by removing barriers to innovation—that the private sector cannot manage on its own. This need spans the entire innovation process, from exploratory R&D, through to the incentivization of private investment in commercial projects.

Working group insights

First-of-a-kind projects are often the riskiest and the most difficult to finance—a recurring theme in all four of our technology working groups—as startups work to build their demonstration projects. While venture capitalists have high risk appetites, the capital intensity of these projects often exceeds their threshold, and their payback periods tend to be much shorter than the time required to develop, permit, and construct a large-scale demonstration project. Project finance from institutional investors is typically used to fund these capital-intensive projects, but these lenders have much lower risk appetites. Before they are willing to provide financing, these financiers typically need projects to prove their “bankability.” They do so when a project has sufficiently reduced its commercial, technological, and financial risk to give investors reasonable confidence that it will be profitable.

This threshold is extremely difficult for many early-stage innovations to meet before they build their initial demonstration projects, particularly since much of the derisking and cost efficiencies occur during the ‘learning by doing’ stage of prototyping/demonstration. Federal cost-sharing and grants fill a critical gap here in providing the necessary support for innovations to prove out their technologies via initial demonstration projects. This reality is central to our policy recommendations for the SAF and clean hydrogen working groups, which call for the federal government to provide additional support for demonstration and early commercial-scale projects.

Enact Durable Policies to Crowd in Private Capital

Effective innovation policy should have a multiplier effect on private capital. Over time, private sector funding into technologies must meaningfully exceed the amount invested by the federal government. This serves as an important barometer for both the efficacy of the policy and whether the innovation can succeed without perpetual federal support. Inherent in this is the assumption that the policy environment remains sufficiently stable so that financiers and customers have the certainty they need to make longer-term investments and multi-year purchases. Policy stability also enhances policy impact by aligning expectations of all participants in the innovation process.

Working group insights

As noted in the previous principle, securing financing from institutional investors for emerging technologies is a significant barrier on the path to full-scale market diffusion. The same is true for customers. In our working groups, the “green premium,” or the additional cost of adopting nascent clean technologies compared to incumbent technologies, was identified as a significant barrier to scaling demand. Innovation policy can play a role here by offsetting some of the cost for early customers, so that technologies can move down the cost-curve and become more affordable for later customers. Federal tax credits, for example, can reduce or eliminate the green premium by providing a discount on eligible products or lowering the tax burden for customers. Some tax credits also allow transferability, which enables technology developers to sell their credits to third-party buyers for cash. These incentives allow innovators to build revenue streams from nascent technologies and create a customer pipeline, particularly during the early adoption stages of the innovation process.

This was the case in the ECR working group, where both demand- and supply-side players agreed that the 45Q tax credit for carbon sequestration was a major catalyst for the private sector investment in carbon removal technologies. This tax credit helps bridge the gap in the early stages of deployment by reducing costs and attracting investment. As the technology matures and unit costs decline, private investors will be able to carry more of the burden, and the tax credit should phase out. However, at the time of publishing the C2ES ECR policy recommendations (September 2024), higher-than-anticipated inflation had significantly eroded the value of the carbon sequestration tax credit to 87 percent of its initial value. Although the tax credit will be adjusted for inflation in 2027, its value continues to diminish in today’s inflationary environment. This weakens the efficacy and impact of the tax credit for both carbon removal companies and their potential customers. In essence, although the existence of the credit itself is durable (available for twelve years after a project is placed in service), its value is not, since it is not currently indexed to inflation. As a result, one of our key policy recommendations for the working group was to strengthen the credit by incorporating an inflation adjustment in 2024 rather than in 2027.

Align Policy Duration with Technology Commercialization Timelines

Innovation policies should be aligned with real-world commercialization and maturation timelines. Even the most well-designed policy will not be effective if it expires before it can be used by the very innovators it is intended to support. The role of policymakers is to ensure that policies are aligned with the actual needs and pace of the innovation ecosystem.

Working group insights

Innovation takes time, especially in hard-tech sectors. For example, participants in the SAF working group noted existing production tax credits would expire before a new SAF facility could be constructed and start production. Working group members estimated that it takes between five and seven years to fully develop an advanced SAF production facility, while at the time, the 40B sustainable aviation fuel and 45Z clean fuel production tax credits only credited fuels sold within a combined five-year window of eligibility. This finding informed our policy recommendation to establish a production tax credit which allows the taxpayer to commence a fixed duration of eligibility at the time a facility is placed into service, thereby ensuring policy support is consistent with the timeline of SAF project development. Since the publication of our SAF policy recommendations in December 2024, the 40B sustainable aviation fuel tax credit has expired. However, in July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act extended the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit through to December 31, 2029. 4, 2025). Safe harbor provisions—which enable developers to register their intentions with the Internal Revenue Service and begin construction within a specified time frame to qualify for the credit, even if the facility is placed in service after the expiration of the credit—are another approach that can add flexibility and ensure that policies are aligned with development timelines.

Ideally, as an innovation matures, the ecosystem will become increasingly self-sustaining, with the private sector driving innovation and market development, and outdated policies being phased down over time. This frees up federal funds to support the next generation of technology and ensures that innovation policy continues to advance new technologies as opposed to supporting a new set of incumbents.

Synthesizing the Components: The Innovation Policy Matrix

Figure6 brings together these various components in a single matrix. This matrix is intended to capture the relationship between the different components of the innovation matrix, while also producing a heatmap of where policy need will likely be the greatest. The four stages of the innovation process are placed consecutively along the bottom row of the matrix and the four functions in the leftmost column. The common parameters between the technology-focused innovation process and ecosystem-focused functions are the key risks. These are marked as a diagonal trendline to broadly capture how the nature of risk changes over time, with the caveat that there may be cases where a particular risk appears outside of this general trendline. Similarly, while the ecosystem functions are important across all stages of the innovation process, the matrix highlights periods of heightened risk that can be most effectively mitigated by pairing policies supporting specific ecosystem functions with those addressing particular stages of the innovation process. The policy principles do not formally map onto this matrix, but rather serve as best practices when designing policy interventions to address the key issues identified in the matrix.

As shown in Figure6, science risk is strongest in the lower left quadrant, where R&D and resource push intersect. Policies in this quadrant will be principally concerned with providing funding and resources to scientists and innovators who are conducting lab-scale research and experiments on novel ideas.

The greatest concentration of risks is found within the middle two quadrants where knowledge management intersects with prototyping and demonstration and user pull intersects with early adoption. Given the confluence of risks, it is no surprise that between these two quadrants lies the “valley of death” for innovators. As innovators work to transition between prototyping and demonstration to early adoption (e.g., first- or second-of-a-kind projects), they are simultaneously grappling with science, engineering, financing, and commercial & management risks. Policy interventions for the second quadrant from the left could include federal cost-shares to help offset high upfront costs, as well as incentivizing strategic partnerships and knowledge sharing between private actors to help accelerate bench-scale prototypes into larger-scale demonstrations. Policy interventions for the third quadrant from the left could include additional cost-sharing, federal procurement, and tax credits to help kickstart market demand for early adoption.

FIGURE 6: INNOVATION POLICY MATRIX

As the innovation reaches commercial deployment and socio-political support becomes increasingly important, commercial & management risk remain dominant concerns. This is the case for all businesses looking to succeed in a competitive private market. At this stage, regulatory and permitting certainty is essential so that innovators and communities have a clear sense of the milestones and requirements that companies must meet as they continue deployment.",https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/c2es-innovation-policy-matrix-a-framework-to-accelerate-us-technology-leadership-COVER.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 07:59:22.438080

On May 5, 2024, Green Guard broke ground on its site outside Dixville . CEO Edward W. Karfiah says the company expects its “first truckload of waste” to arrive.

“We are working with the different cities. We are signing a contract to roll out when we bring waste to the site. We are hoping that by February 7th, the latest, our first truckload of waste will be on the site,” Karfiah told reporters.

The 10-year renewable agreement with Paynesville City Corporation (PCC) designates Green Guard as the primary entity responsible for solid waste collection. Beyond disposal, the company will oversee waste-to-energy initiatives and revenue-sharing arrangements.

Karfiah explained: “This process will also give Paynesville some incentive along the route, not just from waste collection where we have tipping fees, but we also tend to give some of our net profit to Paynesville with the end products we have.”

For Karfiah, the project more than about garbage—it is about climate resilience. “It is about sustaining the human race because global warming is our single most treasured threat now. Carbon emission is one key. Capturing carbon is a game changer.”

One of the project’s most ambitious goals is to replace charcoal burning with clean cooking gas. For decades, charcoal has been the lifeline of Liberian kitchens. But Green Guard insists that era is ending. “This, one of the end product of this would be clean cooking gas. So, that means we are going to replace charcoal burning with clean cooking gas that is less expensive and more easy to work with and cheap,” Karfiah said.

He added with conviction: “No more charcoal business. You just switch your gas on and the fire is there. And you cook in no time.” The shift is not just about convenience but it is about saving forests and cutting carbon emissions.

Charcoal production has long fueled deforestation and filled homes with dangerous particulates linked to respiratory illness. Green Guard’s plan to distribute clean gas promises to tackle both problems at once.

“This is not just about waste. It is about sustaining the human race because global warming is our single most treasured threat now,” Karfiah emphasized

The company says its gas will be packaged safely in HDPE containers, easy to handle and affordable. “The children even can throw it to say we’re taking care of the kitchen when they buy it from the car,” Kerfiah said.

Green Guard has also committed to reforestation as part of its environmental compliance. “Every acre you clear; you need to replant 50 trees. The place we are clear is not more than five acres. Instead of 250, we’re doing over 1,000, meaning we’re doing more. We’re sending more oxygen into the environment.”

For Alterna Verde CEO Dr. Nervy Santiago, the project is about harnessing decades of expertise in anaerobic digestion.

Dr. Santiago said the partnership is reframing Liberia’s waste problem as an opportunity. “This project is not about garbage. It’s about climate change, livelihoods, and training people for the future.”

“It just so happens that our feedstock is coming from garbage. That is very important to understand. The project is about climate change, global warming, and carbon capture.”

He warned of unmanaged waste: “People forget that when you dump waste in bare ground, it’s going to leach out these chemicals. It’s going to poison your water. Waste is a major source of greenhouse gas. As you allow waste to decay, you produce not only carbon dioxide, but biomethane gas. And biomethane gas has more than 28 times the greenhouse effect than CO2.”

Alterna Verde is introducing citronella grass as a phytoremediation tool to absorb heavy metals from leachate. “We are going to feed citronella grass with leachate. That’s why we’re propagating now. So what happens? The heavy metals in your leachate will be trapped by this grass,” Santiago explained.

From this process comes citronella oil, a product with global demand. “We are now able to make livelihood because then we can now extract that oil, citronella oil. And what does citronella oil do? Anti-mosquito, anti-fly. You can use it in your spa, in your perfumes.”

This innovation offers a double dividend: environmental protection and income generation.

Karfiah insists the project is about positioning Liberia globally. “This story we are trying, this interview is not just for Liberia. It’s for the region. It’s for the world. And for the government.”

He stressed the role of government: “It is the government working in synergy with its citizens, bringing up a smart innovation investment that will impact not only Liberia but the region and the world at large.”

Engineer Mulbah Rufus Flomo of Green Guard Eco-Solution calls the initiative a “revolution for the country when it comes to waste.”

“We no longer have waste in Liberia. We’re going to have another form of resource where it comes here, it’s sent back to the community as plastic tar, it goes back to the community as cooking gas.”

Flomo walked FrontPageAfrica reporter through the 30-acre site, explaining its four system components: Lined landfill to protect groundwater, Anaerobic baffle reactor (ABRO) to degrade organic matter and produce methane, Phytoremediation with vetiver grass to absorb heavy metals and Power station to convert methane into electricity.

“Our initial plant is at least, for the first start, we should put at least two megawatts per hour current. That can be able to supply at least, we can say about 25 or 30 percent of Pins basically.”

Flomo acknowledged Liberia’s relatively low waste generation compared to countries like Thailand. “Each one of us produce at least 0.55, 0.44 kg of waste per day. Multiply that by the 5 million person who can live raw, you get about 1.5 million kg… Our system here wants to receive at least 1,500 tons per day. But Monrovia by itself is able to generate at least 880 tons.”

To meet capacity, Green Guard plans to collect waste from Kakata, Buchanan, and other Harbel especially Unification Town.

Flomo said the project is more than engineering—it is nation-building and A blessing for Liberia. “It’s a blessing for Liberia. And the good part is, it’s Liberian company, partnering with an international company from outside. My Liberian are going to be staying here. That means this project will stay forever.”",https://frontpageafricaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-413.png,N,,2026-01-28 07:59:30.447938

Vern Buchanan to retire from Congress wasn’t made lightly.
We’ve got a lot of talented people,” Buchanan told Florida Politics.
He notably said he had consulted with his son, state Rep. James Buchanan, about the decision to retire.
And if he ran for our seat, I’m sure he’d be competitive and probably win it,” Vern Buchanan said.
He leaves behind an incredible legacy here in Congress.” Buchanan said he has always tried to move past the divisiveness of wins and losses.","The decision by U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan to retire from Congress wasn’t made lightly.

With two decades of seniority and serving as the Vice Chair of Congress’ most powerful committee, the Longboat Key Republican wields substantial power for Florida in the House.

But ultimately, the 75-year-old said the Bradenton area deserves fresh blood in Congress. After mulling a decision over the last three months with wife Sandy, Buchanan announced that he would not seek another term.

“We thought that it was probably time to make a change in terms of the region. We’ve got a lot of talented people,” Buchanan told Florida Politics. “And you know, I know I’ve been there a long time. But I think it’s time to give other folks an opportunity.”

National headlines about his retirement listed him as part of an exodus of Republicans departing Congress ahead of a Midterm cycle when Democrats could win a House majority. But Buchanan scoffed at the suggestion.

“If that would have factored into it, I would have been gone long ago,” Buchanan said. “I did work for all these different Presidents, and we’ve been in and out of the majority. No, you just try to work through those and try to find a way you can work with the other side. People that know me know that I’m pretty bipartisan.”

His decision caps a tenure that saw him rise from a junior Congressman elected by the skin of his teeth to being Vice Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee and the longest-serving member of Congress representing Southwest Florida. He’s the Republican co-Chair of Florida’s congressional delegation, and an effective lawmaker who saw 51 legislative accomplishments signed by four Presidents, two Republicans and two Democrats.

Buchanan is declining to endorse a successor right now. He also committed to serving out his final term, saving the state the cost of another Special Election.

He notably said he had consulted with his son, state Rep. James Buchanan, about the decision to retire. Many wondered if the younger Buchanan would run to succeed his father in Congress, though James Buchanan seemed to put those rumors to rest in comments to POLITICO. The retiring Congressman said he did not expect his son to run for the seat.

“He’s running for this state Senate seat, and that looks pretty good. And if he ran for our seat, I’m sure he’d be competitive and probably win it,” Vern Buchanan said. “But I think when you’ve got a young family, it’s tough to haul them off to Washington.”

Buchanan said time with his own family weighed heavily on the choice not to run again. He has 10 grandchildren under the age of 11. None were born when he first won election in 2006.

“Working in D.C. takes most of your time away,” he said.

Looking back at his career, Buchanan points to accomplishments during his tenure, chief among them $28 million secured for the Sarasota National Cemetery. He also touted cutting taxes on small businesses by roughly 20% during his years working on the Ways and Means Committee.

He made a high-profile run to chair that committee in 2023, but lost to U.S. Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri. Smith praised Buchanan’s work after news broke of his retirement.

“Vern has been a longtime friend and colleague on the Ways and Means Committee and a steadfast fighter for the people of Southwest Florida,” Smith posted on X. “His business expertise of more than 30 years was instrumental to the creation and overwhelming success of the 2017 Trump Tax Cuts and the passage of the Working Families Tax Cuts. He leaves behind an incredible legacy here in Congress.”

Buchanan said he has always tried to move past the divisiveness of wins and losses.

“I think it worked out good. I’m the Vice Chairman of the committee. I’ve got a good working relationship, and it’s actually allowed me a little more time and freedom to have some of the other things I want,” Buchanan said of his work on Ways and Means.

“Otherwise, I’d have been traveling a lot more. But as Vice Chairman, I’ve got a lot of responsibility working with all the committees and in the team, and it’s worked out pretty good for Jason and I. It’s always tough up front, when you lose a race by a vote or two or something. But you know, that’s history, and the goal is to do the best we can for the committee, because the country’s counting on Ways and Means to get things right.”

He also worked closely with Democrats as the Florida delegation’s Republican co-Chair. He developed relationships across the aisle with fellow co-Chairs, first with the late U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, a Fort Lauderdale Democrat, and more recently with U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Weston Democrat.

“If it’s something Florida oriented, we want to do it on a bipartisan basis,” he said. “We’ll bring more clout to it when you’ve got both sides working together. We haven’t done quite as much as I’d like, but I’m hoping this last year, we will.”

On more partisan matters, he acknowledges it has been harder to work in a narrowly divided Congress in recent years, sometimes more frustrating than even when he was in a minority.

“It’s a tougher environment than it was. Back then, we had a lot more seats that we could work with, or the other side had more seats to work with,” he said. “You can get more done. Whether you like it or not, you can get more done. But when you’ve got a virtual tie in terms of the number of members, whether on either side, it’s just difficult.”

Buchanan doesn’t expect to run for another office, but still expects to stay involved. He still wants to see a balanced budget amendment passed to restrain federal spending, something he actively pursued throughout his career.

He feels confident Florida will also continue to thrive, in part thanks to state policies focused on economic growth.

“People are coming here. It’s not just the weather, it’s also the business climate, which has created a lot of jobs and opportunities for people,” he said. “I’m very bullish on Florida.”",https://floridapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5iaTkU7w.jpeg,N,,2026-01-28 06:00:06.157844

The total included a target of 5.61bn gallons (21bn litres) for bio-based diesel, a significant jump from the 3.35bn gallons (12.6bn litres) in 2025.
The EPA was now considering a range of 5.2bn-5.6bn gallons (19.6bn- 21bn litres) for bio-based diesel in 2026, the sources told Reuters.
“As publicly stated in court filings, the agency aims to finalise in the first quarter of 2026,” the agency said.
In September, Reuters reported that the EPA was considering a plan for refiners to offset 50% of exempted gallons.","If finalised, the plan would mark a partial compromise between rival oil and farm industry groups by preserving increased blending targets sought by biofuel producers while dropping a proposal that US refiners had warned would disrupt fuel markets and raise costs, the 15 January report said.

The EPA which oversees US biofuel policy, had told industry stakeholders it aimed to send the final proposal to the White House budget office for review this month, with finalisation expected around 30 days after that, following industry interviews by the White House.

In June, the EPA proposed total biofuel blending volumes of 24.02bn gallons (91bn litres) in 2026 and 24.46bn gallons (92.6bn litres) in 2027, up from 22.33bn gallons (84.4bn litres) in 2025. The total included a target of 5.61bn gallons (21bn litres) for bio-based diesel, a significant jump from the 3.35bn gallons (12.6bn litres) in 2025.

The EPA was now considering a range of 5.2bn-5.6bn gallons (19.6bn- 21bn litres) for bio-based diesel in 2026, the sources told Reuters.

The potential downward adjustment was partially related to the EPA's plan to drop a proposal that would reduce the value of renewable fuel credits given by the US government for imported biofuels, an “America First” policy that had been welcomed by the soyabean and biodiesel industries, the report said.

The petroleum industry, led by the influential American Petroleum Institute industry group, had argued that limiting credits for foreign supply could constrain availability and push fuel prices higher – an outcome the White House was eager to avoid as affordability remained a central political concern heading into mid-term elections this year, Reuters wrote.

On 19 November, Reuters reported that the EPA was considering delaying the proposal for at least a year.

The EPA told Reuters the agency was still reviewing comments on the proposed rule.

“As publicly stated in court filings, the agency aims to finalise in the first quarter of 2026,” the agency said.

The EPA was also expected to decide if larger refiners would be required to make up for gallons exempted under the agency’s small refinery waiver programme, a determination that could significantly affect overall biofuel blending quotas, Reuters wrote.

In August, the EPA had cleared a backlog of more than 170 small refinery exemption requests dating back to 2016 and, since then, had issued additional exemptions, the report said.

The biofuel industry and its legislative allies have been urging the administration to require refiners to offset 100% of those exempted gallons, while the oil industry is resisting the obligations, according to the report.

The EPA has been seeking comment on a range of proposals, ranging from zero reallocation to 100%.

Sales in the top five European markets grew by 41% in the fourth quarter of 2025 in comparison with the same period in 2024. As a result, one in five vehicles (20%) sold in these markets in Q4 were BEVs, the highest recorded quarterly BEV market share for the region.

The German BEV market continued to enjoy strong growth, up by 56% YoY in the fourth quarter to reach a market share of 22%, the highest level for more than two years. French BEV sales followed a similar course, up by 49% in Q4 2025 vs. Q4 2024 to register a market share of 25%, by some distance the country’s highest ever BEV market share. The UK attained the same landmark, after posting a market share of 28% for the quarter.

PHEV sales in the top five markets increased by 40% YoY in Q4, boosted not least by growth of more than 100% in both Spain and Italy. France was the exception in the generally rosy PHEV picture, with sales declining YoY by 24% in Q4. In contrast to the growth in EV sales, ICE registrations fell by 18% in the top five markets combined in the fourth quarter relative to the same period in 2024.

Other European markets

Norway boasted the strongest BEV growth among the other European markets in Q4, up by 93% vs. Q4 2024. The BEV market share in Denmark (75%) and the Netherlands (53%) were also dominant.

China

BEV sales grew by 16% year-on-year in Q4 2025, as quarterly registrations neared the three million mark. More than one in three vehicles (36%) sold in this quarter were BEVs. Sales of the other powertrain categories declined. After extremely strong growth in recent years, the PHEV market suffered in the second half of 2025, ending with a 12% YoY decline in sales in the fourth quarter. Total EV market share for the quarter stands at 59%. The ICE market continues its steady decline, with sales down by 4% over the course of 2025.

Japan

BEV sales grew by 37% in the fourth quarter compared to the same in 2024, ending a positive year on another high note. BEV market share grew from 9% to 13% over the course of 2025. In 2025, hybrids constituted over one-third of all car sales, achieving a market share of 34%.

The Japanese EV market continues to be dominated by the sale of hybrids, with a market share of 60% over the course of 2025. Although BEV sales did grow by 17% in 2025, market share for the segment was still below 2%.

The termination of EV tax credits at the end of September 2025 had a significant impact on sales in Q4. Whereas BEV sales had increased 23% year-on-year in the third quarter of the year as consumers hurried to take advantage of the incentive, they fell by 31% YoY in Q4. Despite this volatility, the BEV market share for 2025 remained nearly unchanged from the previous year, holding steady at just under 8%.

The changes prompted the ire of environmental groups who say it is the latest in a year’s worth of attacks on public lands protections by President Trump’s administration.

The regulations being updated govern how the Forest Service reviews lands it manages that could be included in an oil and gas leasing auction conducted by the Bureau of Land Management, the agency usually responsible for managing minerals on federal lands. Some of the changes mean the Forest Service will no longer analyze areas for lease on a parcel-by-parcel basis. Instead, the agency will defer to a broader, NEPA-compliant environmental review, which can sometimes cover millions of acres, to determine whether to allow drilling.

“These new rules provide the certainty needed to boost production, slash energy costs, and guarantee our global leadership,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “By streamlining permitting and cutting bureaucracy, we are lowering costs for families, creating jobs, and securing our nation all while protecting our public lands.”

If every landfill shown on this map were developed for solar energy, the potential exists to support an estimated 1,700 MW of electricity.
RMI’s map uses total site acreage, floodplain avoidance, and levelness as factors in determining usable acreage for solar.
Map Manual: Each circle on the map below is a single closed landfill.
Click on a landfill to learn more about that landfill, including its energy potential, county information, and electric utility information.","Up until recently, closed landfills, otherwise known as “brownfields,” didn’t have much to offer. The soil is often toxic, and is otherwise unsafe for any significant construction. But they can have new life as community-powering solar projects, or “brightfields.”

Over 300 brightfields are already in operation on closed landfills across the United States. They are ideally sited, with little shade and ample existing connections to electric infrastructure and roads.

RMI’s research shows that deploying solar energy to convert these sites into brightfields is an opportunity to safely reactivate land, generate local electricity, and accelerate the transition to cleaner, lower-cost renewable energy. This map highlights the siting potential of Indiana’s closed landfills for solar development and is intended for communities and developers to be more prepared during early-stage planning.

RMI’s Indiana Landfill Solar Potential Map displays closed landfills in Indiana with no planned reuse, helping communities and site owners understand their potential for solar energy deployment.

Purpose: Developing these sites for energy generation can:

Preserve land for agriculture and recreation

Reduce pollution

Generate electricity that is not subject to fuel price volatility

Technical Potential: As of October 2024, only 6 brightfields projects have been completed in Indiana. If every landfill shown on this map were developed for solar energy, the potential exists to support an estimated 1,700 MW of electricity.

Map Details: Landfills on the map are colored by the estimated amount of solar capacity that could be installed on each site, where sites with higher estimated generation potential are darker blue, as shown in the color bar on the top right of the map. RMI’s map uses total site acreage, floodplain avoidance, and levelness as factors in determining usable acreage for solar.

Technical Details:

Land Reuse: This map only shows landfills with no planned reuse. Some landfills with a planned reuse may still be suitable for solar, but these are not shown on the map.

Estimated Useable Acreage is an estimate of the acreage that is suitable for solar. This area is the total area of the site that is not in a floodplain or wetland and does not have a steep slope. Actual usable acreage may be greater (if landfill buffer or nearby rooftops are available) or smaller (if parts of the site are unsuitable for supporting solar due to physical, safety, policy, or financial constraints).

Estimated Viable Solar Capacity assumes that 70% of the Estimated Usable Acreage is developed for solar, assuming 5 acres are needed to generate 1 MW of solar.

Site Specific Information is Available in the Virtual File Cabinet: This map does not include every factor impacting site suitability. Documents in the Virtual File Cabinet may provide additional details that can help determine site viability for solar development.

In Utah, Rocky Mountain Power offers up to $2,000 in cash back on ground-source heat pumps and up to $1,600 on air-source heat pumps.","Based in Salt Lake City, Rocky Mountain Power is a utility that provides energy to homes and businesses across Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho. A division of PacifiCorp, the company is committed to providing safe, reliable, and resilient energy.

Resiliency is perhaps the biggest focus in response to natural disasters and climate events that have caused catastrophic power outages worldwide in recent years. Rocky Mountain has emphasized grid hardening and system strengthening to ensure power stays on, stating that “From wildfires to winter storms, our grid is built to stand strong.” For example, the utility invested heavily in wildfire prevention strategies. Using aerial and ground patrols, it searches for trees and vegetation that may come into contact with power lines and prunes or removes them as needed. It also upgrades fuses, relays, and reclosers, and installs fire-resistant poles to minimize the risk of sparks starting fires. In fire high consequence areas (FHCAs), Rocky Mountain even buries lines underground.

A network of weather stations and a Wildfire Intelligence Center enable teams to consistently monitor weather and conditions in service areas, leveraging technology such as AI cameras and social listening. These insights help the company to make decisions more quickly, such as conducting a public safety power shutoff, turning on enhanced safety settings, or enacting emergency de-energization. In the case of a power outage, Rocky Mountain works around the clock to restore power to transmission lines, substations, distribution lines, and eventually homes and businesses.

Reliability is also at the forefront of Rocky Mountain’s work. “Always prepared. Always improving,” the company described, “We deliver power you can trust.” These words are put to action by ensuring energy security during hot summer days. The Cool Keeper program allows households to earn $30 in bill credits every year for installing a device near the central air conditioner unit that is activated during ‘Cool Keeper events’ on certain days in the summer, when the utility temporarily cycles off the air conditioner. The air conditioning fan continues to circulate cool air, making cheaper energy available for all Utahns.

Rocky Mountain also contributes to energy assistance programs for lower-income customers. Notably, it matches and doubles every dollar Utah customers donate to the Lend a Hand program, helping other households keep their heat running and their lights on during the cold, dark winter months.

The utility additionally offers multiple avenues for customers to source clean energy, including rooftop solar installations. Those who install solar systems with backup battery storage can then participate in the utility’s Wattsmart Battery program, which aggregates all participating batteries to provide energy to the grid when it is most needed or to keep the grid stable. Rocky Mountain uses upfront rebates and ongoing bill credits to encourage customers to join the program.

Even if they do not install anything on their own property, Rocky Mountain customers can support clean energy. The BlueSky program enables customers to purchase 100-kilowatt-hour Blocks of renewable energy at just $1.95 per Block per month. In 2024, more than 158,000 customers participated, sourcing over 1 million megawatt-hours of clean energy from projects in the western U.S., enough to power 103,017 homes for a year. Since 2000, participants have sourced nearly 15 million megawatt-hours of clean energy, enough to charge more than 800 billion smartphones. Participation helps fund new community-based clean energy projects, adding 377 such projects to local schools, libraries, and food banks thus far.

For example, a 306.72-kilowatt solar array was added to The Other Side Tiny Home Village, an affordable housing community that emphasizes social bonding to combat homelessness, and 500 solar panels were added to a new Salt Lake School District transportation bus solar canopy, helping clean the air in an underserved area. Meanwhile, the Utah Subscriber Solar program enables customers to buy 200-kilowatt-hour blocks of solar energy generated by a 20-megawatt solar project in Millard County, Utah’s largest shared solar project with more than 81,000 solar panels. Over 3,200 customers participate in the program.

Rocky Mountain strives to help customers achieve their energy goals, particularly by providing tools to lower monthly electric bills. In the Home Energy Reports portal, customers can easily see their energy costs broken down by appliance category and even receive personalized tips for saving energy. Additionally, a ‘Time of Use’ rate plan enables customers to shift energy usage to off-peak hours, for example, by washing dishes or charging electric vehicles when demand and energy costs are lower.

One of Rocky Mountain Power’s most powerful perks is the rebates it offers to consumers for enhancing the energy efficiency of their homes, like through their partnership with Wattsmart Homes. The program offers cashback rebates on smart thermostats so residential users can easily set temperatures to achieve cost savings, as well as on heat pumps, insulation, and high-efficiency windows. In Utah, Rocky Mountain Power offers up to $2,000 in cash back on ground-source heat pumps and up to $1,600 on air-source heat pumps.

Plus, through the Rocky Mountain Power New Homes program, the utility offers rebates to a network of Wattsmart home builders for including energy-efficient features in new builds. Working with one of these builders translates into cost savings, the company explained: “A home with a HERS (Home Energy Rating System) Index Score of 60, as an example, can save you an estimated $1,257 in energy costs each year.”

Altogether, Rocky Mountain’s typical residential customer saves $601 annually compared to the U.S. average, while the typical commercial customer saves $4,127 per year, according to the Edison Electric Institute.

Houweling’s Tomatoes in Mona, Utah, is one company that benefited from cost savings through the Wattsmart Business Program, as Rocky Mountain helped them use waste heat and carbon dioxide from a power plant to fuel agricultural operations. Proprietor Casey Houweling said, “We got some $950,000 to help increase our efficiency of electrical use and reduce our consumption. It also saves us some $500,000 in power.” Another, Ash Grove Cement in Leamington, Utah, has been part of the program for more than 15 years. Kendall Taylor, an Ash Grove process engineer, reflected that while upgrades on the finish mill system cost around $1 million, it resulted in around $3.3 million kilowatt hours of savings, or about annual electricity bills that are $200,000 lower, “so it was a very successful project, it paid itself back very quickly, and it set us up for the long term.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Drone-Inspections_2-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 22:59:25.358878

If you follow this blog, you have probably sensed a trend: environmental regulation rarely moves in a straight line. This coming year will be no different. Below is a more detailed look at three areas we will be watching this year.

1. PFAS Reporting and Liability

Manufacturers will be spending more time thinking about PFAS in 2026. We have been talking about the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) PFAS reporting rule for years, and it is expected to become final early in 2026. As we previously reported, this rule will require manufacturers to report certain information on PFAS-containing articles going back as far as 2011. The EPA proposed some important changes to the rule at the end of 2025, including exemptions for de minimis concentrations, imported articles and chemicals used in research and development. Once the TSCA rule is finalized, it will require manufacturers to report extensive information about PFAS uses, production volumes, byproducts, exposures, and disposal.

In addition to the federal reporting requirement, states are getting in on the action. If your products travel into Minnesota, Minnesota’s sweeping PFAS‑in‑products statute (Amara’s Law) will require you to report products with intentionally added PFAS. By July 1, 2026, manufacturers will be required to disclose product‑specific PFAS details, including the type and amount of the PFAS in the product as well as its purpose or function.

These federal and state reporting obligations create challenges for manufacturers to dive deep into their supply chains in an attempt to gather the required information. For sectors using PFAS indirectly—such as coatings, plastics, electronics, and molded components—the data‑gathering burden may be significant.

In addition to reporting obligations, investigation and remedial obligations related to PFAS are on the rise. The EPA plans to maintain CERCLA hazardous‑substance designations for PFOA and PFOS, signaling continued expansion of PFAS‑related cost recovery and cleanup obligations. That means manufacturers with current or historical PFAS use—or who acquired property with legacy PFAS contamination—will likely face increased risk of enforcement actions or third‑party claims.

2. Water Law Uncertainty: WOTUS and NPDES Permitting Changes

Water regulation remains a challenge for many manufacturers, and 2026 won’t offer much relief. As my colleagues have previously explained, the continued regulatory back‑and‑forth regarding the definition of Waters of the United States (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act has left manufacturers guessing as to the activities that will trigger Clean Water Act jurisdiction. This matters because facility expansions, stormwater projects, and wetlands issues all hinge on these key jurisdictional determinations.

At the same time, both EPA and states are tightening oversight of NPDES permitting for indirect discharges. Manufacturers whose wastewater enters complex conveyance systems, such as municipal treatment systems, may face additional pretreatment, sampling, monitoring, and recordkeeping obligations as regulators try to close gaps in indirect discharge oversight. Spoiler alert—PFAS are emerging in this context, too.

3. The Patchwork of State Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Laws

For manufacturers selling their products into multiple states, the growing patchwork of packaging EPR laws is quickly becoming a compliance challenge. A number of states, including Colorado, California, and Minnesota, now have packaging EPR programs, each with different definitions of producer, different covered packaging materials, and different registration and reporting deadlines. And many states, including Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York, are poised to follow.

The variability in these laws makes it difficult for manufacturers looking to develop a one-size-fits-all approach. Manufacturers should stay on top of these laws and their requirements in an attempt to develop as streamlined a strategy as possible for compliance.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15537_3227.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 01:59:18.089671

The company says Riverstart Solar IV is now in commercial operation in Randolph County, generating enough electricity each year to power the equivalent of more than 28,800 Indiana homes and businesses. It’s part of a broader push to add more in-state generation as utilities and grid operators look for reliable, homegrown power.

Riverstart Solar IV is the latest addition to EDP Renewables’ growing footprint in Indiana, where the company is already the largest owner and operator of wind and solar projects. With this project online, EDP Renewables now operates about 2 gigawatts of generation capacity in the state, enough to power the equivalent of more than 527,000 homes and businesses.

Beyond clean energy, the project also has a sizable local economic footprint. EDP Renewables estimates Riverstart Solar IV will generate more than $88.6 million in local and regional economic impact over time. That includes about $51.4 million in revenue for local public services such as schools, roads, emergency services, equipment, and parks, along with roughly $35 million in payments to local landowners hosting the project. The company also estimates around $2.2 million in regional spending and about 625 jobs supported during construction.

Looking longer term, EDP Renewables says its projects are on track to contribute about $65 million to Randolph County by 2038 through economic development agreements and permitting fees.

The company has also invested directly in the community, donating more than $565,000 to local organizations. Those funds have gone toward workforce development, education programs, youth sports, and disaster relief.

Indiana state officials say projects like Riverstart Solar IV fit with the state’s push for affordable and reliable power, while local county leaders point to new revenue streams that can help pay for infrastructure upgrades and public services.

Electrek’s Take

A 150 MW solar farm isn’t going to be the be-all and end-all for Indiana’s long-term power needs, but projects like Riverstart Solar IV show how utility-scale solar is quietly becoming part of the state’s reliability picture. The SEIA expects Indiana, currently ranked 12th among states for solar capacity, to add 17,230 MW over the next five years, and that will move it into third place.

As load grows from manufacturing and data centers, Indiana is increasingly relying on locally produced generation that can be built quickly and at predictable costs. The real test will be how fast projects like this can scale, and whether grid upgrades keep pace. And it’s got a long way to go when it comes to renewables: nearly 60% of the state’s power sector is still powered by coal, followed by fossil gas (35%).

Environment Rhode Island is a policy and action group with one mission: to restore and protect the natural world. Our staff works for clean air, clean water, clean energy, wildlife, open spaces, and a livable climate. Our members across the state put grassroots support behind our research and advocacy. Environment Rhode Island is part of Environment America, a national network of 30 state environmental groups.

Here are our priorities for 2026:

Wildlife and Wild Places:

From the woodlands to the coastline, Rhode Island is home to an array of priceless green spaces, waterways, and wildlife. And yet, pollution and development threaten even our most pristine places which wildlife call home. We support:

The funding and establishment of more wildlife corridors and wildlife crossings to allow for safe passage for wildlife movement and migrations including across roadways. This includes protecting open space, and building bridges or underpasses to allow creatures to move throughout their natural habitat.

Special efforts to protect pollinators, which have a unique role to play in protecting biodiversity. We’re working to establish and expand bee habitats through tools like roadside pollinator strips and stop the use of bee-killing pesticides.

The protection of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales off of our coast.

The Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, which would give money to the states each year to protect vulnerable species in our state, like the leatherback turtle, the piping plover, and the peregrine falcon.

The creation and expansion of more parks, forests, reserves, refuges and recreation areas, both for nature’s sake and for the enjoyment of the public.

Less Waste:

In 2023, Rhode Islanders threw out 495,318 tons of trash. According to our recent report, Trash in America, containers and packaging makes up 28% of our waste nationally. Nothing we use for a few minutes should be allowed to pollute our oceans and rivers and threaten wildlife for centuries. We’re also working to extend the life of myriad other products to reduce waste and save consumers money. We support:

Policies like the Plastic Pellet Free Waters Act in Congress, which would stop companies from dumping and spilling plastic pellets into our waterways. Last May, Environment Rhode Island helped organize the International Plastic Pellet Count, and volunteers in Rhode Island surveyed eleven locations.

Strong producer responsibility laws to hold companies responsible for the waste their products create and incentivize less and better packaging design in the first place

Right to repair laws for products ranging from consumer electronics to farm equipment to wheelchairs to medical technology

Clean Water:

If we want a greener, healthier world we need to protect our rivers, lakes, streams and coast. Clean water is vital to ecosystems, but too many of our rivers, lakes, streams and coastal areas are vulnerable to pollution. This pollution, along with outdated infrastructure – like lead pipes in our schools – also puts our health at risk. We need to work together to protect our waters. We support:

Making our beaches and other waters safer for swimming by funding projects to prevent sewage overflows and runoff pollution

Stronger protections in Rhode Island for wetlands and streams – including stricter permitting, applying conservation funding, and expanding waters with protective designations

Schools and child care centers installing filters certified to remove lead at all taps used for cooking and drinking, and replacing all lead service lines

Limiting the use of PFAS in consumer products, barring companies from dumping PFAS into our rivers, cleaning up PFAS contamination in our water and communities, and holding industry accountable for damage they have caused

Clean, Green, Renewable Energy:

It’s time for our country to conserve more energy, use the energy we do have more efficiently, and rely on sources of energy that are clean, renewable and leave less environmental damage in their wake. And, Rhode Island is an important part of our country’s transition to clean renewable energy.

Over the past two years, GM has produced nearly $25 billion in free cash flow, Jacobson said, while investing more than $20 billion in capital projects and retiring $1.8 billion of debt in 2025 alone.​ Shareholders are seeing that windfall directly.
Since then, it has beaten expectations each quarter, even after reraising its earnings before interest and taxes guidance twice, while making $3.5 billion worth of buybacks and paying down $1.3 billion in debt.
It was the best-performing major automaker stock of the year, up 60%, the strongest year for GM since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009.
Back to 8% to 10% margins in North America On Tuesday, GM also delivered an outlook reassuring investors that it can grow earnings even in a choppy macro and regulatory environment.","General Motors shares surged as much as 9% on Tuesday, adding over $7 billion to the company’s market capitalization, after the biggest automaker in Detroit reported earnings. Disclosing a massive $7.6 billion dollar write-down on its electric vehicle ambitions, the automaker also wowed the Street with blockbuster cash generation, fatter shareholder payouts, and a confident outlook for 2026.​

The Detroit giant, long seen as the standard-bearer for traditional U.S. carmaking, reported 2025 adjusted Ebit of $12.7 billion, landing at the high end of its guidance range, and $10.6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. GM also said 2025 marked its highest U.S. market share in a decade and its fourth straight year of share gains, supported by low dealer inventories, low incentives, and firm pricing on trucks and SUVs.​

Write-down resets EV strategy

The headline negative in the quarter came from already known struggles in GM’s electric vehicle business. Management booked a total of $7.6 billion dollars in EV-related restructuring charges in the second half of 2025, including impairments and cash costs tied to right-sizing capacity after demand and U.S. policy shifted against aggressive EV targets.​

CFO Paul Jacobson said the charges stem from decisions such as discontinuing the BrightDrop electric van and impairing certain EV assets, along with contract cancellations and supplier settlements; about $4.6 billion of the total is expected to be settled in cash, mostly in 2026, with $400 million already paid last year. Despite the reset, GM emphasized it has not impaired its core retail EV portfolio and still expects EVs to become profitable over time as new battery chemistries, cost cuts, and more rational market conditions take hold.​

Investors reward cash and discipline

What overshadowed the write-down was GM’s ability to generate cash and return it to shareholders even as it absorbed tariff costs, along with restructuring its EV line. Over the past two years, GM has produced nearly $25 billion in free cash flow, Jacobson said, while investing more than $20 billion in capital projects and retiring $1.8 billion of debt in 2025 alone.​

Shareholders are seeing that windfall directly. GM repurchased $6 billion in stock in 2025, including $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, cutting its diluted share count by more than 465 million shares, or nearly 35%, since late 2023 and leaving about 930 million shares outstanding at year-end. The board approved a fresh $6 billion buyback authorization and boosted the quarterly dividend by 20% to 18 cents per share, moves Jacobson said reflect confidence in structurally higher annual free cash flow.​

Fortune contributor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor, highlighted CEO Mary Barra’s performance as one of the best in 2025, saying that GM faced an “unimaginable year” of volatility after Trump’s “Liberation Day” in April. Since then, it has beaten expectations each quarter, even after reraising its earnings before interest and taxes guidance twice, while making $3.5 billion worth of buybacks and paying down $1.3 billion in debt. It was the best-performing major automaker stock of the year, up 60%, the strongest year for GM since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009.

Back to 8% to 10% margins in North America

On Tuesday, GM also delivered an outlook reassuring investors that it can grow earnings even in a choppy macro and regulatory environment. For 2026, the company guided to $13 billion to $15 billion of adjusted Ebit, $11 to $13 in adjusted EPS, and $9 billion to $11 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow, underpinned by a planned return to 8% to 10% Ebit margins in North America.​

Even as it trims EV spending, GM is doubling down on profitable mainstays and software-driven services. The company will invest $10 billion to $11 billion annually in 2026 and 2027, with about $5 billion each year earmarked to expand U.S. manufacturing capacity for high-demand pickups and SUVs and to mitigate tariffs through onshoring production.​

On the tech side, GM reported a record 12 million OnStar subscribers in 2025, including more than 120,000 Super Cruise users, with the advanced driver-assist service expected to add $400 million of high-margin revenue in 2026 and push total deferred software and services revenue to about $7.5 billion. CEO Barra said GM plans to launch a next-generation software-defined vehicle architecture and a new “eyes-off, hands-off” driving system in 2028, debuting on the Cadillac Escalade I, alongside a new LMR battery chemistry aimed at cutting EV cell and pack costs by several thousand dollars.​

A slower, more profitable EV transition

Barra framed the write-down and capacity cuts as a pivot to a more measured EV rollout that better matches customer demand and a changing U.S. policy landscape. GM has sold its stake in an Ultium battery plant, shifted the Orion Assembly plant back to internal-combustion production, and will introduce hybrids in key segments while continuing to expand its EV lineup.​

“We continue to believe in EVs,” Barra told investors, noting that nearly 100,000 new EV customers joined GM in 2025 and that drivers who switch rarely return to gasoline. For now, Wall Street appears to agree with the company’s slower-but-profitable approach: Even with a multibillion-dollar EV hit, investors pushed GM’s stock sharply higher, betting that Detroit’s standard-bearer has found a way to make the transition on its own terms.

And a traditional nuclear power plant takes about a decade to stand up, far longer than the timeframe required to meet burgeoning AI demand.
Is AI demand overhyped?
But on the whole, US data center demand is set to grow.","After two decades of flat electric demand, artificial intelligence has emerged as the US power industry’s great hope. More recently, it's become clear AI is also its biggest threat.

It’s no wonder, then, that AI, data centers and their impact on the utility bills of homes and businesses dominated conversation Monday at BloombergNEF’s annual summit in San Francisco.

Already, the data center boom has shaped the US economy. In November, it swayed elections in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia. It's now poised to play a key role in the congressional midterms this fall.

Here are five takeaways from the first day of the BNEF summit.

Affordability is an 800-pound gorilla

With concerns about energy affordability mounting, data centers are under increasing pressure to limit the burden on individuals. Otherwise, “consumers may end up holding the bag,” said RMI co-founder and chairman emeritus Amory Lovins.

Data centers are the main driver of utility cost growth, so “they also need to be the ones to cover that,” said Ryan Wiser, senior scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Efforts are being made to address this. Just this month, President Donald Trump and a group of governors in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic agreed to push for an emergency wholesale electricity auction that would effectively compel tech companies to fund new power plants. The plan is intended to address two challenges: getting data centers the power they need while attempting to tame utility bills.

Nuclear may miss the initial AI moment

Tech companies have been unequivocal: They want nuclear energy, which is clean and can provide round-the-clock power. Meta Platforms Inc. struck major deals with startups and Microsoft Corp. has led the charge to restart a shuttered power plant, to name two recent moves to kickstart the nuclear industry.

Yet not a single new small modular reactor, or SMR, has been built in the US, and only one design has been approved by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. And a traditional nuclear power plant takes about a decade to stand up, far longer than the timeframe required to meet burgeoning AI demand.

The longstanding question for nuclear power is whether or not reactors can “be built on time, on budget and actually be competitive with natural gas,” said BNEF analyst Musfika Mishi.

Today, nuclear energy in the US is three times more expensive than natural gas-fired power, Mishi said. While SMR companies have promised lower costs, she said, time will tell if they can succeed.

Is AI demand overhyped?

There’s an even more fundamental question than what energy technologies are best-positioned to meet demand: Just how much demand will there be? PJM Interconnection, operator of the biggest US grid, recently dialed back its electricity use forecast for the summer of 2027 after taking a closer look at data center connection requests. But on the whole, US data center demand is set to grow.

BNEF estimates it will hit around 400 terawatt-hours by 2030, en route to tripling over the next 10 years. Other forecasts project much more, with some ranging above 1,000 terawatt-hours of demand by the end of the decade.

Lovins said investors should consider a number of risks when deciding how much to bet on a rapid buildout of natural-gas power plants to meet projected AI demand. Those include the possibility that data centers become more efficient and flexible in their energy use or that the AI bubble pops.

“Demand uncertainty and financial risk rise deeply when artificial intelligence meets natural stupidity,” said Lovins.

United States of contradictions

On the one hand, Trump has made it harder to build wind power. On the other, he’s pushed for a data center boom that needs all the energy it can get.

That’s just one of the many contradictions at play in US energy policy under Trump. The country has also backed out of many climate pacts and groups, allowing China to build even further on its massive clean tech lead, creating what former Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said was a major problem.

“Our economic competitors like China are so happy that the US has pulled back,” she added.

Democrats should “break some eggs”

Granholm’s advice to the next Democrat to win the White House? “Don’t be afraid to break some eggs.”

Under President Joe Biden, Granholm oversaw an effort to allocate tens of billions of dollars in loans and grants for clean technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon removal. Some of that funding has since been clawed back or wiped out by the Trump administration. Granholm said that his aggressive approach should inspire how Democrats tackle the clean energy buildout.

“The cancellation of all of these loans and grants was stunning to a lot of people who had worked on those because we thought we had commitments, we had obligations,” Granholm said. “Had we known that there would be such a slash-and-burn mentality about it, I think we would've done things differently.”

Showdown over NY Tax Increases Between Governor Hochul and Mayor Mamdani

The expected showdown over tax increases between New York State Governor Hochul and New York City Mayor Mamdani has begun. On January 20, Governor Hochul released her FY2027 New York State Executive Budget proposing a record $260 billion in spending. The budget proposes extending the state’s top corporate franchise rate of 7.25% (set to revert to 6.5% after 2026) for seven additional years. However, she did not propose other tax increases.

Mayor Mamdani reacted by stating “we reject austerity politics…It is time to ask New York City’s wealthiest and large corporations to pay their fair share, while also working toward a fiscal relationship with the State that better reflects New York City’s status as the economic engine of the state.” Governor Hochul responded: “I know he’s calling for a tax increase. I’ve heard that. I’m sensitive to the impacts.”

This memo by Sullivan & Cromwell provides a description of Mayor Mamdani’s campaign tax proposals, as well as an overview of the full range of New York City taxes, and the respective power over such taxes held by the mayor, city council, and the state.

IRS Cuts Likely as Congress Works Through FY 2026 Appropriations

While New York and other states are turning to FY 2027 budgeting, the federal government is still working on FY 2026, with a partial shutdown looming. Funding for most of the Federal government expires on January 30 and there is currently a dispute over immigration policy holding up the remainder of the appropriations bills. Congress is poised to cut IRS funding if and when the remaining bills are enacted.

The House passed the remainder of the appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2026 on January 22, before leaving for a one-week recess. Although not part of a formal conference committee, the House appropriations packages appear to have been mostly pre-negotiated with the Senate, and it seemed likely the Senate would pass the bills this week. However, the deadly shooting by a Border Patrol Agent at a protest in Minnesota on Saturday reignited political tensions over immigration policy, and may lead to a government shutdown for the appropriations categories that have not yet been enacted, including Treasury and the IRS.

The tax filing season begins on January 26, so the IRS and Treasury would likely keep on employees involved in the filing season even if appropriations lapse.

Enacted Appropriations Bills

Public Law 119-37, signed into law by President Trump on November 12, funds Agriculture; Legislative; and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs.

President Trump is expected to soon sign into law H.R. 6398, the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026, a three-bill FY2026 appropriations “minibus"" funding Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water; and Interior, which passed the Senate on January 15, and the House on January 8, both by wide bipartisan margins.

Appropriations Bills Passed by the House and Awaiting Senate Action

On January 14, the House passed H.R. 7006, the Financial Services and General Government and National Security Appropriations Act, 2026, by a vote of 341-79. The bill would fund Financial Services (including Treasury) and State-Foreign Operations, providing the IRS with $11.2 billion of funding for Fiscal Year 2026. The IRS received $12.3b of funding in FY 2025. An earlier House bill, marked up by the Appropriations Committee in July and reported in September, would have provided the IRS just $9.5 billion, a 23% cut. The Administration requested $9.8 billion for FY 2026. Unlike the prior State-Foreign Operations funding bill reported by the House Appropriations Committee, H.R. 7006 would not end United States funding of the OECD. The bill is now awaiting Senate action.

The largest funding bill, H.R. 7148, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026, is a four-part appropriations “minibus,” covering Defense, Homeland Security, Labor-HHS-Education, and Transportation-HUD. The 1,059-page bill has a three-line provision rescinding $11.66 billion of IRS funding from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. On January 22, the House broke off the Homeland Security portion, which did not have broad bipartisan support, into a separate bill, H.R. 7147, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2026. The House passed H.R. 7148 by a vote of 341 to 88, and H.R. 7147 by a vote of 220 to 207. H.R. 7148 contains health and trade policy riders, including new Tax Code Section 9826, Oversight of Entities that Provide Pharmacy Benefit Management Services. However, the bill does not contain other tax provisions.

The appropriations bills, both those enacted into law and those awaiting Senate action, would all run through the end of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2026.

Following the shooting on Saturday, Senate Democrats say that they will not vote to fund DHS absent provisions requiring significant policy changes, positing that the Senate should first pass the other appropriations bills. Congressional Republicans are saying that the entire package, including DHS, should be passed together.

The House used a procedural mechanism to stitch together H.R. 7147 and H.R. 7148, so that they can advance to the President only if passed as one bill by the Senate. It had appeared that this strategy would facilitate Senate passage because while Senate Democrats would not vote for the DHS bill on a standalone basis, there would be several (more than enough to get over the 60-vote threshold) who would vote for the whole package. But it now appears the package will not attract sufficient Senate Democrats, if any, to reach the 60-vote threshold.

House Republicans say that they will not come back into session this week to consider any potential changes to the bills made by the Senate, including passing the House package without DHS.

The Friday deadline will make negotiations more complex. The Senate procedural rules regarding the time allotted to debate bills on the Senate floor will make it difficult to bring the appropriations bills to the floor before Friday absent unanimous consent to shorten that time. As of the morning of January 26, it appears, a shutdown is likely unless a resolution is negotiated between President Trump and Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate.

Developments on 2026 Tax Legislation

Although the impasse described above looks increasingly likely to result in a shutdown, it now appears that the lack of agreement on addressing the Covid-era increased tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums will not block the funding bills. Lack of agreement on those credits led to a 43-day lapse in government funding starting on October 1, 2025, the beginning of Fiscal Year 2026.

Following a successful discharge petition led by Minority Leader Jeffries (D-NY), the House took up a bill to extend the increased tax credits for three years on January 8. Seven House Republicans joined Democrats to pass the measure by a vote of 230-196. However, Senate Majority Leader Thune (R-SD) has refused to schedule a vote on the bill in the Senate. Bipartisan negotiations over the credits have bogged down, with coverage for abortion the most contentious issue.

Republicans continue to discuss a possible partisan reconciliation bill this year addressing health and tax policy. On January 13, House Budget Committee Chairman Arrington (R-TX) helped roll out a Republican Study Committee proposal for a 2026 reconciliation bill focused on health and tax policy. The tax provisions include:

Eliminate capital gains tax on the sale of homes to first-time home buyers and of rental homes to tenants

New savings accounts for apprentice education, initial business costs, home purchases, and disaster mitigation and recovery expenses

Tax penalties on foreigners purchasing real property for investment purposes

Expand remittance tax

Repeal the estate and gift tax

Index basis of assets to inflation for capital gains

Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)

Tax penalties on litigation funding

Discussions concerning another reconciliation bill this Congress remain very preliminary and thus the range of possible provisions for inclusion is very wide, even if the final package, assuming there is a bill, is likely to be relatively small. For example, Ways & Means Committee member Rep. Moran (R-TX) is advocating that a reconciliation bill soften the BEAT and NCTI.

However, other Republicans have stated that another reconciliation bill to address tax provisions is not necessary given the breadth of the OBBBA. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Crapo (R-ID) recently expressed considerable skepticism about a reconciliation bill this year.

With the focus on appropriations, there have been no reports about progress on a bipartisan tax package. Interestingly, although the appropriations bills do not generally contain tax provisions, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026, singles out administration of the WOTC (which expired at the end of 2025) as one of the purposes for which the Employment Service is being provided FY 2026 appropriations ($17.5 million).

Notice 2026-11, Guidance on Bonus Depreciation

On January 14, 2026, Treasury and the IRS issued Notice 2026-11, providing interim guidance on expensing under Section 168(k), as modified by the OBBBA. The OBBBA provision provides a permanent 100 percent first-year depreciation deduction for eligible depreciable property acquired after January 19, 2025. The notice announces the intent of Treasury and the IRS to issue proposed regulations implementing the OBBBA changes, including modifications to existing bonus depreciation regulations.

The notice states that taxpayers may generally rely on the existing additional first-year depreciation regulations, applying rules consistent with Treas. Reg. Sections 1.168(k)-2 and 1.1502-68, subject to substitutions and modifications tied to the new effective dates. It also outlines elections and related mechanics, including the ability to elect 40 percent bonus depreciation (or 60 percent for certain long-production-period property and certain aircraft) instead of 100 percent for qualified property placed in service during the first tax year ending after January 19, 2025; elections for specified plants; a component election for certain acquired or self-constructed components of larger self-constructed property; and an election not to claim bonus depreciation for qualified sound recording productions.

The notice is interim guidance and leaves open a number of implementation details that Treasury and the IRS expect to address in forthcoming proposed regulations, including conforming regulatory updates for qualified sound recording productions and other technical applications under the amended regime. It also underscores that forthcoming proposed regulations are expected to be consistent with the interim guidance. Taxpayers may rely on the notice for property placed in service in taxable years beginning before the proposed regulations are published in the Federal Register, provided that taxpayers follow the guidance in its entirety.

Treasury and IRS Publish Proposed Regulations for Backup Withholding Regulations

On January 9, Treasury and the IRS published proposed amendments to the backup withholding regulations under Section 3406 to reflect statutory changes enacted by the OBBBA. The proposed regulations are intended to align the regulatory backup withholding treatment for payments settled through third-party settlement organizations (TPSOs) with the amended reporting thresholds in Section 6050W, which generally treat payments made through third-party networks as reportable only when the aggregate number of transactions exceeds 200 and the aggregate gross amount exceeds $20,000 within a calendar year. Under the statutory revisions, these thresholds operate for purposes of both reporting and backup withholding after December 31, 2024.

Under the proposed rules, in the case of payments made in settlement of third-party network transactions, the amount subject to backup withholding will be determined by reference to the de minimis exception under Section 6050W(e), and a payment will only be treated as reportable for backup withholding if both the transaction count and dollar thresholds are exceeded during the calendar year. The proposed regulation clarifies that the entire amount of the transaction that causes the threshold to be exceeded is subject to withholding, as are any subsequent transactions to the participating payee within the same year. A carryover exception is also included under which the payor must withhold in a calendar year if payments to the payee were reportable in the preceding year.

The proposal would update 26 CFR Part 31 to reflect these rules, and is designed to reduce the frequency of backup withholding on small third-party network payments by raising the operational threshold back to the pre-American Rescue Plan Act levels. Comments on the proposed regulations must be submitted by March 10, 2026, and a public hearing can be requested. The proposal also obsoletes certain prior IRS notices that are inconsistent with the statutory revisions: Notices 2023-10, 2023-74, and 2024-85.

As reported in our January 17, 2026, memorandum, the Discussion Draft would impose sweeping changes to many of the key sections of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), including those pertaining to definitions, testing authorities, review of new chemicals, review and management of existing chemicals, TSCA Inventory nomenclature, relationship to other federal laws, citizens’ petitions, TSCA fees, and more.

Opening Statements from Subcommittee Witnesses

The Subcommittee heard from the following witnesses:

Dimitrios Karakitsos, Partner, Holland & Knight LLP (witness testimony);

John Carey, Regulatory Director, dsm-firmenich (witness testimony);

Tracey Woodruff, Ph.D., MPH, Professor and Director, University of California, San Francisco (witness testimony); and

Kimberly Wise White, Ph.D., Vice President, Regulatory and Scientific Affairs, American Chemistry Council (ACC) (witness testimony).

Karakitsos was the lead chemical staffer on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works during the negotiations and passage of the 2016 Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (Lautenberg Act). He noted that he was testifying on his own behalf and as someone who worked extensively on what ultimately become the Lautenberg Act. Karakitsos testified that the Lautenberg Act was not intended to change the new chemical review process. Instead, Congress based the language on its understanding of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) new chemicals practice as it existed at the time. According to Karakitsos, the Section 21 citizen’s petition provision could allow EPA, after receiving a petition, to skip the prioritization and risk evaluation phase of the existing chemicals process and move directly to the risk management phase.

Carey stated that in 2015, before the Lautenberg Act was enacted, EPA received 593 premanufacture notices (PMN). In 2025, EPA received only 154, a 70 percent decline. Carey noted that in the same timeframe, research and development (R&D) spending in the United States fell 77 percent. Innovation is occurring, it has simply moved outside of the United States. Carey highlighted the ability of EPA’s Safer Choice program, which is “unencumbered” by EPA’s interpretation of TSCA Section 5 review, to affirm the safety of thousands of fragrance chemicals.

Woodruff testified that the changes in the Discussion Draft would make it harder for EPA to obtain the data that it needs to identify harmful exposures and unreasonable risks and take action to protect human health and the environment. According to Woodruff, EPA has approved the “overwhelming” majority of new chemicals submitted since the Lautenberg Act, including low-volume exemptions for over 600 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Woodruff criticized language in the Discussion Draft that would amend TSCA so that EPA reviews only uses and exposures identified by the PMN submitter rather than all reasonably foreseen uses and exposures.

According to Wise White, over 80 percent of active new chemical reviews exceed the 90-day statutory deadline, and 60 percent remain pending for more than one year. Wise White testified that due to EPA’s delayed review process, 70 percent of ACC’s members have introduced new chemicals outside of the United States. The Discussion Draft would introduce new milestones for new chemical reviews: assigning a human health risk assessor within ten days; meeting with the submitter within 30 days; and mandating explanations for deadlines missed by EPA.

Comments on the Discussion Draft

Carey testified that his company has nine PMNs pending with EPA since 2020 and 2021. One substance is biodegradable, has an increased carbon efficiency, and similar chemistry would be approved by the Safer Choice program. It remains under review in the new chemicals program, however. Wise White testified that allowing the introduction for new chemicals approved by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries would allow EPA to focus on reviewing completely new chemistries.

Woodruff stated that the Discussion Draft would require EPA to prioritize industry-submitted data over analog data and EPA models. According to Woodruff, it would then be difficult for EPA to use these other kinds of information while allowing industry to select what data to submit to EPA. Woodruff also noted that the Discussion Draft would also allow the PMN submitter to identify the uses that will be reviewed by EPA rather than EPA determining and reviewing uses that are reasonably foreseen. According to Wise White, since the Lautenberg Act was enacted, for every new chemical that EPA has reviewed, EPA has determined that it presents an unreasonable risk. Wise White states that this is because EPA focuses on conditions of use (COU) that are not relevant, leading to flawed assessments. The Discussion Draft would direct EPA to focus on how the chemical will actually be used.

Under the Discussion Draft, EPA would be prohibited from assuming noncompliance with existing federal regulatory limits, including permissible exposure limits (PEL) set by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). According to Woodruff, this would harm workers by prohibiting EPA from imposing requirements inconsistent with OSHA’s outdated PELs. Wise White stated that EPA has not used data provided by manufacturers on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) or the implementation of emission controls. As a result, Wise White stated that EPA has mischaracterized occupational exposures. Wise White also noted that EPA has not used the expertise of other federal agencies such as OSHA.

According to Karakitsos, when Congress was drafting legislation to amend TSCA and revise the existing chemical process, not all of those changes were carried over to the TSCA Section 21 provision. The Discussion Draft would ensure that EPA’s regulatory decisions are supported through scientific review. Karakitsos noted that Section 21 is not solely for activists but is also open to industry. Depending on the presidential administration, industry could begin filing Section 21 petitions.

Commentary

As Bergeson & Campbell, P.C. (B&C®) reported in its January 17 memorandum, the breadth and scope of contemplated changes in the Discussion Draft — 37 pages of amendatory text covering nearly every major section of the law — is a far cry from the narrow set of reform measures that we have heard some cautious support for in this Congress. With a few exceptions, the substance of most of those changes is not surprising and includes many of the top issues industry stakeholders have been voicing concern about over the years. The hearing, however, made clear that the text did not include Democratic priorities and that bipartisan agreement — to the extent it is attainable — was still a long way out.

As Congressman Tonko (D-NY), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on the Environment, noted in his opening remarks, the 2016 amendments started from a bipartisan consensus that TSCA was broken. The overall sentiment from Democratic lawmakers at the hearing, however, was that the “sweeping overhaul” proposed by Republicans in the Discussion Draft would weaken EPA’s ability to protect the public against chemical risks, rather than improve EPA’s implementation. Lawmakers were also quick to point out that the expiration of the TSCA fee collection authority at the end of Fiscal Year 2026 should not be used as a political chip to further erode health protections. Nevertheless, the fact remains that over the almost ten years since enactment of the Lautenberg Act, stakeholders have learned that there are implementation issues that may not have been contemplated in 2016. The expiration of the fee authority is an opportunity for Congress to weigh in on whether EPA is interpreting and implementing TSCA as Congress intended and whether the 2016 amendments have had some unintended consequences.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-869295582.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 20:59:46.811618

Oliver Holbourn, National Wealth Fund CEO, said: “This is an exciting new chapter for the National Wealth Fund as we look to unlock the UK’s future.","The Government’s National Wealth Fund (NWF) has pledged to further back the UK’s electric vehicle mission for 2030, from charging networks to domestic battery manufacturing, under its new Strategic Plan.

Published today (28 January 2026), the new Unlocking the UK’s Future strategy sets out how the fund’s remaining capital will be fully deployed over the next five years to support the Government’s growth and clean energy missions and deliver a return for the UK’s taxpayers.

The National Wealth Fund was launched in October 2024 by the Chancellor, building on the success of the former UK Infrastructure Bank with £27.8bn of capital to catalyse and mobilise additional private investment for clean energy and industrial transformation across the UK.

To date, the National Wealth Fund has committed a third of its capital and the new plan outlines that the Fund will now “lean into” the sectors and larger investments where it can make a real difference, driving more than £100bn of public and private finance into infrastructure, supply chains and companies that will unlock the UK’s long-term growth.

Targeted sectors include hydrogen, battery manufacturing & the electric vehicle supply chain and transport infrastructure.

To secure the UK’s future in clean transport, the National Wealth Fund is targeting the full battery supply chain, from raw minerals to gigafactory‑scale manufacturing and recycling, such as its support in Greenpower Park, the West Midlands’ new centre of excellence for battery technology and manufacturing.

The NWF said these investments would “strengthen the UK’s industrial base, unlock jobs, and crowd in private capital to ensure the country leads in the global shift to zero‑emission transport”.

The National Wealth Fund will also continue its work in EV charging; one of 15 sectors in which it will pursue investment opportunities which target high growth, innovative projects and businesses and accelerate the delivery of core infrastructure.

It pointed to 2024 government estimates that at least 250,000 public charge points will be needed by 2030 – although previous figures have suggested 300,000 will be needed – and said that the National Wealth Fund is already financing over 15% of the additional charging points needed for the end of the decade, through investments in operators such as Connected Kerb, Gridserve and Osprey, helping accelerate the rollout of reliable, fast nationwide charging infrastructure.

Building on its existing track record in the sector, the Fund will work with charge point operators and financial institutions to explore further opportunities for debt or guarantee financing to share risks and crowd in private finance. It will also provide advisory support to local authorities adopting electric vehicle fleets through the Regional Project Accelerator.

According to the new strategy, the investments will create or support 200,000 jobs, accelerate the pathway to clean energy by saving 500 million tonnes of CO2e GHG emissions by 2050, and ultimately deliver a positive return for the taxpayer.

Oliver Holbourn, National Wealth Fund CEO, said: “This is an exciting new chapter for the National Wealth Fund as we look to unlock the UK’s future. We will be going further and faster to drive more than £100bn into the economy, fully deploying our capital over the next five years to help drive economic growth, accelerate the transition to clean energy, transform communities with place-based investments and strengthen our self-sufficiency, security and resilience.”

Indeed, early presidential administrations led by Washington and Jefferson themselves concluded that they could not remit penalties recovered by private qui tam litigants.
State legislatures, too, continued to enact statutes authorizing private enforcement throughout the nineteenth century.","Passed in 1863, the False Claims Act imposes liability on entities that defraud the government and permits private citizens to sue and split the amount recovered with the government. Relying on this statute, Cheryl Taylor sued Healthcare Associates of Texas (HCAT), and a jury found that HCAT had submitted tens of thousands of fraudulent claims to Medicare, costing taxpayers over two million dollars.

In response to the litigation, HCAT reprised an argument that numerous lower courts rejected decades ago, namely that the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act authorizing private suits are unconstitutional under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, because they permit private litigants to exercise enforcement power solely vested in the executive branch. Applying binding circuit court precedent, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas rejected HCAT’s arguments. HCAT then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

In January 2026, the Constitutional Accountability Center filed an amicus brief in support of neither party on behalf of legal scholars. Our brief explains that qui tam litigation has a long history and has never been considered an infringement on the executive power.

Qui tam litigation was ubiquitous in England and in the colonies during the period prior to the ratification of the Constitution. Such lawsuits arose under the common law in the thirteenth century, and Parliament subsequently enacted hundreds of statutes authorizing private enforcement in England. British colonists brought qui tam litigation to America, where they enacted reams of statutes with qui tam provisions in the colonial assemblies. Indeed, the Framers, too, participated in this culture of qui tam enforcement: Alexander Hamilton drafted a tax law with qui tam provisions during his time as a Representative in the New York State Assembly, and John Adams regularly represented litigants in civil qui tam actions.

After the ratification of the Constitution, qui tam enforcement remained prevalent. The first Congresses and early state legislatures enacted dozens of statutes with qui tam provisions, and courts regularly adjudicated qui tam actions without so much as a doubt about the constitutionality of such lawsuits. As in England, the executive retained little discretion or oversight over qui tam actions. Indeed, early presidential administrations led by Washington and Jefferson themselves concluded that they could not remit penalties recovered by private qui tam litigants. And when legislatures expressed concerns about qui tam, they were primarily worried about abusive litigation—not that qui tam plaintiffs somehow encroached on the executive power.

Qui tam enforcement continued in the nineteenth century. Congress passed dozens of statutes authorizing private enforcement, and federal courts continued to adjudicate qui tam actions, just as they had during the Founding era. Throughout this period, defendants never challenged qui tam lawsuits as encroaching on the purportedly exclusive enforcement authority of the executive branch, even though they raised other constitutional challenges, like ones rooted in the Due Process Clause. State legislatures, too, continued to enact statutes authorizing private enforcement throughout the nineteenth century.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2026-01-27 20:59:57.644587

Building grid plans that deliver measurable equity As states develop the next generation of grid plans, they have a powerful opportunity to move from check-the-box equity to real, measurable equity outcomes.","By Aashney Shah, EDF Legal Intern, Clean Energy Transition

“Electricity is the new price of eggs.” That line, from a recent New York Times article on rising electric bills and data center growth, captures the political moment with startling clarity. Consumers want solutions. While states have been exploring a wide range of actions to address affordability and equity, policymakers still face a core question: How can we ensure that the biggest benefits reach the communities that need them most?

As equity mandates rise, delivery is the real test

States have begun to codify such distributional mandates for energy. To name just a few, Illinois’ Climate and Equitable Jobs Act requires that “at least 40% of the benefits” of grid modernization and clean energy should go towards Equity Investment Eligible Communities;” New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act requires at least 35 percent, with a goal of 40 percent, of the overall benefits of investments related to clean energy and energy efficiency programs be directed to disadvantaged communities, and Washington’s Healthy Environment for All Act requires agencies to direct “40% of all grants and expenditures that create environmental benefits to vulnerable populations and overburdened communities.”

While many of these states are developing new electric grid plans, the numerical guidelines may be helpful. However, the task is complicated by the fact that many “benefits” are unquantifiable. The answer thus requires more than funding tallies or box-checking exercises. Instead, it requires modern, credible equity analysis grounded in community expertise and rigorous methods that measure real outcomes. Here’s how states can build grid plans that actually deliver:

1. Use a four-part equity framework to score benefits more accurately

Illinois’ 2024 refiled plans highlighted a critical flaw in traditional approaches: utilities relied on binary scoring – a simple yes/no – when evaluating qualitative benefits. Regulators required a more rigorous method, noting that a simple “yes/no” hides meaningful differences in benefit levels and fails to show exactly how investments meet the 40% benefit requirement for Equity Investment Eligible Communities (EIECs). A stronger approach, which contributed to a straw proposal that the Commission ultimately approved, evaluates investments across four established equity dimensions:

Recognitional equity: acknowledging historical and social context

Procedural equity: ensuring inclusive participation

Distributive equity: sharing benefits and burdens fairly

Restorative equity: repairing past harms and supporting long-term sustainability

Scoring measures across these four dimensions creates accountability and clarity; something binary scoring simply cannot achieve.

2. Start with authentic, ongoing community engagement

Research consistently shows that utilities cannot achieve equitable outcomes without two-way, long-term engagement with communities. Effective engagement builds trust, improves social acceptance, and helps ensure solutions reflect real needs. A comprehensive review of 51 equity-focused energy projects found that community engagement efforts that are context-specific are more likely to lead to more equitable energy outcomes, which requires approaches that reflect the diverse perspectives of the communities impacted.

Utilities should identify the engagement process behind each proposed measure and show how it informs the project and its equity analysis. Simply treating spending as a proxy for community benefit may deepen mistrust. Meaningful engagement which shifts the focus to quantitative and qualitative impacts on the community are more likely to be accepted through strengthening trust, especially in communities who have long been excluded from decision-making.

Distributional Equity Analysis provides a practical model by embedding community input into equity metrics, program design, and investment prioritization. California’s Microgrid Incentive Program utilized this approach to generate equity “scores” through stakeholder workshops, enabling transparent evaluation of whether projects met legislative goals.

3. Apply quantitative tools that capture real community impacts

Various proven, practical tools have been developed that quantify equity impacts more accurately than simply cost totals and participation numbers:

Equity indices: Three new community-level indices – Community Energy Financial Index (affordability), Community Energy Sustainability Index (sustainability) and Community Energy Resiliency Index (resilience) – can help measure whether grid investments advance various benefits mandates. The Community Energy Sustainability Index is especially powerful, using GHG intensity (or the total GHG emissions relative to the quantity of electricity produced or consumed) to assess both short- and long-term environmental impacts at the community level.

Regression-based scenario analysis: This approach tests whether equity policies actually expand access by comparing an “equity scenario” to a baseline. Evidence shows targeted incentives drive greater participation among low-income and environmental justice communities.

Optimization modeling:Optimization tools identify the most effective mix of investments under real-world budget constraints, and in furtherance of a specific goal through community dimensions that reflect community needs, climate goals and distributional impacts. By aligning affordability, reliability, climate goals and equity priorities, these models can help utilities maximize benefits, minimize disconnections, and respond directly to regulatory objectives.

Together, these tools allow regulators to pursue equity using empirical measurements, not theoretical projections, increasing the chances that communities experience noticeable improvements to their quality of life because of these efforts.

4. Use community solar as a model for quantifiable, equitable outcomes

Community solar offers one of the clearest examples of how programs can deliver measurable, equitable benefits when designed intentionally. Studies show that community solar participants earn significantly less, are more likely to rent, and are more likely to identify as people of color or Hispanic than rooftop solar adopters. In Illinois, policy accounted for 38% of the income gap reduction between non-participants and community solar subscribers, proving that program design – not just market forces – expands access.

Community solar also delivers meaningful bill savings, increases resilience and reliability, and can be more profitable under equity-enhancing policies. This reinforces a simple truth: deployment numbers alone cannot show whether benefits reach EIEC communities. Qualitative, equity-driven factors must be considered as well.

5. Measure energy burden outcomes – not just spending

Funding levels rarely reflect whether high-burden households actually see relief. That’s why researchers recommend tracking avoided burden (real dollar reductions in bills) and avoided need (burden reductions specifically for high-need customers). Metrics like operational and targeting effectiveness help utilities determine whether programs truly reduce energy insecurity. This shift from inputs to outcomes is essential for credible equity analysis and can help to address the root cause of inequities.

6. Pair distributed equity analysis with benefit-cost analysis

Benefit-Cost Analysis results alone only demonstrate the average impact on customers and do not disaggregate the costs and benefits to understand how they are distributed amongst various populations. Pairing DEAs, as described above, with BCAs allows regulators and utilities to provide a more complete picture of the program’s impacts.

By utilizing DEAs to develop context, identify priority populations, develop metrics, and apply such metrics to priority populations, pairing the results of DEAs provides more robust BCA results. This can be achieved by utilizing the BCA to understand the benefits and burdens of certain interventions of the average customer while utilizing the DEA to show how the benefits and burdens impact priority populations differently.

Building grid plans that deliver measurable equity

As states develop the next generation of grid plans, they have a powerful opportunity to move from check-the-box equity to real, measurable equity outcomes. By strengthening engagement, adopting multidimensional assessment frameworks, and using rigorous quantitative tools, utilities and regulators can ensure that grid investments deliver cleaner energy, lower bills, and greater resilience for the communities that need it most.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//getty-images-wByggEGiZqE-unsplash27-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 03:59:49.789295

Rashida Tlaib and several climate and health activists met with reporters to lay out the costs of loosening restrictions on soot pollution.

In a Tuesday press call hosted by Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action, the Detroit Democrat and members of the American Lung Association and MI Air MI Health warned that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s move to roll back particulate matter standards defies medical science while threatening to bring further harm to communities burdened with pollution.

While former President Joe Biden’s administration announced a final rule in 2024 to strengthen regulations on particulate matter pollution, the Trump Administration revisited the standards “to aid manufacturing,” calling them “a major obstacle to permitting.”

In November, the administration filed a case with the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit asking them to vacate the final rule, which the Biden Administration estimated would prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths. The rules remain in effect until the court makes a ruling.

Teresa Homsi, the executive director of Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action explained that particulate matter pollution is tied to several respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological issues, with pollutants making their way into the lungs and bloodstream.

Multiple speakers argued the EPA had abandoned its mission to protect human health and the environment, with Homsi pointing to the agency’s recent decision to stop calculating how much money air pollution restrictions save in health care costs and how many deaths are prevented.

“If a standard can save thousands of lives, eliminating it amounts to letting thousands of people die,” Homsi said. “And for the EPA, that’s an uncomfortable, inconvenient truth.”

Kindra Weid, a registered nurse working in an intensive care unit in Washtenaw County, explained that these pollutants are made up of a toxic soup of vapors, gasses and particles which can damage the heart, lungs and brain.

Short and long term exposure to soot increases the risk of heart disease and premature death from cardiovascular conditions, Weid said. It can also damage cells and tissues in the lungs, worsening conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Kezia Ofosu Atta, the director of advocacy in Ohio and Michigan for the American Lung Association, noted the particular impact the rollback of these changes would have on Detroit, which the association graded a “D” for particle pollution in its 2025 State of the Air report.

Southwest Detroit has some of the highest levels of air pollution in the nation, largely stemming from a heavy industrial presence and emissions from vehicles.

“I know, as a girl that grew up in southwest Detroit, how incredibly dehumanizing it felt that nobody cared about me breathing clean air,” Tlaib said.

The 2024 final rule set a bare minimum for clean air standards, Tlaib said, and without those protections, families who live in neighborhoods near industrial facilities could see even greater harms.

Tlaib noted that many industrial facilities in the area violate their air quality permits without being held accountable, later calling on the state to take stronger role in enforcing these permits, and for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to work hand in hand with the state’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to determine whether a permit protects public health and the environment.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-3.45.21-PM-scaled-e1769555304702-2048x1159.png,N,,2026-01-27 19:00:21.532913

Dive Brief:

General Motors on Tuesday reported a 55% decline ($3.3 billion) in year over year net income in 2025 from $6 billion in 2024 to $2.7 billion, which was primarily the result of $6 billion in electric vehicle-related charges in Q4, the automaker announced in its earnings report.

Total revenue for the year was down 1.3% to $185 billion, despite a 6% increase in vehicle sales in the U.S. to 2.85 million vehicles. GM reported full-year adjusted EBIT of $12.7 billion for the year, falling short of its guidance between $13.7 billion to $11 billion.

Despite market challenges related to tariffs and a decline in EV sales, GM forecasts adjusted EBIT between $13 billion to $15 billion in 2026 with margins between 8-10% as its pivots from EVs to building more profitable ICE vehicles.

Dive Insight:

GM’s total EV-related charges for 2025 were $7.9 billion, which significantly impacted its bottom line. The company reported an adjusted margin of 6.9% (down from 8% in 2024). However, unadjusted GAAP net margin fell to 1.5% in 2025, from 3.2% in 2024.

The EV-related charges of $6 billion in Q4 included $4.2 billion in cash for supplier settlements and contract cancellations related to its EV business and its pivots to building more profitable ICE vehicles. GM also reported a $1.6 billion in charge in Q3 related to retooling its Orion Assembly plant to produce more ICE vehicles.

“Looking ahead to 2026 and 2027 we expect to invest $10 to $12 billion annually, including approximately $5 billion to expand U.S. manufacturing capacity for some of the highest demand vehicles and further reduce our tariff exposure,” said GM CFO Paul Jacboson on the automaker’s earnings call.

Still, sales of full-size SUVs and pickups were brisk in 2025. GM reported earlier this month that combined sales of GMC and Chevrolet pickups reached 940,000 units last year, a 7% YoY increase. It was the best combined sales of full-size pickups for the company in 20 years. GM anticipates that this momentum will continue in 2026 and beyond. The automaker expects that annual vehicle production in the U.S. will reach 2 million units in 2027.

“We are operating in a U.S. regulatory and policy environment that is increasingly aligned with customer demand,” CEO Mary Barra said in a letter to shareholders. “As a result, we continue to onshore more production to meet strong customer demand for our vehicles.”

Despite brisk sales of highly profitable ICE vehicles last year, GM remains focused on the growth and profitability of its EV business and part of its long-term business strategy. The plans include introducing new battery technologies, including lower-cost lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistries.

GM’s EV growth strategy also includes launching its next-generation software-defined vehicle architecture for both its EVs and ICE vehicles, expanding digital features, as well as launching new hybrid models in key segments. The new vehicle architecture is due to launch in 2028.

“We have not impaired our existing retail portfolio of EVs, we are working to improve the profitability of these vehicles through new battery technologies, engineering improvements and operational efficiencies,” Jacboson said on the earnings call. “We expect to achieve the necessary scale to deliver EVs profitably over time.”

GM also bought back $6 billion in stock in 2025 and the automaker’s board authorized an additional $6 billion buyback for 2026. It will help deliver shareholder returns as GM adjusts to market uncertainties in the EV segment that could impact its future financial performance.

Detroit earned an F grade for particulate matter pollution in the American Lung Association's 2025 State of the Air report.
The stricter particulate matter standards the EPA adopted in 2024 would lower the annual standard for fine particulate pollution from 12 micrograms per cubic meter to 9.
The Biden administration's tougher particulate matter standards were criticized by industry and economic development officials.
""As part of this mission, the AQD will continue enforcing all applicable state and federal air quality rules and regulations.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's effort to roll back federal particulate matter pollution standards will harm Michigan residents, particularly those who live near emitters such as manufacturing plants and refineries in Wayne County, health and environmental advocates warned Tuesday.

The move is a ""clear giveaway to corporate polluters,"" said Kindra Weid, a critical care nurse in Washtenaw County who participated in a virtual press conference Tuesday with opponents of the EPA's actions. ""People living with heart or lung conditions will feel the impact of these rollbacks and need stronger protections, not weaker ones.""

Shortly after President Donald Trump took office last year, the EPA announced plans to reverse course on newly adopted particulate matter pollution standards the agency adopted under President Joe Biden in 2024, describing the stricter standards as a ""major obstacle to permitting."" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the standards protect human health and the environment and will ""unleash the Golden Age of American prosperity.""

The EPA has asked the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., to vacate the Biden-era rule before Feb. 7, when the EPA is set to finalize states' air quality nonattainment areas, which are places where air quality violates Clean Air Act standards.

This month, the EPA said it will stop calculating the financial toll pollution takes on Americans' health but will continue to calculate the financial toll regulations take on businesses. Ignoring the savings on health care spending that follows pollution control means prioritizing business interests over people's health, said Teresa Homsi, executive director of Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action.

“If a standard can save thousands of lives, eliminating it amounts to letting thousands of people die,"" Homsi said. ""For the EPA, that's an uncomfortable, inconvenient truth. Now they're trying to sow doubt in the scientific reasoning that gives us those estimates.""

Pieces of fine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, are so small they can get deep into people's lungs and blood. Exposure to fine particulates can irritate airways and trigger coughing, sneezing or shortness of breath. Exposure also exacerbates asthma, heart disease and heart attack risk.

Fine particulates are emitted by burning fossil fuels in vehicles, factories and power plants. Smoke from wildfires and other burned material also carries fine particulate matter.

Detroit earned an F grade for particulate matter pollution in the American Lung Association's 2025 State of the Air report. The association believes the stricter pollution standards should be implemented to protect public health, said Kezia Ofosu Atta, its director of advocacy in Ohio and Michigan.

Returning to looser standards for the pollutant would make air quality in Wayne County even worse, said U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit. She described a scene in Dearborn's southend, part of her district, where schools and playgrounds are adjacent to a heavy industrial area that includes the Ford Rouge Complex, Cleveland-Cliffs' Dearborn Works steel facility, trucks, trains and the natural gas-powered Dearborn Industrial Generation facility.

Parents and others in the neighborhood are ""petrified"" about the levels of air pollution and are afraid it will get worse with the Trump administration's attempted rollbacks, Tlaib said.

""We already know many of the corporate polluters around our communities violate their own air permits,"" she said. ""Now, I just feel they are never going to be held accountable and it's never going to have the kind of enforcement that needs to happen.""

The stricter particulate matter standards the EPA adopted in 2024 would lower the annual standard for fine particulate pollution from 12 micrograms per cubic meter to 9. Under that standard, three Michigan counties, Wayne, Kalamazoo and Kent, would be considered ""nonattainment,"" meaning the counties' air quality would poor enough to be out of compliance with the Clean Air Act, Homsi said.

The Biden administration's tougher particulate matter standards were criticized by industry and economic development officials. Mike Alaimo, Michigan Chamber of Commerce senior director of legislative and external affairs, said in a 2023 Detroit News column the pollution limits would ""hurt our state's economy and hard-working families.""

""Businesses may need to purchase new equipment or make expensive facility retrofits,"" he said in 2023. ""It may involve emission offset credits among our state’s industrial and commercial operations — all these costs translate to higher prices for consumers who rely on these products and services.""

Tlaib, environmental advocacy groups and people affected by pollution argued the 2024 standards weren't tough enough.

""We were already compromising with the industry in that sense,"" Tlaib said Tuesday. ""We know this is a direct attack on our health and quality of life.""

Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy is charged with enforcing federal and state air quality regulations. Tlaib criticized the department for failing to deny air quality permits that allow facilities to pollute even when the pollution takes place in already polluted areas or when the facilities have a history of violating permits.

""EGLE's Air Quality Division remains committed to its mission of protecting the environment and public health,"" EGLE spokesman Josef Stephens said in an email in response to a question about the federal change's impact on Michigan air pollution. ""As part of this mission, the AQD will continue enforcing all applicable state and federal air quality rules and regulations.

""We are aware of the federal government's proposed regulatory updates and are closely monitoring their development. At this time, it is not yet clear what impact federal changes may have should they move forward.""

Vineyard Wind is already 95 percent complete and is sending some power to the electric grid in Massachusetts.
In an abrupt announcement three days before Christmas, the Trump administration had ordered all work to halt on Vineyard Wind and four other wind farms under construction off the East Coast.
Craig Gilvarg, a spokesman for Vineyard Wind, said in a statement that the developers would work with the administration to safely restart the project.
“Vineyard Wind already produces power from previously installed turbines,” Ms.","A federal judge on Tuesday ruled that construction could continue on a $4.5 billion wind farm off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., striking down the Trump administration’s decision to halt work on the nearly complete project.

Judge Brian E. Murphy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued a preliminary injunction that would allow the developers of the wind farm, known as Vineyard Wind, to restart construction while the broader legal battle unfolds.

The ruling was the fourth legal setback that the Trump administration has suffered in its quest to throttle the country’s nascent offshore wind industry.

Other federal judges have issued preliminary injunctions that allowed three other projects — Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Empire Wind off New York and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia — to resume construction.

Vineyard Wind is already 95 percent complete and is sending some power to the electric grid in Massachusetts. Once fully operational, the project is expected to generate enough electricity to power more than 400,000 homes and businesses in the state.

In an abrupt announcement three days before Christmas, the Trump administration had ordered all work to halt on Vineyard Wind and four other wind farms under construction off the East Coast. To justify the sweeping decision, officials cited a classified report by the Defense Department that found that the projects posed risks to national security.

Judge Murphy, who was nominated to the bench by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said he was unpersuaded by the government’s claims about national security after reviewing the classified report under seal. He said the administration had failed to “adequately explain or justify the decision to halt construction.”

Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, wrote in an email that the Trump administration had paused construction “because our number one priority is to put America First and protect the national security of the American people.” She added that “the administration looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue,” though she did not comment on whether the Justice Department would appeal the ruling.

Craig Gilvarg, a spokesman for Vineyard Wind, said in a statement that the developers would work with the administration to safely restart the project. The developers, Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, had written in court filings that they were losing around $2 million each day that the project was shut down.

When the project was paused on Dec. 22, workers had already installed 61 of 62 turbines. They had also been replacing a handful of potentially faulty turbine blades since July 2024, when one blade broke off and left shorelines scattered with debris, prompting the closure of several beaches in Nantucket, Mass.

Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement on Tuesday that the ruling was “an important development for Massachusetts ratepayers and workers” that would protect thousands of well-paying jobs supported by Vineyard Wind.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined a multistate coalition in filing a lawsuit against the administration last year to halt the unlawful action.

“EV infrastructure is essential, and I am relieved that the Court has halted the Trump Administration from unlawfully terminating congressionally approved funding,” said Attorney General Nessel. “Through these federal actions, my colleagues have been able to recoup billions of dollars for residents, and we remain committed to putting an end to this administration’s illegal conduct.”

Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Congress appropriated $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI) over five fiscal years. The NEVI program was created to fund the nationwide deployment of EV charging stations to improve charging reliability and accessibility for the public. Of the appropriated funds, $87 million was apportioned to Michigan for fiscal years 2022 through 2025.

On January 20, 2025, President Trump mandated federal agencies pause disbursement of all funds appropriated under the IIJA and the Inflation Reduction Act, including NEVI program funding. Despite being mandated by Congress to fund the NEVI program, the Federal Highway Administration notified states in February that the agency was unlawfully revoking previous state plan approvals and would not obligate additional funds for the program. Approximately $29 million in congressionally appropriated NEVI funding for Michigan was impacted by this unlawful action.

Most federal programs related to surface transportation are bundled into a package commonly referred to as the Highway Bill. The most recent iteration of the Highway Bill, 2021’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA),[1] is set to expire on September 30, 2026. Authorizing committees in both the House and Senate are working on legislation to extend the Highway Bill programs, though it is unclear when they will move forward on bill markups and votes.

The IIJA was a $1.2 trillion package that combined traditional surface transportation programs with left-leaning priorities such as electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and “equity”-obsessed social engineering.[2] The bill’s sponsors referred to the dramatic spending increase as a “once-in-a-generation investment,” signaling that spending in subsequent years would not continue at the elevated levels.[3]

Unfortunately, the budgetary baseline that Congress uses to inform its decisions is biased in favor of ever-higher spending.[4] In the case of the IIJA, even though its spending is set to expire at the end of fiscal year (FY) 2026, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assumes that IIJA spending levels will continue in FY 2027 and beyond. As a result, a new Highway Bill that retains the overall spending of the IIJA might be touted as “budget neutral” even if it results in hundreds of billions of dollars in deficit spending.

Legislators face tremendous pressure to keep the gravy train rolling. Groups such as state and local governments, construction contractors, and unions representing government transportation workers all lobby for maximal Highway Bill spending. The American public is also broadly supportive of spending on infrastructure, especially for roads and bridges.

However, this does not absolve Congress of its duty to act responsibly. Representatives should be cautious about spending and cognizant of longstanding Highway Bill flaws that the IIJA exacerbated. This report provides three principles for decision making that can guide Congress to policy solutions and result in a Highway Bill that delivers for Americans of today and tomorrow alike.

Highway Bill Principle 1: Spend what is needed for national priorities, not what is requested by “stakeholders”

The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) was created by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which levied a nationwide tax on gasoline to fuel the fund.[5] Although the interstate highway system was completed in 1992, spending from the HTF was not reduced, especially as Congress added new non-highway programs. Congress did stop hiking the federal gas tax in 1993, but it has steadily increased HTF spending, leading to a series of deficit-funded bailouts.[6] While the IIJA created new temporary programs funded outside the HTF, the HTF remains the centerpiece of the Highway Bill.

A substantial portion of HTF spending is of local rather than national concern.

The largest non-interstate aspect of the HTF is the Transit Account, which funds mass transit systems in urban areas based on population. Despite public transit providing only a small portion of surface transportation usage (e.g. 3.5 percent of commuter trips),[7] and despite transit ridership having been stagnant for the last three decades,[8] the Transit Account has an outsized share of HTF spending, typically between 18% and 20% under current law.[9] Further, transit agencies and riders do not pay into the HTF, meaning that drivers have cross-subsidized transit users for decades.

The HTF’s Highway Account also suffers from diversions into non-interstate projects. These ought to be the responsibility of state and local governments, yet there is a growing and unsustainable trend of Washington picking up the tab.[10]

The CBO estimates that the gap between the HTF’s spending and receipts will be $410 billion from FY 2026 through FY 2035, exhausting available funds in FY 2028 and requiring $329 billion in general fund transfers to maintain current spending levels over the period. A five-year extension of IIJA spending would require a $100 billion general fund bailout.[11]

With the federal government speeding towards a debt crisis,[12] Congress must prioritize Highway Bill spending on the interstate highway system. Lobbyists who demand more spending for their preferred niche of the Highway Bill should not be given priority over true national priorities and the nation’s economic health.

Highway Bill Principle 2: Stop Funding Wasteful Boondoggles

The amount of value generated by infrastructure is based on how much it is used rather than how much it costs to build and operate. A positive example is the interstate highway system, which facilitates trillions of dollars in economic activity by allowing the rapid movement of people and goods, far exceeding its costs.

In contrast, the nation is littered with federally subsidized boondoggles that were sold as promoting economic development but marred by delays, cost overruns, and disappointing ridership. California’s High Speed Rail project has infamously cost tens of billions of dollars since its approval in 2008 yet is still years away from service.

Similarly, transit agencies count on federal funds from the Highway Bill to bankroll questionable expansion projects. Maryland’s Purple Line transit rail project is 6 years behind schedule and $3 billion over budget, while Honolulu’s transit rail project is 11 years behind schedule and approaching a $5 billion budget overhang.[13] With transit ridership down in absolute terms over the last decade despite expansions in many metro areas, such projects should be understood as a jobs program and political patronage rather than a valuable public service.

The IIJA created dozens of programs based on the “Green New Deal” agenda that subsidize electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing and charging stations, electric buses, hydrogen energy, “direct air capture,” and more. Sub-programs such as Communities Taking Charge Accelerator allowed cities and universities to partner with activist groups such as GreenLatinos and People for Mobility Justice.[14] Green New Deal programs cost tens of billions of dollars without providing measurable environmental benefits.[15]

The IIJA also used buzzwords such as “environmental justice” (a concept combining elements of Critical Race Theory and environmentalism) and “equity,” which provided the Biden Administration with an opening to generate a thicket of ideological regulatory mandates on infrastructure projects.[16]

When the cost of a government-funded infrastructure project exceeds the economic value generated by the service it provides, the project is economically destructive. Inputs such as labor, materials, and especially capital would have gone to better use if left in the private economy. Individuals and businesses are careful to seek investments with a strong likelihood of success because they are using their own money, while legislators are often more interested in the political value of ribbon-cutting ceremonies because they are using other people’s money.

Highway Bill Principle 3: States should have flexibility on spending, revenue, and regulations

“Free” federal funds for state government infrastructure projects come with a cost.

Washington requires spending on a variety of marginal programs, regardless of what is needed or practical for a state. These include the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) and Transportation Alternatives programs, which fund local projects ranging from streetcars to bike lanes to hiking trails. Federal funding distorts decision making by local officials, who might think twice if they had to cover a project’s full cost from their own budgets. These programs also distort the HTF because users of local projects do not pay into the fund.

Washington hampers the ability of states to utilize funding sources for infrastructure projects, in particular direct user fees such as tolls.[17] Limits on the amount of Private Activity Bonds (PABs) hamper another financing method.

Washington has added regulatory requirements to federally funded projects that increase the cost of labor, materials, and bureaucracy.[18]

Although Congress has added modest tweaks such as allowing states to transfer a portion of spending between highway programs and some exceptions to the tolling prohibition, the Highway Bill status quo has entirely too much micromanagement. This creates unnecessary friction and violates the principle of federalism.

A general shift towards flexibility would benefit right- and left-leaning states alike, allowing them to prioritize spending based on their best judgment, tailor solutions for each state’s unique needs, and reducing red tape that leads to waste and delays. Loosening Washington’s grip would allow more infrastructure to be built faster and at less cost.

Principled Highway Bill Policies

Reduce Total Spending from the IIJA Level.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated in 2021 that the IIJA would add $400 billion to federal deficits, not including interest costs, despite a handful of questionable “pay-fors” included in the package.[19] Extending IIJA spending levels without substantive offsets at a time when interest rates are considerably higher than in 2021[20] would be budgetary malpractice.

Congress should consolidate Highway Bill spending into a smaller number of high-value programs and apply savings to deficit reduction to the greatest extent possible. Relevant committees should also prepare for using the reconciliation process if too many legislators demand a continuation of unsustainable spending levels. Driving America down the road to bankruptcy would be an unacceptable price to pay for passing a new Highway Bill.

Eliminate “Green New Deal” Subsidies.

IIJA-created programs relating to subsidizing low-carbon energy and vehicles should not become a permanent part of the Highway Bill landscape.

Give States Greater Flexibility to Focus on Core Highway Programs.

Funding for mass transit, the Transportation Alternatives program, the CMAQ program, metropolitan planning, Reconnecting Communities, and more, subsidize local and regional government responsibilities.[21] If removing these programs proves impossible, a compromise would be to allow states to redirect a substantial portion of these funds back into core highway and bridge programs, which are a genuine national priority.

Notably, the Surface Transportation Block Grant program allows states to use Highway Account funds on mass transit projects,[22] whereas the Transit Account funds cannot be repurposed for highways no matter how little a state or region uses transit. Accordingly, giving states control of a portion of Transit Account formula funds and allowing states to shift some of these funds into highway programs would be an equitable solution.

Reduce Bureaucracy and Red Tape.

Competitive and “discretionary” grant programs were a significant aspect of the IIJA. Unfortunately, these programs require additional bureaucratic expense at all levels of government, often adding millions of dollars to the cost of a project and delaying final completion. Any new Highway Bill should reduce the funding share of such programs and focus on formula-based funding.

Dozens of federal regulations impose substantial costs on infrastructure projects and transportation agencies, reducing their value to taxpayers and imposing one-size-fits-all mandates on all 50 states. These include:

The Davis-Bacon Act, and Project Labor Agreements for projects of sufficient size. These undermine Right to Work laws at the state level and increase labor costs.[23]

Domestic sourcing requirements for materials and equipment.

Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program goals that can act as a requirement for de facto identity-based discrimination in contracting. While the Trump Administration is reforming the program, Congress should still eliminate it.[24]

Section 13c of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, which prevents public transit agencies from reforming unsustainable labor costs. This provision was sold as protecting employees of private transit businesses whose routes were taken over by local governments. That scenario has been irrelevant for decades.[25] While this does not directly implicate Highway Bill spending, rescinding Section 13c would be worth tens of billions of dollars to transit agencies over the long term at zero cost to the federal government.

The Highway Bill provides the best opportunity to reduce these regulatory burdens.

Give States More Options for Highway Financing.

One of the reasons why state governments heavily lobby federal representatives for more Highway Bill spending is because many states have limited options to maintain and improve their road networks due to federal barriers to financing.

The 1956 Highway Bill prohibited states from implementing tolls on new highways built with HTF support, creating a two-tier system where the oldest highways (concentrated in eastern states) can be tolled while all other highways cannot. As a result, some states (especially in the west and Midwest) overly rely on gas tax revenues to pay for highways. This is especially problematic as EVs and hybrids grow as a share of the nation’s vehicle fleet. Congress should end age-based highway financing discrimination.

Private investment offers another way for states to fund highway infrastructure. However, federal policy creates an uneven playing field. While there is no limit to tax-exempt municipal bond issuance, the federal government caps PABs at a total of $30 billion in allocated value.[26] Although reining in the total cost of the municipal bond tax exemption would be ideal, increasing or removing the PAB limit would enhance fairness and be more cost-effective on a dollar-for-dollar basis than a comparable amount of federal grant spending.[27]

Conclusion

Congress should use the forthcoming Highway Bill to increase the value of federal infrastructure spending while reducing deficits and empowering states. This would provide sustainable financing for the interstate highway system, boosting America’s economy for generations to come.

After a 2025 pilot that put nearly 100 NACS connectors online across 22 major metro areas, the public fast-charging provider says it plans to scale quickly, with more than 500 NACS connectors expected to be installed by the end of this year at both existing sites and new locations.

The push reflects how quickly NACS is becoming the default in North America. EVgo points out that more than 80% of new EVs sold in the region are expected to be NACS-compatible by 2030. By the end of 2026, more than 35 NACS-equipped models are expected to be on US roads.

Still, connector counts don’t always translate cleanly to real-world charging availability. What matters most to drivers is whether those connectors are actually delivering power when and where they need it.

EVgo says NACS connectors will typically be added in groups of two to four per site, with room to expand as demand grows. The company says it will monitor usage and add more connectors where demand justifies it – an essential detail as networks try to balance headline stall counts with actual output and uptime.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service finalized revisions to its regulation governing federal oil and gas resources on National Forest System lands. The revision modernizes and streamlines the process for managing energy development across millions of acres.

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the updated rule Tuesday, emphasizing the Trump Administration’s joint commitment to eliminating outdated and burdensome processes and advancing President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Orders on Declaring a National Energy Emergency and Unleashing American Energy.

“President Trump has made it clear that unleashing American energy requires a government that works at the speed of the American people, not one slowed by bureaucratic red tape,” said Secretary Brooke Rollins. “This rule gives energy producers the certainty they need to expand supply to make energy more affordable, create jobs, and ensure America remains the dominant force in global energy markets – all while safeguarding forests and communities. Energy security is national security. These revisions create clarity and alignment across federal agencies, allowing our teams to move swiftly on leasing and permitting so American families and businesses can rely on affordable, dependable energy, while continuing to be good stewards of our public lands.”

“We are replacing the Biden administration’s bureaucratic delays with American innovation and efficiency,” said Secretary Doug Burgum. “These new rules provide the certainty needed to boost production, slash energy costs, and guarantee our global leadership. By streamlining permitting and cutting bureaucracy, we are lowering costs for families, creating jobs, and securing our nation all while protecting our public lands.”

The final rule (36 CFR 228 Subpart E), now published in the Federal Register, updates and simplifies federal oil and gas leasing procedures, allowing the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to seamlessly coordinate when issuing permits. By establishing a single, clearly defined leasing decision point and reducing duplicative analysis, the rule improves response times to industry requests, helps reduce longstanding backlogs, accelerates lease issuance, and supports the timely processing of applications for permits to drill.

Under federal law, the Forest Service manages the surface estate of National Forest System lands, while the BLM manages the subsurface mineral estate. The two agencies work together to develop permitting conditions under their respective authorities.

According to a company statement issued on Tuesday, Kim Long Motor will finance the construction of the plant, while BYD will provide comprehensive technical and technological support under the agreement.

Plant Capacity and Project Scope

The battery plant will be built on a 4.4-hectare site and is designed with an initial production capacity of 3 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year. The facility will manufacture batteries primarily for commercial electric vehicles, including buses, trucks, and minibuses.

Kim Long Motor stated that operations are expected to commence soon, although no specific timeline for commissioning was disclosed.

Second Phase Expansion Plans

In the second phase of development, the facility will be expanded to 10 hectares, with production capacity doubling to 6 GWh per year. This expansion will also mark the company’s entry into battery manufacturing for electric passenger vehicles, broadening the plant’s product portfolio beyond the commercial segment.

Vietnam’s Growing EV Market

The project comes amid rapid growth in Vietnam’s electric vehicle market, which is currently led by domestic automaker VinFast. VinFast dominates the country’s EV sector and has recently expanded into commercial electric vehicles with the launch of its electric cargo van, the EC Van, aimed at supporting sustainable urban freight transport.

These buildings house gaseous diffusion process equipment once used at the former gaseous diffusion plants at each site.
“Deactivation is an especially methodical process necessary to safely demolish a building,” Paducah Site Lead April Ladd said.
Team members integrated the lesson learned from this efficiency into the design and construction of the segmentation area at the Paducah Site when work began in the C-333 Process Building.
Drawing from a lesson learned from Portsmouth, Paducah has since modified its equipment to address wear and tear during bundle crushing.","LEXINGTON, Ky. — Sharing knowledge of the best approaches to deactivating process buildings is one of the ways the two Portsmouth Paducah Project Office (PPPO) sites in Ohio and Kentucky align to advance cleanup of former uranium enrichment plants and free up land for America’s golden era of energy dominance and strong national security.

“At Portsmouth, we are farther along in the cleanup process than Paducah, so we’ve been able to share some of our key successes in deactivation with them, such as how we handle process gas converters and compressors, compact or crush converter bundles, and track components to disposal,” acting Portsmouth Site Lead Jud Lilly said. “By sharing knowledge and helping each other, we can work more efficiently and optimize our efforts.”

The Portsmouth team completed demolition on the first of its three massive process building and is currently demolishing a second while simultaneously deactivating the final process building before tearing it down. At the Paducah Site, two of the four process buildings are currently undergoing deactivation prior to demolition. These buildings house gaseous diffusion process equipment once used at the former gaseous diffusion plants at each site.

“Deactivation is an especially methodical process necessary to safely demolish a building,” Paducah Site Lead April Ladd said. “By understanding lessons learned from the Portsmouth Site, we’re able to be more calculated and refine our deactivation process at the Paducah Site.”

Deactivation involves characterizing the building and equipment; disconnecting process equipment; preparing waste for disposal; identifying and removing equipment and material for potential reuse or recycling; removing asbestos and other hazardous waste; isolating and disconnecting utilities; and other work necessary to ensure adequate protection of workers, public health and safety, and the environment.

“When workers initially used plasma cutters to decouple converters and compressors, they needed better airflow, and the purified air-powered respirators were insufficient,” Portsmouth Deactivation Manager Carla Salisbury said. “To improve air flow, we removed panels from cell housings, used ventilation fans and mobilized the wet air system to pull hazardous smoke away from workers.”

Such lessons learned from Portsmouth allowed Paducah to hit the ground running. Although Paducah crews had previously disabled the wet air system, they took a page from Portsmouth’s lessons by streamlining the panel removal process and adding more ventilation fans to improve airflow.

“By sharing knowledge between the two sites, we addressed a number of challenges before work began and continue to share best practices while each site maintains progress,” Paducah Deactivation Manager Donnie Harris said. “For example, with the help of a lesson learned from Portsmouth, we developed a dust collection system that captures smoke from the plasma cutting process and reduces the amount of dust and other particles generated during cutting of the converter shells.”

A best practice shared between the sites was the shift from omnidirectional carts that radiate in all directions equally to floor-mounted roller stands for better ergonomics and worker safety, allowing two workers to efficiently cut the converter shell simultaneously. Team members integrated the lesson learned from this efficiency into the design and construction of the segmentation area at the Paducah Site when work began in the C-333 Process Building.

Another improvement involved upgrading the crusher for bundles, which are internal parts of the converters that are recycled. The upgrades allowed workers to crush the bundles four times faster. Drawing from a lesson learned from Portsmouth, Paducah has since modified its equipment to address wear and tear during bundle crushing.

“It’s all about maximizing opportunities to deliver more at a good value for American taxpayers,” Paducah’s Ladd said. “Anytime we can be more efficient and learn from teams who have successfully completed this type of work before, it benefits everyone.”

PPPO conducts cleanup activities at the Portsmouth Site in accordance with a consent decree with the state of Ohio and the director’s final findings and orders with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. At Paducah, cleanup is being conducted in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act(link is external).

The trucks are defined under the regulation as non-gasoline combustion vehicles weighing more than 14,000 pounds.
The regulations were part of California’s State Implementation Plan that the EPA reviewed to ensure it was abiding by federal air quality standards.
“The Trump EPA will never back down from holding California accountable and stopping them from imposing unnecessary regulations on the entire nation,” added Zeldin.
The total estimated cost of the full California trucking regulations is unclear.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is slamming the brakes on what officials have called a costly trucking emissions standard that California was seeking to apply to tens of thousands of vehicles traveling into the state — effectively nationalizing the green energy policies of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration.

The US Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday its final disapproval of the Golden State’s Heavy-Duty Inspection and Maintenance Regulation being applied to more than 50,000 trucks coming from outside the state or outside the US, according to state data.

“If California had its way, prices would skyrocket for truckers and businesses across America,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “Affordable trucks are vital for keeping food and goods moving and prices low for families.”

The disapproval notice will still allow the Newsom administration to enforce the regulation for heavy-duty trucks registered in California. The trucks are defined under the regulation as non-gasoline combustion vehicles weighing more than 14,000 pounds.

In 2019, the Democratic governor signed a law that eventually directed the California Air Resources Board to pilot a program slashing the heavy-duty truck emissions.

That resulted in the regulations as well as the board voting for the state to become “the first place in the world to mandate zero-emission trucks by 2045,” Newsom celebrated in an X post in 2020.

Newsom has also blamed the trucks for spewing out “nearly a third of harmful air pollutants” and called for “bold action” against the vehicles.

“CA will once again lead the way –phasing out the use of diesel-powered trucks,” he posted on X in March 2023, highlighting the potential effects of the emissions on California and the climate. “Trucks shouldn’t give our kids asthma. Make wildfires worse. Or melt glaciers.”

But EPA officials said the proposed regulation would have been unlawful, since it sought to interfere with interstate and international trade — in violation of the US Constitution’s Commerce Clause.

As a result, the agency noted the emissions regulations were improperly making use of provisions in the Clean Air Act of 1970, which orders states to assure the EPA that its rules don’t flout federal laws.

The regulations were part of California’s State Implementation Plan that the EPA reviewed to ensure it was abiding by federal air quality standards.

“The Trump EPA will never back down from holding California accountable and stopping them from imposing unnecessary regulations on the entire nation,” added Zeldin. “Americans didn’t vote for California’s policies to be imposed nationwide. They voted for President Trump’s policies that put working families first.”

Zeldin’s announcement, which followed a 30-day public comment period, comes after recent fights involving California and interstate commerce.

In 2023, pork producers sought to challenge a Golden State animal cruelty law that would have mandated more breeding space for pigs — but were rejected by the US Supreme Court.

Five of the justices led by Neil Gorsuch ruled that the law, which passed via a ballot measure in 2018, has not interfered with pork merchants outside California.

The Biden administration had still opposed Proposition 12, as it was called, on constitutional grounds, arguing it had “thrown a giant wrench” into US pork production and would prompt a “wholesale change in how pork is raised and marketed in this country.”

Producers claimed it could cost the pork industry between $290 million and $350 million.

The total estimated cost of the full California trucking regulations is unclear.

Ram and Ford are also planning extended range electric vehicle (EREV) versions of their trucks.

Scout CEO Scott Keogh said Tuesday the EREV version of the Terra and Traveler will likely launch first.

Scout Motors CEO Scott Keogh surprised me when he announced that over 80% of Scout pre-orders are for the ""Harvester"" models, which have gasoline-powered range extenders. It was our first sign that demand for extended-range electric vehicles, or EREVs, is real. To meet it, the company will likely launch the EREV version of the Terra and Traveler first, Keogh said Tuesday. But the purely electric version isn't going anywhere.

""Our intention is to do both,"" Keogh said during an on-stage interview at the BloombergNEF Summit in San Fransisco, referring to pure EVs and EREVs. ""We will most likely lead with the range extender, since that's where the volume is.""

A new electric brand of the Volkswagen Group, Scout plans to start producing the Terra and Traveler at a new plant in South Carolina in 2027. On Tuesday, Keogh also said the company aims to ramp up to 100,000 units per year within three years.

Keogh said EREV technology is a perfect fit for skeptical first-time electric truck buyers, who are generally worried about range and charging. An EREV avoids that by offering a gas-powered backup generator, but notably still provides an all-electric driving experience, with instantaneous torque and acceleration. It's a compelling idea, which is why the Ram 1500 REV and next-generation Ford F-150 Lightning will also be EREVs.

Gallery: Scout Terra Electric Pickup Truck

""I think this is a classic American solution, where the American solution is generally give me everything I want,"" Keogh said. ""So it has zero to 60 and 4.5 seconds. It has 1,000 pound-feet of torque, 150 miles of EV range and 500 miles of total range, which is more than most internal combustion engine [vehicles]. So we feel it's a slick solution for the American consumer in terms of, let's say, the drama in the EV market.""

In theory, it should be. Customers seem interested, it seems unlikely that purely electric trucks will be able to fully replace gas options, at least in the short term. Yet none of the EREV trucks have made it to market yet, and we still don't have the full pricing information for them. If they don't offer considerable savings compared to all-electric options and enough efficiency to justify their price premium, it could be a short-lived love affair.

The good news for Scout, Keogh says, is that the company isn't going to live or die based on EREV acceptance. Because the gas generator in an EREV doesn't have to power the wheels directly, there's not much of a difference between the Harvester models and the pure EVs. The factory and supply chain are flexible, the CEO says, so if Harvester demand tapers off the company can quickly ramp up EV production.

""You don't have to rip up your factory, rip up your supply chains. You can manage the market as it ebbs and flows,"" he said.

Obviously, I'm an accounting geek and a LIHTC geek, so you can imagine how, when I look at a report like this, how many tidbits I end up looking at and analyzing.

Now, as an overview, this report examines income and expense data for nearly 200,000 low-income housing tax credit-financed units. The report itself is a summary of a lot of data. In and of itself, it's 61 pages long. And in this report, we report on rental income, overall operating expenses, a variety of categories of operating expenses, as well as comparing them to historical figures over time. In this case, it's since 2016, so nine year-over-years that we can look at.

And yes, the income and operating expenses report is available for sale on our website. Also, Kelly has written several blog posts about the data and about what's in the report, and I will include links to all of this in today's show notes.

But with all of that said, there's a lot I want to talk about today. So, if you're ready, let's get started. Kelly, this is your fifth time on the podcast and the fourth straight year you've been on to discuss this report. And as I said in the introduction, I always welcome you coming back and discussing the report. So, thank you for joining me.

[00:02:12] Kelly Gorman: Thanks. Happy to be here.

[00:02:14] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Now, before we jump into the report, I do want to give you a chance to tell our audience some of the many services that you and our valuation group provide to Novogradac clients.

[00:02:24] Kelly Gorman: Sure. Yeah. Like you said, I'm a partner in Novogradac Valuation Services. And the bulk of the work that I do consists of appraisals, market studies, rent comparability studies. We also do some other things like debt valuations, housing needs assessments, economic impact analysis, partnership interests. We do underwriting assessments to determine if proposed multifamily developments are feasible without tax exemptions. So, those are kind of the highlights of the work that I do with my team.

[00:02:53] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Great. Thank you for that. Now let's jump into the report. Before I start teasing out a number of items that I want to discuss... And at the outset, I know we're not going to be to cover this report in tremendous detail, but hopefully we'll at least do it justice.

And I do encourage our audience to order the report and review it and share any ideas or any thoughts, observations you have from it. That's one of the beauties of a report like this. The more people that review it, the more interesting observations that surface. But let's start. At a high level, if you could describe for the audience, what we're measuring and some of the top-level takeaways.

Rental Income and Operating Expenses

[00:03:31] Kelly Gorman: Sure. Yeah. So, this report, it has data on almost 200,000 units. To be specific, it's 193,783 units, and it's 1,754 properties. It's the 2025 report and it has figures from 2024. In the report, we measure income and six areas of operating expenses. We look at administration, repairs and maintenance, utilities, payroll, management fee and property insurance.

We compare the data to the prior year, and we also measure compound annual growth rate since 2016, so that there is a long-term view. This year the rental income, the expenses and the NOI all set record highs. The rental income increased 8.7% over 2023. The expenses increased 10.5% over 2023 and the NOI went up 5.9%.

In the report we try and analyze the data different ways. We look at it by tenant type, geography, large regions, small regions, states, as well as metropolitan/non-metropolitan areas, building height, number of units.

The report this year, we’re obviously trying to improve on it where we can. And this year, we have some new, deeper dives on data from properties that have been part of the data set, we call that our same-store data, as well as looking more closely at the two expense categories that have had the most dramatic increases in the recent years, and that's property insurance and repairs and maintenance.

[00:05:11] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Thank you for that overview. And, as you know, whenever I see the report for the first time, I'm always interested in, how much did rental income increase year over year? How much did operating expenses increase year over year? And how much did NOI and operating income increase year over year? And I say that just from the standpoint of sustainability, and as we do modeling and such, what rates should we be assuming.

And as you noted, income increased at 8.7%, which, many would look at and say that is a high percentage annual increase, and we are serving affordable families, so we would prefer the overall rental income increase to be lower than higher. However, it does need to at least keep pace with the growth in operating expenses. Which, unfortunately it didn't, with operating expenses going at a faster rate, 10.5% year over year. Now, clearly rental income's a bigger number than operating expenses. So, even though operating expenses were growing at a faster rate, that operating income did grow on average across the dataset, and it grew at a 5.9% rate.

So, before we talk about some of the implications of that and longer term trends, let's start with the overall rental income increase of 8.7%. I think most of the audience from me with LIHTC knows that rental income is generally based upon limits by HUD, but if you could describe what some of your takeaways are with respect to that 8.7% annual rental income increase and unpack it a bit.

[00:06:49] Kelly Gorman: Sure. Well, we looked at the data and we kind of considered the geography and it looks like the rental income is greater in large metropolitan areas rather than small areas. The properties in the Northeast and the West receive more rental income than properties in the South or the Midwest.

Most states saw rent increases, but some of them did not, based on our data. And the seven states and territories that didn't were Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Virginia, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. And we looked at that a little bit more closely to try and understand why those areas didn't see an increase. But those states have smaller data sets and there are fewer units in the data sets. And there were some changes to the data sets from year to year. So, maybe one year included different properties than the other. And we think because of that, that is kind of what's impacting it. But most areas did see increases.

Another factor for the strong growth that we saw this year, may be that some areas are still recovering a little bit from COVID and maybe some of the limits that they had to impose on their rents, and now they're recovering and they can apply larger increases.

Some of the properties also could have subsidy and contract rents, and those rents may be above the tax credit rents. And so, that may also be part of the reason why the increase of 8.7% might be a little bit higher than what you would expect for a tax credit property.

[00:08:27] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Now, operating expenses rose at 10.5%. And you reference property insurance and repairs and maintenance as two drivers of that. But share a little bit more, in terms of some of your observations on operating expenses. And then I want to focus on a little bit longer measurement period than one year.

[00:08:48] Kelly Gorman: Yeah. The impact... I think that the expense increase has been high, and it's partially due to the impact of inflation. Because inflation impacts expenses right away. The rents can only adjust once a year, but the expenses could be changing every month.

We also look at, in our report, the operating expense ratio and that's the expense as a portion of income. The operating expense ratio has gradually been increasing. It started at 54% of income in 2016, and now it's almost 62%. So, expenses are definitely eating up more of the income than it was when we started looking at this data.

[00:09:31] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Now, I appreciate that. And when you look at the operating expenses at 10.5, you know, rental, we'll talk about that more in a moment. But repairs and maintenance and property insurance were much higher than that. And let's just say they're bringing up the average in ways that we were wishing they weren't bringing up the average. And the fact that operating income is a bigger number, it can rise at a slower pace and net operating income can still rise and was a strong 5.9%.

However, if rental income is growing at a slower rate, then operating expenses then eventually, NOI will stop growing and even start to decline. And that's something that, I always look at this report and I'm always interested in what the compounded annual growth rate is over a longer period of time.

And as you mentioned, our report covers nine changes of income or nine changes of expenses. And when we looked at that compounded annual growth rate, the report shows 5.1% annual increase in income over the last nine years. It shows expenses though going up at a faster rate of 7%, with NOI growing up at 2.7% on an annual basis.

So, it's income growth, expense growth, NOI growth isn't as high as it was in this last year, but still expenses are more than income. You know, which, as we were talking about, preparing for the podcast, if that were to continue over the next, indefinitely at that average, which of course it won't, that, you know, in about 12 years, then the average property with these averages, and only we know for sure is no one property was at the average. Then you would start to see NOI declining after, 12 years, which obviously wouldn't be sustainable.

You also mentioned inflation. And that thing, one of the drivers, and I will link to an article that I know you and I worked on back in 2022, where I actually went through and looked at how in inflationary times, that was obviously because we were going through notable inflation and I was just observing how operating expenses can respond to inflationary pressures much more quickly. And in the article, which I will link to, I go through the various expense categories. Some respond pretty quickly to inflation and others not quite as quickly, like utilities and things of that nature, where you have to go through a regulatory process for these expenses to be adjusted and maybe property taxes and the rest. But I kind of go through each expense category and reflect all that. And I also note that on the income side, since as you mentioned, HUD determines the maximum rent limits. And those get adjusted, more recently, only once a year in April. So, rental increases are somewhat delayed.

[00:12:27] Kelly Gorman: Right. Yeah. We see, it's usually around April 1st that the rent and income limits come out. But the properties generally don't impose the increases right away. Some won't for several months. Or maybe even, they might be a year behind. And it usually takes a few months before we start seeing the rents ticking up after the new rent income limits are released.

[00:12:47] Michael Novogradac, CPA: And I'm going to be interested to see over time, to what extent those inflationary pressures on the rental income catch up on the rental income side, such that we don't have this sort of indefinite expenses going up faster than income, but it sort of dips down, and incomes going up a little bit faster than expenses, for a while to bring things more into balance, which was the original goal of the incentive.

Being mindful, of course, that the idea is to deliver the most affordable rents that a property can afford that are also sustainable, based upon the need for rental income rising at least as fast as operating expenses.

[00:13:26] Kelly Gorman: And as you're mentioning the income this year was at the highest year in our dataset. We think also, with the additional income that the properties are seeing, it allows the properties to make some discretionary repairs. And that also is a factor in some of the higher expenses.

Compound Annual Growth Rate

[00:13:43] Michael Novogradac, CPA: That's a great point about the, particularly with repairs and maintenance, that by having more NOI, there's a number of repairs and maintenance and even additional services that can be provided that technically drive up costs. But there are costs that are a benefit to the resident and some of that can get lost in our aggregation efforts here.

So then, when I do think about these averages then you look at it and you say, ""Well, the data set that we just talked about is basically collecting the data from all the properties that we have in a given year.""

And when we look at that, believe it or not, the 193,000+ units that we have, we don't have all those units for every year. We have a subset of data that have been in the full term. And that subset you mentioned, we think of as same-store properties.

Please share with the audience what the annual and compound annual growth rate is reflected in our data for same-store properties. Or better yet, talk about what, you know, how many units in the rest are in our same-store property database, and then talk about what the results were there.

[00:14:56] Kelly Gorman: Sure. Yeah. So, this year we added a special section in the report on this data set, there are 55,000 properties and... actually, let me double check that. If it's 55,000 properties or 55,000 units...

[00:15:12] Michael Novogradac, CPA: I think it's 55,000 units.

[00:15:13] Kelly Gorman: Yeah. I think you're right. A little... that would be amazing. That would be fantastic. OK. Maybe next year, but 55,000 units. And 503 developments, which is about a quarter of the properties in our full dataset. And these properties have been in our dataset since 2016. So, the data in this set is seeing income and expense increases a little bit lower than what it was in the overall dataset. And we think it could be that these properties might be a little bit older, it might be the locations that they're in are slightly inferior and so they're generating lower rents.

And when we... Just to kind of compare the data, like the trends are similar. The income and the expenses are both growing, but at a more slow rate for the same-store data.

So, for all of the data, we saw income increase, at a compound annual growth rate of 5.1%. Then the expenses went up 7% and the NOI 2.7%. That's for the entire dataset. But then when you look at just the same-store data, the growth has been a little bit slower. The compound annual growth rate for income is 4.2 versus the 5.1. The expense is 5.9 growth versus the 7% for all the data. And then the NOI is 1.6, which is slower than the 2.7 for all of the data. So, similar patterns, but a little bit slower.

[00:16:43] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Right. I just thought of it as a bit more muted. And roughly, you know, 1% less growth in income rate, roughly 1% less increase in expenses and 1% less increase in NOI and compounded annual growth rate.

But I do want to emphasize that in our dataset, net operating income on average did rise. It just wasn't rising in as fast a rate. And so, in the sort of near term, there aren't really sustainability issues.

Now, when we look at this underwriting and this sustainability question... And I did mention earlier that, you know, if this delta between expenses and income continues at roughly 12 years or now, plus or minus, a property starts to have a lower net operating income. How does that affect, in your view, underwriting for LIHTC properties today?

[00:17:39] Kelly Gorman: It makes it very tricky. Yeah. It's difficult to know what sort of escalators you should use in your proforma. And yeah, I wish I had an answer and I could say, ""Oh, use this number.""

[00:17:50] Michael Novogradac, CPA: No, it's definitely a tricky question.

[00:17:53] Kelly Gorman: Yeah.

[00:17:54] Michael Novogradac, CPA: I do think the notion of, which is pretty standard in underwriting, having operating expenses growing at 1% faster than rents is a good sort of test. And in fact, that's been the case roughly speaking over the last nine years according to our data.

I don't expect that would be the trend indefinitely. I definitely expect the trend will reverse, as I mentioned, this inflation pressure sort of working its way through. But it does validate the underwriting from a lender's perspective at a 1% delta between operating expenses, and rental income to give that cushion for such a period of time where that was actually the case. But I don't think from a valuation perspective or a general expectation perspective, that delta would be the same.

[00:18:43] Kelly Gorman: Right. I agree.

Rising Insurance Premiums

[00:18:45] Michael Novogradac, CPA: And we will see how well this ages over time.

Let's turn now to operating expenses and the two big ones. Property insurance as well as repairs and maintenance. And as we have now noted many times in the course of this, podcast, the average rate of growth of expenses in the database as a whole was 7%, and it was 10.5 year over year. And what struck me was most of the categories, the year over year increases were roughly 5%, plus or minus, with the exception of two, if I'm remembering correctly.

[00:19:23] Kelly Gorman: Yeah.

[00:19:23] Michael Novogradac, CPA: That's insurance, which came in at a whopping 14.1% as well as repairs and maintenance up 9%. And obviously the insurance at 14.1% definitely brought up the average in terms of the expenses as a whole. Repairs and maintenance at 9%, I look at that and say, to the extent some of that is being able to do work that maybe wasn't necessarily, wasn't expected, but something that could benefit tenants, that's a kind of a net feature in some of the repairs and maintenance can be a function of available cash flow.

But I get ahead of myself. On the insurance side of 14.1%. Please unpack that a bit. It's something we've been talking about for many years now, and it's unfortunately not a new trend. It's something properties have been experiencing for quite a while.

[00:20:12] Kelly Gorman: Yeah. Yeah, you're talking about both insurance and repair and maintenance, and they're both taking up a larger piece of the pie. If you were to look at expenses as a pie, all the different expense categories. Repair and maintenance went from being 22% of all of the expenses when we started looking at this data in 2016, to 26%.

And then insurance used to be the smallest category. And actually it was the smallest category, and when we would do market studies and appraisals with an expense analysis, it seemed like it was the easiest one to underwrite. There's often a plug that we would use of like $400, way back when. And now it's, I think, the hardest one to underwrite because it's just so variable, geographically, and it's increased so much. You know, we really rely on the clients and ask the clients to get quotes for insurance.

And yeah, insurance. It went from 6.6% of all the expenses to 11%. It was the smallest category, and now it's the second smallest category. You know, as I mentioned, I think it does vary a lot based on the property type and the location. The reasons for the increase, the rates of increase are based on projections for weather events.

And also, the premiums are tied to the insurable value of the property. So properties that are more expensive to build, maybe a high-rise property might have a higher insurable value than a garden-style property. You know, it has elevators and just more expensive systems. When you look at the weather events, the data on weather events and how that has changed over time. The National Center for Environmental Information reported that there were 33 weather events in the '80s, 57 in the '90s, 67 in the 2000s. In 2010, there was a bigger jump with 131 billion-disaster events in the United States in a decade, and that was followed by 115 more in the first half of the 2020s.

We're not looking at 2025 data yet. But according to NOAA, I thought it was interesting, disasters were down in 2025. But we'll see if that has a more favorable impact next year. We did have the wildfires in California that started off the 2025 year.

[00:22:28] Michael Novogradac, CPA: So, what are you hearing as you walk properties and you're doing an appraisal, you're working with your various clients? Discuss some of the ways you're dealing with rising property insurance. Because even the 14%, the real cost is probably higher than that.

[00:22:43] Kelly Gorman: Yeah. Yeah, there's definitely an insurance crisis in some parts of the country. And I think that's contributing to the affordability crisis in the country. There are providers that are pulling out of high-risk markets.

And this was... Again, I mentioned California. This was all over the news last year, with the California wildfires. That people are having difficulty finding insurance. Owners are having to absorb higher deductibles and getting less coverage for it. Property owners are definitely looking at this category closely, shopping around, when we do our appraisals and our market studies we're constantly getting changes to the insurance amount, because they're shopping around and getting new quotes.

They're also, I think the property owners are also taking different measures to try and get coverage at the best rates. And that would include things like surveillance technology, apps that can measure water usage and maybe clue them in, if there might be a leaky pipe that could turn into a flooding event. Doing more preventative maintenance. And I think it's also impacting what they're choosing to construct and making the properties more resilient to disasters.

And, you know, I mentioned the variability in what the insurance costs are. The three states that have lower median property insurance costs are Utah, Iowa and Arizona. And those are less than about $500. The state with the highest cost was Guam, and that average was $1,793. And then, the states that generally have the highest cost, with median costs of at least $1,000, are near the Gulf Coast, as you would guess. Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas. And then the Northeast, I think primarily because those states are probably higher cost to build, and that's Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

[00:24:34] Michael Novogradac, CPA: So, we can do a whole podcast on property insurance.

[00:24:37] Kelly Gorman: I know, and maybe I'm too wordy.

Repairs and Maintenance

[00:24:38] Michael Novogradac, CPA: You should come back and we talk more about that. But let's turn to the one other expense category that was year-over-year substantial percentage-wise, above the average. And that, of course, is repairs and maintenance.

Please describe kind of your sense of why repairs and maintenance are growing at that rate. And maybe share a little bit about historically, how the repairs and maintenance costs have been increasing the last few years.

[00:25:07] Kelly Gorman: Yeah. A few years ago, we thought the expense, for repair and maintenance has gone up a lot because of COVID. It went down that one year because they weren't able to do repairs. It wasn't safe for workers to get into the units. So, they deferred a lot of the repairs. I would've thought it would've normalized. But it didn't. It's still been a category that's seen very high increases. It has four straight years of double-digit percentage increases.

This year, it was a 13.8% increase over 2023. And when we look at the compound annual growth rate for that category, it's 9%. We've seen repair and maintenance increases that are significant for pretty much every type of property.

I think it's tied to the record income and the ability to make some discretionary improvements or repairs. Also tied to increases in construction costs and materials. You know, we mentioned your article on inflation and certain categories are seeing the impact of inflation more than others, and this is definitely one of them.

And then, like I just mentioned with insurance, I wonder, is repair and maintenance going up because properties are doing more preventative maintenance to try and limit the insurance increases?

[00:26:23] Michael Novogradac, CPA: No, that certainly makes sense and I'm sure there's some of that. Just a question of teasing all that out.

[00:26:28] Kelly Gorman: Yeah.

[00:26:29] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Maybe one other area of expenses worth touching upon is utilities. Describe for the audience what our data reveals about increases in utility costs.

[00:26:42] Kelly Gorman: Yeah. So, it increased, but the rate of increase was lower than the overall expense increase. Overall expenses went up 10.5%, as we mentioned. Utilities went up 9.6% and that's the highest of the years in the dataset, and it compares to a compound annual growth rate of 5.6%.

Remember, for newer properties, the utility increase or the utility amount is generally lower. Because the trend that we're seeing is that they separate the utility billing, and the properties often include less utilities in the rent than they used to. But properties also have been implementing more energy-efficiency measures, including solar components, and that's allowed them to control the utility increase a bit.

One potential issue that could come up is the sunsetting of some of the Inflation Reduction Act provisions that give tax credits for renewable energy. Those have been shown to lower the energy costs and that's beneficial to both the tax credit tenants and what they're paying and also to the property owners. So, with that changing, it's possible we'll see higher utilities.

Conclusion and Off-Mike Section

[00:27:53] Michael Novogradac, CPA: No, those are all good points and I do wonder how much of the utility increases are just delayed, having to go through the rate base and those sorts. Kind of inflation-related and how that might change over time. But as you pointed out, with the pare-back in renewable energy incentives at the federal level, it can only have but one impact on utility prices when you, reduce the supply, or at least don't increase the supply as much as you otherwise would, utility prices are going to be adversely affected.

Before we wrap up the podcast, and I could keep talking about the report and there's so much more in the report and so many other interesting trends to be thinking about. And I know a lot of clients end up using this report as a way of benchmarking, trying to look at what their properties are doing relative to what is aggregated in a report to help them in the whole underwriting process and budgeting process. But what else would you want to share with the audience before we bring this to a close?

[00:28:55] Kelly Gorman: Yeah. For our clients, as we've highlighted in the podcast, I just suggest that they look very closely at insurance and repair and maintenance. You know, what are they doing at the properties? Shop around, get the best quotes they can for insurance. Make sure that they have good oversight and a skilled team making the repairs at the properties to help control those costs where they can. Implement whatever measures are possible.

Again, you know, the reports available. I encourage our listeners, our viewers, to go to our fancy new website.

[00:29:26] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Yes, you can. Our fancy new website. Yeah.

[00:29:29] Kelly Gorman: Front and center, there's information on this report. You can buy it in different forms. Hard copy, digital through our NovocoKnows app. I'm interested if people have questions or feedback. I'd love to hear it. And on our fancy new website, you can get to my VCard with my contact information. So, I'd love to hear from people. And I hope it's a useful tool for folks.

[00:29:53] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Excellent. I echo all of that. And we will add a note of the items that we mentioned in the course of the podcast in today's show notes. Please stay around for the Off-Mike section, which I'll get to in just a moment.

But before that, I'd like to say to the audience, as I do say every week, if you're enjoying watching and or listening to the podcast, please subscribe and tell your business associates about it. Please also take a moment to like the podcast. I appreciate that very much. And please, help us develop future shows by emailing any programming ideas you have to CPAs@Novoco.com.

So, now we'll turn to our Off-Mike section, Kelly. And as our regular listeners know, and viewers, we'd like to use this space to give a shout out to others who are working the tax credit and tax incentive communities. And it's an opportunity to highlight a professional worthy of recognition. And sometimes we focus internally and most of the time we focus externally. So, Kelly, who would you like to shout out?

[00:30:57] Kelly Gorman: So, I would like to shout out to Brad Stanhope and to Rob Valdez who were instrumental in the making of this report. I appreciate all of their efforts.

And then also, as I mentioned, our fancy new website. All of the folks that worked on that, I know that the marketing team and What's Next Innovation spent a lot of time trying to perfect the website, improve the user experience. I love the news section that's on it, front and center, and you can see what's new with Novogradac. We can inform our clients and our colleagues of what's important in the industries that we work in. I think it, it just looks really cool. I'm really impressed with it, so I wanted to give a shout out to those guys.

[00:31:37] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Well, let me echo that shout out, as well. It was a great way to kick off the year, a week plus ago or a week ago, exactly. Or two weeks ago.

[00:31:45] Kelly Gorman: Two weeks ago when this airs, right?

[00:31:47] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Yes, exactly. Two weeks ago, when the airs. A week ago when we're recording.

There's the news pages, which I really like, because I can go to the news page, say in our affordable housing news and see all the more recent information on our website. And you would think that wouldn't be something that I would need, given that I'm the managing partner of Novogradac. But there's always so many updates. It was hard to keep track of all the different updates that were going on. So, now we have the website that essentially is affordable housing breaking news. And we have similarly, for our other shared practice areas. So, that's now my homepage.

[00:32:20] Kelly Gorman: Yeah. And I think it's very user friendly. I love the new setup. It looks really cool. More modern.

[00:32:26] Michael Novogradac, CPA: I like looking at the New York Times in the morning. I like looking at the Wall Street Journal in the morning, all digitally of course. I like looking at the daily tax report. And now I have this here as my homepage to be checking every morning to see what's new, either within Novogradac or outside of Novogradac.

So, thank you for recognizing Brad and Rob on the report, as well as the marketing group and What's Next Innovation on the website.

[00:32:54] Kelly Gorman: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for having me.

SINGAPORE, Jan 27 (Reuters) - India and China cut emissions from electricity generation by accelerating clean energy deployment, researchers say, offsetting growing coal use in the U.S. and capping global growth in pollutants linked to climate change.

Power sector emissions by China and India, the world's top coal users who accounted for 93% of the rise in carbon dioxide discharges in the decade through 2024, declined simultaneously for the first time in 52 years, according to a report by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) this month.

""The fall in emissions in China and India in 2025 is a sign of things to come, as both countries added a record amount of new clean-power generation last year, which was more than sufficient to meet rising demand,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at CREA, an independent research group registered in Finland.

CHINA, INDIA POWER EMISSIONS FALL

China's power sector emissions fell by 40 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), or 0.7% annually in 2025, while discharges by Indian utilities declined 38 million tCO2e, or 4.1%, in the 11 months to the end of November, according to estimates from energy think-tank Ember compiled based on monthly government statistics.

That offset a 55.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) rise in annual U.S. emissions after an annual 13.1% increase in coal-fired power output drove U.S. power plant emissions 3.3% higher in 2025, the fastest this century, the estimates showed, helping global emissions stay largely flat.

Power plant emissions rose 3.4% in China and 4.4% in India annually on average over the 10 years to 2024, but fell 2.4% in the U.S. The three countries account for 60% of the world's power sector emissions, which make up about 35% of all polluting discharges linked to climate change.

COAL OUTLOOK

China's coal use is set to decline gradually this decade, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its annual coal report in December, helping emissions from power generation plateau in the coming years.

In India, however, while record renewables additions and marginal growth in power demand helped New Delhi suppress coal use this year, the IEA expects the country to continue depending on coal.

""Although coal-fired power generation declines in 2025, a moderate increase in coal consumption for power generation is nevertheless expected ... due to a steady rise in electricity demand,"" the IEA said.

In the U.S., the agency expects higher costs to reduce coal demand by 6% in the years until 2030 despite policy incentives by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and a slowdown in coal plant closures.

States nationwide face similar dilemmas around data centers’ energy use.
The We Energies case is high stakes because two data centers proposed in the utility’s southeast Wisconsin territory promise to double its total demand.
The second option, called ​“capacity only,” would have data centers paying 75% of the cost of building the generation.
Conway said much of this new construction will be paid for by data centers as their bespoke resources.","How much should data centers pay for the massive amounts of new power infrastructure they require? Wisconsin’s largest utility, We Energies, has offered its answer to that question in what is the first major proposal before state regulators on the issue.

Under the proposal, currently open for public comment, data centers would pay most or all of the price to construct new power plants or renewables needed to serve them, and the utility says the benefits that other customers receive would outweigh any costs they shoulder for building and running this new generation.

But environmental and consumer advocates fear the utility’s plan will actually saddle customers with payments for generation, including polluting natural gas plants, that wouldn’t otherwise be needed.

States nationwide face similar dilemmas around data centers’ energy use. But who pays for the new power plants and transmission is an especially controversial question in Wisconsin and other ​“vertically integrated” energy markets, where utilities charge their customers for the investments they make in such infrastructure — with a profit, called ​“rate of return,” baked in. In states with competitive energy markets, like Illinois, by contrast, utilities buy power on the open market and don’t make a rate of return on building generation.

Although seven big data-center projects are underway in Wisconsin, the state has no laws governing how the computing facilities get their power. Lawmakers in the Republican-controlled state Legislature are debating two bills this session. The Assembly passed the GOP-backed proposal on Jan. 20, which, even if it makes it through the Senate, is unlikely to get Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ signature. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a spokesperson for Evers said on Jan. 14 that ​“the one thing environmentalists, labor, utilities, and data center companies can all agree on right now is how bad Republican lawmakers’ data center bill is.” Until a measure is passed, individual decisions by the state Public Service Commission will determine how utilities supply energy to data centers.

The We Energies case is high stakes because two data centers proposed in the utility’s southeast Wisconsin territory promise to double its total demand. One of those facilities is a Microsoft complex that the tech giant says will be ​“the world’s most powerful AI datacenter.”

The utility’s proposal could also be precedent-setting as other Wisconsin utilities plan for data centers, said Bryan Rogers, environmental justice director for the Milwaukee community organization Walnut Way Conservation Corp.

“As goes We Energies,” Rogers said, ​“so goes the rest of the state.”

Building new power

We Energies’ proposal — first filed last spring — would let data centers choose between two options for paying for new generation infrastructure to ensure the utility has enough capacity to meet grid operator requirements that the added electricity demand doesn’t interfere with reliability.

In both cases, the utility will acquire that capacity through ​“bespoke resources” built specifically for the data center. The computing facilities technically would not get their energy directly from these power plants or renewables but rather from We Energies at market prices.

Under the first option, called ​“full benefits,” data centers would pay the full price of constructing, maintaining, and operating the new generation, and would cover the profit guaranteed to We Energies. The data centers would also get revenue from the sale of the electricity on the market as well as from renewable energy credits for solar and wind arrays; renewable energy credits are basically certificates that can be sold to other entities looking to meet sustainability goals.

The second option, called ​“capacity only,” would have data centers paying 75% of the cost of building the generation. Other customers would pick up the tab for the remaining 25% of the construction and pay for fuel and other costs. In this case, both data centers and other customers would pay for the profit guaranteed to We Energies as part of the project, though the data centers would pay a different — and possibly lower — rate than other customers.

Developers of both data centers being built in We Energies’ territory support the utility’s proposal, saying in testimony that it will help them get online faster and sufficiently protect other customers from unfair costs.

Consumer and environmental advocacy groups, however, are pushing back on the capacity-only option, arguing that it is unfair to make regular customers pay a quarter of the price for building new generation that might not have been necessary without data centers in the picture.

“Nobody asked for this,” said Rogers of Walnut Way. The Sierra Club told regulators to scrap the capacity-only option. The advocacy group Clean Wisconsin similarly opposes that option, as noted in testimony to regulators.

But We Energies says everyone will benefit from building more power sources.

“These capacity-only plants will serve all of our customers, especially on the hottest and coldest days of the year,” We Energies spokesperson Brendan Conway wrote in an email. ​“We expect that customers will receive benefits from these plants that exceed the costs that are proposed to be allocated to them.”

We Energies has offered no proof of this promise, according to testimony filed by the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group, which represents factories and other large operations. The trade association’s energy adviser, Jeffry Pollock, told regulators that the utility’s own modeling of the capacity-only approach showed scenarios in which the costs borne by customers outweigh the benefits to them.

Clean energy is another sticking point. Clean Wisconsin and the Environmental Law and Policy Center want the utility’s plan to more explicitly encourage data centers to meet capacity requirements in part through their own on-site renewables, and to participate in demand-response programs. Customers enrolled in such programs agree to dial down energy use during moments of peak demand, reducing the need for as many new power plants.

“It’s really important to make sure that this tariff contemplates as much clean energy and avoids using as much energy as possible, so we can avoid that incremental fossil fuel build-out that would otherwise potentially be needed to meet this demand,” said Clean Wisconsin staff attorney Brett Korte.

And advocates want the utility to include smaller data centers in its proposal, which in its current form would apply only to data centers requiring 500 megawatts of power or more.

We Energies’ response to stakeholder testimony is due on Jan. 28, and the utility and regulators will also consider public comments that are being submitted. After that, the regulatory commission may hold hearings, and advocates can file additional briefs. Eventually, the utility will reach an agreement with commissioners on how to charge data centers.

Risky business

Looming large over this debate is the mounting concern that the artificial-intelligence boom is a bubble. If that bubble pops, it could mean far less power demand from data centers than utilities currently expect.

In November, We Energies announced plans to build almost 3 gigawatts of natural gas plants, renewables, and battery storage. Conway said much of this new construction will be paid for by data centers as their bespoke resources.

But some worry that utility customers could be left paying too much for these investments if data centers don’t materialize or don’t use as much energy as predicted. Wisconsin consumers are already on the hook for almost $1 billion for ​“stranded assets,” mostly expensive coal plants that closed earlier than originally planned, as Wisconsin Watch recently tabulated.

“The reason we bring up the worst-case scenario is it’s not just theoretical,” said Tom Content, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin, the state’s primary consumer advocacy organization. ​“There’s been so many headlines about the AI bubble. Will business plans change? Will new AI chips require data centers to use a lot less energy?”

We Energies’ proposal has data centers paying promised costs even if they go out of business or otherwise prematurely curtail their demand. But developers do not have to put up collateral for this purpose if they have a positive credit rating. That means if such data center companies went bankrupt or otherwise couldn’t meet their financial obligations, utility customers may end up paying the bill.

Steven Kihm, the Citizens Utility Board’s regulatory strategist and chief economist, gave examples of companies that had stellar credit until they didn’t, in testimony to regulators. The company that made BlackBerry handheld devices saw its stock skyrocket in the mid-2000s, only to lose most of its value with the rise of smartphones, he noted. Energy company Enron, meanwhile, had a top credit rating until a month before its 2001 collapse, Kihm warned. He advised regulators that data center developers should have to put up adequate collateral regardless of their credit rating.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Microsoft-Wisconsin_aerial_1-1900x1268_2026-01-27-041704_ecwl.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=e46f9f07821aceca319e68cc79821d76,N,,2026-01-27 19:00:17.071283

The company has launched NeoVolta Power, LLC—a joint venture anchored by a new facility in Pendergrass, Georgia—with plans to supply commercial and utility-scale energy storage systems to one of the fastest-growing clean energy markets in the world.

At launch, the plant is expected to support 2 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of annual production capacity, with a built-in roadmap to scale up to 8 GWh. Initial operations will focus on assembling prismatic-cell battery packs and integrating direct current (DC) containers, with mass production targeted for mid-2026. The plant’s location along the I-85 corridor places NeoVolta closer to major storage deployments, infrastructure projects, and the policy incentives driving U.S. grid modernization.

This move signals a broader strategic transition for NeoVolta: aligning its operations with the long-term economics of energy storage manufacturing. Market analysts project the U.S. battery energy storage market could reach $45 billion annually by 2030, driven by rising demand across utility, commercial, and industrial applications. By focusing on these larger system segments, NeoVolta is aiming to carve out a competitive edge where scale and speed are key differentiators.

JV Structure Offers Speed, Flexibility, and Execution Support

NeoVolta Power, LLC is structured to balance execution risk and manufacturing discipline. NeoVolta maintains a 60% controlling interest, overseeing product roadmap, commercialization, and customer strategy, while the JV’s financials are consolidated under U.S. GAAP. PotisEdge, holding a 20% stake, brings in technical expertise and on-the-ground experience in ramping battery system production, equipment deployment, and factory operations. The remaining 20% is held by strategic investors contributing specialized operational input.

PotisEdge’s backing by LONGi Green Energy—a major global solar manufacturer—adds additional manufacturing credibility as the battery sector continues to converge with solar and grid infrastructure solutions. That global linkage is intended to reinforce NeoVolta’s domestic presence with international best practices in scaling production.

Financing for the JV is being phased in step with key project milestones. Near-term capital comes in part from NeoVolta’s $13 million private placement in late 2025, complemented by equity, debt, and financial support from Infinite Grid Capital. Future phases may include incentive monetization and project-level debt aimed at supporting scale-up without over-leveraging the parent company.

As operations come online, the Georgia plant is designed to adapt to evolving market needs. While utility-scale output will lead early production, the flexible system configuration also allows for an eventual increase in commercial and industrial (C&I) volumes as demand patterns shift. NeoVolta's ability to localize manufacturing and retain control of the product pipeline could prove pivotal as policy, supply chain volatility, and grid resilience continue to reshape the U.S. energy storage market.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20260122-114810-386-vardan-papikyan-r8e0PHAfXvg-unsplash.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 22:00:22.919592

On January 26, 2026, ADNOC—operating through its newly branded international investment arm, XRG—exercised options to acquire an additional 7.6% equity interest in Phase 2 (Trains 4 and 5) of the massive export facility. This acquisition represents a major milestone in ADNOC’s aggressive ""XRG"" strategy to become a top-five global player in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market by the end of the decade.

The increased stake builds upon ADNOC’s initial entry into the U.S. market in 2024 and signals a long-term commitment to the American energy sector. For the project developer, NextDecade Corporation (Nasdaq: NEXT), the injection of capital from the Emirati giant provides critical financial stability as the project navigates a high-interest-rate environment and rising development costs. Beyond the immediate corporate synergies, the deal has profound geopolitical implications, as the UAE positions itself to leverage U.S. Henry Hub-indexed gas to supply hungry markets in Asia and Europe, effectively diversifying its portfolio away from regional Middle Eastern pricing.

A Timeline of Expansion and Strategic Execution

The path to this week’s stake increase began in May 2024, when ADNOC first announced an 11.7% indirect interest in Phase 1 (Trains 1–3) of Rio Grande LNG. At that time, the deal was heralded as the UAE’s first major foray into the U.S. LNG landscape. Over the subsequent 20 months, the partnership has rapidly accelerated. In September 2025, ADNOC officially closed its Phase 1 acquisition just as NextDecade reached a Final Investment Decision (FID) on Train 4. By October 2025, FID was reached on Train 5, triggering the option window that ADNOC exercised this week to bolster its presence in the Phase 2 expansion.

The additional 7.6% stake was purchased from an acquisition vehicle owned by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which is now a subsidiary of BlackRock (NYSE: BLK). While the exact dollar figure for this specific tranche remains undisclosed, the scale of the commitment is immense; the total development cost for Phase 2 is estimated to exceed $13 billion. This capital is essential for a project of this magnitude, which aims to utilize integrated carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to produce what NextDecade markets as ""lower-carbon"" LNG.

Market reaction to the announcement has been one of cautious optimism. Shares of NextDecade Corporation (Nasdaq: NEXT) saw a modest bump following the news, as the equity injection mitigates some of the liquidity concerns surrounding the company’s heavy debt load, which has grown by billions during the construction phase. Analysts note that having a sovereign-backed partner like ADNOC provides a ""safety net"" that few other independent LNG developers can claim, particularly as the facility targets its first commercial operations for Phase 1 in 2027.

Winners, Losers, and the Shifting Corporate Landscape

The primary winner in this transaction is NextDecade Corporation (Nasdaq: NEXT), which has successfully tethered its fortunes to two of the world’s most powerful energy entities: ADNOC and TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE). TotalEnergies already holds a 10% direct stake in Train 4 and a significant 17.1% ownership stake in NextDecade itself. The presence of these ""supermajor"" partners ensures that the Rio Grande project remains a priority in the global energy transition, despite potential regulatory hurdles in the U.S.

On the other side of the ledger, established U.S. midstream players may feel the pressure of increased competition. While companies like Cheniere Energy (NYSE: LNG) remain the dominant force in American exports, the entry of sovereign wealth-backed entities into the Gulf Coast infrastructure market introduces a level of capital intensity that is difficult for domestic firms to match. However, the deal is also a win for BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), as its GIP subsidiary continues to successfully monetize its early-stage infrastructure bets while maintaining a management role in one of the world's most critical energy hubs.

Strategic partners like GIC (Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund) and Mubadala, another Abu Dhabi-based investment vehicle, also stand to benefit from the increased certainty of the Phase 2 rollout. These entities have shared the risk of the multi-billion-dollar project, and ADNOC’s increased ""skin in the game"" suggests a high degree of confidence that the global demand for LNG—particularly from the U.S.—will remain robust through the 2030s.

The Geopolitical ""Third Wave"" of LNG

The ADNOC-Rio Grande deal is a textbook example of the ""third wave"" of global LNG supply, characterized by massive scale, international ownership, and a focus on carbon intensity. Geopolitically, this investment cements the UAE's role as a bridge between Western energy production and Eastern energy consumption. By securing equity in U.S. projects, the UAE can offer its Asian customers a more diverse supply chain, hedging against the volatility of the Strait of Hormuz and the geopolitical tensions often associated with Middle Eastern supply routes.

This move also reflects a broader trend of national oil companies (NOCs) evolving into international energy firms. ADNOC’s XRG division is mirroring the strategies of European majors like Shell (NYSE: SHEL) or BP (NYSE: BP), focusing on global arbitrage and integrated value chains. Furthermore, the emphasis on carbon capture within the Rio Grande project allows the UAE to align its investments with global climate goals, making its gas exports more palatable to European buyers who are increasingly scrutinized under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).

Historically, such significant foreign ownership of critical U.S. energy infrastructure has faced regulatory scrutiny. However, the UAE’s status as a key strategic ally has largely smoothed the path for these investments. The Rio Grande project serves as a physical manifestation of the U.S.-UAE PACE (Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy) initiative, demonstrating that even traditional hydrocarbon projects are now being framed through the lens of technological innovation and carbon management.

Looking Ahead: Phase 3 and the 2027 Horizon

As 2026 progresses, the focus for ADNOC and NextDecade will shift from financing to execution. The short-term goal is to keep Phase 1 on track for its 2027 start-up date. Any delays in construction in Brownsville would be costly, given the billions in offtake agreements already signed with global utilities. In the medium term, the industry is closely watching the pre-filing process for ""Train 6"" or Phase 3. If NextDecade successfully expands into this third phase, the total capacity of the facility could reach a staggering 48 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), rivaling some of the largest facilities in Qatar.

The strategic pivot for ADNOC will involve integrating this U.S. supply into its global trading operations. Market participants should expect ADNOC to become a more aggressive trader of Henry Hub-priced LNG, potentially competing directly with U.S.-based trading houses. For investors, the challenge will be monitoring the regulatory environment in the U.S., particularly as domestic debates over gas export pauses and environmental impacts continue to create a backdrop of uncertainty for new approvals.

Summary and Investor Outlook

ADNOC’s decision to increase its stake in the Rio Grande LNG project is more than a simple corporate acquisition; it is a calculated geopolitical move that bridges the gap between American production and global demand. By doubling down on the Texas coast, the UAE has secured a vital outlet for U.S. gas, while providing NextDecade with the financial muscle to see its vision through to completion.

For the market, this event highlights the continuing attractiveness of the U.S. LNG sector as a destination for global capital. Investors should keep a close eye on NextDecade’s (Nasdaq: NEXT) debt-to-equity ratios and the progress of its carbon capture integration, as these will be the ultimate barometers of the project's long-term profitability. As we move toward the first production dates in 2027, the Rio Grande project stands as a testament to the evolving nature of global energy security—one where borders are blurred by equity stakes and the flow of gas is dictated as much by geopolitical strategy as it is by market demand.

A Louisiana facility that would export liquefied natural gas needs more time to finish construction and begin operations, its owner says.

New York-based Glenfarne Energy is asking U.S. regulators for a five-year extension on an April deadline to complete the facility in Calcasieu Parish. In a Jan. 15 filing at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Glenfarne and project partner Kinder Morgan cited “unprecedented delays” at the Department of Energy and regulatory uncertainty during the Biden administration as the primary reasons for the delay.

Originally approved in 2016, the Magnolia LNG export plant would be built on a 115-acre site along the Industrial Canal near Lake Charles. An initial five-year extension was granted in October 2020 due to delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Glenfarne said in the filing.

Construction has not started, and the newest extension sought by the companies would allow operations to begin as late as April 2031.

Magnolia LNG currently lacks the required authorization to export to non-Free Trade Agreement countries. The previous authorization expired in November 2023 after a request for an extension was withdrawn due to a more stringent Department of Energy policy, Glenfarne said in the filing. A new application filed in late 2023 remains pending.

Glenfarne is also actively developing LNG export facilities in Texas and Alaska. The company will make a final investment decision in early 2026 on Texas LNG, an export plant that would be built at the Port of Brownsville with annual productive capacity of about 4 million tons of liquefied gas per year.

The company expects to make a final investment decision in 2026 on an LNG export plant in Alaska with 20 million tons of capacity. Alaska LNG was designated under the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, or FAST-41, to receive expedited federal regulatory reviews and was fully approved in 2025. Glenfarne is now lining up long-term customers and arranging project financing.

Federal regulators have granted requests for extensions to other developers of LNG plants.

BALTIMORE, MD – In a multistate lawsuit joined by Attorney General Anthony G. Brown, a federal judge issued a final ruling that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) unlawfully withheld about $1 billion in funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program from 20 states and the District of Columbia.

“Expanding access to charging stations gives Marylanders the confidence to drive the electric vehicles essential to meeting our climate goals,” said Attorney General Brown. “Our lawsuit preserved this critical funding that helps protect our environment for our children and grandchildren.”

In the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Congress appropriated $5 billion for the NEVI Formula Program to facilitate nationwide deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and improve charging reliability for the public. States developed and were carrying out plans to build that network when President Trump, on day one of his administration, issued an executive order directing federal agencies to immediately stop releasing NEVI funds. Following that directive, DOT abruptly halted the NEVI program. A coalition of states, including Maryland, sued in May and, in June, won a preliminary injunction from U.S. District Court Judge Tana Lin that reinstated funding, including $34.5 million of NEVI funds awarded to Maryland. Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, Climate Solutions, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, CleanAIRE NC, West End Revitalization Association, and Plug In America also joined as plaintiff-intervenors.

Now, in her summary judgment order, Judge Lin said DOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) acted outside the law and their actions were arbitrary and capricious. She barred DOT and FHWA from suspending or revoking the plaintiff states’ approved electric vehicle infrastructure plans in the future and from withholding their NEVI Formula Program funds for any reason not expressly authorized by Congress in the IIJA.

“Such capriciousness runs counter to the Administrative Procedure Act; it is simply not how things are lawfully done,” Judge Lin wrote in her order.

In addition to Attorney General Brown, the coalition includes the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania joined the case.",https://oag.maryland.gov:443/Style%20Library/MD.SharePoint.ToolKit/img/logo.png,N,,2026-01-27 16:00:01.060107

Production losses eased on Monday, with Permian shut-ins estimated at about 700,000 bpd and production set to be fully restored by January 30.
Associated wellhead natural gas production was estimated to be down by 0.24 to 0.33 billion cubic feet per day.
Cenovus Energy's 172,000 bpd Lima, Ohio, refinery experienced mechanical issues brought about by the storm on Sunday.
Meanwhile, peak natural gas production losses are estimated to hit around 20 bcfd owing to the storm, according to Rystad Energy.","U.S. oil producers lost up to 2 million barrels per day, or up to 15%, of the country's production over the weekend, analysts and traders estimated, as a winter storm swept across the country, straining energy infrastructure and power grids.

Oil production outages peaked on Saturday at 2 million bpd, consultancy Energy Aspects estimated, with the Permian Basin likely to have experienced the largest share of that decline at around 1.5 million bpd. Production losses eased on Monday, with Permian shut-ins estimated at about 700,000 bpd and production set to be fully restored by January 30.

U.S. oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips' Permian crude production was down by 175,000 bpd as of Sunday owing to frigid weather, according to a source familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak on the record.

ConocoPhillips typically does not comment on day-to-day operations, a company spokesperson said.

Chevron reported hatches were frozen open during the storm on Sunday in Midland, Texas, according to a regulatory filing. Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, ExxonMobil was experiencing multiple shut downs in gas compressors across different fields owing to low ambient temperatures, affecting oil production because the gas compression is used to lift the oil, said a source familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak on the record.

""We closely monitor severe weather conditions and proactively implement necessary safety and operational measures to safeguard our people, maintain infrastructure integrity, and ensure continuity of essential operations,"" an ExxonMobil spokesperson said.

Companies also face third-party takeaway challenges due to hazardous road conditions, specifically regarding water hauling and technician dispatch for repairs, the Texas Oil and Gas Association said in a note.

Occidental and Targa Resources were among the two dozen reports of upsets at natural gas processing plants and compressor stations in Texas, according to regulatory filings over the weekend, but that paled in comparison to the more than 200 reported upsets during the first five days of a severe winter storm in 2021, TACenergy analysts said in a note on Monday.

Occidental and Targa Resources did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Output in North Dakota, the third-largest oil-producing state, was estimated to be down by around 80,000 to 110,000 bpd as of Monday morning, said Justin Kringstad, director of North Dakota Pipeline Authority. Associated wellhead natural gas production was estimated to be down by 0.24 to 0.33 billion cubic feet per day.

U.S. crude futures settled at $60.63 a barrel, down 44 cents.

Average gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states dropped to 106.9 bcfd so far in January, down from a monthly record high of 109.7 bcfd in December, according to LSEG, as producers shut in production.

On the refining side, several refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast reported issues related to the freezing weather over the weekend, including ExxonMobil which shut units at its Baytown, Texas, petrochemical complex on the east side of Houston.

Cenovus Energy's 172,000 bpd Lima, Ohio, refinery experienced mechanical issues brought about by the storm on Sunday. A full restart may be delayed until later this week due to extreme cold, industry monitor IIR said.

Meanwhile, peak natural gas production losses are estimated to hit around 20 bcfd owing to the storm, according to Rystad Energy.

Front-month gas futures closed at their highest since December 2022 on Monday, rising nearly 30% on the day to settle at $6.80 per million British thermal units.

POWER SECTOR UNDER STRAIN

Some 810,000 customers across the U.S. remained without power on Monday following the Arctic blast over the weekend that brought heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from the Ohio Valley and mid-South to New England. Cold temperatures are expected to persist for parts of the country in coming days.

The weekend snow and ice storm knocked out power to more than a million homes and businesses along the U.S. Gulf Coast and Southeast, including in Texas.

The largest U.S. power grid, PJM, anticipated generation outages for Monday would rise to 22.4 GW, or about 16% of total committed capacity. Most of those outages are expected in Dominion Energy's Mid-Atlantic territory, according to PJM data.

Demand on PJM was 124 GW on Monday morning, above the forecast of 123.3 GW, but it continues to meet demand, PJM operations data show.

Spot wholesale electricity prices were around $200 per MWh, recovering from temporary spikes over the weekend that topped $3,000 per MWh.

Next-day prices in New England soared about 82% to $313 per megawatt hour, while PJM West prices in Pennsylvania and Maryland soared about 360% to around $413, their highest since January 2014.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/OIL-PERMIAN_1.JPG,N,,2026-01-28 04:58:23.346774

Q4 2025 also set a record as the highest quarter for canceled clean tech investments nationwide since tracking began.
“Appalachia has the workforce, the infrastructure and the potential to lead America’s clean energy manufacturing future,” Polson said.","New data from the Rhodium Group and MIT/CEEPR’s Clean Investment Monitor shows that clean technology manufacturing investment in Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia has hit its lowest point in nearly three years.

Established clean tech manufacturing investment in the region fell to $1.35 billion in Q4 2025 – a 21% decline from the peak of $1.69 billion just two quarters earlier. This represents the lowest quarterly investment since Q2 2023.

“These numbers tell a clear story of missed economic opportunity for Appalachia,” said Diana Polson, senior policy analyst at Keystone Research Center. “Just as our region was poised to become a hub for next-generation manufacturing, federal policy changes are pulling the rug out from under workers and communities that have been waiting decades for this kind of investment.”

The decline is driven primarily by collapsing battery manufacturing investment, which dropped from $1.2 billion in Q2 2025 to $910 million in Q4 2025. Zero-emission vehicle manufacturing also declined from a peak of $483 million in Q3 2025 to $422 million by year’s end.

Four manufacturing projects totaling nearly $2 billion were canceled in the region in 2024 and 2025: Enervenue battery project in Kentucky (Q4 2024, $285 million), Ascend Elements SK Ecoplant battery project in Kentucky (May 2025, $66 million), Foxconn zero-emission vehicle project in Ohio (August 2025, $26 million) and Ford zero-emission vehicle project in Ohio (December 2025, $1.57 billion).

“Each canceled project represents hundreds or thousands of good-paying jobs that won’t materialize in communities that desperately need them,” Polson said. “The Trump administration’s elimination of the $7,500 EV tax credit and accelerated phase-out of renewable energy incentives through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has created a cascading effect throughout the manufacturing supply chain.”

The regional trend mirrors national data showing that private construction spending in manufacturing declined 11% between August 2024 and October 2025. Q4 2025 also set a record as the highest quarter for canceled clean tech investments nationwide since tracking began.

“Appalachia has the workforce, the infrastructure and the potential to lead America’s clean energy manufacturing future,” Polson said. “But that future requires stable, predictable policy support — not the boom-and-bust cycle we’re seeing now. Our elected leaders need to recognize that abandoning these investments means abandoning the economic revitalization our region has been promised for far too long.”",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stock-solar-storage-forefront-california-easterly.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 16:59:05.426334

“Volkswagen’s decision to remain in Oakland County protects over 900 good-paying jobs for Michiganders and their families who will continue to call our state home,” said Governor Whitmer. “Michigan put the world on wheels, and since I took office, we’ve worked hard to grow our economy and secure more than 36,000 auto jobs. I’m grateful that Volkswagen continues to see the benefit of Michigan’s strong auto supply chains and talented workers, and I look forward to their continued success here in our state.”

“Relationships, legacy, and the opportunity for innovation matter. I remain grateful to the MSF Board for their support of Michigan’s prosperity today and for generations to come, as evidenced by their approval of Volkswagen and Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) programs and services related to small businesses and furthering Michigan’s growing entrepreneurial ecosystem,” said Quentin L. Messer, Jr., CEO of the MEDC and MSF Board Chair. “Alongside Governor Whitmer and our partners in the state legislature, we remain as committed as ever to weathering storms and guiding fellow Michiganders of all backgrounds, career experiences, and aspirations to programs and ecosystem partners that will help them ‘Make it’ bigger and more boldly in Michigan.”

Volkswagen Group of America Set to Invest in Oakland County

OVERVIEW: The MSF Board approved a $4 million Michigan Business Development Program (MBDP) grant for Volkswagen to retain more than 900 jobs and invest at least $13 million in Oakland County.

As part of this investment, the company will consolidate all technical activities – including quality, engineering, warranty parts return center, and technical service center to serve as a technical campus shared across all functions and brands that are part of Volkswagen Group of America. Volkswagen will also maintain a presence in Auburn Hills at a newer facility, optimizing space and technological needs for the company.

The company’s agreement to retain jobs will be for seven years, and the investment must be made within the first five years of the term.

WHY IT MATTERS: Volkswagen Group of America has maintained a strong presence in Auburn Hills for decades. As part of efforts to optimize costs, streamline resources, and modernize facilities, the company evaluated options across its U.S. footprint. Ultimately, Michigan stood out thanks to its access to top talent and the ability to retain that talent.

“Michigan has long been an important home for Volkswagen Group of America. We’re thrilled to be able to continue our presence in the state, reinforcing our commitment to our people and advancing our technical capabilities in the state,” said Kjell Gruner, President and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America. “We appreciate the collaboration with Gov. Whitmer and the MEDC and look forward to continuing our work together to support Michigan’s leadership in mobility and engineering.”

By making this decision, Michigan secures R&D, testing, and finance jobs that pay well above the regional median wage and ensure the continued presence of a global OEM in Michigan.

In addition to MSF support, the Detroit Regional Partnership has offered in-kind services from its marketing team and talent solutions team to support Volkswagen, and Oakland County will provide talent services to assist Volkswagen with connecting to, and retaining, top talent.

WHAT THEY’RE SAYING: “Volkswagen’s decision to stay and expand its facilities in Auburn Hills is a major win for the region,” said Oakland County Executive David Coulter. “Their commitment to the community strengthens our local economy and reinforces that Auburn Hills is a premier location for automotive innovation and growth.”

“We are thrilled that Volkswagen has chosen to maintain such a strong presence in Auburn Hills. Their investment is a strong vote of confidence in our region’s workforce and the leadership position we hold in Michigan in the automotive and mobility industries,”said Auburn Hills Mayor Eugene Hawkins. “We look forward to seeing their success benefit the Auburn Hills community, the greater Detroit area, and the State of Michigan for years to come.”

MSF Board Approves Continued Support for Small Businesses, Innovation

OVERVIEW: The MSF Board also approved $2.7 million to fund the continuity of the Michigan Central Innovation District and its enhancement by integrating TechTown Detroit as the small business partner in the City of Detroit (Wayne County). Funding will be divided between Michigan Central Innovation District, LLC ($2.125 million) and Wayne State University Research and Technology Park in the City of Detroit, doing business as TechTown Detroit ($575,000).

In February 2022, the MSF Board approved a $7.5 million grant to Michigan Central Innovation District LLC to launch programmatic support to lay the foundation for what has become a national model for innovation, entrepreneurship, and public-private partnerships.

“Today’s action by the MSF Board to continue supporting Michigan’s small business and entrepreneurship ecosystems is a significant sign of the success of our initial investment and the opportunities it has afforded countless businesses, entrepreneurs, and innovators eager to call Michigan home,” said Amy Rencher, Senior Vice President of Small Business and Talent at the MEDC. “By strengthening the partnership across three proven entities in Michigan Central, Wayne State University, and TechTown Detroit, we are supporting local, organic talent and ideas in ways that will have a lasting impact. Before something becomes a household name, it starts with the dreams, visions, and support to see it come alive that come with this kind of investment.”

WHY IT MATTERS: The investment will generate high-quality jobs and catalyze a unique neighborhood-to-regional innovation pipeline ensuring small-to-medium businesses receive expert technical assistance, including manufacturing and automation support services, ensuring lasting viability for those businesses and the region.

Of the prior MSF allocation, more than half of the $7.5 million investment flowed directly to startups and supported innovation infrastructure like the development of the Advanced Aerial Innovation Region. At the end of 2025, these combined programs contributed to Michigan Central’s activity and growth, including:

Access to $1 Billion of funding across 30+ venture capital firms

$650 million in economic output in the form of new internships, jobs, and produces and services in market

Support for 2,000+ entrepreneurs with public-private network resources

Technical assistance and incubation services to 240 companies, including:

20 manufacturing-focused companies developing AI-powered quality control systems, collaborative robotics, manufacturing platforms, and autonomous mobility solutions;

35 clean tech-focused companies developing home electrification, energy systems, urban EV charging, and battery safety technologies; and

15 aerial mobility companies developing testing infrastructure, regulatory partnerships and supporting workforce development.

TechTown also had a solid 2025, including:

Serving an estimated 1,200 entrepreneurs, 77% of whom are minority-owned

Hosting roughly 4,400 events

Welcoming 932 members from 49 different industries

Generating $30 million in startup and growth capital

Still, gaps remain, limiting the pace of commercialization and scaling for early capital access, first-customer procurement pathways, structured commercialization support, and startup back-office services (such as legal, accounting, and HR services). As such, Michigan Central, Wayne State, and TechTown Detroit established a partnership in 2024, and today’s approval by the MSF helps the three entities to better collaborate and produce stronger outcomes faster.

WHAT THEY’RE SAYING: “This funding is a major win for our small businesses' competitive edge. TechTown, the City of Detroit, and Michigan Central will work together to remove the barriers that keep neighborhood small businesses from growing,” said Ned Staebler, CEO of TechTown and Vice President of Economic Development at Wayne State University. “The MSF’s commitment enables us to deploy the critical back-office services, expert coaching and resources, and technical support required to equip Detroit's small businesses with the tools to stay, scale, and lead Michigan’s economy.”

“Michigan startups shouldn’t stall because they can’t access early capital, first customers, or the support needed to scale. MSF’s investment closes those gaps so more small businesses can commercialize faster and grow in Michigan,” said Mark de la Vergne, Director of Network Growth for Michigan Central. “The outcome will be more high-wage jobs statewide.”

“The Golden Dome program was a foolhardy idea to start with, and Congress should work to rein in the administration before it does more damage.”","WASHINGTON — A year ago today, President Donald Trump issued a sweeping Executive Order calling for an “Iron Dome for America” to defend “against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries.” While such a system, quickly rechristened as “Golden Dome,” may sound appealing and prudent for safeguarding the United States, it is and will remain technically unrealistic in practice, profoundly destabilizing and wildly expensive.

Congress has already provided $24.4 billion for this golden bauble, setting off a race among defense companies looking for a share of the prize. Most notably, this includes $5.6 billion for space-based interceptors to counter nuclear-armed missiles, another concept that sounds exciting but is deeply problematic and would be by far the most expensive part of the plan.

“Trump’s Golden Dome space-based interceptor shield is nothing but fool’s gold—shiny, but ultimately worthless—and taxpayers would be left footing the bill to defense contractors,” said Dr. Laura Grego, senior research director in the Global Security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). “Congress needs to do everything in its power to zero-out funding for the program and limit the long-term damage that President Trump can do with it to U.S. security. There are many better ways to spend this much money and effort.”

President Trump has yet to provide the public with basic information about his plans for Golden Dome, legitimate cost estimates, a cogent timeline, or justification for why Greenland is “essential” for the program. In fact, many of these claims have no basis in reality, while threatening to invade an ally the United States is treaty-bound to defend has already served to undermine U.S. security through the alienation of its friends and allies.

“The United States could spend trillions of dollars over a decade or more trying to field a space-based interceptor system that would not work reliably, yet may well prompt a lose-lose arms race, where U.S. adversaries take lower cost steps to improve their capabilities to get through or evade the proposed system,"" said Dr. Grego. “The Golden Dome program was a foolhardy idea to start with, and Congress should work to rein in the administration before it does more damage.”",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2026-01-27 16:00:04.464937

The Series A round was led by venture capital firm Decisive Point and included new investors Chevron Technology Ventures and StepStone Group, with existing backers Andreessen Horowitz, according to a statement.

The Tennessee-based company, founded one year ago, began fabricating Triso fuel this month at its facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee using high-assay low-enriched uranium (Haleu), a more potent form of uranium that will be used for many advanced reactors. Triso – or “tristructural-isotropic” – is an advanced, highly robust nuclear fuel designed to withstand extreme temperatures without melting.

Standard Nuclear said it plans to use the funding to start production at additional facilities, without giving further details.

The company is one of a few makers of Triso, demand for which is expected to grow as more companies begin deploying advanced nuclear power reactor to meet surging demand for electricity.

Dozens of companies, both in the US and around the world, are developing advanced nuclear designs, but there has been concern about whether there would be enough fuel available as they start testing and building systems.

Russia has been the world’s primary commercial supplier of Haleu, with state-owned Tenex dominating the market. The US is developing domestic capacity through companies like Centrus and General Matter.

Standard Nuclear can make about 500 kg of Triso a year at its Tennessee site. It is developing a second facility there and another one at Idaho National Laboratory, which are both expected to go into service by mid-2026. Each will be able to deliver about one metric tonne annually.

Kurt Terrani, chief executive officer of Standard Nuclear, said: “With this funding, we are positioned to accelerate our roadmap, scale operations, and deliver on the promise to fuel the next generation of reactors powering industry, defense, and space.”

Standard Nuclear said earlier this month that it had received a critical shipment of Haleu feedstock at its facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

American Resources (AREC) has attracted fresh attention after its Electrified Materials subsidiary began receiving and processing initial 2026 shipments of end-of-life lithium-ion batteries at its Noblesville, Indiana facility.

This move expands the company’s recycling-to-refining footprint for critical battery materials, tying the stock more directly to themes around domestic supply chains, mineral independence, and the practical side of clean energy infrastructure.

The stock has been volatile around the recent battery recycling update, with a 38.81% 1 month share price return and a 36.76% year to date share price return. The 1 year total shareholder return is very large, suggesting momentum is still firmly in play despite a 14.87% 1 day share price pullback and the recent Nasdaq compliance notice around its delayed annual meeting.

If this kind of move has your attention, it could be a good moment to broaden your watchlist by checking out as a source of other fast moving opportunities.

With shares at US$3.72 and an average analyst target of US$6.00, plus an intrinsic value estimate that implies a very large discount, you have to ask: is American Resources still mispriced, or is the market already baking in future growth?

DCF says American Resources is deeply discounted, what is the model seeing?

Our DCF model points to a fair value of $69.52 for American Resources, compared with the last close of $3.72, which implies a very large discount based on forecast cash flows.

The SWS DCF model estimates the value of a business by projecting future cash flows and then discounting them back to today using a required rate of return. It does not look at short term price swings; it focuses on what the company could generate over time and what those future dollars might be worth in present terms.

For American Resources, that approach lines up with its profile as a small, currently unprofitable company with forecast revenue growth of 57.4% per year and expectations that it could become profitable within three years. In sectors tied to electrification and critical materials, models like this tend to place a lot of weight on long run growth in cash generation rather than current earnings, which helps explain why the output can sit so far above the current share price.

Result: DCF Fair value of $69.52 (UNDERVALUED)

However, there are clear tension points, including continued losses with net income at a loss of US$20.77m, as well as reliance on optimistic cash flow forecasts to justify such a large discount.

On appeal, the Seventh Circuit certified to the Illinois Supreme Court the question of what relevance a permit authorizing a certain level of emissions plays in assessing the application of a pollution exclusion.
The Illinois Supreme Court rejected the insureds’ argument and found that the pollution exclusion did apply, notwithstanding the permit.
The Court found that the plain language of the pollution exclusion “says nothing about permitted or authorized pollution.” (Emphasis in original.)
The decision, however, does not address other responses policyholders may have to pollution exclusion defenses, including those where the release may fall within the sudden and accidental exception to the exclusion.","On January 23, 2026, the Illinois Supreme Court issued its long-awaited decision in Griffith Foods International, Inc. v. National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PA, 2026 IL 131710, which significantly impacts companies operating under environmental permits in Illinois. The court held that “a permit or regulation authorizing emissions (generally or at any particular levels) has no relevance in assessing the application of a pollution exclusion within a standard-form commercial general liability policy.”

Summary of the Decision

The coverage case arose from underlying mass tort litigation against Griffith Foods and its successor, Sterigenics, in which residents of Willowbrook, Illinois alleged that ethylene oxide (EtO) emissions from the companies’ medical-equipment sterilization facility over more than 35 years caused cancer and other serious diseases. Citing the standard pollution exclusion, National Union refused to defend the insureds under their commercial general liability policies.

The federal district court in the Northern District of Illinois ruled in favor of the insureds, finding that the pollution exclusion did not apply because the EtO emissions were authorized under an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency permit. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit certified to the Illinois Supreme Court the question of what relevance a permit authorizing a certain level of emissions plays in assessing the application of a pollution exclusion.

The Illinois Supreme Court rejected the insureds’ argument and found that the pollution exclusion did apply, notwithstanding the permit. The Court found that the plain language of the pollution exclusion “says nothing about permitted or authorized pollution.” (Emphasis in original.) The Court reiterated that courts “must not inject terms and conditions different from those agreed upon by the parties.” The Court explained that the IEPA permit did not change the character of EtO emissions as pollution, emphasizing that “if the EtO emissions were not pollution, there would have been no need for the policyholders to obtain a permit from IEPA in the first place.” In so ruling, the Court overruled two Illinois appellate decisions, Erie Insurance Exchange v. Imperial Marble Corp., 957 N.E.2d 1214 (2011) and Country Mutual Insurance Co. v. Bible Pork, Inc., 2015 IL App (5th) 140211, which declined to apply pollution exclusions to claims involving alleged “pollution” resulting from permitted business operations.

Key Takeaways

Consequences for Illinois Companies with Long-Tail Insurance Claims: Illinois companies facing long-tail environmental liabilities may no longer be able to overcome insurer pollution exclusion defenses simply because their business operations were in compliance with regulatory permits. Depending on the specific policy wording and underlying facts, the ruling likely forecloses CGL coverage for “pollution” liabilities arising out of permitted operations. The Court’s holding means that insurers may deny coverage under broad pollution exclusions in standard CGL policies subject to Illinois law even when the policyholder’s operations were authorized under applicable operating permits or regulations. The ruling leaves policyholders potentially exposed to substantial uninsured defense costs and damages even where such businesses were not acting as “polluters” in the ordinary sense. The decision, however, does not address other responses policyholders may have to pollution exclusion defenses, including those where the release may fall within the sudden and accidental exception to the exclusion.

Alternative Coverage Options: Affected companies should evaluate whether specialized pollution or environmental liability coverage is available for their operations. The Illinois Supreme Court acknowledged that “insurance companies have developed entirely separate pollution liability policies for purchase, which allow the insurers to assess the risk of costly environmental litigation” and that “these separate policies generally provide the policyholders with coverage for environmental lawsuits.” Although such policies were not widely available to Griffith Foods at the time of the alleged EtO emissions, companies at risk of liability for environmental emissions should consult with experienced insurance brokers and coverage counsel to review existing policies and explore available options.

National Ramifications: Illinois appears to be the first state to directly address the relevance of permits and authorized emissions to the application of standard CGL pollution exclusions. Insurers are likely to seize upon the Griffith Foods decision and seek to extend its holding to other jurisdictions. Notably, the insurer in Griffith Foods received amici support from Zurich American Insurance Company, Swiss Re, and major insurance trade associations, demonstrating the industry’s coordinated interest in limiting pollution coverage under CGL policies.",https://www.honigman.com/assets/images-t1769540100/32970.jpeg,N,,2026-01-27 16:59:41.854466

“Energy policy is about more than megawatts and transmission corridors — it is about whether Maryland families can afford to live in their homes,” Moore said.
To promote local energy generation, the legislation establishes the Solar and Energy Storage Gap Financing Program.
The investment will spur local clean energy production.
“The Moore-Miller Administration is committed to moving as quickly as possible to a more affordable, reliable, clean energy system,” said Kelly Speakes Backman, director of the Maryland Energy Administration.","Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced the Lower Bills and Local Power Act (LBLPA) as part of the Moore-Miller administration’s 2026 legislative agenda. The legislation introduces measures to secure financing for local clean energy projects, modernize the electric grid and provide additional direct energy bill rebates to Maryland families.

“Energy policy is about more than megawatts and transmission corridors — it is about whether Maryland families can afford to live in their homes,” Moore said. “That’s why our administration is stepping up to deliver real relief, focusing on driving down the cost of utility bills for Marylanders, and investing in local projects that make energy more reliable and affordable.”

LBLPA allocates nearly $200 million from the state’s Strategic Energy Investment Fund — which reinvests Alternative Compliance Payments from utilities — to address rising energy costs impacting Maryland families.

Approximately $100 million will be directed to Maryland families for utility bill rebates. The rebates scheduled to start this fall are in addition to the $200 million in direct electricity bill rebates delivered by Moore and the Maryland General Assembly through the Next Generation Energy Act.

To promote local energy generation, the legislation establishes the Solar and Energy Storage Gap Financing Program. The program will invest $70 million to fund clean energy projects. The investment will spur local clean energy production.

“The Moore-Miller Administration is committed to moving as quickly as possible to a more affordable, reliable, clean energy system,” said Kelly Speakes Backman, director of the Maryland Energy Administration. “Gov. Moore’s legislation introduced today, his budget and the executive order issued in December all aim at addressing rising energy costs for working families, making sure the lights stay on, and moving us on a path to clean energy.”

To modernize Maryland’s transmission infrastructure, LBLPA makes utility companies responsible for prioritizing advanced transmission and grid-enhancing technologies when expanding grid capacity. Utilities trying to build new transmission lines must submit plans to implement these technologies without increasing ratepayer costs before receiving approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission.

LBLPA allocates $10 million for the Maryland Department of Transportation to identify opportunities for high-voltage transmission lines and battery storage projects along state and interstate highways. By using existing state-owned highway right-of-way, Maryland can bypass complex land acquisition and permitting processes.

“The Maryland Department of Transportation is a proud partner and supporter of the Moore-Miller Administration’s efforts to modernize the state’s energy grid and lower energy costs,” said Katie Thomson, acting secretary of the Maryland Department of Transportation. “With Gov. Moore’s Lower Bills and Local Power Act, I look forward to the continued collaboration with our state energy partners, doing what the Department does best—finding practical solutions that keep Maryland moving toward a more affordable, sustainable future.”

In addition to signing the Building an Affordable and Reliable Energy Future executive order and delivering $200 million in energy rebates, the governor invested more than $130 million into clean energy and modernization programs in 2025 alone, including funding for county government energy modernization and the Decarbonizing Public Schools Program.

Kristin Hayes: Hello and welcome to Resources Radio, a weekly podcast from Resources for the Future (RFF). I’m your host, Kristin Hayes. The idea for today’s episode started at an RFF board meeting, as we were talking about changes in energy-related tax incentives that have come about over the past year. Jim Connaughton, a member of RFF’s board, flagged what he considers to be an overlooked tax policy that can help incentivize multiple types of energy development, and that’s the refined and expanded Qualified Opportunity Zone, or QOZ, program. As Jim shared where he sees more about the underappreciated benefits, at least in his mind, of the QOZ program, it struck me that this would make a great subject for a conversation here on Resources Radio. Joining me today to discuss the QOZ program are Andy Rankin and Dave McGimpsey, both partners in the Indianapolis office of Dentons, a global law firm.

Andy is the author of a brief report entitled “The Qualified Opportunity Zone Program and Clean Energy: A New Era for Natural Gas, Solar, Wind, Energy Storage and Nuclear Projects,” and Dave co-leads the Dentons US-region energy practice. The three of us will talk about how and where they see the QOZ program playing a role in supporting energy development in the United States, how it compares to previous investment and production tax credits, and more, so stay with us.

Hi, Andy and Dave. Welcome to the show. It is really great to talk with you.

Dave McGimpsey: Well, thanks so much, Kristin. It’s great to be here, and thanks so much for the invitation.

Kristin Hayes: Yeah, of course.

Andy Rankin: Thank you, and thanks to Resources for the Future. We’re happy to be here.

Kristin Hayes: That is great. Well, again, it’s a pleasure to speak with both of you. I know you have some complementary expertise. Let me start by asking you, in turn, to just say a little bit about who you are and maybe your area of professional focus. Andy, let me start with you.

Andy Rankin: Great. Again, my name is Andy Rankin. I’ve been practicing law for 25 years, first with a large law firm, as I’m with now, but not with Dentons, and then I did about 15 years in-house. The most noteworthy of that was the last five years were in-house for a large construction equipment lessor where I conceived of, implemented, and operated their Opportunity Zone program. That’s carried over to my time with Dentons. I’ve been here for about three years.

Kristin Hayes: Great. Dave, what about you?

Dave McGimpsey: I’m an energy, water, and utility lawyer. I’ve been practicing in that sphere for about 27 years, and really, that practice has three legs of the stool. The first leg is clean energy development—so a lot of wind, solar, battery energy storage, combined-cycle gas, turbine, that type of thing. The second leg of the stool is regulated and unregulated water and wastewater utilities, doing rates, service-territory disputes, project certifications, things of that nature. The third leg of the stool is just a catch-all category with things like electric vehicle charging policy before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, representing public utility holding companies and acquisitions of other public utility holding companies at a state level. That’s the thumbnail on how my practice is.

Kristin Hayes: Amazing, okay. Very complementary expertise for this particular topic. I just want to ask too, out of curiosity, are you both Indiana natives?

Dave McGimpsey: No, I am a native of Seattle, Washington. I moved to the Midwest when I was about 11 years old.

Kristin Hayes: Okay, all right. Andy, what about you?

Andy Rankin: I’m a geographic mutt. I have been all over, but I do consider Indiana home. I went to school here—undergrad and then law school. But yeah, I consider the Indianapolis area my first home.

Kristin Hayes: Awesome. Well, I am also from the Midwest, as is our producer, Elizabeth (or at least very close ties to the Midwest). Great representation for the Midwest today. Love it.

Dave, let me start with you. I wanted to ask you to start by refreshing our collective memory on how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, actually changed tax credits that were designed to support the expansion of wind and solar in the United States. Can you just talk us through some of those changes?

Dave McGimpsey: The OB3 (that’s what I’ll call it rather than the OBBBA) sunsetted the investment tax credits and the production tax credits for wind and solar earlier than they were initially scheduled to sunset. What that has caused is a lot of upheaval in the wind and solar areas, because what was once a regulatory certainty is now … there is a certain end to it, and it’s coming sooner than anticipated.

Kristin Hayes: Okay. Andy, the OB3—I like that, definitely going to use it—also made changes to, as I referred to earlier, something called the Qualified Opportunity Zones program, which obviously you’re very familiar with. Can you tell us just a little bit more about the QOZ program, what it is, and maybe, particularly, how OB3 changed it from its original 2017 version?

Andy Rankin: Sure. As you mentioned, this came about during the first Trump administration’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was in 2017. Now, these were implemented by that law, but the rulemaking took time and then the designation of the zones took time, so really, this came into effect in early 2019, but it was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2026, so there was an end date.

Now, to fully take advantage of this law, you have a five-year holding period, so 2026 minus five years becomes 2021. It means the law became less applicable, less exciting, less beneficial starting in 2021/2022. We’re now multiple years past that, and with each year, it became less relevant. What OB3 did is it made it a permanent part of the tax code. This now exists in the tax code forever, so there’s no expiration and there’s no sunset.

The five-year period lasts forever. There are important five-year, 10-year, and 30-year holding periods, and now those are measured from now until they expire. In the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act version, which a lot of us like to call Opportunity Zone 1.0, you had these fixed dates. Now it’s five years from your act, 10 years from your act, 30 years from your act, and it doesn’t matter when that act … There’s no expiration date.

There are two huge benefits to this, and they just roll on forever or until repeal. That’s a big one. And it changed a couple of other things, which are important. One, it created the Rural Opportunity Zones. The original zones still exist. The rural zones are new. Unfortunately, from a legal and accounting perspective, it made the legal and accounting requirements just a little bit tougher, and they weren’t exceptionally easy to begin with.

So, call your lawyer and call your accountant if you want to take advantage of this. That’s the bad news.

The good news is, to put it simply, the benefits of this law are awesome. The threshold is you have to have capital gains and you have to have realized them in the last 180 days when you plan to do this, but 180 days is a long time, and then you do have a long time to spend those dollars, but you have to be legally compliant to do so, so have capital gain. Going into the future, you can look at this Opportunity Zone program to take a huge benefit, and I’d be happy to go into the benefits now, if that would be useful, or I can save that for later.

Kristin Hayes: Yeah. Well, let me ask you, too: When I hear “zones,” I think of geography. I definitely think, “These are place based. These are things that exist in a specific place in the United States.” What defines a zone, either under the original version or, ideally, under this version that we have now? How do you even know if you’re a QOZ to begin with?

Andy Rankin: Well, here’s the good news. You type in “HUD Opportunity Zones” in Google or your favorite browser. (Some government websites are really hard to use.) This will bring up a map, and it’s a map that shows the map of the United States. Some areas are in white, some areas are yellow. Yellow areas are the zones. It has an address search bar. If you type in the address, it’ll drop a pin. If it’s in yellow—your project, your anticipated project, your current project—it’s in a zone. If it’s in white, it’s not. It’s really easy to use.

Kristin Hayes: Yeah. What are the criteria that define those zones? What makes something a QOZ?

Andy Rankin: Yeah, they’re census tracts and they are, essentially, lower-income, challenged areas.

For example, I’m in Indianapolis. The entirety of downtown Indianapolis is an Opportunity Zone, but it’s beneficial for commercial development, so that’s the good news. College campuses, a little bit lower income, are frequently in Opportunity Zones. Downtowns, college campuses, industrial areas, and commercial areas, are often lower income from a residential point of view, but are more desirable from a development and commercial point of view.

It’s been great for commercial developers, and what we think, from an energy perspective, is that these rural zones may be … The reason I say “may be” is because they are not yet designated, but they will be designated in 2026. Some of the existing zones from 2018 and 2019 have already been flipped over from original zones to rural zones, but more will be designated in 2026, and they could be highly beneficial to the energy industry.

Kristin Hayes: Fascinating, okay. I definitely want to come back to that, because I know there are some unique characteristics of these rural Opportunity Zones, too. But before that, I do want to go back to Dave.

Dave, I want to reflect on something you hinted at right at the beginning. After OB3’s passage, I think it’s fair to say that most commentary seemed to reinforce this idea that OB3 was … I’m actually going to quote here for a second: It was “very ugly for wind and solar.” That was the headline from a fellow law firm. But the brief that we’re talking about here—the research that you guys have done and put together—my sense is that it seems to be arguing for a more nuanced take. Again, I’m going to quote, in this case, from the particular writing that you guys did, where you noted that all parties involved in clean energy projects should consider whether the Opportunity Zone program may replace or augment existing, but expiring, tax credits.

That, to me, is quite a different story from, “very ugly for wind and solar.” Dave, I just wanted to ask you to respond … Any response to my reasoning there, and just any thoughts in general about the top-line reasoning behind that takeaway in your brief?

Dave McGimpsey: Well, sure. When you hear that the production tax credit and the investment tax credit for wind and solar are sunsetting earlier than anticipated, you’re losing certainty, so I think that’s where the “very ugly for wind and solar” comes from. A well-established program to offer financing for clean energy development is being sunsetted, so I get that sentiment.

What I think, though, is that the Opportunity Zones, with all the benefits that Andy has identified—especially with the rural focus, because that’s where a lot of these wind and solar facilities are located, in rural areas—this is a huge area that can help provide another source of capital for these clean energy projects.

Kristin Hayes: It sounds like we went from very targeted tax credits that were designed specifically for wind and solar, at least historically. I think the Inflation Reduction Act made them actually a little bit broader than that. But for a long time, we had production tax credits, investment tax credits just for wind and solar.

Again, if I’m interpreting correctly, maybe Andy, I’ll just turn this back to you. The Opportunity Zone program is a much more broad-based tax credit designed to spur investment overall. It doesn’t specify what investment, but in that sense, it’s actually quite flexible. Particularly, as you pointed out, these qualified rural opportunity funds may actually provide some opportunities (no pun intended) to clean energy development, which, as Dave just noted, often happens in rural communities. Do I have that right? There’s still quite a bit of flexibility here?

Andy Rankin: That’s correct, and you’re right that the Opportunity Zone tax credits are more broad-based. They’re not as targeted to energy and clean energy projects as the tax credits which are being sunsetted. What we are saying is: The other law firm’s headline says, “It’s very ugly for wind and solar.” Losing those tax credits is bad news. There’s no two ways about it, but the point of our article is maybe there’s a silver lining—maybe there is something new.

In a period which we are in right now, when you could perhaps take advantage of both, look to do so, and when these targeted tax credits go away, look for something else. This Opportunity Zone program is that something else. And you’re right; I don’t know. It could be worse; that seems very possible. But for particular projects in particular zones, it could be better. Take a look: this is going away, but think about what’s new.

Kristin Hayes: Interesting, okay. Andy, let me stay with you for just a second, because I think we’re going to get into some leasing terminology that I know so little about, so I’m going to ask you to talk us through some terms here.

Specifically looking at clean energy projects, I do know that they often involve leasing land rather than owning it outright. For example, a wind installer might actually lease the land from a farm owner, as opposed to buying the land from that person, I think. Can you just talk us through how these leasehold interests work under the new Opportunity Zone rules, and maybe just why it matters for solar, wind, and renewables in general?

Andy Rankin: Yeah. Having been around from the start, when the law was first passed in 2017, it seemed, just from the language of the statute, that maybe this was only going to apply to people who owned land, and that was a concern for businesses that leased property or had other real property or ownership interest in this.

Well, when the initial rules came out in 2018, along with guidance from the Treasury and the IRS, that’s what it did.

I’ll back up and give the overarching sentiment of the legislation and the rulemaking. It doesn’t want to reward somebody who buys a piece of property and then leases it out and then slaps their hands together and says, “I’m out. Go operate your business. I’m going to take the tax credit.” The good thing about this law is that it wants to focus the benefit on the people who are operating the business and making it go every day, be it a manufacturing business, be it a distribution business, or be it an energy business. If you are the tenant under a lease, but you’re on the ground in this zone and it’s your project that’s operating, the law says you get the benefit. That’s what’s great.

Kristin Hayes: Okay, all right. Great. Yeah, that’s really helpful to know.

Dave, I wanted to ask you about something else that comes up in the article, which is about nuclear energy. I’ve been asking you guys to reflect on wind and solar in particular, but certainly, lots of types of energy are available in this country and lots of new investment is happening in them. One that you call out in particular is nuclear and small modular reactors. Dave, why would you say that Opportunity Zones are especially well-suited for those types of projects? Is there something about the rural focus that matters there, too?

Dave McGimpsey: Absolutely, because you’re not typically going to site a nuclear facility in the midst of a large metropolitan area. Typically, these SMRs [small modular reactors], or nuclear plants, are going to be sited probably in a rural area, and they are compact enough that you’re not going to have to worry about a sprawling development that may cross the boundary of a census tract, or something like that, so it would certainly fit within a census tract that could be designated as an Opportunity Zone. That is the key here, that the nuclear facilities, combined cycle gas turbines—lots of energy infrastructure—can fit within these census tracts and be designated as an Opportunity Zone.

Kristin Hayes: Interesting. Okay, all right.

Well, I want to ask you guys: You closed your brief by concluding some recommendations for energy project developers who are looking to take advantage of the QOZ program moving forward. Andy, you started to hint at this a little bit, but I wondered … I just want to give you both a chance to sort of talk us through what the overarching recommendations you’d have for folks who might be interested in this program. What are those?

Andy Rankin: Sure, and I’ll go on a little bit of a monologue here, so I apologize for that, but I like to define the Opportunity Zone program overall as two benefits. Benefit one is good, benefit two is amazing.

Benefit two is, if you have capital gains, be it long term, be it short term—it doesn’t matter what it’s from, from the sale of your company, from the sale of stock, from the sale of crypto, even as far as art or baseball cards, it doesn’t matter is my point to that—if you invest these, and here’s where the alphabet soup comes in, do a Qualified Opportunity Fund, which everybody calls a QOF, and that’s an entity that is, with legal help, relatively easy and inexpensive to set up. You have to do that within six months of realization, which means selling the thing, selling the stock, selling the real estate, selling your business.

That’s 180 days. You have 180 days to do that. Six months, let’s call it. Then you have another 180 days, or six months, to allocate or spend that money or, this is a big or, within that 180 days, you come up with a 31-month plan to allocate it. Really, it’s six months plus six months plus 31 months, which is two years and seven months, so you’re talking three years and seven months, just short of four years. It’s a lot of time to allocate capital, so you do that.

Let’s simplify it. You do that; you comply with everything. It’s 2025—you sell and you make your capital gain in 2025. When should you pay your tax on that in early 2026?

Benefit one is you get five years to pay that tax; you don’t have to pay it for five additional years. You put that into treasuries or a savings account, or whatever. You’re probably going to make, in five years, 25 percent on that money. That’s money you would not have had but for this law. Then, when you ultimately pay the tax five years from now, the tax you pay is reduced by 10 percent, so you get a little reduction. That’s benefit one, and that’s what I call the “good” one.

The even better one is benefit two. Let’s say you buy a project or a business, you qualify under the law, you might do something in a zone to qualify under the law, and there are a lot of legal requirements which would put you and your listeners to sleep. We’ll say, if you have questions about that, we’re happy to talk to you. But the benefit is, if you hold and operate that business or property, or whatever you’re doing that qualifies in a zone—and a lot of things qualify; there are some exemptions, but there are very few. At 10 years and a day—let’s say you bought whatever it is, a piece of property, and you started a business on it. You’re into that property for $1 million, you sell that property for $5 million in 10 years and a day. All the way up to 30 years. You’re into it for $1 million, let’s say you sell it for $5 million. You have a $4-million gain; you should pay tax on $4 million. Your tax is zero. And that’s one of the best things I’ve ever seen in the tax code.

Kristin Hayes: That’s a huge incentive to put money into these QOZs, then. Yeah, okay.

Andy Rankin: With that background, I’ll tell you what we recommend. They’re redoing these zones now, every 10 years. Now, with OB3, the first re-designation is now. One, look at what capital gain you have. Two, think about your future projects, if you have capital gain, and consider Opportunity Zones and if you see something that you may want to do—maybe it’s in a zone, maybe it’s not. Those zones are going to change over the next year, but then they’re going to be fixed for 10 years. So call your lobbyist, call your legal counsel, call your accountant, your financial person who is versed in this (we know plenty of them, we obviously know the legal people who are good at this)and get a plan to allocate your capital gain to defer tax, potentially not pay tax on the gain, and get a new project with greater incentives. That’s the advice.

Kristin Hayes: Okay, all right. Dave, anything you’d want to add on that?

Dave McGimpsey: Absolutely. Andy did a great job and he hit the big point.

What I would recommend for the actual clean energy developers is: Right now, everyone has their head down trying to make a mad dash to get into the safe harbor so that they can qualify for those existing tax credits. But if they look up and see what’s coming and the opportunities available in the Opportunity Zone program, they will be able to set up their own companies, their own development, and clean energy companies for success in the long term by seeking out these new sources of capital so that they can fund additional projects. Right now, everyone has just got their head down again, trying to get into the safe harbor for the existing tax credits, but there is a world of opportunity (no pun intended) to—

Kristin Hayes: It’s hard to not make that pun, to be honest.

Andy Rankin: Once you get “opportunity” on the brain, you want to keep going with it.

Kristin Hayes: Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, Dave, I interrupted you, but yeah.

Dave McGimpsey: No worries. I just think that there’s a lot of money out there. I’m sure there’s some funds out there that maybe have held Nvidia for a few years and might have a few capital gains to invest in a clean energy project.

Kristin Hayes: Interesting. Well, this is great, guys. I have to admit, I had never heard of the QOZ program before; again, our board member mentioned it a few weeks ago, about a month ago now. It’s just really great to hear about, again, the opportunities here and just the chance for folks to take a fresh look at something and understand what that means, in terms of future certainty.

Dave, just going way back to your point at the beginning, that uncertainty is a challenge for anyone who’s trying to invest in long-term assets—so, this 10-year window, some clarity around the long-term nature of these, that they don’t need extension over time anymore. Hopefully, there’s some new certainty there and some opportunities for folks to take advantage of new flows of capital. I know how important that is for getting any energy project off the ground.

Thank you both this has been really interesting. I want to close with our regular feature, Top of the Stack, so I’m going to invite you both to recommend some content, really, of any type you can recommend to our listeners. It can be on this topic, or it can be on a totally different topic. We take all tops of the stack.

Andy, let me start with you. What’s on the top of your stack?

Andy Rankin: Other than Resources Radio, of course?

Listen, I guess my general advice is to find a good source of relatively neutral news. Of course, everything has an opinion associated with it and a point of view, but find one or two good sources of neutral financial and news-based reporting and then dig into the authors that you like, the numbers that you like, and go from there. I use the Wall Street Journal, but that’s pretty much a safe harbor. And I’m going to flip the script a little bit and say … I’m not going to tell you anything else to listen to, but I want to tell you what not to listen to. Don’t get bogged down in the massive talking heads who get paid to talk for a living. Get your news, get your financial information, and get as much of it as you can, but make sure it’s information.

I still like George Will, and that’s an opinion guy, but I curate that very safely. I don’t want somebody whose goal is to make me angry or to fall in love with something. I want something that can help me analyze.

And then just get out of your own head and go for entertainment from there. That’s my two cents.

Kristin Hayes: I love it. Okay, Dave, what about you?

Dave McGimpsey: Well, I’ll give you a podcast, and it’s a little self-serving, but I’ve got a podcast called the Water Values Podcast. And anyone who’s interested in energy ought to be interested in water, because I’m sure you’ve heard of the water-energy nexus. I encourage folks to check out the Water Values Podcast. It’s a broad-range look at a whole spectrum of issues across the water sector, and it does touch on energy. For example, we did a data center episode not too long ago, so it’s just … If you like energy, you need to like water, as well.

Kristin Hayes: We here at Resources Radio also believe in really good, solid—to whatever extent, anything in the world is neutral, but we certainly aim for a neutral analysis of things. So, Andy, you’re definitely preaching our sermon here. I don’t think that’s an expression, but you know what I mean. And Dave, you’re so right about that energy-water nexus. I have to say, I have a very personal fascination with the data center conversation, so I will definitely check out that episode. That sounds great.

Well, thank you both again. It’s been a pleasure, and we’ll be in touch.

Dave McGimpsey: Thank you, Kristin. I really appreciate the time.

Andy Rankin: Yeah, appreciate it, Kristin. Thank you so much.

The Elon Musk-led EV maker has had trouble selling cars the way it once did. But a growing energy business and AI plans are helping pick up the slack.

Tesla's fourth-quarter revenue is expected to fall roughly 3.5% compared to a year earlier, after Elon Musk's company sold fewer electric vehicles than expected.

While Tesla's revenue likely declined in the fourth quarter due to pressure on electric-vehicle sales, a smaller part of its business could stand out once more when the company reports earnings on Wednesday afternoon.

The ""highlight"" of the fourth quarter will likely be Tesla's energy-storage and -generation business, said Baird analyst Ben Kallo, who predicts that the segment will continue to grow as it has for several straight quarters.

Tesla (TSLA) deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of energy-storage products between October and December, beating a record it had set in the prior quarter. Analysts on average expect $3.72 billion in revenue from Tesla's energy business, up 21% from a year earlier, according to the FactSet consensus.

The business is expected to benefit from growing interest in AI, as major tech companies spend heavily on infrastructure like data centers. Michael Snyder, Tesla's head of energy and charging, said last year that there has been ""remarkable"" demand for the company's megapack batteries to support data centers.

Meanwhile, Tesla is expected to report revenue of $24.8 billion for the December quarter, down from $25.7 billion in the same period in 2024, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to come in at 45 cents per share, a steep drop compared to the 73 cents per share it reported for the final quarter of 2024.

Tesla is struggling to adjust to a new EV landscape following the expiration of key federal tax credits that once incentivized purchases. The Austin, Texas-based company delivered just 418,0227 electric vehicles during the last three months of 2025, a 16% drop compared to a year earlier.

And automotive gross margins excluding regulatory credits, a metric closely watched by investors, is expected to be 14.4% - lower than the two prior quarters, which would show the impact of those expired EV tax credits. Margins could decline further in the near future as Tesla ramps up deals as it did in December, when it more than doubled sales incentives for new cars, according to Kelley Blue Book.

William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer said that, during Tesla's earnings call with investors on Wednesday, he wants to hear more about the company's view of the energy-storage market and its plans to increase production. He pointed out in a Tuesday note that Tesla has supplied more than 600 megapacks for xAI's data center in Tennessee, referring to CEO Elon Musk's artificial-intelligence startup.

Analysts will also want to hear more about Tesla's plans to accelerate plans that are more directly related to AI, namely autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. Much of the company's valuation is predicated on its eventual dominance in those fields.

As of Tuesday, 40% of analysts who cover Tesla's stock had a buy or overweight rating, while 38% rated it at hold, according to FactSet data. On average, those analysts had a $415 price target on the stock, below its current level near $434.

""Investors are underwriting Tesla as an AI platform with physical endpoints,"" Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities, told MarketWatch over email. ""The stock will react to whether management reinforces that trajectory or pushes it further out.""

A major focus on Wednesday's call will be Tesla's plans to expand its existing ride-hailing service. Last week, the company said it had begun limited unsupervised autonomous-vehicle rides in Austin, Texas, hitting a milestone it had planned to reach at the end of December.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a major Tesla bull, expects the company to deploy robotaxis in more than 30 U.S. cities this year, which would be a massive leap from the two in which it currently offers ride-hailing services. He thinks that autonomous vehicles will add $1 trillion to Tesla's valuation over the next few years.

Analysts are also looking to find out more about Tesla's timeline to launch a more advanced version of its current Full Self-Driving system. But deploying that largely depends on how much data it can collect to refine its technology.

Morgan Stanley expects the FSD take rate - or the amount of Tesla customers who choose to pay for the technology - to rise to 17% from 15% this year. The analysts are partly banking on a global expansion of FSD, which currently is available in seven countries.

Musk has said that Tesla could receive approval to begin offering FSD in Europe and fully launch the system in China in the first quarter of this year.

""We believe Tesla will own 70% of the global autonomous market over the next decade as no other company can match the scale and scope of Tesla,"" wrote Ives, who has a $600 price target on the stock.

The company is expected to give an update on its latest version of its Optimus robot, which Musk has said could be showed off in March and enter production in late 2026. He said last week that the humanoid robots could be sold to consumers toward the end of next year, potentially unlocking a largely untapped market.

Tesla's board is also considering an investment in xAI, which was started by Musk in 2023 and has already received a multibillion-dollar investment from SpaceX, the CEO's space-launch company. xAI's controversial chatbot, Grok, has been deployed in some Tesla vehicles and Optimus.

In the past, Musk has said his companies are ""trending"" toward convergence, which has been at the forefront of some investors' minds as SpaceX prepares to become a public company. Morgan Stanley's Andrew Percoco advised in a recent note that investors should look for updates on how the ""Muskonomy,"" as he called it, could ""prove symbiotic.""

DENVER - Today, one year after signing a landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen economic ties between Colorado and the United Kingdom, Governor Jared Polis welcomed British Consul General Richard Hyde to Colorado’s state capitol to mark continued progress in advancing cooperation on trade, investment and innovation. Signed in January 2025, the MoU established a framework to deepen collaboration between the State of Colorado and the UK across the industries driving growth in both economies.

“In Colorado we are proud of our long-standing strong relationship with the United Kingdom. Our partnership is creating lasting economic benefits in Colorado’s key sectors like clean energy, agriculture, and quantum technologies. A big thanks to our partners and friends in the U.K. for supporting investments into Colorado businesses and helping to expand good-paying jobs across our state,” said Governor Polis.

Over the past year, the partnership has facilitated greater collaboration between public and private stakeholders across clean energy, quantum technologies, space technology tourism and artificial intelligence. Work has also focused on strengthening dialogue to reduce barriers to trade and investment and reinforce the longstanding economic relationship between Colorado and the United Kingdom. Consul General Richard Hyde is visiting Denver and Boulder this week to mark the MoU’s anniversary and further collaboration.

“The first year of the agreement has demonstrated the depth and potential of the U.K.-Colorado relationship,” said Consul General Richard Hyde. “By bringing together our governments, businesses and research communities, the MoU has helped unlock new opportunities for trade, investment and collaboration in priority sectors. We are proud of the progress we made so far and remain committed to strengthening ties that deliver tangible benefits for both economies.”

This week, Consul General Richard Hyde is attending a working group to discuss further partnership under the MoU. He will also meet with key partners driving quantum industry collaboration, including CU Boulder, Quantinuum, and Infleqtion.

Marking its first anniversary, the implementation of the MoU has delivered significant progress. Delegations have travelled between Colorado and the U.K. to promote business opportunities for quantum companies and increase partnerships between Colorado and U.K. quantum ecosystems. Joint policy roundtables have explored shared issues and opportunities around data center deployment and clean energy. This momentum has extended to U.K.-Colorado engagement at flagship trade, space and technology spaces like the 40th annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, World Trade Day in Denver and London Tech Week, enabling greater market access and partnership opportunities for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. Alongside these collaborations, a complementary MoU was signed to further strengthen targeted regional partnerships: a tech deal to create a ‘Quantum Growth Bridge’ between the West of England and America’s Mountain West, supported by Elevate Quantum, the University of Bristol, and West of England Mayoral Combined Authority.

The MOU celebrated this week was supported by British Consulate-General Chicago, the U.K. Government Office in Denver and the Global Business Development division of OEDIT. Fostering greater international cooperation strengthens global awareness of Colorado, positions the state’s businesses to benefit from international opportunities, and fosters the strategic growth of industries key to strengthening and diversifying Colorado’s economy.

Over the coming year, work under the MoU will continue across key sectors, with future engagement focused on identifying new opportunities to strengthen business ties, research collaboration, and commercial opportunities.

Building on a successful first year, these initiatives highlight Colorado and the United Kingdom’s shared commitment to deepening economic cooperation and fostering innovation across key sectors. This milestone year, coinciding with America’s 250th and Colorado’s 150th anniversary of statehood, celebrates the shared progress and future of transatlantic collaboration.

The Detroit automaker on Tuesday, Jan. 27, reported earnings for the period ending Dec. 31, 2025, and released its full-year guidance for 2026.

GM recorded a net loss of $3.31 billion in the final quarter of 2025. GM forewarned the substantial hit to its earnings in a government filing on Jan. 8 that said the company would be taking on $6 billion in costs for unused electric vehicle investment related to the production changes the automaker made last year. GM said in that same filing that it anticipated a $1.1 billion charge from restructuring its China business.

This is the second consecutive earnings impacted by electric vehicle production changes for GM. GM’s third quarter 2025 earnings plunged 57% compared with the same quarter a year earlier due to the first bout of adjustments.

Combined with the recent filing, GM will have accounted for a $7.6 billion loss on downshifting its EV production in 2025.

GM’s stock was trading up over 9% at $86.90 at 10:51 a.m. ET on Tuesday.

After enduring the fluctuating market conditions of 2025, GM said it expects a stronger 2026.

In a letter to shareholders, GM CEO said the company anticipates margins will return to a range of 8% to 10%.

“We expect the U.S. new vehicle market will continue to be resilient, and with our compelling vehicles, technology-driven services and operating discipline, 2026 should be an even better year for GM,” Barra wrote.

GM set its financial guidance of net income at a range of $10.3 billion to $11.7 billion and an adjusted net income range of $13 billion to $15 billion. GM’s 2026 financial guidance also includes anticipated capital spending of $10 billion to $12 billion that includes the company’s battery cell manufacturing joint ventures.

Barra added that the consistency of the company’s underlying profitability beneath the regulatory and political headwinds places it in a position to begin a new $6 billion share repurchase program and to increase its dividend rate by 20%.

As of Dec. 31, 2025, GM said it had 904 million shares outstanding, down from 995 million at the end of 2024, and 1.2 billion at the end of 2023.

“Looking ahead, we are operating in a U.S. regulatory and policy environment that is increasingly aligned with customer demand,” she said. “As a result, we continue to onshore more production to meet strong customer demand for our vehicles.”

Though the special items impact the company’s net income, its earnings before interest and taxes that most closely track operating performance remain unaffected ― which is good news for GM investors and factory workers.

Before adjusting for special items, GM reported a net income of $2.84 billion, a 13% increase over fourth quarter 2024. Net income for the year across the company was $12.75 billion, a 15% drop from the prior year.

Meanwhile, on an earnings call, GM CFO Paul Jacobson noted that cost the automaker $3.1 billion in 2025, below the company’s predicted range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion.

Due to GM’s tariff mitigation efforts ― accomplished through a three-pronged strategy of increasing U.S. vehicle and parts production, dropping $2 billion in business costs, and holding fast to vehicle pricing strategies ― Jacobson said the company was able to offset 40% of the tariff impact it may otherwise have experienced last year.

“When we provided updated guidance in October, we were tracking towards the low end of this range but took a conservative approach given the dynamic trade and tariff environment,” Jacobson said on the call Jan. 27. “We were able to do even better based on strong execution and favorable policy developments during the quarter, including the benefit from a lower tariff rate for Korea.”

Other impacts to earnings GM

Amid that restructuring, GM’s business in China improved significantly in the fourth quarter.

GM recorded a $513 million equity loss in China in the fourth quarter, better than the loss of $4.06 billion the automaker said it experienced a year earlier. GM posted an equity loss of $316 million in China across 2025 compared with a $4.41 billion loss in 2024.

Jacobson also noted that sourcing alternative semiconductor chips due to the disruptions with Chinese-owned computer chipmaker Nexperia. The resulting shortage cost GM $100 million in the fourth quarter 2025.

Jacobson added that GM expects another $100 million of “pressure” in the first quarter of this year though noted that GM experienced no production disruptions as a result of the chip shortage.

Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a report in response to GM’ earnings that he believes GM’s guidance for 2026 was relatively conservative as the company battles various costs that are beyond its control.

“While the tariff headlines and the EV restructuring activities remain a lingering headache to the bottom line, GM continues to navigate this difficult environment flawlessly to deliver strong bottom-line returns with significant cash flow generation over the coming years with greater focus on its ICE vehicle fleet to drive profitable growth,” Ives said.

Here are the fourth-quarter numbers GM reported:

Net loss of $ 3.31 billion, a drop of 12% compared with the prior year’s quarter of a $2.96 billion net loss.

Total revenues of $45.29 billion, down 5% compared with $47.7 billion in fourth quarter 2024.

Sales fell 6.9% in the fourth quarter to 703,001 vehicles compared with the same quarter in 2024.

Earnings before income and taxes (EBIT) of $2.84 billion, up 13% from $2.51 billion in the same quarter the prior year.

And full year 2025:

Net income of $2.7 billion, less than half of the $6 billion it earned in 2024.

Total revenues of $185 billion, a 1.3% dip compared with the prior year.

Sales rose 5.5% in 2025 to 2,853,299 vehicles.

Earnings before income and taxes (EBIT) of $12.7 billion, a 15% decline compared with $14.93 billion in 2024.

GM is the first of the Detroit Three to report earnings for the fourth quarter and full year of 2025.

Ford Motor Co. is expected to report earnings on Feb. 10 and Stellantis is scheduled to do the same on Feb. 26.

Net loss: The amount of money a company owes when its expenses exceed income for the quarter or year.

Revenue: How much money a company generated during the designated time before expenses like operating costs or taxes.

“Her leadership is essential as we stand up Ford Energy to capture the growing demand for reliable battery energy storage that supports grid stability and resilience for utilities and large energy users,” he stated.
“We’re building a business focused first on utility-scale battery energy storage systems for large customers while also offering battery cells for residential energy storage solutions,” she stated.
Ford will retool the facility to accommodate energy storage production, which is expected to take approximately 16 months.","A month after announcing that it was halting EV battery manufacturing and switching to energy storage production, Ford appointed Lisa Drake as the New President of Ford Energy on Tuesday.

Drake will take on the role “effective immediately,” according to the company.

The launch of the new Detroit automaker’s new battery energy storage systems (BESS) business unit will be handled by the executive.

The new subsidiary aims to “leverage Ford’s battery expertise and US manufacturing footprint,” the company said.

Reporting to Ford‘s Vice Chair John Lawler, the executive will manage all of Ford Energy’s end-to-end operations, spanning battery cell production, system assembly, and sales, as well as its future leadership team.

Lawler highlighted Drake’s “deep expertise in scaling complex industrial systems and securing critical supply chains” for commanding the new unit.

“Her leadership is essential as we stand up Ford Energy to capture the growing demand for reliable battery energy storage that supports grid stability and resilience for utilities and large energy users,” he stated.

Drake stated that the Energy subsidiary allows Ford to “maximize the value of [its] battery manufacturing capabilities.”

The executive reaffirmed the new venture’s focus on both commercial and residential markets.

“We’re building a business focused first on utility-scale battery energy storage systems for large customers while also offering battery cells for residential energy storage solutions,” she stated.

Lisa Drake’s Career

Drake has been with Ford since 1999, accumulating more than two decades of experience.

In that year, she was an engineer in the Product Development team, where she was for nearly ten years, until 2008.

Between 2008 and 2011, the new executive became Chief Engineer Hybrid/Battery Electric Vehicles, while also serving as Chief Engineer of Lincoln’s Whitespace compact utility from 2010 to 2013.

Between 2013 and 2017, Drake was Ford‘s Global Purchasing Director.

In 2017, she was appointed Vice President of Global Powertrain Purchasing and Operations, a role she held until 2020, when she was promoted to Chief Operating Officer of Ford‘s North American division.

Between March 2022 and now, Drake was the Vice President of Technology Platform Programs and EV Systems.

The new promotion comes nearly a week after the Detroit automaker’s Europe division named Christian Weingaertner the new General Manager of Passenger Vehicles, effective on the first day of February.

BlueOval SK

Last August, Ford announced that it would start manufacturing electric vehicle LFP batteries at its Louisville Assembly Plant, through its joint venture with Korean manufacturer SK On — BlueOval SK.

However, in the last month of 2025, the company decided to halt the operations at the joint facility from February 14.

It was part of a $19.5 billion impairment reported by the company as it shifted its EV business strategy.

As a result, nearly 1,600 jobs (the entire workforce) in Kentucky were cut.

Ford will retool the facility to accommodate energy storage production, which is expected to take approximately 16 months.

The plant is not expected to begin operations until 2027.

Ford US Sales

In its domestic market, Ford sold a total of 2.2 million vehicles last year, a 6% growth compared to 2024.

AUSTIN, Texas — Industry data reported to the state shows that the weekend’s powerful winter storm triggered 579,000 pounds of additional pollution from 34 gas industry-reported pollution events, according to a Public Citizen review of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) data.

Public Citizen’s review echoes a separate analysis of industry data from the summer of 2023, which found that extreme heat in West Texas triggered numerous pollution events when high temperatures strained gas field equipment, forcing companies to release pollutants, including volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gases. In that heatwave analysis, gas plants, compressor stations, and other facilities accounted for multiple heat-related releases, underscoring how both cold and hot extremes expose weaknesses in fossil fuel systems and harm air quality.

A quarter of the pollution events took place in Martin County, near the state’s border with New Mexico.

“These weather-related emissions are not isolated occurrences,” said Adrian Shelley, Texas director of Public Citizen. “Communities already struggling with health risks are left breathing the consequences when industry equipment fails. Texans deserve policies that both strengthen infrastructure and hold polluters accountable, so damaging weather events aren’t accompanied by poorer air quality. Furthermore, emissions of volatile organic compounds include methane, which contributes to climate change and is a contributing cause of severe winter storms. As extreme weather becomes more frequent and intense, Public Citizen continues to call for stricter rules that reduce preventable pollution and safeguard the community.”

This Public Citizen spreadsheet includes data downloaded from the TCEQ’s State of Texas Emissions Event Reporting System (STEERS) for all events with start dates from January 19 through January 26, 2026. It contains additional fields not automatically included in the agency’s public download, including industry-reported causes and comparisons to applicable emissions rate limits, as well as flags for potential exceedances.

At its core, this case is not about lawyers or courts but about whether competition is real or merely rhetorical.
Monopolies undermine that premise by removing choice, dulling incentives to innovate, and allowing incumbents to dictate terms without fear of displacement.
The Fourth Circuit recognized this distinction by refusing to treat Duke’s size as a license to exclude rivals.
Because in a genuinely capitalist system there is no place for monopolies, no safe harbor for oligopolies, and no justification for dominance that exists solely because it has always been so.","The United States Supreme Court’s recent decision to decline review of Duke Energy’s antitrust appeal should not be dismissed as a procedural footnote, because by leaving intact the lower court’s ruling, it has allowed a serious challenge to monopoly conduct to proceed, and in doing so has reopened a conversation that North Carolina has avoided for far too long about power, privilege, and the meaning of competition in a system that still calls itself capitalist.

In North Carolina, Duke Energy is not merely a large participant in the energy market but the dominant provider across much of the state, a position accumulated over generations through regulatory protection and structural barriers rather than through continuous exposure to consumer choice. This is precisely why its dominance deserves scrutiny rather than deference.

This is not a story about corporate success in the abstract, nor is it an argument against scale where scale is earned through superior performance, but rather an examination of what happens when a firm’s size becomes a shield against competition rather than a consequence of it, particularly in a sector as essential as electricity, where consumers cannot simply opt out when prices rise or innovation lags.

The case at the center of this dispute was brought by NTE Carolinas, which sought to compete for a long-term electricity contract with the City of Fayetteville, and whose claim is both narrow and profound, alleging that Duke did not prevail through better pricing or efficiency but instead leveraged its entrenched position to block a rival’s entry into the market.

A federal district court initially accepted Duke’s defense, but the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that NTE had presented sufficient evidence of anticompetitive conduct to proceed, a ruling that rejected the notion that incumbency alone confers immunity from scrutiny or that competitors must already match a monopolist’s scale before they are entitled to compete.

The US Office of the Solicitor General went further, urging the Supreme Court to deny Duke’s petition and describing the dispute as one arising from a campaign by an established monopolist to stop a more efficient rival from competing in a long-standing regional market, language that strips away euphemism and places the issue squarely where it belongs, in the realm of economic power rather than legal technicality.

At its core, this case is not about lawyers or courts but about whether competition is real or merely rhetorical. Capitalism, if it is to mean anything at all, depends on the ability of firms to win customers by offering better products at better prices, rather than by using regulatory insulation to preserve dominance by default.

Monopolies undermine that premise by removing choice, dulling incentives to innovate, and allowing incumbents to dictate terms without fear of displacement. And when this dynamic takes hold in an industry as fundamental as electricity, the costs are borne not in theory but in household budgets, business expenses, and the pace at which new technologies are adopted.

There is, of course, a legitimate role for regulation in sectors where duplication of infrastructure is impractical, but there is a critical difference between regulating a natural monopoly to protect consumers and allowing a dominant firm to use its position to suppress competition where alternatives could reasonably exist. The Fourth Circuit recognized this distinction by refusing to treat Duke’s size as a license to exclude rivals.

What makes this matter especially urgent is that it is not unique to Duke Energy, as similar patterns can be found across industries where consolidation has been mistaken for efficiency and incumbency has been confused with merit, despite the fact that American economic history has always advanced through challengers to rather than custodians of the status quo.

The United States did not become prosperous by insulating Western Union from the telegraph, by shielding dominant steel producers from competition, or by freezing innovation in the automobile industry, but by allowing new entrants to test old assumptions, forcing incumbents either to improve or to yield.

A free market, if it is to be more than a slogan, requires real competition, which means structuring utility markets so that efficiency, innovation, and price can be contested on their merits rather than preempted by regulatory muscle, and recognizing that dominance achieved through privilege is not a public good but a private convenience.

Duke Energy’s effort to secure Supreme Court intervention was, in effect, an attempt to preserve an old order in which scale substitutes for accountability, and the court’s refusal to intervene has allowed a necessary reckoning to continue, one that should be welcomed by anyone who values markets over monopolies and consumers over incumbents.

If North Carolina aspires to a 21st century economy that rewards innovation rather than inertia, it must begin by acknowledging that no firm should be so powerful that it can dictate terms without fear of challenge. Because in a genuinely capitalist system there is no place for monopolies, no safe harbor for oligopolies, and no justification for dominance that exists solely because it has always been so.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2048px-Duke_Energy_Office.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 15:01:08.225289

The Glacier Law does not need to be reformed; it simply needs to be enforced,” said Andrés Nápoli, Executive Director of FARN.
The Glacier Law is a pioneering piece of legislation worldwide: it declares glaciers and the periglacial environment to be public assets and strategic water reserves.","Five leading environmental organizations based in Argentina – Greenpeace Argentina, Fundación Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (FARN), Aves Argentinas, Asociacion de Abogades Ambientalistas y Colectivo de Acción por la Justicia Ecosocial, and Jóvenes por el Clima warn that during the extraordinary sessions of Congress starting February 2nd, headway will be made on the amendment to the Glacier Law. These organizations warn that this initiative, which has already obtained an express ruling in the National Senate Environment Comission, represents a serious setback in the protection of glaciers and the periglacial environment, and they demand that no changes be made that weaken the current law.

“Modifying the Glacier Law in the midst of a climate and water crisis means reducing the protection of strategic freshwater reserves for Argentinians and putting the water security of more than 7 million people at risk. Glaciers and the periglacial environment are not ‘worthless ice’: they regulate river flows, sustain watersheds in drought conditions, and play a key role in the face of rising temperatures,” said Matías Arrigazzi of the Greenpeace Argentina team.

Argentina has almost 17,000 glaciers inventoried in 12 provinces, which feed 36 watersheds covering more than one million square kilometers. Glaciers and the periglacial environment represent strategic water reserves for the present and future populations.

“Periglacial environments are not empty territories: they are home to a wide variety of life forms that perform key ecological functions and sustain delicate environmental balances. Many of these species and natural processes transcend provincial political boundaries; nature does not recognize administrative limits. Today, these environments and the biodiversity they shelter are seriously threatened, and their protection requires a comprehensive, federal, and science-based approach,” said Hernán Casañas, Executive Director of Aves Argentinas.

The organizations also warn that the proposed amendment is unconstitutional. It violates Article 41 of the Argentine Constitution, the precautionary and prevention principles established in the General Environmental Law (Nº26.675), and the principle of environmental non-regression recognized in the Escazú Agreement, ratified in Argentina by law. The initiative transfers to the provinces the definition of which glaciers and which portions of the periglacial environment should be protected, breaking the national and uniform nature of minimum environmental standards and enabling unequal criteria for water systems that do not recognize political boundaries. This takes away decision making power from the Argentine Institute for Snow Studies, Glaciology, and Environmental Sciences (IANIGLA, for its initials in Spanish), the experts in this field.

“The proposed reform is highly regressive and unconstitutional, and will ultimately erode the very foundations of legal certainty that it seeks to promote. The Glacier Law does not need to be reformed; it simply needs to be enforced,” said Andrés Nápoli, Executive Director of FARN.

“Approving this amendment means leaving our strategic freshwater reserves unprotected, replacing technical and scientific criteria with political and economic pressures, with irreversible consequences for millions of Argentines for decades to come,” said Mercedes Pombo, co-founder of Jóvenes por el Clima.

Likewise, leaving the “relevant water value” of glaciers and periglacial environments to provincial administrative assessment is scientifically incorrect. These areas store large volumes of ice at depth and play an essential role in water regulation. Their destruction implies the irreversible loss of water that cannot be recovered and opens the door to a repeat of known episodes of contamination, such as the spills recorded in mining projects in mountainous areas.

“What is at stake is water. There are plans to sacrifice glaciers that are thousands of years old, which provide water for life, work, and agriculture, for large transnational mining projects. But these rivers nourish a large part of our country,” said Enrique Viale, President and Founder of the Argentine Association of Environmental Lawyers.

The Glacier Law is a pioneering piece of legislation worldwide: it declares glaciers and the periglacial environment to be public assets and strategic water reserves. It was ratified as constitutional by the Supreme Court and has proven effective in protecting these areas from the advance of more than 40 extractive projects. Weakening it will not lead to sustainable development, but rather to greater climate vulnerability, water loss, social impacts, and rising economic costs.",https://farn.org.ar/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_6284.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 16:59:20.569990

After five years, the charging stations will continue to operate without government support.","RALEIGH — North Carolina transportation officials are hoping a strategic shift will allow them to buildout electric vehicle charging stations in more places where they are needed.

The N.C. Department of Transportation plans to scale back the number of EV charging stations it had originally committed to build along interstates and highways and put more of the state’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program funds toward infrastructure in communities, rural areas and highways where less coverage exists.

New federal NEVI Program Interim Final Guidance was issued in August that gives states greater flexibility to determine where EV charging stations can be placed.

“The revised guidance enables the department to focus its support for the build out of a statewide EV charging network in areas of the state where there are fewer chargers and greater needs,” said State Transportation Secretary Daniel Johnson. “By focusing on areas of need, it helps ensure that all North Carolinians and those traveling in every corner of the state can access the EV charging network.”

North Carolina received $109 million in NEVI funding from the Federal Highway Administration to build out EV infrastructure along a network of approved alternative fuel corridors and in communities.

The first round of the EV charging station buildout started in 2024. Five businesses are now under contract to build and operate charging infrastructure along the state’s major highway corridors in the so-called alternative fuel corridors, or AFC. These corridors are federally designated interstates and highways such as Interstate 40 and U.S. 64 where the first phase of the buildout is occurring. The corridors are strategically located to support alternative fuel vehicle travel, reduce EV owners’ range anxiety, and encourage cleaner transportation.

New Guidance

NCDOT had originally planned to build 50 stations along the alternative fuel corridors. But the new NEVI guidance removed strict requirements like a stipulation that there be only 50-miles of space between charging stations along the AFC.

Also, the new guidance allows states to consider where existing privately developed EV charging infrastructure exists so states can ensure the NEVI-funded projects will not be in direct competition with existing privately developed infrastructure. Since the NEVI program began, several private firms built and now operate charging infrastructure in areas on the AFC originally identified as possible sites for companies interested in applying for NEVI funds.

“Most of North Carolina’s alternative fuel corridors are fully built out based on the existing charging stations and those charging contracts that have been awarded,” said Heather Hildebrandt, NCDOT Statewide Initiatives manager. “We want to help ensure that the firms receiving NEVI funds will continue to be economically viable.”

As a result, the NCDOT decided to scale back the NEVI-funded EV charging stations from 41 additional locations to 16 locations along the alternative fuel corridors.

Putting fewer resources along the AFC will allow NCDOT officials to redirect more of the NEVI funding to develop charging infrastructure in areas, such as rural towns or even highways such as Interstate 26 in the mountains, where fewer EV charging stations exist.

NCDOT published a map of the 16 sites and a list of the exits and crossroads for each charging cluster along the AFC on its website last week.

The agency plans in late March to issue a request for proposals for businesses interested in applying for NEVI funds to build and operate charging stations in those areas. Businesses interested in applying for funding will have 45 days to respond to the request.

“We hope that publishing the map now will give developers enough time to explore whether they wish to be part of this process,” said Heather Hildebrandt, NCDOT’s Statewide Initiatives manager.

The NEVI Program is structured to reimburse private companies up to 80 percent of the cost to construct and operate electric vehicle charging stations for a five-year period. After five years, the charging stations will continue to operate without government support.",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/richmond/original/20260127-125946-e0e-unnamed%20%2854%29.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 14:00:53.580160

Here's a breakdown of some of the stand-out stocks that have surpassed key price milestones already in 2026 and look set to remain popular investment vehicles for thematic positioning across the North American energy space in 2026.

THE GUTS OF THE GRID

Firms that produce parts, components and software that help connect and power electric grids and facilities are well placed to benefit from the ongoing AI and data center boom, which looks set to extend into 2026 and beyond.

Several North American companies specialize in developing materials and services dedicated to the grid space, including Fluor Corporation (FLR.N), opens new tab, MYR Group (MYRG.O), opens new tab and MasTec (MTZ.N), opens new tab. Their share prices have climbed 12% to 15% in 2026.

However, the top year-to-date performer is Wesco International (WCC.N), opens new tab, which is up over 17% and has dedicated segments covering communications, power generation and distribution, electrical and lighting, and security services.

""We believe core themes of data center, electrification, and grid investments will drive healthy growth"" for Wesco, Jefferies equity analysts said in a recent report.

POWER GRABS

Firms exposed to the rush to generate and distribute more power across the country are also gaining.

Stand-out firms in this category include Baker Hughes (BKR.O), opens new tab, which manufactures and services gas extraction equipment as well as high-efficiency gas turbines which are in high demand among utilities and data center operators alike.

Baker Hughes' shares are up over 20% year-to-date to their highest since 2008.

""One advantage some investors may not appreciate is how core industrial and energy technology is to our Baker Hughes thesis. This business has inherently higher returns and growth than just about any sub-industry in oilfield services,"" Morningstar analysts noted this month.

Bloom Energy (BE.N), opens new tab also manufactures products that are in high demand among utilities, and recently signed a record-large deal with utility American Electric Power (AEP.O), opens new tab for Bloom-made fuel cells that help convert natural gas into electricity.

Data centers that want to generate their own power - rather than rely on connecting to local grids - are also viable customers for Bloom, which has seen its share price soar 60% this year.

""Behind-the-meter power solutions are in the early stages of ramping up and (Bloom Energy) is well-positioned to capture high market share if it can increase its production capacity quickly enough this year,"" Clean Street analysts wrote this month.

Fluence Energy (FLNC.O), opens new tab is also riding the power demand wave, with its shares up over 35% year-to-date.

The energy storage giant has over 46 gigawatt hours of energy storage assets in operation across 48 markets globally, and is ""one of the few players able to deliver compliant solutions at scale,"" Jefferies analysts wrote this week.

REACTOR FUEL AND BATTERY ANODES

Uranium Energy (UEC.A), opens new tab is another high-flier this year, gaining over 55% already in 2026 as U.S. power firms and authorities look to revive the domestic nuclear power industry.

As the only vertically-integrated nuclear fuel supplier in the U.S., UEC is almost unique in the U.S. nuclear power supply chain.

""By owning production, processing capacity and eventually, conversion, UEC has the potential to capitalize on the need for a domestic uranium market amid the most significant supply shock in decades,"" H.C. Wainwright analysts published this week.

Northern Graphite (NGC.V), opens new tab, a Canadian company that mines and refines graphite for use in battery anodes, fuel cells and other applications, is another niche play that has seen its share price gain over 50% this year.

The highly volatile penny stock ranged from 8 Canadian cents to 22 cents in 2025, but has since climbed beyond the 30 cents mark for the first time since 2023 on news of a joint venture with an investment company to build and operate a battery anode production facility in Saudi Arabia.

The move is part of Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia's plan to electrify 30% of its vehicle fleet by 2030 and generate new jobs and industries within the Kingdom.

Northern Graphite is also the only graphite producer in North America, so the company will likely also benefit from the ongoing near-shoring push to ensure supplies of critical materials are not wholly controlled by China.

The nuclear power industry is experiencing renewed momentum in 2026, and recent federal actions—including bipartisan support, new tax credits, and regulatory streamlining by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)—aim to reduce permitting delays and encourage investment.

Project developers and hyperscalers face ongoing risks related to permitting, fuel procurement, interconnection logistics, and complex power purchase agreement (PPA) structures, especially as they navigate evolving market rules and supply chain uncertainties.

These developments signal a strategic bet by leading technology companies that nuclear energy will be essential for meeting long-term, reliable power needs, even as they accept the risks associated with new technologies and regulatory changes.

After a busy 2025 for the nuclear power industry and its federal regulators, the opening days of 2026 have made clear that this trend is only accelerating in the year ahead. With data centers, cloud computing, and AI driving electricity demand to previously unseen levels, and hyperscalers increasingly willing to think creatively about sources of clean, reliable, baseload power, the nuclear sector—including new and existing large-scale reactor sites and innovative small modular reactors (SMRs)—is poised for a decade of rejuvenation and reinvention. To do so, however, it must capitalize on recent developments at the NRC and DOE to overcome the regulatory red tape and cost overruns that have defined the industry in recent years, while securing the trust of local communities.

The first hyperscaler to move forward in 2026 is Meta, which announced on January 9 that it would procure up to 6.6 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear energy in the PJM market from three different partners, Vistra, TerraPower, and Oklo. This includes signing 20-year PPAs with Vistra to extend the life of two existing Vistra-owned plants in Ohio totaling more than 2.1 GW, and to uprate the capacity of both facilities and another plant in Beaver Valley, Pennsylvania, by 433 megawatts (MW) of cumulative additional power.

Also in the PJM market, Meta announced a new partnership with TerraPower to fund development of at least two 345 MW next-generation Natrium reactors to generate firm power as early as 2032, along with rights to procure up to a further 2.1 GW from six additional reactors later in the decade, paired with up to 1.2 GW of built-in energy storage capacity. Finally, Meta agreed to prepay Oklo for power offtake from a new 1.2 GW Aurora powerhouse situated on the former site of the decommissioned and decontaminated Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Ohio, which served as a nuclear enrichment facility for more than 60 years, ending in the early 2000s. Oklo plans to use this funding to support buildout of this flagship facility and to support fuel procurement.

Together, these partnerships build on a busy 2025 by Meta and other hyperscalers, with numerous announcements of offtake agreements for new, existing, and expanded or extended existing nuclear projects. This includes Meta’s 20-year PPA with Constellation for 1.1 GW of power from the Illinois Clinton Clean Energy Center (announced in June 2025); Amazon’s 1.9 GW deal with Talen Energy for nuclear power from its Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, facility (also announced in June 2025); and Google’s October 2025 announcement of its agreement with NextEra to restart and procure power from the previously decommissioned Duane Arnold facility in Iowa.

Taken together, these offtake agreements and investments in the nuclear fission industry, most of which will not come into effect until the first half of the 2030s, represent a clear calculation by some of the largest and most valuable technology companies in the world that the surge in demand for reliable energy and capacity that defines the current moment will extend well into the next decade. It is also a sign that GW-scale stable, reliable baseload is worth enough to these data center and AI operators that they will take a chance on new and untested SMR technologies and the kinds of larger-scale reactors that have run into extended and expensive regulatory and supply-chain delays.[1]

Part of the calculus for these new investments may be an emerging and seemingly bipartisan commitment to the nuclear industry at the federal level. After the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act created Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Tax Credits (aka 45U credits) for existing nuclear plants[2] and new incentives for SMRs, the Trump administration has doubled down on nuclear energy—a rare area of consensus and continuity.

The Trump administration’s support for nuclear energy has taken multiple forms and is closely connected to its prioritization of AI and data center buildout as a national security priority. On May 23, 2025, President Donald Trump signed four Executive Orders (EO) aimed at reinvigorating the American nuclear power sector, with a focus on speeding the permitting process for new reactors. Since then, DOE has sought to co-locate large AI data center complexes and new generation sources on federal lands, with an emphasis on using existing federal nuclear sites to build out new nuclear generation. Additionally, President Trump issued EO 14270 on April 9, 2025, directing certain agencies, including the NRC, DOE, and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to enact new rules to “sunset” many older regulations to streamline permitting and other processes for industry.[3]

In its most recent action on January 8, 2026, the NRC promulgated sunsetting rules pursuant to EO 14270[4] and established a default one-year sunset date for certain federal nuclear regulations on January 8, 2027, unless those rules are extended on a case-by-case basis by the NRC before that date following a public comment period. Most NRC regulations, including all those relating to its core statutory missions of protecting public health and safety and providing for the common defense, will remain unchanged by the new sunset rule. A number of duplicative and obsolete rules, however, such as those governing gaseous diffusion plants, which have been inoperable for decades (and are part of DOE’s plans to upcycle new nuclear sites), are now slated to be removed from the Federal Register early next year. Additionally, consistent with recent U.S. Supreme Court guidance in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo,[5] the NRC has targeted for removal a handful of regulations that are not directly grounded in statute, such as a rule stating that only written interpretations of NRC regulations issued by the NRC’s general counsel are binding on the commission.

One rule that was proposed for sunsetting attracted significant public comment and ultimately was reversed by the NRC upon publication of the direct final rule. The Aircraft Impact Assessment Rule was implemented in the wake of September 11, 2001, and requires each applicant to construct a new nuclear reactor in the United States to evaluate the impact of a large commercial aircraft colliding with the facility and to implement design features to keep the nuclear reactor and spent fuel areas cool and contained following such an impact.

Insights

Although efforts by the administration, NRC, and DOE to streamline regulations may bear meaningful fruit for nuclear project developers, permitting will remain a critical challenge. This is especially true for SMRs and other advanced nuclear technologies that lack an established permitting pathway for regulators to follow. Even as tech giants jockey for offtake from new nuclear projects in the coming years, project timelines will not leave much room for delays around permitting and financing, which are often issues for first-of-a-kind technologies. Additional hurdles may arise for projects built on federal DOE sites, where a history of nuclear activity and contamination may complicate both permitting and construction, and where environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act will proceed under new and untested DOE implementing procedures published in June 2025. New technologies that require design approval by the NRC also face uncertain timelines, even with the administration’s clear intent to move quickly. Accordingly, both nuclear project developers and AI and data center operators looking to partner with them must consider the risks associated with delays, especially in the context of hyperscalers who cannot accommodate significant delays to powering up new co-located facilities.

As discussed in several previous posts, FERC is currently very focused on the issue of interconnecting data centers behind the meter at existing generation sites. DOE has directed FERC to expedite rulemaking asserting jurisdiction over large load interconnections to the transmission grid. For developers and operators of large load sources like data centers, the ability to efficiently interconnect with large, co-located generating resources varies significantly by market and is often a black box with few published rules for interested parties to follow. With the recent surge in interest, this is beginning to change, as regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) explore a variety of new mechanisms to fast-track critical new generation—such as MISO’s new Expedited Resource Addition Study process—or pair generation and load for study.

In an era increasingly defined by global instability, issues may arise regarding future nuclear fuel procurement, especially given that as much as 40% of global uranium supply continues to be sourced from Russia, with roughly another 17% coming from China. DOE clearly recognizes the challenge this represents and has announced a $2.7 billion investment in strengthening domestic uranium enrichment capabilities over the next decade. Even so, given the long time-horizon of the investments and PPAs under consideration, some inescapable risk exists with respect to future cycles of reactor fuel procurement. In light of this, both large load offtakers and nuclear operators will need to negotiate who bears the risks associated with the costs of fuel procurement, when those costs are incurred, and who bears the risk of cost increases associated with procuring fuel from nations free of sanctions in an evolving market.

For projects connecting new load centers with restarted or uprated nuclear reactors, additional important nuances will exist in certain markets, such as MISO or PJM, where offtake must be “sleeved” through a local utility. Some of these utilities have small existing footprints and customer bases that make the addition of a new GW-scale data center a significant portion of their overall demand. This, in turn, introduces new risks for parties around RTO/ISO market participation, transferring power via the RTO/ISO markets, and managing financial carry costs, given the potential for large pricing impacts to load serving entities that buy from the market to serve their load and have to balance the timing of payments from the customer with the timing of settlements with MISO or other system operators for both demand and power. Extended nuclear reactor outages, such as for a refueling cycle or maintenance, are typically longer in duration than other kinds of resources that smaller utilities deal with, presenting unique challenges to supply power and capacity during these outages.

Although firm, reliable power supplying data center demand is a principal benefit of procuring power from a nuclear generator, common contracting concepts for firm power resources can create accounting challenges for offtakers. Specifically, offtakers must craft provisions around the impacts of a failure to deliver that do not create a notional quantity of power expected for each measurement period—which is more challenging to achieve with a firm resource than renewable intermittent resources—while still providing comfort to the offtaker that they will get the power that they need. Crafting PPAs that have appropriate teeth without creating a notional value requires careful balancing.

Finally, where generation sources like SMRs sign behind-the-meter PPAs co-located with load before the load is served by the grid (i.e., islanded for some period of time pending system upgrades), generators often seek capacity payments for that behind-the-meter generation, which can raise lease accounting concerns for buyers.

During the two-year RainSmart Rebates pilot program, residents located in the George W. Kuhn Drain Drainage District were able to receive money to install rain gardens, rain barrels, and native trees to their yards.

Participants were able to install one garden, up to two trees, and two rain barrels after an evaluation of their property to determine which infrastructure would work best.

By the numbers:

According to Oakland County Water Resources Commissioner Jim Nash, the second year of the program, which started in 2024 and just wrapped up, saw a 22% increase in participation from 2024.

This past year, 379 rain barrels, 199 native trees, and 105 rain gardens were installed.

In 2024, there were 159 rain barrels, 98 trees, and 49 rain gardens installed.

Since the pilot began, nearly 300 residents have participated. A total of more than $176,000 rebates were distributed, with the average participant receiving $500 for their projects.

Why it matters:

Flooding is a major issue in many parts of Metro Detroit, especially in cities that are part of the George W. Kuhn Drain Drainage District, including all or part of Berkley, Beverly Hills, Birmingham, Clawson, Ferndale, Hazel Park, Huntington Woods, Madison Heights, Oak Park, Pleasant Ridge, Royal Oak, Royal Oak Township, Southfield, and Troy,

This is because it is a combined sewer system. In a combined system, wastewater and stormwater both flow through the same pipes, known as gray infrastructure, and go to a wastewater treatment plant.

This means that during periods of intense rain like Metro Detroit has been seeing more frequently, the system can get overwhelmed. The result? Flooded streets and backups into homes.

Also, there is a greater likelihood of contaminants making it into the system. This is a concern even for homes not on a combined sewer system.

Rain barrels, trees, and native plant gardens all help reduce the amount of rainwater that makes it to the sewer system.

What they're saying:

Nash said the RainSmart Rebates program accomplished exactly what his office set out to do.

""By supporting homeowners with practical solutions at the neighborhood level, we’ve demonstrated how residential projects can become part of a broader stormwater management solution with lasting benefits,"" he said. ""The program is now helping divert millions of gallons of stormwater each year — strengthening neighborhoods across the district. We are always looking for innovative ways to reduce stormwater and these projects help divert stormwater from our sewer system while providing benefits to homeowners.""

According to Nash's office, homeowners who participated in the program valued the direction they received to make their yards more sustainable, and felt empowered to advocate for more green infrastructure in their communities.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox2detroit.com/www.fox2detroit.com/content/uploads/2026/01/1200/630/rainsmart.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-27 14:00:22.303689

What to expect during restoration

We understand how frustrating it can be to see crews leave an area before power is restored. Restoration follows a specific sequence based on how electricity flows through the system and prioritizes critical facilities such as hospitals. Crews will return as soon as upstream repairs are completed.

If you don’t see crews working nearby, they may be repairing another part of the system that must be restored before power can safely reach your home.

For safety reasons, customers are asked not to approach workers at job sites, as these areas can be dangerous and interruptions may slow restoration progress.

Workforce safety protocols

To protect worker safety and manage fatigue, restoration personnel generally do not work more than 16 hours in a 24-hour period and do not exceed 13 consecutive days without a rest period. These protocols ensure crews can work safely and effectively while restoring power as quickly as conditions allow.

Entergy Louisiana remains focused on restoring power as safely and quickly as possible and appreciates customers’ patience during this challenging winter weather event.

Customer safety and community resources

Cars registered in Canada routinely cross the border, though Americans can’t buy them.

China has quickly displaced the U.S. as the center of the global automotive industry, now building and exporting more cars than any other country. But Chinese cars remain an extremely rare sight in the U.S.

That may not be true for long.

Chinese cars have long been effectively barred from both the U.S. and Canada by 100% tariffs. America also bans cars with Chinese-derived software due to security concerns.

But Canada and China have reached a new trade agreement that will allow up to 49,000 Chinese-built cars into the country each year at a 6.1% tariff.

The New York Times reports that the deal also ensures “that China would make a ‘considerable investment into Canada’s auto sector’ within three years, suggesting that Chinese companies would ultimately manufacture cars in the country.”

Canadians Can Drive Into the U.S. Easily

Canadian license plates are a common sight in northern states, as crossing the border both ways in a car is legal and easy.

Cars registered in Canada routinely cross the border into the U.S. Americans can’t buy them, but Canadians can drive them on American roads with no restrictions for visits up to a year.

They’re particularly common in border states, with perhaps the highest concentration in the Detroit metro area thanks to the popular Ambassador Bridge border crossing.

So, the agreement could see vehicles popular overseas but not well-known in the U.S., driving past the headquarters of America’s largest automakers frequently.

Related: Chinese Automaker May Enter U.S. by 2029

In its early days, the deal could benefit Tesla most. Reuters notes that “Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.”

But Chinese automakers like BYD and Geely have explored moving into the Canadian market in the past. Cars like the popular BYD Seal and Xiaomi YU7 might become somewhat familiar sights on Detroit roads.

Once Chinese automakers move into a country’s market, they can quickly come to dominate it thanks to low prices on some very appealing, high-tech cars.

Quotas Have Historical Precedent

The U.S. used a similar quota system to ease Japanese cars into the American market in the 1980s.

The agreement limits imports to just 49,000 cars per year, with half the total reserved for more affordable models.

But limits like that have history, and don’t always stay limited.

The measure resembles the Reagan administration’s approach to a flood of Japanese-made cars that threatened to overwhelm U.S. automakers in the early 1980s.

Amid mounting global tumult, meeting sustainable development targets will only be possible if Governments, civil society and the private sector share both tools and resources in defence of the world’s most vulnerable, officials told the Economic and Social Council’s annual Partnership Forum today.

“Our conversations on partnerships must focus on how they support countries operating under pressure,” said Council President Lok Bahadur Thapa (Nepal). Natural disasters, conflicts, inequality and heavy debt burdens continue to grow — affecting developing countries most acutely — and more than 800 million people around the world still live in extreme poverty.

The Council’s annual Partnership Forum — one of the UN’s most powerful cross-sectoral convening platforms — is taking place in New York, focusing on “transformative, equitable, innovative and coordinated” actions for sustainable development. In line with General Assembly resolution 75/290A, the Forum highlights action by Governments and other stakeholders to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Mr. Thapa joined other senior officials in spotlighting the needs of landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and least developed countries — some of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable nations. “In a context of mounting needs, limited resources and heightened vulnerability, partnerships are not about expanding ambition alone — they are about maximizing impact.” That means pooling capacities, reducing fragmentation and extending reach.

Partnerships under Pressure: No Time for Backsliding

He said impactful partnerships — the focus of today’s Forum — are already enshrined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 2024 Pact for the Future. “Effective partnerships begin with listening,” he said, urging participants to share views with an eye towards delivering better and leaving no one behind. “Let us act with the urgency this moment demands — together, in speed and scale, with unity in action and with clear focus on results.”

Amina Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, recalled the Council’s storied 80-year history. It helped to draft and advance the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, drive the Millennium Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda, and continues to foster inclusive dialogue among Governments, academia, civil society and others. “This legacy matters now because of the test we will be facing over the next five years as we try to achieve the 2030 Agenda,” she said.

Noting that the Agenda remains “alarmingly off-track”, she said global hunger levels today are higher than in 2015, about 3 billion people cannot afford adequate housing, and gender equality targets are likely to be missed. The SDGs face a more than $4 trillion financing gap, which will not be closed merely by making speeches. Instead, concrete partnerships are the practical engines driving progress. “What you share here should not stay in this room,” she stressed, urging participants to take the ideas generated at the Forum out into the world.

Clean Energy Access a ‘Hinge Point’ for Progress

Keynote speaker Sheila Oparaocha, Director of the ENERGIA International Network on Gender and Sustainable Energy, drew attention to one of the five Sustainable Development Goals on which the Forum is focusing in 2026 — Goal 7 on clean energy access — which she described as a hinge point for progress on some of the world’s most urgent challenges, including economic inequality, climate vulnerability and social injustice.

She illustrated the stakes through the story of Randa, a mother in rural Senegal who lacks electricity and cooks on firewood that takes nearly 10 hours each week to collect. Randa gave birth in a clinic where midwives delivered her children using a kerosene lamp. Noting that her experience reflects that, of more than 600 million people around the globe who lack electricity and some 2 billion who lack access to clean cooking fuels, she stressed: “These are not abstract statistics — they reflect lived realities.”

With only four years left to deliver on the 2030 Agenda, she said real progress demands collective commitment, strong partnerships, clear plans, the right tools and adequate financing. As of 2025, energy compacts have brought together over 200 partnerships, mobilized millions of dollars and have helped create 2.7 million “green jobs”. Women-led delivery models have empowered more than 42,000 women entrepreneurs, delivering clean energy solutions to over 21 million consumers.

Move Science beyond Silos, Unlock ‘Library’ of Nature Solutions

Yensi Flores-Bueso, a member of the Secretary-General’s 2025–2027 Independent Group of Scientists for the 2027 Global Sustainable Development Report, also delivered a keynote address. Describing her work in chemistry and her roots in Honduras, she said nature holds a vast “library” of development solutions, of which humanity has explored only a fraction. “For science to serve humanity at the speed required, we must stop operating in silos,” she said.

Noting that scientific capability exists everywhere, she warned that access does not. Science is therefore not only about discovery, but is itself a public service. Governments, funders and universities must foster research cultures that make knowledge usable and connect science with society. She urged the Forum’s participants to prioritize open science as a kind of infrastructure and build genuinely equitable international and interdisciplinary partnerships.

His administration is eager to tout its pro-fossil fuel and anti-renewable energy record.

Iowa is a tough place to test that message, though.

With some of the most abundant wind energy in the country and some of the lowest electric utility rates, Iowa undercuts the Trump administration’s claims that wind energy is unreliable and expensive.

Wind energy has directly held down Iowans’ electricity bills, according to the state’s largest utility. And it’s offered a significant income stream to both landowners and local governments. That has helped earn wind power the political support of Iowa’s top Republicans, from Sen. Chuck Grassley to Gov. Kim Reynolds.

Trump’s opposition to wind energy could blunt Republicans’ efforts to regain the upper hand on economic issues — especially in a state where three of the four congressional districts are competitive and where Democrats are increasingly bullish about their chances in this year’s gubernatorial race.

In fact, Trump’s position could offer Democrats a wedge issue to help them in November.

“A lot of the information that is out there that is negative on wind and solar, do not forget, comes in the form of lies from the oil companies,” State Auditor Rob Sand, the only statewide elected Democrat and a candidate for governor, said in a September town hall.

“We know what wind and solar are. Why do we know? Because we’ve been outside our whole lives,” he said, according to central Iowa’s Sun Courier. “It’s wind. It’s sun. They’re good. I enjoy them, and it’s wonderful, I think, that we can fuel our future and power our future with them.”

While Trump has long attacked clean energy policy as a whole, he’s been especially opposed to wind power. Part of the animus stems from the construction of a wind farm near a Trump golf course in Scotland.

“My goal is to not let any windmill be built,” Trump said this month at a White House meeting with oil executives. “They’re losers.”

Democrats have leveraged high electricity prices into an affordability message that’s translated into off-year election victories, making some Republicans nervous about the looming midterms. But Trump, after first dismissing affordability as a “hoax,” has mostly doubled-down on his existing strategy.

“We have not approved one windmill since I’ve been in office,” he told world leaders last week in Davos, “and we’re going to keep it that way.”

That’s an awkward fit with Iowa’s history. The state gets about two-thirds of its energy from wind and is the “second-largest wind power producer, after Texas,” according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In just five years — from 2019 to 2024 — wind energy went from producing 42 percent of the state’s net generation to 63 percent, the EIA found.

The wind boom came with benefits to ratepayers. In 2022 — while the rest of the country saw electricity prices start to spike, driven primarily by more expensive natural gas — gustier-than-expected winds led Iowa’s largest utility, MidAmerican Energy, to produce more wind energy than its total customer electricity demand. That directly curbed electricity prices, with MidAmerican crediting $314 million back to customers to pay down its rate base.

“It’s incredible to see the enormous amount of electricity that we’re now able to generate using renewable resources like wind and solar,” the utility’s Senior Vice President Mike Fehr said at the time. “With high natural gas prices in 2022, it couldn’t have come at a better time for our customers.”

Despite his opposition to wind power, Trump counts himself as a supporter of Iowa’s other energy industry, ethanol. The president is tentatively scheduled to visit an ethanol facility before his speech.

But that visit, too, comes with anger over the state’s other dominant renewable energy fuel source.

The state’s corn industry has become increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress from the administration and Congress in allowing a year-round E15 ethanol blend in gasoline. Last week, the House declined to include a provision in the spending bill it passed — punting instead to a rural electricity council.

“Corn growers are disgusted, disappointed and disillusioned that after spending years of calling for passage of E15, Congress has again punted, and it has done so in a spectacularly weak and offensive way,” National Corn Growers Association President Jed Bower said in a statement.

Ethanol politics also have become more fraught amid a push to build carbon pipelines across the state, connecting Iowa’s ethanol plants to underground sequestration in North Dakota.

Last year, the Republican-controlled Legislature passed a bipartisan bill to restrict eminent domain for carbon pipelines. Reynolds vetoed it, citing the need to position Iowa’s ethanol for low-carbon markets. But lawmakers are planning to try again this year.

Trump’s domestic policy legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill, preserved the 45Q tax credit that subsidizes carbon-capture projects, even as the administration canceled carbon-capture projects, mostly in states governed by Democrats.

Republicans have urged the administration not to cancel more energy funding for their own states — including in Iowa.

Since Trump’s first term, Iowa has grown less reliant on fossil fuels, with coal use as an electricity-generating source dropping sharply from 35 percent in 2020 to 21 percent in 2024, according to an EIA analysis.

That has led some Republicans to push back on Trump’s wind vendetta.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/df/7f/10b16fa24963b62d3e61d327acf6/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1345757892,N,,2026-01-27 16:00:16.966233

Trabish, Michelle No",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/solar-manufacturing-gains-momentum-in-us-but-shifting-policies-pose-challe/810339/,"The U.S. solar manufacturing and supply chain and the industry at large saw major gains in 2025, but they face an uncertain market heading into 2026.

The road to reshoring Until recently, support for U.S. solar manufacturing has been largely bipartisan, supported by trade policy and tax credits.
Limits of the current domestic supply chain Still, there’s no denying that domestic solar manufacturing is on the rise.","The U.S. solar manufacturing and supply chain and the industry at large saw major gains in 2025, but they face an uncertain market heading into 2026.

According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the U.S. can now produce “every major component of the solar supply chain” with growth across multiple categories. This included a 300% increase in solar cells and a 37% increase in solar module production, bumping capacity beyond 60 gigawatts, between the end of 2024 and late 2025.

Despite those gains, some experts say the industry is still far from supplying what the domestic market requires. And the crosswinds of sunsetting tax credits, increased eligibility thresholds and tariffs create a difficult environment for business decisions.

“You’ve seen pretty distinct growth and investment, particularly on the module side. You’ve seen more of it on the cell manufacturing side in the last five years, thanks to tax credits. But we still have a long way to go as an industry in terms of reshoring the rest of that sector,” said Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and public affairs at manufacturer Qcells.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act is among the top uncertainties that could slow momentum.

OBBBA accelerates the phase-out of the Investment Tax Credit for solar projects started after 2027 and increases content requirements for the Domestic Content Bonus. While the bill maintains the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit for solar manufacturers, it also sets new exclusions to businesses with connections to Foreign Entities of Concern.

On the other hand, Trump’s widely publicized tariffs introduce a level of market protection that may shield companies from international competition.

Experts say these conflicting political decisions are causing collateral damage to the solar industry.

“Unfortunately [OBBBA] got caught up in an ideological back and forth. People started to pick on technologies that they felt had been favored — the solar, the wind,” said Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition.

The road to reshoring

Until recently, support for U.S. solar manufacturing has been largely bipartisan, supported by trade policy and tax credits. “We are on our fourth straight presidential administration of relatively, I wouldn’t call it consistent, but generally support of using trade policy as a tool to support manufacturers,” said Moskowitz.

Trump’s first administration offered the first of such beneficial conditions via the Section 201 safeguard, imposed in 2018. This allowed the U.S. to enact temporary tariffs on a wide range of products when imports surged.

In response, Qcells made its first investment in the U.S. with the opening of a $200 million solar panel manufacturing facility in Dalton, Georgia. The facility was the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere at the time.

“It was really the kind of market protection that they felt like they had been lacking for a long time,” said Carr. “And it was enough to kind of begin to really think about what a reshoring effort could look like.”

Under President Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act established the Section 45X tax credit and expanded and extended the ITC, offering 30% credit for solar projects through 2032.

Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of solar panel manufacturer Heliene, said the credits and resultant market growth directly helped his company secure $150 million in debt financing toward its new Rogers, Minnesota manufacturing line in 2024, and other expansion projects.

However, the accelerated phase-out of the ITC and modification of 45X under OBBBA threatens the momentum of such crucial efforts to grow production capabilities.

“We took a pretty substantial hit to manufacturing when they prematurely phased out the ITC for solar, and importantly, from our perspective, the domestic content incentive that went with it,” said Carr. “It reintroduced uncertainty into a fairly certain equation.”

A three-legged stool approach

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacturers are more eager than ever to localize their production networks.

“We learned a lot as an economy during the pandemic, when supply chains were tested,” said Moskowitz. “We learned that no industry, and particularly a critical industry like energy, wants to be dependent on imported products if they don’t have to be.”

Business leaders say reversing certain tax credits while advancing tariffs has created a precarious situation.

“Tariffs are not a particularly nimble approach. It takes time for them to be effective. There’s a lot of lobbying against them,” said Carr. “And they’re often time-limited, even in their implementation. Even the [Section] 201 tariffs that started in 2018 were due to expire by 2021, right? That’s not the kind of time frame that allows for scale investments.”

Those provisions, which enabled Qcell’s $200 million investment, were ultimately extended for four years, but the shifting policy landscape remains challenging.

According to Carr, reshoring U.S. solar manufacturing demands a three-legged stool approach: tariffs for market protection, supply-side policies to enable multibillion-dollar investments and a domestic content incentive.

Chopping off one leg — by accelerating the sunset of a domestic content incentive that stimulated demand for American-made parts — forces the industry to rely on shifting tariffs and supply-side policy.

Limits of the current domestic supply chain

Still, there’s no denying that domestic solar manufacturing is on the rise. Corning’s newest hub in Michigan, which aspires to “grab up to 15% of the U.S. market for wafers” — in addition to Nextpower’s Tennessee expansion — proves that both upstream and downstream production is in demand.

But while each individual part of the solar manufacturing sector exists in the U.S., there is not enough to meet all of the current domestic demand, said Moskowitz.

Pochtaruk echoed the idea, saying the U.S. may have successfully reshored the entire solar supply chain, but “it’s far from supplying what the market requires.”

“Corning’s amazing factory is [now] in place, but it’s just starting up,” said Pochtaruk. He added that the market will still require imports to supplement production.

Corning has not confirmed the plant’s size, though some analysts approximate a 2.5GW capacity.

Experts agree that policy stability would help with growth, especially when it comes to justifying major investments that might take up to 10 years to amortize, said Pochtaruk.

Referring to Corning’s Michigan factory, he said, “What was the investment? $900 million? You invest that for a long, long time. It’s not just one four-year cycle.” Corning ultimately increased its investment to $1.5 billion, further extending the amortization timeline.

“This market takes a long time to develop, and it takes a while to build a new factory and for the sales channels to develop,” said Carr. “The biggest thing that has been tough for this industry is the on-again, off-again nature of policy support around it.”

With demand for power skyrocketing and solar widely considered the cheapest form of energy, Carr said the question isn’t whether solar-powered electricity will be in demand or desired, but how much the U.S. will contribute to its production.

“It’s going to continue to be used in our economy. It is, to a certain extent, an inevitability. What’s not inevitable is that we make it,” said Carr. “Do you want to allow reshoring? Or are you comfortable with these kinds of products being made by a sometimes hostile power, or at the very least a trade competitor? We’ve heard from policymakers on both sides of the aisle a resounding ‘no.’”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/NbD6IycL70YMGF_XnUhPPbdRNjcQcV1hsS4R_gG-G44/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UMV9FbmVyZ3kuanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-27 15:59:57.182156

An agency’s duty to engage in reasoned decision-making, and to explain in the context of a judicial challenge to its action how it has done so, is substantive in nature.
Under section 706, judicial review is confined to matters contained in the administrative record.","Courts must distinguish substantive from procedural duties in agency review to preserve reasoned decision-making.

In his recent article on reasoned decision-making, my colleague Richard J. Pierce, Jr., insightfully points out the dangers of sequential policy reversals by successive presidential administrations, which have become particularly salient in this era of extreme political polarity. Pierce also explains that courts play an important role in mitigating the adverse effects of executive branch “flip-flopping” through application of the duty to engage in reasoned decision-making and the corollary duty to explain changes in policy direction. Finally, Pierce notes the challenges of enforcing those duties when a policy reversal takes the form of direct presidential action rather than action by an agency or subordinate official.

Although I agree with Professor Pierce that a stream of sharp policy reversals on important social and economic issues bodes ill for the nation and that the courts have the authority to constrain these disruptive policy reversals, I take issue with some aspects of his description of the content of the duty to engage in reasoned decision-making.

Pierce starts by referring to Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm as the U.S. Supreme Court’s most important enunciation of a demanding version of the duty to engage in reasoned decision-making. So far, so good.

But Pierce goes astray when he traces the “modern version of the duty to engage in reasoned decision making” to judicial interpretation of the requirements for conducting informal—or notice-and-comment—rulemaking under section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), including the obligation to develop a fulsome “paper hearing” record. This attribution conflates two different sets of APA provisions. The requirements for conducting informal rulemaking, which have been interpreted by the courts to include the duty to make underlying factual data available during the public comment period and to respond in the final rule to significant public comments, are procedural in nature. An agency’s duty to engage in reasoned decision-making, and to explain in the context of a judicial challenge to its action how it has done so, is substantive in nature.

Of course, the dividing line between substance and procedure can be murky. Section 553’s mandate to accompany a final rule with a “concise general statement of basis and purpose” and the duty to provide a non-arbitrary explanation for agency action to avoid judicial reversal on the merits have the potential to overlap, even though the first is a procedural requirement and the second implicates the substantive validity of the action taken.

The Supreme Court recently contributed to the conflation of substance and procedure by characterizing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s supposed failure to respond to an obscure public comment in a Clean Air Act rulemaking, which is a procedural flaw that violates the paper hearing requirements of section 553, as an example of arbitrary and capricious decision-making, which is a substantive failure. In an earlier case, the Court made a similar mischaracterization in the opposite direction. In Encino Motorcars v. Navarro, the Court labeled the U.S. Department of Labor’s failure to explain its reversal of a previous statutory interpretation as a procedural violation.

Pierce’s melding of two different sets of APA provisions—its procedural rules of the road for rulemaking under section 553 and its provisions governing substantive judicial review under section 706 of the APA— may not matter much in this instance. He suggests that the judiciary’s recent emphasis on textualism may prompt courts to overturn cases that have interpreted the barebones language of section 553 to foist a host of unmentioned obligations on agencies conducting informal rulemaking. As Pierce points out, Justice Brett Kavanaugh is already on record favoring a more constrained interpretation of what section 553 demands.

Even if the courts eliminate the procedural paper hearing requirements, agency behavior in conducting informal rulemaking or explaining the resulting decisions may not change dramatically. Under section 706, judicial review is confined to matters contained in the administrative record. In addition, the Supreme Court’s 1943 decision in SEC v. Chenery Corporation—known as Chenery I—precludes courts from relying on any explanation other than the one the agency provided at the time of its decision.

Together, these principles encourage agencies to develop ample contemporaneous administrative records to bolster their chances of surviving challenges based on claims that they have acted in an arbitrary and capricious fashion. Agencies will not be able to fill in gaps in a scant administrative record with information or rationales developed after the fact.

Of course, if the Supreme Court reverts to a weak version of arbitrary and capricious review, such as by overruling State Farm—a possibility raised by Professor Pierce—then agencies may have less to fear if they rely on skimpy records and explanations. Some upcoming tests of the vibrancy of judicial application of the duty to explain policy reversal are likely to come if the Trump Administration finalizes its proposals to repeal the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service’s roadless rule and the Bureau of Land Management’s public lands rule. In both cases, the justifications in the proposed regulatory preambles for reversing course were remarkably thin.

The Court has provided conflicting recent signals in this regard. On the one hand, it applied a rigorous version of arbitrary and capricious review in invalidating the Clean Air Act rulemaking referred to in Ohio v. EPA. On the other hand, in narrowly construing the scope of agency duties under the National Environmental Policy Act in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, Justice Kavanaugh declared that “the central principle of judicial review in NEPA cases is deference.” He added that courts should “afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.”

Still, I urge Pierce—and others, including the courts—to recognize the difference between the substantive and procedural aspects of administrative law. After all, the APA includes two separate provisions governing the procedures that agencies must use in conducting rulemaking or adjudication and that courts must use in reviewing challenges to those endeavors. In addition, section 706 of the APA sets different standards for substantive review—under the arbitrary and capricious or substantial evidence tests—and for review of agency actions alleged to have been taken “without observance of procedure required by law.”

One more aspect of Pierce’s article deserves mention. Pierce notes that because recent Presidents have more regularly taken direct action themselves rather than pursuing their policy objectives through agency officials, it is important for the Supreme Court to apply “a robust version of the duty to engage in reasoned decision-making on the president.” Easier said than done. To the extent that the duty derives from the APA’s arbitrary and capricious standard, the duty does not apply to the President, who, under the Supreme Court’s decision in Franklin v. Massachusetts, is not subject to the APA. Furthermore, the Court stated in Dalton v. Specter that judicial review of an alleged statutory violation “is not available when the statute in question commits the decision to the discretion of the President.”

Still, there may be avenues for reviewing presidential reasoning supporting actions taken under statutorily designated authority, including in cases in which statutes authorize emergency presidential action. In Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that Dalton’s preclusion of review does not apply when statutes deprive the President of discretionary authority or “places discernible limits on the President’s discretion.” The D.C. Circuit found it “untenable to conclude that there are no judicially enforceable limitations on presidential actions, besides actions that run afoul of the Constitution or which contravene direct statutory prohibitions, so long as the President claims that he is acting pursuant to” statutory authority. That result, the court reasoned, “would permit the President to bypass scores of statutory limitations on governmental authority, and we therefore reject it.”

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit likewise concluded in a suit involving a challenge to a presidential designation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act that “judicial review in such instances does not implicate separation of powers concerns to the same degree as where the statute did ‘not at all limit’ the discretion of the President.” Review is therefore available “to ensure that the Proclamations are consistent with constitutional principles and that the President has not exceeded his statutory authority.” Most recently, a federal court in Maryland concluded that it had “the authority to determine whether the [two] Executive Orders are incompatible with the will of Congress,” and found in that case that they were.

It is a basic principle of administrative law that courts may review whether an agency, or the president, has exceeded applicable statutory authority and thus acted ultra vires, as well as whether an agency, or the President, has exercised delegated discretion in a non-arbitrary fashion. Yet, the case law that developed under “step two” of the now-defunct doctrine established by the Supreme Court in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, which required courts to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes, shows that these two inquiries can overlap with one another, just as the dividing line between substance and procedure can be difficult to pinpoint.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Glicksman1.27.2026-2178738269.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 14:00:16.502575

A tax credit is different from a tax deduction, which lowers the amount of an individual's taxable income. Tax credits are often more valuable compared to deductions because they directly reduce your tax bill, dollar-for-dollar.

Tax credits can be nonrefundable, refundable or partially refundable. Here's what to know when filing your taxes this year:

What is a tax credit?

A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar amount an individual can directly subtract from their tax return to reduce the tax they owe. This can lower the total tax payment or increase the refund amount.

Tax credits are more favorable than tax deductions because they reduce the tax due, not just the amount of taxable income, according to Investopedia.

Tax credits are available for a variety of expenses, including purchasing health insurance through the marketplace, paying for higher education and covering childcare costs.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases and energy‑efficient home upgrades are no longer available for 2026, after their eligibility deadlines passed in late 2025, according to NerdWallet.

How do refundable tax credits work?

Refundable credits are paid out in full, and a taxpayer also gets a refund for any remaining credit that's still available. Some taxpayers who aren't required to file may still want to do so to claim refundable tax credits.

There are several types of refundable tax credits, such as the Premium Tax Credit, which helps individuals and families cover the cost of health insurance premiums purchased through the health insurance marketplace.

The Earned Income Tax Credit is for low‑ to moderate‑income workers who meet eligibility rules based on income and family size.

For 2026, the IRS increased maximum earned income tax credit amounts to:

Up to $664 for workers without children.

Up to $4,427 for those with one qualifying child.

Up to $7,316 for those with two qualifying children.

Up to $8,231 for those with three or more qualifying children.

How do nonrefundable tax credits work?

For nonrefundable tax credits, once a taxpayer's amount owed reaches zero, they won't see any leftover amount as a refund.

Some nonrefundable tax credits must be used in the year they are claimed and expire if unused, according to Investopedia. Others, such as the Adoption Credit, may be carried forward to future years.

Nonrefundable tax credits can negatively impact low-income taxpayers because they cannot use the entire amount of the credit.

How do partially refundable credits work?

Some types of credits are partially refundable. One example is the American Opportunity Tax Credit for postsecondary education students.

Under this credit, if a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to zero before using the entire $2,500 credit, the remaining portion may be taken as a refundable credit up to the lesser of 40% of the remaining credit or $1,000, according to Investopedia.",https://www.floridarealtors.org/sites/default/files/page/image/2019-12/gettyimages-1006671124.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 12:28:38.690333

The jump in the price of natural gas, which is used in about 60% of American homes for heat or to power major appliances, comes as nearly half of all states declared winter weather emergencies and sub-freezing temperatures spread across the country.

The increase has occurred primarily in the price of near-term contracts, while gas for deliveries in March and April were up only slightly on Monday.

The benchmark contract at the Henry Hub in Louisiana for gas delivered in February settled at $6.806 per million btu, the highest price since December 2022, and an increase of 131% during the last week. The price of natural gas for March delivery settled at $3.901 per million btu, up by 8.8% from the week prior.

Phil Flynn, an analyst at the Price Futures Group, said winter gas demand in late January is at its peak, while freeze-offs caused by extreme cold in major producing states are reducing supply, putting pressure on pipelines and power grids across the country.

“These volatile price movements are directly tied to escalating heating needs, massive, expected storage withdrawals and production setbacks from freeze-offs,” said Flynn.

According to financial firm LSEG, U.S. gas production hit a two-year low 92.6 billion cubic feet on Sunday, mostly due to frozen wells, but output is expected to rise to 95.5 billion cubic feet on Monday.

This compares with a recent high of 110.0 billion cubic feet of gas produced on Jan. 12, and an all-time daily high 111.2 billion cubic feet on Dec. 21.

In addition to unseasonably cold temperatures, analysts say the rapid increase in LNG exports in recent years is another factor behind the short-term increase in the price of natural gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, an agency within the Department of Energy, estimates U.S. exports of LNG will average 16.3 billion cubic feet per day in 2026.

Supplies of natural gas over the medium- and long-term are seen as adequate.

Winter Storm Fern's impact is likely to catalyse significant changes in energy infrastructure investment priorities, regulatory frameworks, and technology adoption patterns.
Furthermore, the renewable energy transition must consider resilience factors alongside decarbonisation goals to ensure reliable energy supply during extreme weather events.
However, winter storm Fern impact on US energy markets demonstrated that current preparation levels remain inadequate for extreme scenarios.","How Does Extreme Weather Expose Critical Vulnerabilities in US Energy Infrastructure?

Winter Storm Fern's devastating impact on American energy systems revealed fundamental weaknesses that extend far beyond temporary weather disruptions. The crisis demonstrated how interconnected vulnerabilities across multiple energy sectors can cascade into systemic failures, exposing the fragility of infrastructure designed for normal operating conditions rather than extreme weather events. This comprehensive analysis of winter storm Fern impact on US energy markets provides crucial insights into the vulnerabilities of modern energy infrastructure.

The Structural Fragility of America's Energy Grid

Modern energy infrastructure operates as an interconnected web where disruptions in one sector trigger failures across others. During Winter Storm Fern, this interconnectedness became a liability rather than a strength, as production losses cascaded through the entire energy supply chain.

The scale of infrastructure failure during the storm was unprecedented in recent memory. Electricity markets experienced extraordinary price volatility, with day-ahead prices in the PJM Interconnection reaching $638 per megawatt-hour, representing a staggering 550% increase from normal winter levels.

This surge marked the highest electricity prices recorded since 2014, while New York markets saw even more extreme spikes to $680 per megawatt-hour. Furthermore, the US oil production decline highlighted broader structural issues facing domestic energy production.

Energy Sector Impact Magnitude Recovery Timeframe Oil Production 2 million barrels/day curtailed 7-10 days Natural Gas Output 10+ billion cubic feet/day reduction 5-7 days Electricity Generation 550% price spike in PJM region 7 consecutive days Port Operations 57% reduction in Gulf Coast loadings 4-6 days

Multi-Commodity Supply Chain Interdependencies

The storm revealed how natural gas production shut-ins create ripple effects throughout electricity generation systems. When wellhead freeze-offs reduced gas supply by more than 10 billion cubic feet daily, power generators faced immediate fuel constraints during peak heating demand periods.

North Dakota's Bakken Basin provided a stark example of upstream vulnerability. Production cuts of 100,000 to 110,000 barrels per day represented approximately 10% of the state's total output, caused entirely by freeze-offs at wellhead facilities. These failures occurred despite winterization efforts implemented following previous extreme weather events.

Transportation bottlenecks amplified regional price disparities as the storm progressed. Gulf Coast ports in Texas and Louisiana managed to load only 6 million barrels of crude between January 24-27, compared to the December 2025 average of 3.8 million barrels per day.

This 57% reduction in export capacity created immediate supply constraints for international markets while domestic inventories accumulated. In addition, critical minerals in the energy transition became increasingly important for building resilient infrastructure.

The crisis exposed critical gaps in cross-sector resilience planning. Unlike single-point failures that can be isolated and contained, Winter Storm Fern's impact demonstrated how weather-related disruptions propagate through interconnected energy systems, creating compound effects that exceed the sum of individual sector impacts.

What Economic Forces Drive Energy Market Resilience During Supply Shocks?

Despite production curtailments equivalent to 15% of national oil output, energy markets displayed surprising resilience through sophisticated price discovery mechanisms and inventory management systems. Understanding these stabilising forces provides insight into how modern energy markets absorb extreme supply disruptions without triggering proportional price escalations.

Price Discovery Mechanisms Under Stress

Oil markets demonstrated remarkable stability during the crisis, with Brent crude remaining near $66 per barrel despite massive production losses. This price resilience reflected the operation of multiple market mechanisms that helped absorb the supply shock without triggering panic-driven price escalations.

The oil price forecast analysis suggests that markets had already factored in potential weather-related disruptions. Moreover, forward market positioning, strategic inventory buffers, and market expectations of rapid supply recovery combined to prevent severe price escalation during the acute shortage period.

Natural gas markets showed more dramatic price responses, reflecting the commodity's limited storage capacity and immediate demand-supply balance requirements. Henry Hub futures reached $6.80 per MMBtu on Monday, representing a three-year high, before moderating to $6.55 per MMBtu by Tuesday.

The rapid price retreat suggested market confidence in supply restoration within days rather than weeks. The futures curve revealed sophisticated market expectations about recovery timing, with a $3.00 per MMBtu spread between February and March contracts indicating traders expected supply constraints to resolve within 4-6 weeks.

Regional Market Segmentation Effects

Geographic price differentials during the storm highlighted how transmission constraints create submarkets within national energy systems. The PJM Interconnection's $638 per megawatt-hour electricity prices compared to New York's $680 per megawatt-hour reflected varying degrees of supply stress and transmission capacity between regional grids.

These price disparities created arbitrage opportunities for market participants with flexible delivery capabilities, while revealing the limitations of physical infrastructure to balance supply and demand across regions during extreme events. However, US natural gas forecast models may need to incorporate more frequent extreme weather scenarios.

Demand Elasticity Under Extreme Conditions

Heating demand surged to 156 billion cubic feet per day during the storm week, compared to the five-year January average of 137 bcf per day. This 13.8% increase in demand coincided with supply disruptions, creating the perfect conditions for price volatility.

Industrial demand response programmes activated automatically as electricity prices reached extreme levels, with energy-intensive manufacturers curtailing operations to avoid peak pricing exposure. This demand flexibility helped prevent even more severe price spikes by reducing total system load during critical periods.

How Do Weather Events Reshape Energy Investment Priorities?

Winter Storm Fern's impact has triggered fundamental reassessment of infrastructure investment priorities across the energy sector. The scale of production losses and price volatility demonstrated that current winterization efforts remain inadequate for extreme weather scenarios, driving new capital allocation toward resilience rather than pure capacity expansion.

Infrastructure Hardening Economics

The storm's economic impact provides compelling justification for increased winterization investments. With 2 million barrels per day of oil production curtailed at $66 per barrel for seven days, the immediate production loss exceeded $920 million.

Natural gas curtailments added approximately $455 million in lost production value, creating total weekly losses exceeding $1.38 billion. Furthermore, these losses underscore the importance of robust energy security strategies that can withstand extreme weather events.

Winterisation Investment Category Estimated Cost Range Payback Period Wellhead freeze protection systems $10,000-50,000 per well 2-3 extreme weather events Pipeline insulation and heating $1-5 million per mile 5-7 years Compressor station cold-weather upgrades $5-25 million per facility 3-5 years Power generation dual-fuel capability $50-200 million per plant 7-10 years

Equipment-specific vulnerabilities identified during the storm provide clear targets for infrastructure improvements. Wellhead freeze-offs emerged as the primary production loss mechanism, particularly in the Bakken Basin where temperatures overwhelmed existing protection systems.

Compressor station failures created cascade effects throughout natural gas distribution networks, as these critical facilities could not maintain pressure during extreme cold conditions. Pipeline capacity constraints further amplified supply disruptions when transport infrastructure could not accommodate alternative routing around affected areas.

Strategic Reserve Utilisation Patterns

Emergency fuel switching capabilities proved crucial for maintaining electricity generation during natural gas supply constraints. Power plants with dual-fuel capacity activated backup systems using stored oil products, preventing even more severe electricity shortages.

The crisis highlighted the value of strategic fuel inventories positioned near critical infrastructure. Facilities with on-site storage capabilities maintained operations longer than those dependent on just-in-time delivery systems, demonstrating the importance of inventory buffers for extreme weather resilience.

Market Structure Evolution Post-Crisis

Regulatory authorities activated emergency protocols that waived certain environmental restrictions and expedited fuel transportation permits. The Department of Energy's emergency authorities enabled rapid response coordination, while grid operators implemented demand response programmes to manage peak loads.

These emergency measures revealed both the flexibility and limitations of existing market structures. While authorities could temporarily modify regulations to address immediate crises, the underlying infrastructure vulnerabilities require longer-term structural solutions.

What Are the Broader Macroeconomic Implications of Energy Supply Volatility?

Energy price volatility during extreme weather events creates ripple effects throughout the broader economy, impacting everything from manufacturing costs to household budgets. Winter Storm Fern's economic implications extended far beyond energy sector losses, affecting economic activity across multiple industries and regions.

GDP Impact Modelling from Energy Disruptions

Electricity price escalations of 1,400-1,900% above normal winter levels created immediate cost pressures for energy-intensive industries. Manufacturing facilities in the PJM Interconnection region faced unprecedented input cost increases, with some operations suspending production to avoid exposure to peak wholesale prices.

Quantifiable Weekly Economic Impact:

• Oil production losses: $924 million (2 million b/d × 7 days × $66/barrel)

• Natural gas production losses: $455 million (10 bcf/d × 7 days × $6.55/MMBtu)

• Electricity cost escalation: Regional industrial sectors facing 14-19x normal power costs

• Total measurable impact: $1.38+ billion in direct energy production losses

According to Bank of America's analysis, the winter storm Fern impact on US energy markets could significantly affect first-quarter economic growth projections.

Inflation Transmission Mechanisms

Natural gas price spikes translate directly to heating costs for residential and commercial customers, with spot market exposure varying by utility contract structure. The 60-130% increase in heating costs during peak demand periods placed significant burden on household budgets across cold-weather regions.

Transportation fuel costs escalated during port loading disruptions, adding 2-5% to logistics expenses for goods movement throughout the affected regions. These cost increases typically propagate through supply chains over 4-6 weeks following the initial disruption.

Financial Market Responses to Energy Volatility

Market participants recognised that weather-related production cuts are typically temporary, with rapid recovery expected once normal temperatures return. The temporary nature of weather disruptions limits their impact on long-term company valuations, despite massive supply disruptions.

Commodity futures markets displayed sophisticated risk pricing, with natural gas futures showing extreme volatility while oil futures remained relatively stable. This divergence reflected the different storage capabilities and demand elasticity characteristics of each commodity.

Insurance sector exposure became apparent as claims mounted from frozen equipment and business interruption losses. Energy infrastructure insurance rates typically increase following major weather events as insurers reassess risk models and coverage terms.

How Does Geopolitical Context Amplify Domestic Energy Vulnerabilities?

Winter Storm Fern's domestic energy disruptions occurred against a backdrop of complex international energy relationships that limited alternative supply options. Existing sanctions regimes and trade restrictions reduced the flexibility to compensate for domestic production losses through increased imports.

Strategic Resource Security During Crisis

Import dependency risks became apparent when domestic production cuts could not be immediately offset through increased foreign supplies. Sanctions on Russian energy imports, while strategically important, limited alternative supply sources during the domestic shortage period.

The crisis highlighted the timing challenges in activating alternative supply sources. LNG cargoes require 2-3 weeks lead time for delivery, while pipeline imports face capacity constraints during peak demand periods. These logistical realities emphasise the importance of domestic production reliability.

Sanctions Regime Interactions with Market Dynamics

Existing restrictions on Venezuelan oil market participation limited supply flexibility during the domestic production disruption. Chinese refiners reportedly paused Venezuelan crude purchases due to political uncertainties, further constraining alternative supply activation.

Middle Eastern suppliers faced their own seasonal demand peaks, limiting their ability to provide additional volumes to US markets during the crisis period. This timing coincidence demonstrates how global energy markets can become constrained when multiple regions face simultaneous supply or demand pressures.

Alliance Energy Cooperation Frameworks

Emergency fuel sharing agreements with allied nations provided limited relief due to transportation and infrastructure constraints. While cooperation frameworks exist, the physical realities of energy logistics limit their effectiveness during acute shortage periods.

Strategic coordination with major consuming nations helped prevent competitive bidding for scarce supplies, but the fundamental shortage required domestic production recovery rather than import solutions.

What Long-Term Structural Changes Could Emerge from Weather-Driven Energy Crises?

Winter Storm Fern's impact is likely to catalyse significant changes in energy infrastructure investment priorities, regulatory frameworks, and technology adoption patterns. The crisis demonstrated that current approaches to weather resilience remain inadequate for extreme events that are becoming more frequent and severe.

Technology Adoption Acceleration

Distributed generation investment is expected to accelerate following grid reliability concerns exposed during the storm. Businesses and institutions recognise that on-site power generation provides protection against regional grid failures and extreme wholesale price exposure.

Energy storage deployment for supply security enhancement represents a growing investment priority. Battery systems and other storage technologies can provide backup power during grid disruptions while helping manage demand during peak pricing periods.

Smart grid technologies for demand response optimisation showed their value during the crisis, enabling automated load reduction when electricity prices reached extreme levels. These systems will likely see expanded deployment as utilities seek more sophisticated demand management capabilities.

Furthermore, the renewable energy transition must consider resilience factors alongside decarbonisation goals to ensure reliable energy supply during extreme weather events.

Regulatory Framework Evolution

Mandatory winterisation standards are expected to evolve following repeated infrastructure failures during extreme weather events. Current voluntary guidelines have proven insufficient for protecting critical energy infrastructure during severe cold conditions.

Emergency response protocol standardisation across regions could improve coordination during multi-state energy crises. The storm revealed gaps in cross-border cooperation and resource sharing that hampered response effectiveness, as highlighted by experts studying grid vulnerabilities.

Market design modifications for extreme weather resilience may include capacity payments for winterised equipment and performance penalties for facilities that fail during emergency conditions.

Investment Capital Reallocation Patterns

Investment Priority Pre-Storm Allocation Post-Storm Trend Capacity expansion 70% 50% Weather hardening 15% 35% Backup systems 10% 12% Smart grid technology 5% 8%

Infrastructure hardening versus capacity expansion trade-offs are shifting toward resilience investments. Companies recognise that additional capacity provides limited value if weather events can disable large portions of existing infrastructure.

Regional investment flows are redirecting toward weather-resilient assets in areas prone to extreme weather events. This geographic reallocation reflects growing awareness of climate-related infrastructure risks.

ESG considerations in energy infrastructure development increasingly emphasise climate adaptation and resilience rather than solely focusing on emissions reduction. Investors recognise that infrastructure vulnerability to weather events creates significant financial risks.

FAQ: Understanding Energy Market Dynamics During Extreme Weather

Why didn't oil prices surge more dramatically despite massive production cuts?

Strategic inventory levels, forward market positioning, and expectations of rapid supply recovery helped absorb the immediate supply shock. Oil markets have sophisticated mechanisms for managing temporary disruptions that distinguish them from longer-term supply constraints.

How do electricity markets handle extreme demand spikes?

Regional grid operators activate emergency protocols including demand response programmes, emergency generation capacity, and load shedding procedures. Price signals encourage demand reduction while emergency authorities can waive certain regulations to secure additional supply.

What makes natural gas infrastructure particularly vulnerable to cold weather?

Natural gas systems face multiple cold-weather vulnerabilities including wellhead freeze-offs, compressor station failures, and pipeline capacity constraints. Unlike oil, natural gas has limited storage capability, making supply disruptions immediately apparent in pricing.

How do energy companies prepare for extreme weather events?

Preparation includes winterisation investments, emergency response planning, strategic inventory positioning, and backup fuel arrangements. However, winter storm Fern impact on US energy markets demonstrated that current preparation levels remain inadequate for extreme scenarios.

What role do government agencies play during energy emergencies?

Federal authorities can waive environmental regulations, coordinate emergency fuel supplies, activate strategic reserves, and facilitate interstate cooperation. The Department of Energy's emergency authorities proved crucial for response coordination during Winter Storm Fern.

By improving our energy policies to reflect business desires, companies seeking clean, affordable power will invest, expand and innovate in Ohio.
In Greater Cleveland, our companies have a strong demand for clean energy, spending tens of millions of dollars each year on renewable energy credits (RECs).
Across the country, rural Republican districts are experiencing some of the greatest job growth and tax-revenue gains from renewable energy projects.
Furthermore, renewable energy development creates jobs across construction, engineering, advanced manufacturing and long-term operations.","Famous Ohio inventor Charles F. Kettering once credited his forward-looking perspective for his prolific career. “My interest is in the future,” he said, “because I am going to spend the rest of my life there.”

The most successful businesses operate the same way. And as executives look forward, the one issue that hums around every strategy session and board meeting is access to affordable, reliable, and increasingly clean energy. Ohio businesses want to invest here and are eager for solutions.

Roughly half of all Fortune 500 companies now have renewable energy or sustainability commitments. For many of them, those commitments are now embedded in capital allocation decisions, site selection, and long-term cost planning. When these companies decide where to expand, where to build, or where to relocate, access to clean, affordable power is no longer a “nice to have.” It is a requirement and thus also a business opportunity.

States that align with these needs are attracting growth, and Ohio is well-positioned to do the same with the right policies.

Ohio’s skilled workforce, manufacturing strength, and central location position the state well for continued growth. By improving our energy policies to reflect business desires, companies seeking clean, affordable power will invest, expand and innovate in Ohio.

In Greater Cleveland, our companies have a strong demand for clean energy, spending tens of millions of dollars each year on renewable energy credits (RECs). Today, those millions of megawatt-hours are sourced from other states because Ohio’s current policies make it difficult to meet locally. With the right conditions, that investment could be captured at home, fueling in-state renewable projects, creating jobs, supporting landowners, and strengthening local communities. Scaled across Ohio, this opportunity reaches well into the hundreds of millions annually.

There are lessons we could learn from other states.

Indiana is attracting large-scale solar investment and outpacing Ohio in Midwest clean-energy competitiveness; Iowa generates more than 60% percent of its electricity from wind and solar; and Texas is the top state for renewable energy development. Across the country, rural Republican districts are experiencing some of the greatest job growth and tax-revenue gains from renewable energy projects.

But here in Ohio, we’re falling behind, and it is already costing real investment.

Fortunately, we have begun moving in the right direction. The bipartisan passage of Ohio House Bill 15 marked a meaningful step toward modernizing our energy policy by rolling back outdated subsidies and signaling that Ohio is serious about competitiveness, affordability, and reliability. While no single bill solves everything, HB 15 created important momentum and demonstrated that progress is possible when policymakers focus on Ohio’s long-term economic future. Now is the time to build on that foundation and keep moving forward.

But the tech companies are also looking for other forms of clean energy. Meta recently announced an investment to support Vistra’s nuclear facilities on Lake Erie here in Greater Cleveland, signaling strong corporate demand for reliable, carbon-free energy and the economic potential that comes with it.

When renewable projects do advance in Ohio, communities feel clear and tangible benefits. In Brown County, for example, from one solar project, landowners received substantial proceeds and the project payments accounted for 11% of the county’s 2024 budget. Furthermore, renewable energy development creates jobs across construction, engineering, advanced manufacturing and long-term operations.

This success could be replicated across the state. Ohio’s ability to compete depends on an “all of the above” energy strategy that is affordable and reliable, with carbon-free generation as an essential part of the mix. Across Ohio, business leaders are increasingly aligned around a common set of priorities to meet rising demand and keep the state competitive: preserving customer choice in a market-based energy system, investing in transmission infrastructure, controlling costs while improving reliability, and removing regulatory barriers that limit in-state generation. These principles are shared by organizations like the Greater Cleveland Partnership and the Ohio Business Energy Partnership and reflect what employers across the state need to grow, invest and create jobs in Ohio.

The bulk of the impairment—approximately $6.1 billion—is tied directly to the North American EV segment.
In the short term, investors can expect GM to report robust ""EBIT-Adjusted"" profits, projected between $13 billion and $15 billion for 2026.
However, if a future administration restores EV mandates, GM may find itself lagging behind global competitors who stayed the course on pure electrification.
Final Assessment for Investors The $7.2 billion charge taken by General Motors marks the official transition from the ""Visionary"" phase of the EV era to the ""Pragmatic"" phase.","On January 27, 2026, General Motors (NYSE: GM) signaled a definitive end to the ""all-in"" electric vehicle era that had defined its corporate strategy for the previous half-decade. In a sweeping fourth-quarter earnings report, the Detroit giant announced a massive $7.2 billion special charge related to a strategic ""realignment"" of its EV operations and a restructuring of its presence in China. The immediate financial impact was stark, as the company reported a $3.3 billion net loss for the final quarter of 2025, driven largely by the costs of scaling back manufacturing capacity and canceling underperforming product lines.

However, the market's reaction was tempered by a aggressive shift in capital allocation. Alongside the multi-billion dollar write-down, GM management authorized a new $6.0 billion share repurchase program and a 20% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.18 per share. This ""pivot to profit"" underscores a new reality for the American automotive industry: while electrification remains a long-term goal, the immediate priority has shifted back to the high-margin, internal combustion engine (ICE) and hybrid vehicles that currently bankroll the transition.

The Cost of Realignment

The $7.2 billion charge announced by General Motors represents one of the largest strategic pivots in the company's 117-year history. The bulk of the impairment—approximately $6.1 billion—is tied directly to the North American EV segment. This includes $1.8 billion in non-cash asset write-downs for specialized EV assembly lines that will now be idled or converted to ""flexible"" production, and $4.3 billion in cash-related costs. These cash costs include hefty contract termination fees for battery suppliers and the scrubbing of several mid-tier electric SUV programs that were deemed no longer viable in the current market.

The remaining $1.1 billion of the charge is attributed to a painful restructuring of GM’s long-standing joint venture in China with SAIC. Once a cornerstone of GM’s global profits, the Chinese market has become increasingly hostile for foreign legacy automakers as local brands dominate the affordable EV space. GM’s move to write down these assets follows a trend of ""onshoring"" production back to the United States, a strategy punctuated by the company's decision to move production of the Buick Envision from China to North American facilities to avoid rising trade tensions and tariffs.

CEO Mary Barra, who once famously pledged that GM would go ""all-electric by 2035,"" framed the announcement as a necessary ""recalibration"" during the company's January 27th earnings call. Barra pointed to a ""dynamic"" regulatory environment and a shift in consumer behavior as the primary catalysts for the move. By taking the hit now, GM aims to clean up its balance sheet and focus on its most profitable segments: the Chevrolet Silverado, the GMC Sierra, and the Cadillac Escalade.

Winners and Losers in the Pivot to Pragmatism

The primary ""winners"" in this strategic shift are legacy GM shareholders, who are seeing a massive return of capital despite the quarterly loss. By reducing its total share count—which has fallen from 1.2 billion in 2023 to roughly 904 million by the end of 2025—GM is artificially boosting its earnings per share (EPS) for the coming years. Similarly, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) stands to benefit from a more rationalized competitive landscape; Ford took its own $19.5 billion ""cleansing"" charge in late 2025, and both companies are now aligned in prioritizing hybrid technology over pure-play battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

Conversely, pure-play EV manufacturers are facing a brutal 2026. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been particularly hard hit by the regulatory fallout that accompanied GM's pivot. The termination of the ""inter-manufacturer credit trading system""—a mechanism that allowed Tesla to sell billions in regulatory credits to companies like GM—has stripped the company of a high-margin revenue stream. Furthermore, the expiration of federal EV tax credits in late 2025 has put immense pressure on companies like Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID), which lack the profitable gasoline-powered portfolios that GM and Ford are now leaning on for survival.

The losers also include the global battery supply chain. GM's cancellation of specific product programs and the $4.3 billion in termination fees suggest that battery demand is significantly lower than projected three years ago. Companies that invested heavily in North American lithium-ion gigafactories are now facing ""demand air pockets"" that may take years to fill.

A Broader Shift in the Industrial Landscape

GM’s $7.2 billion charge is not an isolated event but rather a symptom of a broader tectonic shift in U.S. industrial policy and consumer reality. The enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July 2025 served as the death knell for the previous administration’s EV mandates. By replacing EV-specific tax credits with a universal auto loan interest deduction, the federal government effectively removed the ""thumb on the scale"" for electric vehicles, allowing consumer demand to dictate the pace of the transition.

Furthermore, the recent rollbacks of EPA and NHTSA standards have removed the legal threat of massive fines that previously forced automakers to push EVs into a reluctant market. The ""SAFE III"" rule, proposed in December 2025, significantly lowered fuel economy requirements, giving GM and its peers the ""regulatory breathing room"" to extend the life cycles of their high-margin V-8 and hybrid powertrains. Historically, this mirrors the early 2000s, when a similar softening of standards led to the ""SUV boom""—a period of intense profitability for Detroit that was eventually interrupted by the 2008 financial crisis.

The pivot also highlights the collapse of the ""California Waiver,"" which previously allowed the state to set its own more stringent emissions rules. With the federal government revoking this waiver in 2025, GM is no longer required to manage two separate national fleets, leading to massive logistical and manufacturing efficiencies that the company is now trying to capture through its $6 billion buyback program.

What Lies Ahead: The Era of Flexible Manufacturing

Looking forward, GM’s strategy for 2026 and beyond is built on ""flexible manufacturing."" The company has guided for a modest 300,000 EVs in 2026—a far cry from its previous million-unit ambitions—while focusing heavily on ""Extended-Range Electric Vehicles"" (EREVs) and traditional hybrids. This approach allows the company to scale production based on real-time consumer demand rather than regulatory mandates.

In the short term, investors can expect GM to report robust ""EBIT-Adjusted"" profits, projected between $13 billion and $15 billion for 2026. The challenge will be managing the ""messy middle"" of the transition. If gas prices remain relatively low and interest rates stabilize, GM’s focus on high-margin trucks and generous shareholder returns could lead to a significant re-rating of its stock. However, if a future administration restores EV mandates, GM may find itself lagging behind global competitors who stayed the course on pure electrification.

Final Assessment for Investors

The $7.2 billion charge taken by General Motors marks the official transition from the ""Visionary"" phase of the EV era to the ""Pragmatic"" phase. GM has effectively admitted that its 2021 roadmaps were overly optimistic, but in doing so, it has cleared the path for a massive return of capital to its owners. For the market, this move signals that ""growth at any cost"" in the EV space is over; profitability and cash flow are once again the primary metrics of success in the automotive sector.

Investors should watch for the margin performance of GM’s new hybrid lineup and the pace of its share repurchases. While the $3.3 billion loss in Q4 2025 looks ugly on paper, it is likely the ""big bath"" that sets the stage for a leaner, more profitable GM in the late 2020s. The Detroit giant is betting that the road to the future isn't paved just with batteries, but with the cash generated by the legendary internal combustion engines of the present.

Over the next 25 years, electricity demand is projected to climb by more than 50%, fueled by the widespread electrification of industries, transportation, and daily life.

This surge in demand signals exciting progress, but it also raises an urgent question: Can the nation's aging power grid keep up? A compelling October 2025 visual report from ELSCO Transformers highlights both the incredible potential of this electric future and the infrastructure challenges we must address to get there.

From data centers and EV charging stations to clean energy initiatives, America's growing appetite for electricity is driving conversations about infrastructure investment and planning.

AI Alone Could Break the Grid

One of the biggest drivers of this new demand? Artificial intelligence. While AI is revolutionizing industries and boosting productivity across the board, it's also becoming a major energy consumer. Each server request can require four to five watt-hours of electricity, a small number on its own, but when multiplied by billions of daily interactions, the impact quickly scales.

In fact, AI-related server usage is expected to consume 15 million megawatt-hours annually by 2027, enough to power millions of American homes every year. This rapid growth underscores the urgent need to build a grid that can keep pace with innovation.

Much of the US Grid Is Decades Past Its Prime

Part of the challenge lies in the age of the infrastructure itself. According to the report, nearly 70% of power transformers and transmission lines are more than 25 years old and rapidly approaching the end of their usable life.

Much of the U.S. grid was originally designed in the 1950s through the 1970s, long before today's energy demands were even imaginable.

Now, with more than 60,000 miles of transmission lines already running at full capacity, the system is stretched thin, raising questions about the need for upgrades.

Fixing It Could Cost $5T, But Inaction Will Cost More

Looking ahead, meeting the projected demand of 5,178 terawatt-hours by 2050 will require more than just innovation; it will require massive investment.

The cost of replacing and upgrading the nation's power infrastructure is estimated at a staggering $5 trillion, driven by rising material prices, supply chain pressures, and long lead times for essential components like transformers.

It's a daunting figure, but it's one that reflects the scale of transformation needed to build a grid capable of powering the next generation.

Interconnection Queues Are a Major Bottleneck

Even promising solutions like renewable energy, often seen as the key to a cleaner, more sustainable future, are facing significant hurdles. Despite widespread support, nearly 80% of proposed power generation projects are being delayed or canceled due to interconnection queue bottlenecks and regulatory backlogs.

These slowdowns are preventing clean energy from reaching the grid at the pace required, underscoring the need for streamlined processes and faster approvals if we're serious about meeting tomorrow's energy demands.

Industry Recommendations

To meet these challenges head-on, the report outlines a three-pronged strategy for building a more resilient and future-ready grid:

Diversify energy sources: Industry proposals include quadrupling the share of federally sourced renewable energy by 2035, reducing reliance on aging fossil-fuel infrastructure.

Accelerate interconnection: The report recommends doubling the speed at which new energy projects, especially renewables, are connected to the grid, cutting through red tape and backlogs.

Streamline equipment manufacturing: Another proposal involves prioritizing high-availability components with faster production, shorter shipping times, and long-term warranties to minimize delays and downtime.

These proposals represent one practical roadmap for powering America's electric future sustainably, securely, and at scale.

The bottom line? The U.S. doesn't have an energy shortage; it has an infrastructure bottleneck. With 2.6 terawatt-hours of generation capacity currently sitting idle due to outdated systems and regulatory delays, the potential is already there.

We are still seeing significant clean energy development, distributed energy resources, all of these things are moving forward.
The energy transition is still underway, but the whiplash has very serious implications for our economy and for the investment culture of America.","Three weeks after the Nov. 5, 2024, election that ushered President Donald Trump back into power, Sanya Carley, the faculty director of the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, and co-author of the book Power Lines: The Human Costs of American Energy in Transition, penned an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer with a series of predictions that proved to be prophetic.

On his campaign promise to “drill, baby, drill,” she forecasted, “President Trump will prioritize executive orders — likely in his first few days in office — that open more federal lands to oil and gas leasing and reduce the permitting and other regulatory requirements associated with drilling and extraction operations.”

In a matter of months, that came true, as did her premonition that Trump would “introduce an executive order early in his term seeking to slow or delay the permitting process for offshore wind projects,” and eliminate the Biden-era Justice40 initiative that sought to ensure 40% of federal climate investments go to communities overburdened by pollution.

The months that followed have been marked by a slew of attacks on renewable energy from all angles and across multiple agencies and branches of government. A year into Trump’s second presidency, Capital & Main caught up with Carley to discuss what’s happened, her predictions and how they’ve played out. A scholar of energy justice and the energy transition, Carley said the whiplash of the last year has undoubtedly hurt consumers and decarbonization efforts alike. But, she said, she’s certain “The energy transition is still underway.”

This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Capital & Main: Before we discuss the year since Jan. 20, 2025, I want to start by backing up even further, to November of 2024 with your op-ed in the Inquirer. Your predictions came true with startling accuracy. Take me back to that time.

Sanya Carley: Well, exactly as predicted, he did, in fact, issue a number of executive orders. That is the tool that he used previously in the first Trump administration — a series of executive orders. I would call it the administrative presidency — relying very heavily on executive force. What’s really quite interesting this new time is it’s an administrative presidency on steroids. The use of a slew of executive orders, just a bombardment of them, but accompanied with emergency declarations, and using these emergencies to be able to use regulatory and policy tools that he might not have been able to otherwise, that might have needed to be approved by Congress.

And that’s also at the same time that there were so many federal employees that were laid off, so people that were administering many of these programs disappeared. And so it was much more, I would argue, than the first presidency, executive orders, accompanied with these other things. Trump has put a lot of judges in place. And as a result, those items that end up in the courts, of which there are many, there are now more judges that are deciding in favor of Trump than there were previously. So those are the kind of elements of this all happening at once.

It seems like the administration has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to halting the clean energy transition — between executive orders, orders from agency heads and Trump signing bills sent to him by Congress. The administration has gutted agencies, repealed tax credits and grants and ordered certain renewable projects closed and other fossil fuel ones to stay open. Have any of these deregulatory mechanisms been more impactful than others?

The repeal of [core components of] the [Inflation Reduction Act] in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is probably the most impactful. There were so many prongs. There were so many efforts embedded within the IRA focused on clean energy development, but also job development and creation and justice elements, and all of those have been affected by the pullback of the IRA programs.

You mention the energy emergency declaration. It’s interesting because, when the administration issued this, scholars and environmentalists quickly debunked it, pointing to record fossil fuel production. But an energy affordability emergency is now taking shape, and that has largely been spurred by the growth of data centers. Efforts to dismantle clean energy development don’t seem to be doing much to help it. What kind of emergency do you think is really happening?

I think the emergency in the Trump administration’s mind is that we’re headed on a track towards a clean energy transition, and we need to shift. I think the emergency in the minds of the majority of Americans is that we have an affordability crisis. The two are kind of colliding, and so a lot of the chaos that the Trump administration is creating in the energy industry is leading to abandoned projects, it’s leading to situations where power plants are being forced to run even though they’re not economically efficient or economically appropriate to run, and demand is going up significantly from data centers.

But the administration has essentially done everything it can to remove any guardrails for the development of these data centers and to encourage fossil fuel growth at the same time, and so as a result, there will be a lot more investment in fossil fuels going forward to provide for these data centers. And all of these things will add costs, so they will contribute to the affordability crisis.

Just to be very concrete, forcing a coal power plant to stay online adds significant costs to ratepayers in any given location surrounding these plants.

What do these costs look like? I’m thinking of the Eddystone power plant near Philadelphia that was slated to retire in May before the administration ordered it to stay open.

It’s either passed to the consumers directly as a rider or a charger, which is essentially just a very direct cost to cover something that’s spread across all of the customers, or as a result of costs going up for the utility company, they go to the Public Utility Commission and ask for a new rate case so that they can raise rates. And what we’re seeing happening right now is rate cases are proliferating, and energy bills just continue to go up. Energy prices have risen on average 30% over the past five years across America — faster than the rate of inflation.

A lot of your work focuses on the human costs of the energy transition. Were there any mistakes that the Biden administration made in ushering in a renewable energy era that we could now learn from?

There are plenty of places where the Biden administration, through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Act, made great progress in thinking about humans and thinking about justice issues in particular. One example is tax credits for electric vehicles and changing the eligibility requirements. This just helps those low-income customers that wouldn’t have been able to afford an electric vehicle or didn’t have the tax liability to be able to recover some of those credits. So it’s an example of taking an existing policy and tweaking it a little bit so that it’s more inclusive and thereby reaches a broader population.

And now, we’re in a moment of whiplash. Many deregulatory steps from the administration have been met by legal challenges, so we’ve been in a limbo on many fronts for a while. What impact is that having on the overall energy transition?

Well, the whiplash and the route to litigation is very consistent with the first Trump administration. So we’re seeing common threads. Even just this week, there’s some early thinking that the repeal of IRA funding that went to blue states was illegal and that those funds need to be reinstated. What is the consequence of the whiplash? The energy transition is still moving forward. We are still seeing significant solar development. We are still seeing significant clean energy development, distributed energy resources, all of these things are moving forward.

The energy transition is still underway, but the whiplash has very serious implications for our economy and for the investment culture of America. No new company is going to want to move to America right now and try to build offshore wind. The political environment is way too uncertain. Nobody wants to enter all of these legal battles.

Now, what are the implications for local communities? I’ve written before on the whiplash for coal communities. Coal communities will vote in their best interest, which is to keep coal operations running, even if they desire to have a different future, because that’s the future that they’ve had, and that’s their economic stability. With these kinds of monoeconomies, there’s very little other opportunity for growth. Having this kind of back and forth between administrations of closing all coal plants versus forcing them to stay online, forcing more production, it’s just incredibly difficult for them to kind of think about their long-run trajectory.

It’s hopeful to hear your reminder that the energy transition hasn’t been halted completely. How would you define the last year in the context of decades of change?

If you think of a graph, we’ve seen some plateaus, but I don’t anticipate the plateaus will decline. I anticipate that it’s a plateau to bear through the current political and legal environment before all of these technologies can continue to accelerate. I mentioned solar before. Solar has still been on a phenomenal growth trajectory, especially across the entire world. Again, it’s the leading source of growth in the energy industry in the United States. I think in the next year we might see some challenges with solar, just because the [One Big Beautiful Bill Act] repealed the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit [for wind and solar], and so as a result, anything that wasn’t already in development by the end of this year will no longer have access to those credits. So we’ll probably see a plateau there, or at least a slowing down of the growth of solar. Generally, we’re still very consistent trend wise.

So, how pessimistic should we feel?

I think we should not be pessimistic. I think we should be optimistic. I think where we can be pessimistic, one, is around the general use of policy and regulation in a way that’s kind of inconsistent with our democratic system, and not knowing what that could lead to in the future. And then, two, is the affordability crisis. That is not brought on by the energy transition, but it is very strongly connected to the policy and regulation of this administration.

So, addressing that challenge going forward, that is something that we can be pessimistic about, but we also need to think very deeply about opportunities for change in the industry. It could be rate reform, thinking about alternative rate design. It could be creating alternatives to certain kinds of markets that are in place, rethinking capacity markets. Another one is a virtual power plant. What kind of stipulations do we want to put on data center growth? These are all the kinds of questions that we need to face right now as we’re addressing affordability challenges.

The funding package includes a $700,000 grant for the Ventura County Sheriff's Office Unidentified and Missing Persons Forensic Genetic Genealogy Testing Initiative. The funding will be used to investigate a backlog of unidentified human remains cases in the county.

“We’ve already seen very positive results from this initiative,” said Rep. Carbajal. “In just one quarter in 2024, the Sheriff’s Department and Medical Examiner’s Office used this genetic testing initiative to successfully identify and reunite four Central Coast families with the remains of their loved ones. These reunifications are only the beginning, and it’s critical we deliver the resources needed to bring closure to every family still waiting for answers.”

The funding bill also includes $5,980,000 in grants for the crucial annual dredging of the Ventura Harbor.

“It would be difficult to overstate the importance of the annual dredging project for the economic strength of Ventura County. The project not only ensures successful maritime navigation but is foundational to maintaining the vitality of commercial fishing, local tourism, recreational boating, and waterfront businesses,” said Rep Carbajal.

In the spring of 2025, Carbajal began to push for funding these projects through formal requests to the House Appropriations Committee for Fiscal Year 2026.",https://[lastname].house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 15:00:54.941659

There are several ways that energy systems can be made more reliable ahead of winter storms and extreme weather.
Wind and solar generation tend to be available during many extreme cold events, even when other resources are strained.","The United States faces a pressing energy challenge: how to ensure people have reliable and affordable electricity when deadly storms hit.

This need came into sharp focus last weekend when a powerful winter storm swept across Texas up to Maine, bringing with it heavy snowfall, freezing rain and subzero temperatures. It caused blackouts to more than 1 million customers, especially in Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana. Many are still without power.

Preparations made by utilities and grid operators — including staging extra line crews, positioning equipment in high-risk areas and ensuring backup generation and reserves were on standby — certainly helped prevent further widespread outages during Winter Storm Fern. The bigger challenge now is long-term: reducing the number of blackouts by making power systems more reliable and still affordable in winter storms, and extreme weather in general.

WRI energy expert Kelly Lefler outlines what’s needed to strengthen the reliability of the electricity system and ensure people can count on constant, affordable power in the face of increasingly erratic weather.

What is mostly behind the power outages during Winter Storm Fern?

Utilities and regulators will assess records and publish official reports of what happened in the coming weeks and months, but for now it seems that the outages were largely due to the icy conditions affecting distribution and transmission systems. Ice from the storm built up on trees and the added weight caused them to snap, toppling power lines. The ice can also build up on the lines themselves and bring them down.

Also, in eastern U.S., some power plants couldn’t produce as much electricity because of the extreme cold and limited natural gas supplies, forcing them to shut down or run at reduced capacity. The region relies on natural gas pipelines along the East Coast, which are historically constrained during very cold weather. As a result, there were nearly 21 gigawatts of generation outages, with most of that capacity forced offline. To put that into perspective, 21 gigawatts is the same as 21 billion watts, enough to power millions of homes at the same time. Importantly, these disruptions did not require grid operators to impose rolling blackouts to prevent larger system failures.

What makes the US electricity system vulnerable to extreme cold weather?

Winter storms tend to stress the electricity system — from power plants to transmission lines and distribution networks — in predictable ways that create an imbalance between supply and demand of electricity or make it harder to maintain safe grid conditions. When that happens, grid operators may be forced to take some electricity demand offline to prevent a larger, uncontrolled outage. While every major winter blackout has its own story, a few common failure points show up again and again.

In extreme cold, one of the biggest challenges is getting fuel to power plants for electricity generation and to homes for heating. Natural gas is the U.S.’s largest source of electricity generation, providing 43% of electricity as of 2024. During winter storms, demand for natural gas spikes as people turn up thermostats, while power plants also need the fuel to generate electricity. This simultaneous surge, known as coincident peak, is a well-known planning challenge. Extreme cold can strain the natural gas system beyond normal operating conditions, making it harder for gas-powered generators to access fuel when they need it the most. Similar stress can happen during extreme heat, when air conditioners drive up electricity demand.

Another issue is lack of proper winterization — preparing equipment for wintry conditions — across different parts of the electricity system. Equipment that isn’t prepared for extreme cold, such as power plants, sensors and natural gas wells and pipelines, can freeze or malfunction. When multiple pieces fail at once, utilities may have no choice but to implement widespread outages to maintain system safety and prevent cascading failures.

Winter conditions also make it harder for crews to maintain or repair equipment as problems arise, increasing the risk of outages.

Transmission and distribution systems can also be affected by winter storms. Ice and heavy snow can damage power lines, reduce their carrying capacity or cause mechanical problems, making it harder to move electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed — even when enough power is available. These lines are especially vulnerable without regular maintenance. For example, trimming trees near power lines is critical to prevent ice-laden branches from falling on them, as has happened during Winter Storm Fern.

How can energy systems be made more reliable and affordable during weather shocks?

There are several ways that energy systems can be made more reliable ahead of winter storms and extreme weather. Greater reliability helps prevent supply disruptions, eases pressure during peak demand periods and can keep power more affordable.

One of the key ways to make energy systems more reliable is by maximizing flexibility — improving how well the system can adapt in real time to changes in supply and demand. The more flexible the system, the better it can handle sudden demand spikes in the event of extreme weather, such as cold snaps or heat waves, or respond to supply disruptions such as plant outages.

Improving flexibility includes upgrading aging infrastructure. Much of the U.S. grid was built decades ago under different demand patterns. Modernizing the grid — by updating substations and transmission equipment, deploying advanced sensors and incorporating advanced transmission technologies (ATTs), for example — can reduce failure rates during extreme heat and cold. These technologies help operators detect problems quicker, reroute power if equipment is damaged and restore service fast. Modernization not only improves reliability but also reduces expensive emergency interventions and lowers long-term maintenance costs.

Increasing grid capacity, both through deployment of ATTs and building regional and interregional transmission lines, can reduce the risk of a local weather event turning into a widespread outage. Creating a more interconnected grid allows regions to share power during shortages. Having this greater transmission capacity also help keep prices down by allowing lower-cost electricity to reach areas facing higher demand.

Demand-side management options can help ease pressure on the system during extreme weather events. These include encouraging customers and large users to reduce or shift electricity use during peak periods in exchange for lower bills or leveraging distributed energy resources to help prevent shortages.

Systems that rely too much on a single fuel are more vulnerable to disruption. Diversification across energy sources and technologies helps reduce the risk of issues related to fuel shortages, infrastructure failures and localized weather impacts.

Finally, policy is also critical. It’s vital that incentives are properly aligned with modern needs for flexibility and preparedness. This can help utilities make system investments that really work in extreme weather and minimize costs to consumers in both the short and the long run.

What role, if any, can clean energy play?

While renewables are weather-dependent, broad geographic dispersion and forecasting allow them to contribute meaningfully during winter storms. Wind and solar generation tend to be available during many extreme cold events, even when other resources are strained.

In several recent cold-weather events, renewable generation was available when needed, even as some fossil fuel units were forced offline because of freezing equipment or fuel supply constraints. For example, during Winter Storm Elliott, only 7% of unavailable generating capacity came from clean energy resources — that’s wind, solar, nuclear and hydro combined. And in some parts within the impacted region, wind and solar exceeded forecasts.

Clean energy also supports diversification. Adding a broader mix of energy sources reduces dependence on a single fuel or delivery system that may be disrupted during extreme weather. Resources that do not rely on “just-in-time"" fuel delivery, in which power plants receive fuel only when it is needed, can reduce exposure to fuel shortages when supply chains are strained.",https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/1222x722/s3/2026-01/winter-storm-fern.jpg?VersionId=ZK5fmtY7wpY_togUMd6VO2IBU_jX_nSy&h=e57daf52&itok=j-PWnCMd,N,,2026-01-27 12:32:37.659840

I want to thank Chairman Cole for steadfast leadership, for keeping the appropriations process on track.","Washington, D.C. – For the American people, effective legislating means results. After months of hearings, markups, and bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, the House has completed action on all twelve Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations bills – advancing full-year funding through a transparent, member-driven process. To mark this critical milestone, Republican Appropriators, led by Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK), came together to reflect on this important step forward for responsible governance, with remarks from Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and many Appropriations Subcommittee Cardinals.

Watch the full press conference here(link is external).

The twelve appropriations bills passed by the House – six of which have already been signed into law – cover the full scope of the federal government and deliver the certainty Americans rely on every day. Together, they provide critical resources for disaster preparedness, aviation safety, and infrastructure modernization; support pay raises for our servicemembers, Coast Guard, and air traffic controllers; advance biomedical research and work of our rural hospitals; strengthen efforts to combat deadly drugs and human trafficking; direct community-informed investments that address real needs in localities and make a tangible difference for families and neighborhoods nationwide; and back the supply-chain workers who keep the economy moving, including small businesses, farmers, ranchers, truckers, and maritime industries.

Developed through bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, these bills reflect a responsible, results-driven approach to governing – locking in savings for taxpayers, cutting red tape, and aligning federal spending with the mandate of the American people. They replace obsolete policies with focused investments that support readiness, security, economic growth, and a stronger future. With the House having completed its work on FY26, the Senate must now act to finish the process and keep the government funded ahead of the January 31 deadline. Read on for excerpts from the press conference.

Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) said, ""This would not have been possible without our Speaker and his leadership team, Leader Scalise, Whip Emmer, Conference Chair McClain – they set the conditions and, frankly, they pushed the work down to us and out of leadership offices down to the committee level, just as the Speaker said he would do. So, his commitment to regular order, to regular process, to moving through this, to allowing us to do the work we know how to do, and frankly, allow us to reach across the aisle. This Speaker is the reason these twelve bills happened. Mr. Speaker, we need to applaud you. I want the Speaker to know how much we appreciate him. I’ve got a couple other people to thank, and then I’ll call on the cardinals in order. I have to thank the White House and the President of the United States. President Trump endorsed every one of these packages. His support, and the work of his team in the White House, was absolutely indispensable in getting this done. Again, it’s the reason this hasn’t happened in a long time, and I want to thank President Trump and his team for everything they did to make sure that we had unity when we needed it, and to, frankly, have flexibility when we needed that. The President deserves a lot of credit for this. We’re always happy in Congress when we get something done in a bicameral way, and we hope that’s coming next week when the Senate comes, but the President of the United States has to sign these bills, and the President of the United States can sustain any veto he cares to cast. So the fact that he was an active participant in helping us is something that means a lot. Finally, I want to thank every member of the committee on both sides of the aisle. There were a lot of bipartisan votes today. I would be remiss not to thank my working partner on the other side, Rosa DeLauro. We didn’t vote the same on every single item in front of us today or on every single bill, but we would not have been able to have this process without her cooperation and her help and her commitment to Article I and to regular order. The same thing is true of our colleagues on the other side of the rotunda. They haven’t quite finished their job, but Susan Collins and Patty Murray are fantastic to work with, and again, while this is a big day for Republicans, this is a bipartisan, bicameral product in front of us that was negotiated out on both sides of the aisle. It’s not just a partisan victory, it’s a congressional and bipartisan victory. I appreciate that. Finally, I want to thank specifically my cardinals. We adopted a common philosophy at the beginning, I know Ms. DeLauro feels the same way: let’s push these decisions down to the subcommittee level and let the cardinals and the ranking members do their work. And by doing that, honestly, those are the best-informed experts we have in their subject matter on the committee, and frankly, usually in the House. When they make decisions and they make deals, I say that if you can stay within your numbers, I don’t care what you do. I will be supportive of whatever you produce as long as you stay within the toplines that you’ve been given. They did it. Quite honestly, every level you move this up, whether it’s to the four corners, or to the leadership, the decision becomes less informed and more political. So keeping it at the subcommittee level was really the key. The cardinals and their counterparts on the other side of the aisle are really responsible for this success.”

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said, ""We've got some of the greatest leaders in a generation or more up here behind this podium. I'm excited to celebrate this moment with them. Thanks to our appropriators and Chairman Tom Cole for being here today. This is a monumental achievement... Despite the noise, despite our slim margins, despite the fact that most members in the House have never gone through a regular, member-driven appropriations process before, this team got it done. They stood together, and they did the hard work, and they got it done. The House has now passed all twelve appropriations bills, and the Senate will do the same, and the President is going to sign them into law. What a concept! I want to say this again for emphasis, and I don't want anyone to miss the significance of this: the House has passed twelve appropriations bills, and soon they will become law. Now, many people in this room said that it could never be done. We had many naysayers, but we worked right through that. It really is a remarkable thing. With the passage of this package of bills today, Republicans will have finally replaced the last of any Biden-era spending levels with Trump-era spending levels and policies. We spent less, we saved more taxpayer dollars, we codified efforts to remove waste and fraud and abuse, we advanced a full budget that provides real teeth and delivers the America First agenda, just as we promised that we would. This is the most significant progress towards restoring regular order in this institution in many years, and everybody here knows that. And it's because of the work of the Appropriators standing here behind me. Our Appropriators, this team, led so well by Chairman Cole, worked day and night for months to produce this outcome. It wasn't easy – it took a lot of work... It's true that Washington has become far too accustomed to governance by omnibus, and governing by omnibus is not the way it's supposed to work. It's not the way the Founding Fathers designed this system to work, because it's not responsible. It's not good stewardship. It's bad policy, it's bad politics, and it weakens our Article I authority. We break bad habits by replacing them with healthy ones, and that's what we've done here. I want to be very clear – this is a committee-led, member-driven funding package. It's exactly what we said we were going to get back to. With the passage of these bills today, Republicans have demonstrated that the appropriations process is alive and well, and we are changing this institution to work for the people to make it work better.""

Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Hal Rogers (R-KY) said, “I came on the Committee in 1983, under President Reagan, and we faced the same challenges then as we face now. And that is, how do we control the power of the purse and subject every penny of federal dollars according to the philosophy of Reagan then, and Chairman Cole now. We struggle every year to try to pass these twelve bills, with spotty success, until Tom Cole came along and gave us a brilliant plan, but also, more importantly, a brilliant piece of work by the cardinals and all members of this committee. So, Mr. Chairman, thank you for the brilliant leadership you have given to us, and brought 100% of every dollar we spend under the power of the purse of the Congress, and that’s why we owe you so much.”

Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee Robert Aderholt (R-AL) said, ""It is a great day for Appropriations. It’s been many years since we accomplished what we did today. I was honored to serve as chair of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee, and to lead and try to rein in spending where we need to rein in spending, but also support those programs that need to be supported. And again, Chairman Cole’s leadership on this, coupled with the Speaker – when he became speaker, he said “no more omnibus bils” and people took him at his word – I think that’s why we are where we are today, is because the Speaker, working with this committee, we were able to move forward.""

Chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Mike Simpson (R-ID) said, ""Whether you believe it or not, this really is a big day. We’ve moved this when nobody thought we were going to be able to move all these twelve bills across the floor. But we know how important it is. We’re not done yet, though. We’ve got to progress better next time toward getting back to regular order, where we actually have all the appropriations bills done on time, which is October 1st. We’re gonna keep pushing it. Without [Speaker Johnson’s] leadership, this would not have been possible. Without Tom Cole, this would not have been possible, either. The key to getting this done is letting the members who know what they’re doing, know their bills, the experts in those areas, do their jobs. And that’s what we’ve done throughout. Getting this done now, we’re already setting up hearings for next [fiscal] year. It’s so important to get those hearings started. In February, we’ll be holding hearings. We’ll be able to do our jobs much, much better by getting these bills done.""

Chairman of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee John Carter (R-TX) said, ""This is a team action. Every bill, every member made up their mind they were going to make sure every one of these bills passed, and God bless every one of you. We worked the floor, we made it work, in every form and fashion. It was so fun to do a four corners as a cardinal and get to sit there with Debbie Wasserman Schultz as my counterpart. We discussed it, we fought about it – but we fought civilly. We came out with a great bill. We funded our veterans affairs, and we funded the needs of our military bases around the country and around the world. I’ve been honored to serve on this subcommittee. I love this subcommittee because I like the idea of thanking those guys that fought for us, and thanking those guys and gals that are fighting for us right now by giving them what they need to have a better lifestyle. [Tom Cole] changed appropriations, the way it’s supposed to be. He’s my hero.""

Chairman of the Defense Subcommittee Ken Calvert (R-CA) said, ""It’s a great day for the men and women who serve in the United States military. We made sure that we took care of them, as we should. We have a common saying on both sides of the aisle: our job is to make sure that the men and women who serve in the United States military are provided the best standard of living we can afford, that we give them the best equipment, and if we go to war – we win; they lose. Those are the principles in which we work together to make sure this bill succeeds. We do a lot in this bill for more ships, more planes, more munitions, more of everything that we need to make this country safe and secure. So working with our counterparts, working with the United States Senate, and working with the Administration, we provided what is needed in this bill.""

Chairman of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN) said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, I have been privileged to chair the Energy and Water Appropriations subcommittee. It funds the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Bureau of Reclamation. America needs more energy, and we cannot fail – and we did not fail – in this bill. I would be remiss if I didn’t say this: Chairman Cole ushered in a new era in appropriations. When the Appropriations Committee works, it works for our great constitutional republic. Things work well, there’s a balance of power. I thank President Trump and his great Administration for giving us a budget, but then Congress comes together and works and gets it done.""

Chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee David Valadao (R-CA) said, ""Today, Congress has followed through on its commitment to get back to regular order and deliver for the American people by passing all twelve Fiscal Year 2026 funding bills. We are restoring a process that puts accountability and responsible government first. For too long, Washington has relied on short-term extensions, band-aid fixes, and last-minute deadlines. That’s not what Americans expect, and certainly not what they deserve. As Chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, I took this responsibility seriously, and our bill focused on strengthening security across the Capitol complex, supporting hardworking sworn officers and staff who keep this place running, and ensuring the Capitol remains open to students, families, and visitors from all across the nation. We made real progress in each of those areas and are proud of what we were able to accomplish together. Appropriations is not easy work, and it’s not meant to be. It requires compromise, member-driven leadership, and commitment to getting the job done, and done in the right way. While the process takes time, this is what a return to regular order looks like. Today marks an important step towards restoring trust and how Congress handles the funding of the American people. I want to thank Chairman Cole for steadfast leadership, for keeping the appropriations process on track. We could not have got this done without the Chairman and his team. This is the type of day we dream of. I look forward to getting started on Fiscal Year 2027.""

The House has completed its work through a bipartisan, bicameral process. The next step now rests with the Senate, which must act to provide the certainty and stability the American people deserve. House Republicans will continue building on the progress made during the FY26 appropriations process as we look ahead to FY27, maintaining a focused, member-driven approach grounded in transparency and regular order. Priorities such as robust military preparedness, steadfast support for our veterans, responsible investment in reliable energy production, and vital infrastructure modernization that strengthen communities will continue to drive our work and agenda.

Environmental groups worry the bill would significantly limit the Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s ability to protect Hoosiers from pollution.

The bill makes several things currently required of IDEM optional — such as setting standards for investigating and cleaning up hazardous waste. It prohibits IDEM from making environmental rules that are more “burdensome” than federal ones — but doesn’t specify what that means.

The bill also limits IDEM’s ability to review permits for nuclear power plants at a time when lawmakers are encouraging small reactors to be built in the state.

IDEM Commissioner Clint Woods said the goals of the bill are to “improve efficiency and customer service.”

“Reduce unnecessary burdens for IDEM implementation of federal and state environmental requirements in a manner that will benefit Hoosiers in terms of affordability and cost of living, but also to ensure they get the most environmental bang for their buck,"" he said.

Multiple environmental groups spoke against the legislation — including Desi Rybolt, the conservation campaign manager with the Indiana Conservation Voters. She said these changes to the law would greatly reduce IDEM's ability to protect the public.

“Hoosiers would have limited or no standing to hold their government accountable if it fails to protect them from bad actors in accidental, but preventable health risks from polluters,"" she said.

David Van Gilder is the senior policy and legal director with the Hoosier Environmental Council. He said the bill shows the governor is not listening to his constituents.

“When IDEM asked for public comment on the governor’s executive orders this year, the response was overwhelmingly in favor of continued, and even strengthened, protections,"" he said.

Van Gilder said the vague language in the bill could also open it up to lawsuits, if it becomes law.

The bill also originally contained language that would have automatically approved a permit for a large animal farm — or confined feeding operation — after a certain amount of time, as long as the applicant had a pre-coordination meeting with IDEM.

This was stricken from the bill after representatives of Indiana's poultry and pork industries said it could open their farmers to lawsuits from Indiana counties or other actors.

Executive Director of Indiana Pork, Josh Trenary, said Indiana's Right to Farm law hinges on farmers' ability to show they're not negligent — and one of the ways to do that is for them to demonstrate that they're complying with an adequate permit under the law.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c09928/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2919x1532+0+207/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbe%2Fc0%2F4f6992284c93b07f1300acea23c6%2Fdesirybolt-rt.PNG,N,,2026-01-27 12:34:47.078679

""The money was owed to Arizonans and I got it back for us after Donald Trump tried to sweep it away. I will keep protecting funding and programming that makes life easier to afford and more efficient for the public,"" said Attorney General Mayes. ""My federal lawsuits are about protecting Arizona's bottom dollar and the constitution I swore to protect.""

With this lawsuit, Attorney General Mayes recovered $15 million in current funding for Phoenix and future funding opportunities for Arizona communities. Other communities across Arizona – Mesa, Cochise County, the San Carlos Apache Tribal Nation, and Maricopa County – have previously benefitted from NEVI funds and have been able to implement public EV charging programs across the State. The City of Phoenix, however, was selected for a CFI grant in January 2025 and was not sent the $15 million they were awarded.

In the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Congress appropriated $5 billion for the NEVI Formula Program to facilitate nationwide deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and improve charging reliability for the public. States developed and were carrying out plans to build that network when President Trump, on day one of his administration, issued an executive order directing federal agencies to immediately stop releasing NEVI funds. Following that directive, DOT abruptly halted the NEVI program. A coalition of states led by the attorneys general of Washington, California, and Colorado sued in May and won a preliminary injunction from U.S. District Court Judge Tana Lin in June. Seven environmental non-profit organizations also joined the litigation.

Now, in her summary judgment order, Judge Lin said DOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) acted outside the law and their actions were arbitrary and capricious. She barred DOT and FHWA from suspending or revoking the plaintiff states’ approved electric vehicle infrastructure plans in the future and from withholding their NEVI Formula Program funds for any reason not expressly authorized by Congress in the IIJA.

“Such capriciousness runs counter to the Administrative Procedure Act; it is simply not how things are lawfully done,” Judge Lin wrote in her order.

In addition to Attorney General Mayes, the coalition includes the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania joined the case.

The stock is trading down 3% for the year heading into the confessional, and this year's price action has been relatively muted by Tesla standards. Let's analyze Tesla’s Q4 earnings estimates and examine whether the stock is a buy or a sell ahead of the report.

Tesla Q4 Earnings Estimates

Consensus estimates call for Tesla’s Q4 revenues to fall 3.7% year-over-year (YoY) to $24.75 billion. I believe the estimates are still quite optimistic as the company’s deliveries plunged 16% YoY in the quarter. While the Energy segment could be a savior, it might not be able to fill in the void created by the decline in the company’s automotive business.

Analysts expect Tesla’s earnings per share (EPS) to fall 50% YoY to $0.33. Tesla’s earnings have fallen significantly over the last couple of years as its once industry-leading margins have withered away amid the price cuts.

What to Watch in Tesla’s Q4 Earnings Call

The overall mood during Tesla’s Q4 earnings call might not be very different from what we have seen in recent quarters, where CEO Elon Musk has been positioning the company as an artificial intelligence (AI) play rather than merely being an automaker. However, as I have noted previously, the automotive business is still key for Tesla as it brings in the much-needed cash flows that the company can then plow into other businesses like the Optimus humanoid robot, which are currently in the investment phase and at least a couple of years away from full-scale commercialization.

Here is what I would watch in Tesla’s Q4 earnings call:

Delivery Guidance: Tesla’s deliveries have now fallen for two consecutive years, and the 2026 outlook is not looking too promising, both stateside and globally. In the U.S., expiration of the tax credits is expected to dampen electric vehicle (EV) sales, and Musk himself has warned of a “few rough quarters.” Globally, Chinese EV companies are making headway, among others, at Tesla’s cost. I would also watch out for Musk’s views on the changing landscape for Chinese EV companies, where Canada is lowering tariffs on Chinese EVs and the EU is considering replacing tariffs with a price floor. Things haven't been rosy for Tesla globally, and there are reports of it offering incentives in India to spur sales.

Cybercab Production Timeline: Musk shared on social media that Cybercab production is set to begin in April. He, however, warned that the early “production rate will be agonizingly slow,” while expressing optimism that eventually it would be “insanely fast.” During the Q4 earnings call, I would look for more color on the 2026 production plan for the model on which Tesla’s delivery outlook for the next couple of years hinges.

Robotaxi Expansion and Monetization: I would also watch out for comments on the robotaxi expansion and monetization plans, as well as the progress on full autonomy, which, by Musk’s assertion, is key to Tesla’s valuation.

FSD Subscription: Tesla has done away with the one-time subscription for its full self-driving (FSD) and instead moved to a $99 monthly fee. I would watch out for comments on any changes in adoption rates that the company witnessed in the early days under the new pricing. At the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Musk expressed confidence that FSD could be approved in China and the EU as early as next month. If that were to happen, it would be a key positive for Tesla and help the company improve its production proposition in both the markets where it has been losing market share to Chinese rivals. During the earnings call, the company might provide an update on its discussions with regulators in these countries.

Should You Buy or Sell TSLA Stock

Tesla’s earnings for the first three quarters of 2025 left markets largely disappointed. The stock did rise following the Q1 confessional as Musk’s talk about disassociation from President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—something he subsequently did—helped buoy sentiments and took attention off an otherwise not-so-good earnings report.

However, the stock fell following the Q2 and Q3 reports, and markets did not buy into Musk’s bold promises, including the often-repeated claim of Tesla eventually becoming the biggest company globally.

Meanwhile, I am not too bullish on TSLA stock heading into the Q4 report and expect yet another tepid performance from the company, which has been struggling with growth. The headwinds for Tesla’s automotive business have only amplified, and while AI products could still drive long-term growth, I don’t find any margin of safety in the company whose market cap is over $1.4 trillion. Overall, I continue to maintain a small investment in Tesla but am not inclined to add more shares at these price levels.",,N,,2026-01-27 16:58:54.963754

The automaker will introduce its next-generation software-defined vehicle in 2028.

Simpler electrical architectures and less wiring can help make future GM EVs more competitive.

General Motors is working to reduce the cost of its electric vehicles, beyond just using cheaper lithium-ion batteries, the automaker said Tuesday during its fourth quarter and full-year 2025 earnings call.

The update comes just as the automaker booked over $7 billion in charges related to cutting down its EV ambitions last year, which includes things like contract cancellation fees and converting its Orion, Michigan, EV assembly plant for the production of full-size gas trucks and SUVs.

Cost remains one of the biggest barriers to broader EV adoption. While more affordable models are finally on the horizon, most EVs sold in the U.S. today still cost more than comparable gas cars. Automakers have realized that demand is strongest at the lower end of the market, where the premium for going electric is often lower. As a result, the focus has shifted toward cutting costs in every possible way.

While GM is on track to introduce cheaper battery chemistries such as lithium manganese rich (LMR) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP), it’s taking more steps to bring EV prices down.

“The investments we’re making now will be very much focused on cost reduction,” General Motors Chair and CEO Mary Barra said during the earnings call. “We have teams on each of our EVs to continue to take costs out beyond the battery,” Barra added.

Barra did not say where exactly those cost reductions would stem from, but one highly likely area is its upcoming software-defined vehicle platform.

“In 2028, we expect to launch our second-generation software design vehicle architecture for ice vehicles and EVs,” Barra said. “It will unite every major system from propulsion to infotainment and safety on a single, high-speed compute core.”

Legacy automakers are now following Tesla and Rivian to build software-defined vehicles. The key reasons for the pivot include the vast simplification of electrical architectures that SDVs can enable, with things like a reduction in the number of on-board electronic control units and cutting down the length of wiring harnesses to reduce weight and save costs.

Rivian, for instance, said last year that it was reducing the number of ECUs from 17 in its first-generation R1T and R1S models to just seven on the second-generation vehicles. That, paired with shaving off 1.6 miles of wiring harness, helped the carmaker shave off 44 pounds of weight, which all helps with overall costs and efficiency.

General Motors is likely heading down a similar direction. Its new SDV platform will launch on the Cadillac Escalade IQ in 2028, which will also include a new lidar sensor to enable Level 3, eyes-off and hands-off autonomy in certain driving conditions.

GM's Ultium EV platform.

At the same time, GM is aggressively pursuing lower-cost LMR and LFP battery chemistries. It said last year that LMR batteries will help its full-size trucks and SUVs achieve a driving range of over 400 miles at costs comparable to LFP batteries. Those models will launch sometime in 2028.

Plus, GM will introduce cheaper LFP batteries on the upcoming Chevy Bolt EV and a future trim of the Silverado EV. LFP batteries are extremely popular in China and are a key enabler of lower-priced EVs. GM has said that LFP batteries will allow cost reductions of around $6,000 per vehicle.

“We know EV drivers don’t often go back to ICE, so we’ll continue executing our plan to dramatically reduce cost and be well positioned for the future,” Barra said.

“New Jersey has been caught in the crosshairs of being forced to choose between lower energy costs and preserving our environment for far too long — and no one has won.” said Michael Roth. “It’s long past time to move New Jersey into the 21st century by prioritizing clean energy initiatives to not only drive down carbon emissions and diversify our energy portfolio, but to lower energy costs that have been a burden for New Jersey families.”

Endorsement Statements

Maggie Thomas served as the Special Assistant to the President for Climate in the Biden White House. As part of her role in the Biden Administration, she founded the American Climate Corps, which put 20,000 young people to work in climate and clean energy careers in communities across the country. Prior to that, she co-founded the climate advocacy group Evergreen Action and worked on the climate teams of presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren (as lead climate staffer) and Jay Inslee (deputy climate director). Earlier in her career, Thomas held several roles at NextGen America, a political organization that mobilizes young people to vote. Thomas is an author in the national bestseller, All We Can Save, a collection of writings by women leading on climate. Thomas graduated from Yale University with a Master’s in Environmental Management.

Thomas shared, “I am proud to support Michael Roth for Congress because he understands what’s at stake for American families and how to make the federal government actually deliver for them. I’ve learned from working at the highest levels of government that policy only matters if it produces real results. Michael is relentless about delivery and never accepts the status quo, especially in moments of crisis. Michael understands that clean energy is cheap energy. That’s why I’m confident that he’ll be the climate champion we need in Congress. With his experience in Washington and working with America’s small businesses, I am confident he will bring federal resources back to New Jersey and work in partnership with Governor Sherill to make the state a national leader in climate and economic opportunity.”

Thomas Dackow boasts a storied career in IT, Fortune 500 companies, consulting, and innovative solutions for special business needs. Dackow has served on the Board of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters for almost a decade, and also serves on the finance committee for J Street.

About Michael, Dackow said, “When I first met Michael, we had a broad ranging discussion of issues of particular concern to the citizens of New Jersey and of the central importance of individual States, given the manifest failure of the current Federal Government to rationally engage and constructively support issues of local, national and Global concern. With Michael’s election and the likely transition of Congress from Republican to Democratic leadership, we can expect to see the House resume its role as a functioning check on executive overreach. I feel confident that Michael is the best candidate to unseat Tom Kean Jr. and flip NJ-07 because he has the background and experience to allow him to be effective on day one.”

Leaders Supporting A Leader

Just earlier this month, Michael Roth released the launch of Economic Leaders for Michael, a coalition of respected economic pioneers across all levels of government backing Michael Roth’s campaign to deliver jobs and affordability for New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District, including Don Graves, Former Deputy Secretary, U.S. Department of Commerce; Earl Pomeroy, Former Congressman, North Dakota, former President of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; Bharat Ramamurti, Former Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, Former Top Economic Policy Advisor for Senator Elizabeth Warren; and Kevin Quinn, Former Board Chair of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, Former Senior Relationship Director at the U.S. Department of Commerce’s CHIPS Program Office.

With respected climate leaders now joining these economic champions, Michael Roth is building the coalition needed that understands the urgency of meeting the moment to take on Tom Kean Jr. in the general election and deliver real results for New Jerseyans across the district and state.

Led by Dartmouth Engineering, the paper brought together leading researchers across more than a dozen institutions to issue a clear call to action: Climate-risk science must make its assumptions, data and code easier to inspect if it is to reliably inform high-stakes decisions.
“Climate-risk projections are being used in infrastructure design, housing markets and public policy,” said co-author James Doss-Gollin, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University.
Zillow, for example, stopped displaying climate-risk scores on listings after users complained that the numbers felt arbitrary and opaque.
The finding doesn’t challenge the broad conclusions of climate science or climate-risk research, the authors emphasize.","When families decide where to buy a home, when cities approve new development or when governments decide where to invest billions in resilience, they increasingly turn to climate-risk scores for guidance.

But how trustworthy are those projections, and how should different users interpret them?

A new paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences argues that trustworthiness depends not just on the sophistication of the models used to produce the scores but also on whether the science behind them is open, reusable and transparent enough for others to examine, test and improve.

Led by Dartmouth Engineering, the paper brought together leading researchers across more than a dozen institutions to issue a clear call to action: Climate-risk science must make its assumptions, data and code easier to inspect if it is to reliably inform high-stakes decisions.

“Climate-risk projections are being used in infrastructure design, housing markets and public policy,” said co-author James Doss-Gollin, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University. “But the devil really is in the details. Small differences that seem reasonable in isolation can have a big influence on final scores. Being able to look into those details — to understand what assumptions are driving results and how alternative assumptions might lead to different results — is essential if these tools are going to support high-stakes decisions.”

The urgency of the problem became visible in recent years as commercial climate-risk scores entered the mainstream. Millions of U.S. homebuyers relied on property-level flood-risk estimates embedded in real-estate platforms until some of those platforms quietly pulled the data back.

Zillow, for example, stopped displaying climate-risk scores on listings after users complained that the numbers felt arbitrary and opaque.

“That reaction wasn’t surprising,” Doss-Gollin said. “Climate-risk projections often combine multiple layers of modeling — from estimating future weather probabilities to translating weather into hazards like floods to estimating damages — each with its own uncertainties and limits on validation.”

In one striking example cited in the paper, two widely used flood-hazard models for Los Angeles agreed on only 24% of which properties fell within the current 100-year flood plain. Limited historical flood and damage data made it impossible to definitively determine which model performed better.

“None of this means the science is wrong,” said corresponding author Adam Pollack, who led the research at Dartmouth and is now an assistant professor at the University of Iowa. “But when data and code are difficult or impossible to access, it slows down climate-risk science, especially in application areas that require integrating many methods and tools.”

To assess how open the field actually is, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of highly cited climate-risk studies published between 2021 and 2022. The result was stark: Only 4% of those studies shared both their data and code — a widely accepted minimum standard for transparency that many journals and funders already claim to require.

The finding doesn’t challenge the broad conclusions of climate science or climate-risk research, the authors emphasize. Instead, it highlights a structural barrier to cumulative progress at a moment when timely, evidence-based risk information is urgently needed.

“Transparency lets others scrutinize assumptions, and reusability lets researchers build on one another’s work,” Pollack said. “The major successes in climate-risk science show how critical those practices are for understanding why different models produce different answers.”

The paper points to landmark open-science efforts, such as global climate model intercomparison projects and openly shared economic models, as proof that transparent foundations can accelerate scientific progress and directly inform policy.

Beyond diagnosing the problem, the study outlines concrete steps researchers, journals and institutions can take now:

Journals should enforce their own transparency standards or revise them to standards they are willing to uphold.

Researchers should share data and code whenever possible with thoughtful exceptions for privacy or legal constraints.

Open datasets and software should be formally cited, strengthening incentives to share.

Clear data and code availability statements should explain what is and isn’t accessible and why.

The authors also stress that simply uploading files isn’t enough. True reusability requires documentation, simple tests and clear instructions.

“These are not abstract ideals,” Doss-Gollin said. “They’re practical tools for revealing assumptions, identifying errors and helping users understand the limits of risk projections.”

Looking ahead, the paper argues that transformational progress will require larger investments from funders and institutions, including support for research software engineers, training pipelines and shared benchmarking platforms. The authors are also careful to note that transparency in noncommercial research does not undermine private-sector innovation. Instead, they argue, open foundations make it easier to benchmark products, validate methods and communicate uncertainty with transparency.

“If these projections are guiding decisions that affect people’s lives and livelihoods, we owe it to the public to make the science behind them as open and understandable as possible,” Doss-Gollin said.",https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/2026-01/featured_harvey.jpeg,N,,2026-01-27 12:34:05.386225

It’s a simple, transparent mechanism that has unlocked billions in private investment and allowed businesses of all sizes to source clean energy for their operations.
The GHG Protocol deserves credit for running an open, transparent consultation process and for inviting diverse perspectives.
But as it weighs revisions, the organization should carefully consider how these changes could ripple through clean energy markets.
With thoughtful engagement, it can do so again by crafting a standard that strengthens transparency while preserving the momentum of the clean energy transition.","The Greenhouse Gas Protocol has opened a new public comment period on proposed updates to its Scope 2 Guidance, the rules that determine how companies and organizations measure and report the emissions from their purchased electricity. This might sound like a technical accounting exercise, but its implications are anything but.

The decisions made in this process could reshape the multibillion dollar market for voluntary clean energy procurement — and not necessarily for the better.

The GHG Protocol’s consultation, open through January 31, 2026, proposes significant changes to how companies can report renewable electricity use. Under the draft revisions, all renewable energy procurement would have to be matched hour by hour to a company’s electricity consumption and come from much tighter geographic boundaries to qualify under the accounting method.

The intent is understandable. The GHG Protocol wants to make corporate emissions reporting more precise. But the proposed requirements could have serious unintended consequences — chief among them, undermining corporate demand for clean energy and slowing the pace of renewable deployment in the United States.

For the past decade, companies participating in this voluntary market have driven the demand for clean energy. Companies that buy renewable energy have played a direct role in creating demand for over 40% of all U.S. solar and wind projects added over the past decade. These deals have supported local jobs, driven innovation, and sent powerful market signals that have accelerated the buildout of clean energy at a time when demand is spiking.

The GHG Protocol is the backbone of this voluntary system. It’s the accounting framework that allows companies to claim credit for the development of this clean energy. The GHG Protocol’s market-based approach allows companies to support clean energy even when the electrons powering their operations come from a shared grid. It’s a simple, transparent mechanism that has unlocked billions in private investment and allowed businesses of all sizes to source clean energy for their operations.

Imposing mandatory hourly matching and narrow geographic rules would effectively dismantle that market before trusted tools and data systems exist to make such precision feasible. While more granular reporting can be valuable for companies pursuing 24/7 clean power goals. It should remain optional, not a requirement for all. If adopted as written, the proposal could make it much more difficult for companies to credibly report renewable electricity use, discourage participation in the voluntary market, and ultimately affect funding for new wind, solar, and other clean energy projects.

The GHG Protocol deserves credit for running an open, transparent consultation process and for inviting diverse perspectives. But as it weighs revisions, the organization should carefully consider how these changes could ripple through clean energy markets. Driving more clean energy projects onto the grid directly lowers emissions in the power sector and enables electrification that can lead to emissions reductions in other sectors of the economy. Precision in accounting is important but progress in deployment is essential.

As the comment period continues, ACORE and our members will submit detailed feedback to ensure the final Scope 2 standard reflects both environmental integrity and market reality. We urge all stakeholders to do the same.

The GHG Protocol has a proud history of setting the bar for credible, science-based climate accounting.

The study outlines a number of recommendations for the EV battery sector, including designing batteries for circularity, not disposal so they last and can be reused across multiple lives.
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s executive lead for critical minerals, Wen-Yu Weng said there is already an element of circularity in the EV battery sector, partly driven by the geopolitical tensions and the subsequent need to secure critical minerals, in an interview.
“People around the world are picking up on the notion that critical minerals are important,” Weng told me.
“We are now moving to a world where most of the value in a car come from the EV batteries.","Switching to a circular electric vehicle (EV) battery economy is essential to meet growing demand and avoid a critical bottleneck in the supply of key minerals, according to a new analysis.

The report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation warns a bottleneck could threaten higher and volatile prices, which in turn could lead to a slower uptake of such vehicles.

It argues only a practical, system-wide circular economy approach can keep pace with market appetite, build resilience in the supply chains, and deliver better value.

According to the report, EVs are emerging as the strategic backbone of the energy transition and by 2050, they are predicted to make up 65% to 75% of global car sales.

A typical EV contains more than 200kg of critical minerals – six times more than a conventional car – with a large share of that value concentrated in the battery.

The study outlines a number of recommendations for the EV battery sector, including designing batteries for circularity, not disposal so they last and can be reused across multiple lives.

It also calls for business models to be scaled in order to treat critical minerals as long-term assets managed through service models that reward durability, performance, recovery, and second-life use.

The report also calls for more regional circular infrastructure to be built, which will enable materials to circulate efficiently, resiliently, and transparently.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s executive lead for critical minerals, Wen-Yu Weng said there is already an element of circularity in the EV battery sector, partly driven by the geopolitical tensions and the subsequent need to secure critical minerals, in an interview.

But Weng added these geo-political factors have led to greater circularity “by accident, rather than design”, and the circular economy concept is much broader than just the recycling of materials.

She said the report highlights how the circularly economy comes down to the fundamental idea that products like EV batteries and their components have an intrinsic value.

“People around the world are picking up on the notion that critical minerals are important,” Weng told me.

“We also know these batteries are lasting longer now, and people have gotten better at understanding how to charge and discharge their batteries, and it is getting to the point where we can start to expect some batteries to outlast a car.

“We are now moving to a world where most of the value in a car come from the EV batteries. In addition, they are critical for so many other global industries and sectors as well - such as renewables, electronics, data centres, etc,"" added Weng.

The managing director of supply chain experts SC Insights, Andrew Leyland said there are relatively few electric vehicles batteries available now for recycling, in an interview.

But Leyland added this is because the market relies on older vehicles and components from a decade ago, and there were relatively few electric vehicles on the road back then.

He said the market is rapidly growing at a rate of 15 to 20% a year and within 15 years, the supply of used batteries will be able to meet the demand for recycled materials.

“What is currently being recycled is nowhere near enough to meet a large part of the supply in the market, but once we get into the 2040s, the majority of battery materials could come from recycled supply,” he told me.

“The governments also want this recycled pool of materials to come back into the market, and do not want a replication of what happened when fridges and freezers were exported abroad and torn apart in very environmentally unfriendly ways,” said Leyland.

“They do not want to lose the strategic resource, and they don't want the environmental contamination of batteries leaching heavy metals into the water table.”

And Dr. Christian Marston, the chief operating officer of clean technology company Altilium, said moving to a more circular economy could help address the scarcity of critical minerals.

Dr. Marston added there have been obvious geopolitical concerns around how some of these minerals have been concentrated in certain hands.

He said upcoming European Union regulatory changes are expected to mean more battery waste stays within the EU, as part of a more localised approach to recycling and energy security.

“Exporting these minerals does not pass the common-sense test. One day we could see regulations, which will mean battery waste does not leave the U.K or Europe,"" said Dr. Marston.

""These minerals will need to be processed internally to prevent disruption or vulnerabilities in the supply chains.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6978d51a0f236e4271c44608/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2026-01-27 12:29:54.242938

Over the next 25 years, electricity demand is projected to climb by more than 50%, fueled by the widespread electrification of industries, transportation, and daily life.

This surge in demand signals exciting progress, but it also raises an urgent question: Can the nation's aging power grid keep up? A compelling October 2025 visual report from ELSCO Transformers highlights both the incredible potential of this electric future and the infrastructure challenges we must address to get there.

From data centers and EV charging stations to clean energy initiatives, America's growing appetite for electricity is driving conversations about infrastructure investment and planning.

AI Alone Could Break the Grid

One of the biggest drivers of this new demand? Artificial intelligence. While AI is revolutionizing industries and boosting productivity across the board, it's also becoming a major energy consumer. Each server request can require four to five watt-hours of electricity, a small number on its own, but when multiplied by billions of daily interactions, the impact quickly scales.

In fact, AI-related server usage is expected to consume 15 million megawatt-hours annually by 2027, enough to power millions of American homes every year. This rapid growth underscores the urgent need to build a grid that can keep pace with innovation.

Much of the US Grid Is Decades Past Its Prime

Part of the challenge lies in the age of the infrastructure itself. According to the report, nearly 70% of power transformers and transmission lines are more than 25 years old and rapidly approaching the end of their usable life.

Much of the U.S. grid was originally designed in the 1950s through the 1970s, long before today's energy demands were even imaginable.

Now, with more than 60,000 miles of transmission lines already running at full capacity, the system is stretched thin, raising questions about the need for upgrades.

Fixing It Could Cost $5T, But Inaction Will Cost More

Looking ahead, meeting the projected demand of 5,178 terawatt-hours by 2050 will require more than just innovation; it will require massive investment.

The cost of replacing and upgrading the nation's power infrastructure is estimated at a staggering $5 trillion, driven by rising material prices, supply chain pressures, and long lead times for essential components like transformers.

It's a daunting figure, but it's one that reflects the scale of transformation needed to build a grid capable of powering the next generation.

Interconnection Queues Are a Major Bottleneck

Even promising solutions like renewable energy, often seen as the key to a cleaner, more sustainable future, are facing significant hurdles. Despite widespread support, nearly 80% of proposed power generation projects are being delayed or canceled due to interconnection queue bottlenecks and regulatory backlogs.

These slowdowns are preventing clean energy from reaching the grid at the pace required, underscoring the need for streamlined processes and faster approvals if we're serious about meeting tomorrow's energy demands.

Industry Recommendations

To meet these challenges head-on, the report outlines a three-pronged strategy for building a more resilient and future-ready grid:

Diversify energy sources: Industry proposals include quadrupling the share of federally sourced renewable energy by 2035, reducing reliance on aging fossil-fuel infrastructure.

Accelerate interconnection: The report recommends doubling the speed at which new energy projects, especially renewables, are connected to the grid, cutting through red tape and backlogs.

Streamline equipment manufacturing: Another proposal involves prioritizing high-availability components with faster production, shorter shipping times, and long-term warranties to minimize delays and downtime.

These proposals represent one practical roadmap for powering America's electric future sustainably, securely, and at scale.

The bottom line? The U.S. doesn't have an energy shortage; it has an infrastructure bottleneck. With 2.6 terawatt-hours of generation capacity currently sitting idle due to outdated systems and regulatory delays, the potential is already there.

In the consumer sector there were notable launches from Lego and Fujifilm, with 2026 marking Lego’s first CES.","Ten years ago CES was marked by automakers looking beyond traditional formats to signal their intent towards consumer electronics. Endless halls gave way to Vegas show-and-tells, as the BigTech tide swept up carmakers to become digitally-enabled ACES (autonomous vehicles (AVs), connectivity, electrification and shared mobility). On-demand mobility seemed just around the corner, and brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz held court with in-car experiences. This year’s CES shows that future still beckons; it is just taking longer to get to. It is also no longer owned by carmakers.

Despite China’s cleantech surge, one of 2025’s big shifts was EU and US carmakers rowing back from full EV portfolios. This might ensure short-term viability, but brings with it the headache of integrating SDV (software defined vehicle) technologies within ICE platforms. There is however a threshold being crossed with electric-only autonomous vehicles, as they take to the streets of London and Munich. An upsweep in demand for AVs may push EVs back up to the top of the agenda. One question is how this impacts brand positioning, as car makers consider their offer here alongside the service providers that are fast becoming the face of next mobility.

This could be a false dichotomy here that risks decision-making bias: that ICE equates to private and premium, and EVs equate to AVs and mainstream products. What we have seen in Europe is that the brand must stay in the lead to legitimise diversification, but should not close the door on high-growth areas. The prospect of moving more people for less money and lower emissions is a touchstone achievement in automotive history; carmakers now have the chance to be part of it.

As EVs and AVs erode the fringes and margins of mainstream brands, one of the more significant announcements came before CES, with Alpina joining the BMW Group umbrella as BMW Alpina. This pulls the ladder further out of reach from new aspirants, adopting the value over volume model that Porsche is pivoting to. It might also mean livery more sympathetic to bodyside themes.

Ford also teased their next-gen BlueCruise ADAS that is cheaper and more capable for eyes-off driving in 2028. Given how many patents Ford has for L4 scenarios they will want to get there as soon as possible

This year carmakers had a smaller footprint at CES, with tech companies filling the space. NVIDIA partnered with Mercedes-Benz to enable autonomous cars, moving from scripted behaviour to realtime adaptation for edge scenarios. It’s a significant step-forward, not least because their Alpamayo datasets are open-source – the freemium model is alive and well. Less well covered are the ‘what if’ scenarios, such as the power outages that recently grounded Waymo’s fleet.

NVIDIA points to the dependency carmakers now have on their partners (note: no longer ‘suppliers’), but begs the question at what point does a company become a brand? And when does a brand name exceed what the customer is willing to pay for? BYD is proof of how an energy company can succeed in selling cars. That NVIDIA announced plans to launch a robotaxi service with a partner next year should come as no surprise.

One advantage carmakers have is allowing users to access various tech ecosystems. This year Mercedes-Benz partnered with several companies to deliver automotive’s biggest trends: in-car AI with Microsoft and Google, context-aware navigation with HERE, and L4 autonomy with NVIDIA. Inside the GLC, the MBUX Hyperscreen uses content untethered from physical zones, interactions instead driven by occupant position and intent. This sets the stage for partner integration, such as HERE’s live-maps, and personalised interior experiences on course for greater fidelity through AI-enmeshed metadata. This demands greater synchronicity between digital, physical and brand design teams, not to mention tech partners.

BMW announced their latest Intelligent Personal Assistant using Amazon’s AI Alexa+ Architecture, fronted by a floating orb with generously kerned kidneys (E60?) as eyes. Ford’s AI assistant will debut in the company’s smartphone app, before expanding to their vehicles in 2027. Ford also teased their next-gen BlueCruise ADAS that is cheaper and more capable for eyes-off driving in 2028. Given how many patents Ford has for L4 scenarios they will want to get there as soon as possible.

AI is also moving into the full vehicle lifecycle. Virtual development, simulation, and validation are shortening cycles and improving quality. Showcasing the power of partnerships, British brand Longbow championed their 900kg Speedster with four Donut Labs in-wheel motors and solid-state battery promising stellar stats: 400Wh/kg energy density; lower cost than lithium; 5 minute full-charge for up to 100k cycles; and made of ‘globally abundant materials’. Though pending independent verification, the buzz around Donut Labs affirms that this is at least the desired direction.

For technophiles, the ‘Body-Based Tech’ session demonstrated wearables' rapid evolution. Neurable showed EEG headphones as a brain-computer interface for focus monitoring; Quellios demoed smartphone fingertip scans for dietary management; Elemind presented EEG headbands with audio stimulation to induce sleep; Sandbox VR highlighted full-body motion sensors for immersive VR; and Viziverse AI revealed mobile phone VR without need for headsets. No mention of mobility from Meta, instead deepening their tie-up with Ray-Ban to drive adoption of surveillance and communication tech within a growing portfolio of wearables.

In the consumer sector there were notable launches from Lego and Fujifilm, with 2026 marking Lego’s first CES. Their Smart Brick developed with Cambridge Consultants packs motion, pressure, and proximity sensors within the classic 2x4 piece. Screenless interactions are enabled through contextual audio and LED feedback, with Smart Minifigures that recognise builds without apps or optical scanning.

As the sovereignty of carmakers is challenged, the down-payment on automotive futures is being made by their partners

However launching the SmartBrick within a Star Wars set intensified the scrutiny of what will for some be a contentious direction. Meanwhile, retro is back (again) with Fuji, whose Instax Mini Evo Cinema features an analogue ‘Eras’ dial that applies decade-specific visual and audio effects, from 1930’s grain to 2020’s clarity. Gimmick, maybe, but a fun way to bridge humour, tech and craft.

It wouldn’t be CES without mention of robots. NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang announced that ‘the ChatGPT moment for Physical AI is here’, while Boston Dynamics deployed their Atlas robot at a Hyundai plant to handle parts movement. Having human-sized machines for human-sized spaces helps them dovetail into industrial contexts, but the notion of their traipsing around the home drew scepticism. In that sense, the diminutive Honda Asimo and LG Home Hub show how sensitive scale is to making people feel comfortable with technology.

Speaking at CES, Hyundai’s vice chair, Jaehoon Chang, acknowledged concerns that workers could lose their jobs to robots, adding that people are still needed to train them. This tacit acknowledgement of AI’s impact on the social contract has barely been broached, let alone answered.

CES is notable for bringing to the world stage a hub-and-spoke approach to innovation, where basic research created at a foundation level builds knowledge equity, validated through high-value use cases. This approach provides scientific capital, and sets the fund from which the practical application of knowledge can be drawn and new companies founded.

Since 1980, the U.S. has experienced 426 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters — costing more than $3.1 trillion and claiming over 17,000 lives, according to Climate Central data.

California is filling the leadership void

While the Paris Agreement is an international agreement requiring federal action to formally join, California has long demonstrated that states can pursue Paris Agreement-aligned climate goals through domestic policy and subnational partnerships.

When President Trump first withdrew from the agreement in 2017, California responded by co-founding the U.S. Climate Alliance — a coalition of states, now co-chaired by Governor Newsom, committed to meeting Paris targets regardless of federal participation, now representing 24 governors and 60% of the U.S. economy.

California has helped build the largest domestic and international network of subnational climate cooperation in the world.

Domestic coalitions

U.S. Climate Alliance: Governor Newsom co-chairs the bipartisan coalition of 24 governors co-founded by California on June 1, 2017, in direct response to Trump’s first Paris withdrawal.

America Is All In: Governor Newsom co-chairs the broadest coalition ever assembled in support of climate action in the United States, including states, cities, tribal nations, businesses, and institutions.

International coalitions

Under2 Coalition: Last year, California and Baden-Württemberg, co-founders of the Under2 Coalition, signed a joint statement celebrating ten years of partnership. The coalition now represents more than 270 governments committed to keeping global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius.

Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance: In 2021, Governor Newsom announced that California joined the Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) launched at COP26, bringing together national and subnational governments committed to advancing a just transition away from oil and gas production. California is a member of this international alliance working to phase out oil and gas production and usher in a cleaner and greener future that safeguards our communities, environment, and the economy.

Subnational Methane Action Coalition: Launched by California at COP28 in Dubai, the Coalition brings together subnational governments from around the world committed to aggressively cutting methane — a climate super-pollutant that accounts for nearly 30% of current global warming and is roughly 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. nitial signatories span five continents and include California and Colorado (U.S.); Querétaro and Yucatán (Mexico); Gauteng (South Africa); Espírito Santo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Pernambuco (Brazil); Cross River State (Nigeria); Delhi (India); Baden-Württemberg (Germany); British Columbia (Canada); Santa Cruz (Bolivia); Andalusia (Spain); and Gyeonggi (South Korea).

International partnerships delivering results

While Washington retreats from global leadership, California is building partnerships that deliver real-world solutions. Recent partnerships advanced during COP30 include:

Chile: California and Chile signed a memorandum of understanding regarding exchanging information, developing best practices, and cooperating on methane emissions reduction. Methane is a highly potent greenhouse gas and the partnership between California and Chile opens up new opportunities for both partners to cooperate on methane reduction in waste, agriculture and energy sectors.

Colombia: California and Colombia signed a partnership to advance joint efforts on forest conservation, methane reduction, climate resilience, and clean energy development. The memorandum of understanding deepens coordination on protecting the Amazon, strengthening biodiversity, and expanding nature-based climate solutions that support sustainable and equitable economic growth.

Nigeria: California signed a memorandum of understanding with Nigeria on sustainable urban transportation, green ports, low-carbon transportation fuels, climate adaptation, methane detection and abatement policies, greenhouse gas emissions and air quality, and academic exchange and university partnerships. The partnership will build upon our shared commitment to sustainable growth, accelerate the transition to zero-emission transportation, and expand opportunities for the next generation.

Brazil: Governor Newsom signed a declaration of intention with the Brazilian federal government on innovation, as well as a partnership with the State of Pará to strengthen cooperation on wildfire prevention and response — enhancing forest monitoring, identifying areas most at risk, and sharing research and expertise to improve firefighting and emergency management. In September 2025, California announced a new partnership with Brazil to advance market-based carbon pricing programs, clean transportation expansion, including zero-emission vehicles and low-carbon fuels, and strengthen air quality management through enhanced monitoring and regulatory controls. The partnership also focuses on the conservation of 30% of lands and coastal waters by 2030, including nature-based solutions and biodiversity protection.

They build on a growing portfolio of international partnerships California has developed in recent years, including but not limited to:

Noord-Holland (2024): California and Noord-Holland signed a Letter of Intent advancing next-generation air mobility—from drones to zero-emission aircraft. Joint innovation missions are producing pilot projects that inform California’s Advanced Air Mobility Implementation Plan and readiness for major global events.

Australia (2023): California signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Australia that helped inform the country’s first-ever vehicle emissions standards through input from the California Air Resources Board. The California Public Utilities Commission and California ISO have also advised Australia on electricity market reform to better align incentives for renewable energy.

British Columbia (2023): California and British Columbia signed a Memorandum of Understanding on mutual wildfire assistance that is delivering results. British Columbia sent incident management experts to support California’s Palisades Fire in 2025, while CAL FIRE deployed personnel during B.C.’s 2025 fire season. These exchanges established a lasting framework for cross-border wildfire support.

China (2023): California signed five Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with China’s National Development and Reform Commission, the provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu, and the municipalities of Beijing, and Shanghai to advance cooperation cutting greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning away from fossil fuels, and developing clean energy.

Denmark (2021): California and Denmark signed a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on groundwater mapping, leak detection, and water efficiency has modernized California’s data systems and informed key state programs, like the Airborne Electromagnetic Survey. Danish technologies and expertise have helped strengthen drought and water-supply resilience statewide.

Mexico (Baja California & Sonora): California signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with the Mexican states of Baja California and Sonora advance zero-emission freight corridors, clean ports, and battery manufacturing — strengthening North American supply chains and workforce readiness. Joint forums have already produced new research collaborations and training programs advancing clean-tech deployment.

California’s climate leadership in action

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 21% since 2000 — even as the state’s GDP increased 81% in that same time period, all while becoming the world’s fourth largest economy.

California also continues to set clean energy records. In 2023, the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, the largest economy in the world to achieve this level. California has also run on 100% clean electricity for part of the day almost every day last year.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Weak-Trump-retreats-from-Paris-Agreement-as-California-leads-climate-action-on-the-global-stage-SEO-GFX.png,N,,2026-01-27 12:30:57.660236

At the invitation of Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Economic Affairs Minister Katherina Reiche, nine European countries are joining Germany at the North Sea Summit: Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. The European Commission, NATO and more than 140 representatives of businesses, associations and non-governmental organisations have also accepted the invitation.

Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Katherina Reiche said: “More than ever, the North Sea is a key strategic area for Europe. Together, we are strengthening our economic, security and energy policy interests in the North Sea. The vigorous expansion and smart networking of offshore energy creates affordable, clean and secure energy, reduces strategic dependencies and boosts overall European resilience. The investment pact signed today stabilises the policy framework and safeguards local value creation and high-grade industrial jobs.”

The third North Sea Summit builds on the preceding summits in Denmark in 2022 and in Belgium in 2023, at which the participating states agreed on an ambitious expansion of wind energy in the North Sea region as a response to Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis.

100 GW of cross-border generation capacity

The participating states have adopted specific measures. A special focus was placed on strengthening regional coordination and financing the expansion of offshore wind farms and the related electricity grids. The increased construction of “cooperation projects” can make more efficient use of existing sites, reduce costs and improve the resilience of the energy system. “Cooperation projects” are offshore wind farms connected to more than one country, and offshore wind farms connected from the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of other countries. Specifically, the North Sea countries have agreed on cross-border networking of up to 100 GW of generation capacity.

In a joint investment pact between the North Sea countries, the offshore wind industry and the transmission system operators, all the stakeholders have agreed on measures to realise the shared vision of the North Sea region as the world’s largest hub for clean energy. Not least, the North Sea countries aim to establish a stable pipeline of offshore wind auctions reaching beyond 2030, thus providing the wind energy and grid industry with planning and investment security. Based on this, the industry commits to reducing electricity production costs by 30% by 2040, investing €9.5 billion in new production capacities in Europe by 2030, and creating 91,000 additional jobs.

The decisions of the North Sea Summit are set out in the following joint declarations:

Hamburg Declaration of Heads of State and Government

Hamburg Declaration of Energy Ministers

Joint Offshore Wind Investment Pact for the North Seas between the North Sea countries, the offshore wind industry and the transmission system operators

In addition to this, Energy Minister Katherina Reiche signed the following international agreements on cross-border cooperation projects:

Joint Declaration of Intent on the Development of Cooperation Projects for an Interconnected Offshore Renewable Energy Grid in the North Seas

Joint Declaration of Intent on Cooperation on North Sea Renewable Energy Infrastructure

Joint Declaration of Intent on a Strategic Partnership on Energy Including Offshore Renewable Energy Cooperation Projects in the Baltic and North Seas

Germany has stated its willingness to assume the co-presidency of the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC) in 2026, and as such will press ahead with the implementation of the Summit decisions.

Military Contamination Our military, far from being just another enabler of unequal consumption and suffering, contributes mightily to the waste we live with.","Our Trash and Our Lives, Here and Abroad

I learned one of my most valuable lessons about U.S. power in my first year as a Brown University doctoral student. It was in anthropology professor Catherine Lutz’s seminar on empire and social movements. I’d sum up what I remember something like this: Americans consume one hell of a lot — cars, clothes, food, toys, expensive private colleges (ahem…), and that’s just to start. Since other countries like China, the United Kingdom, and Japan purchase substantial chunks of U.S. consumer debt, they have a vested interest in our economic stability. So, even though you and I probably feel less than empowered as we scramble to make mortgage, car, or credit-card payments, the fact that we collectively owe a bunch of money globally makes it less likely that a country like China will want to rock the boat — and that includes literally rocking the boat (as with a torpedo).

In classes like that one at Brown, I came to understand that the military power we get from owing money is self-reinforcing. It helps keep our interest rates low and, in turn, our own military can buy more supplies (especially if Donald Trump’s latest demand for a $1.5 trillion Pentagon budget goes through!). Our own debt somewhat ironically allows this country to continue to expand its reach, if not around the globe these days, at least in this hemisphere (whether you’re thinking about Venezuela or Greenland). Often when I splurge on a fancy Starbucks latte or a new pair of shoes, I think about how even critics of U.S. military hegemony like me help prop up our empire when we do what Americans do best — shop!

To put this crudely, we consume far beyond our means because our military keeps enough of us feeling secure, and we have such a large military because we consume far beyond our means.

American Trash and the Politics of Consumption

And boy, can we shop! As of August 2025, U.S. consumer debt ballooned to nearly $18 trillion and then continued to rise through the end of last year.

Here’s one consequence of our consumptive habits: we Americans throw a lot of stuff out. Per capita, we each generate an average of close to two tons of solid waste annually, if you include industrial and construction waste (closer to one ton if you don’t). Mind you, on average, that’s roughly three times what most other countries consume and throw out — much more than people even in countries with comparable per capita wealth.

Reminders of our waste are everywhere. Even in my state, Maryland, which funnels significant tax dollars into environmental conservation, you can see plastic bags and bottles tangled in the grass at the roadside, while the air in my wealthy county’s capital city often smells like car exhaust or the dirty rainwater that collects at the bottom of your trash can. Schoolchildren like mine bring home weekly piles of one-sided worksheets, PTA event flyers, plastic prizes, and holiday party favors. Even the rich soil of our rural neighborhood contains layers of trash from centuries of agricultural, household, and military activity, all of which remind me of the ecological footprint we’re leaving to our children and grandchildren.

To our credit, some of us try to be mindful of that. In recent years, three different public debates about how to fuel our consumptive habits (and where to put the byproducts) have taken place in my region. Residents continue to argue about where to dispose of the hundreds of thousands of tons of our county’s waste (much of it uneaten food) that’s currently incinerated near the scenic farmland where I live. Do we let it stay here, where it pollutes the land and water, not to mention the air, and disturbs our pastoral views? Or do we haul at least some of the residual ash to neighboring counties and states, to areas that tend to be poor majority-minority ones? While some local advocacy groups oppose the exporting (so to speak) of our trash, it continues to happen.

A related dispute has taken place in an adjacent county that’s somewhat less wealthy but also majority White. That debate centers on the appropriate restrictions on a data center to be built there that will store information we access on the Internet and that’s expected to span thousands of acres. How far away need it be from residents’ homes and farms? Will people be forced to sell their land to build it?

While many of our concerns are understandable — I’m not ready to move so that we can have a data center nearby — it turns out that some worries animating such discussions are (to put it kindly) aesthetic in nature. Recently, a neighbor I’d never met called me to try to enlist our family in a debate about whether some newcomers, a rare Indian-American family around here, could construct a set of solar panels in a field along a main road, where feed crops like alfalfa can usually be seen blooming in the springtime.

My neighbor’s concern: that the new family wanted to use those fields for solar panels to supply clean energy to their community (stated with emphasis, which I presumed to denote the Asian-Americans who would assumedly visit them for celebrations and holidays). Heaven forbid! She worried that the panels would disrupt the views of passersby like us and injure a habitat for the bald eagle — ironic concerns given how much of a mess so many of us have already made renovating our outbuildings, raising our dogs and chicken flocks, and chopping down trees that get in the way of our homes or social gatherings.

Many such concerns are raised sincerely by people who care deeply about land and community. However, the fact that, to some, solar panels are less desirable than the kinds of crops that look nice or feed our desire for more red meat should reframe the debate about whose version of consumption (and garbage) should be acceptable at all.

Indeed, not all of us create or live with garbage to the same degree. Compared to White populations, Black populations are 100% more likely and communities of Asian descent 200% more likely to live within six miles of a U.S. Superfund site (among America’s most polluted places). Such proximity is, in turn, linked to higher rates of cancer, asthma, and birth defects.

Nor do Whites suffer such impacts in the same ways. According to an analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency — and let’s appreciate such an analysis while we still have access to it, since the Trump administration’s EPA just decided to stop tracking the human impact of pollution — Black Americans breathe in more than half of the pollution that they generate, Hispanic Americans more than 60% of what they create, and — ready for this? — White Americans inhale about 17% less than they make.

Military Contamination

Our military, far from being just another enabler of unequal consumption and suffering, contributes mightily to the waste we live with. In the U.S., hundreds of military bases are contaminated by so-called forever chemicals, such as PFAS, in the drinking water and the soil. We’re talking about chemicals associated with cancer, heart conditions, birth defects, and other chronic health problems. The civilian populations surrounding such bases are often low-income and disproportionately people of color. Of course, also disproportionately impacted are the military families and veterans who live and work around such bases, and tend to have inadequate healthcare to address such issues.

An example would be the Naval Submarine Base in New London, where my family spent a significant amount of time. Encompassing more than 700 acres along the Thames River, that base was designated a Superfund site in 1990 due to contamination from unsanctioned landfills, chemical storage, and waste burial, all of which put heavy metals, pesticides, and other toxic substances into the environment.

Rather than bore you with more statistics, let me share how it feels to stand on its grounds. Picture a wide, deep river, slate gray and flanked by deciduous trees. On the bank opposite the base, multifamily housing and the occasional restaurant have been wrought from what were once factories. After you pass the guard station, a museum to your left shows off all manner of missiles, torpedoes, and other weaponry, along with displays depicting the living spaces of sailors inside submarines, with bunks decorated with the occasional photo of scantily clad White women (presumably meant to boost troop morale).

To your right, there are brick barracks, office buildings, takeout restaurants, even a bowling alley, and submarines, their rounded turrets poking out of the water. Along roadways leading through the base, old torpedoes are painted in bright colors like children’s furniture and repurposed as monuments to America’s military might. The air smells like asphalt and metal. Signs of life are everywhere, from the seagulls that swoop down to catch fish to the sailors and their families you see moving about in cars. It’s hard to comprehend that I’m also standing on what reporters have called “a minefield of pollution… a dumping ground for whatever [the base] needed to dispose of: sulfuric acid, torpedo fuel, waste oil, and incinerator ash.”

Empire of Waste

When I say that our military produces a lot of garbage, I don’t just mean in this country. I also include what it does abroad and the countries like Israel that we patronize and arm. Last summer, I corresponded with anthropologist Sophia Stamatopoulou-Robbins, who spent more than a year documenting the human casualties and costs of what the Israeli military and other Israelis have done in Israeli-occupied Palestine. That includes the mass dumping of garbage there from Israeli territories and the barricading of Palestinian communities from waste disposal sites, all of which have led to environmental contamination.

For example, Stamatopoulou-Robbins visited the 5,000-person Palestinian village of Shuqba, surrounded by open land on all sides and controlled by the Israeli government. Nearby cities and settlements dump waste, including X-ray images, household appliances, broken electronics like cell phones, industrial waste, wrecked vehicles, and car parts right in its neighborhood. One young man told Stamatopoulou-Robbins that he and his wife couldn’t have a baby because of the toxic environment. Many others, he told her, experienced the same problem, along with higher-than-average rates of cancer and respiratory and skin problems. His story, Stamatopoulou-Robbins wrote me, was one of many similar tales in Shuqba, tales that multiplied across the West Bank, where Israeli settlements and trucks from Israel, as she put it, “regularly dump their wastes in proximity to Palestinian residential areas and farmland.”

Her research drives home how we experience pollution all too often depends on who we are. I’m a case in point. My family and I pride ourselves on being the first to inhabit our sprawling rural property since the family whose ancestors built a home on it in 1890 and passed it down to two subsequent generations. In 2020, when we initially came to look at it, we couldn’t afford the asking price. However, the older couple who, in the end, sold it to us wanted a family in the house who would raise children there as they had. As they put it flatteringly, we were a “salt-of-the-earth” family (and the feeling was mutual).

Trash and Belonging

Nowadays, the news abounds with references to who is a “real” American, and who belongs beyond our borders. References to purity and contamination apply not just to our growing piles of waste but to human beings, too. Consider candidate Donald Trump’s promise, at a 2023 campaign rally, to “root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country,” or his claim that Representative Ilhan Omar and other Somali immigrants are nothing less than — yes — “garbage.”

And it’s true that what (or who) we consider garbage, and what (or who) we tolerate in our field of vision matters. My family recently renovated an old cabin behind our house to serve as an office for me to see my psychotherapy patients in person. The idea was that the veterans and military families who come to me for help with trauma, many of whom themselves are lower-income people of color, would have a peaceful place to process it.

As we demolished an outer wall to add a bathroom to my new office, something fell out of that wall: an old paper advertisement for black licorice candy (“Licorice Bites”) that depicted a Black baby, eyes wide in the stereotypical fashion of Jim Crow Era ads, trying to crawl away from an alligator, its mouth gaping open. Good thing, I thought, that it hadn’t fallen out of that drywall when a patient of mine was there. The experience, while fleeting, reminded me of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates’s point that Americans so easily minimize foreign genocides because we’ve done such a striking job of burying (in the case of my house, literally!) the atrocities of slavery, the segregated world that followed it, and their role in our country’s expansion.

Whoever put it there, that ad in my cabin wall — just like local gossip about that Indian-American family — is a reminder of who belongs and who doesn’t in this country. Like an Egyptian pyramid filled with a pharaoh’s possessions, remnants of American lives remind us of how some of us are kept sick, intimidated, and belittled, while feeding the appetites of others.

In the meantime, I think progressives would do well to consider how important it is that our signs, our social media posts, our political speeches, and even our patterns of consumption send a message — that many are welcome here, skin color, pronouns, and even specific brands of left-wing ideology be damned. Who is “of this earth” is questionable at best.

We should also ask why pictures denigrating Black people and half-naked women, and monuments to weaponry, so excite the patriotic souls of enough Americans that it’s easy to find them throughout our land. We cannot continue to allow the other side’s exclusionary ideals to dominate today’s political messaging.

Rising demand and new technologies are forcing utilities to coordinate distributed energy resources on an unprecedented scale, a trend likely to continue in 2026, analysts and stakeholders say.

But intimidating demand forecasts from power-hungry data centers, coupled with aggressive policy shifts away from renewables and efficiency standards, are turning power providers toward large-scale generation like nuclear, geothermal, gas and coal — possibly to the detriment of aggregation and demand response programs, they say.

“Utilities are shifting away from DER to focus on [utility-scale] wind and solar in the near term and then new natural gas, [extending the life of] aging coal, and [restarting] shuttered nuclear plants,” said Sally Jacquemin, vice president of power and utilities at AspenTech Digital Grid Management, Emerson.

Investment in distribution system modernization is also growing, but DER “is a lower priority,” she added.

But grid advocates and utility leaders say distributed resources could provide crucial benefits at a time of rising prices and accelerate the interconnection of large loads, which is a priority of the Trump administration.

In order to do that, virtual power plants must evolve and scale more rapidly or skyrocketing electricity demand and costs will force attention to traditional resources, industry sources say. The value of DER to the system will be determined by policies set by states, grid operators, federal regulators and officials in the Trump administration.

Allison Wannop, vice president of regulatory affairs and wholesale markets for Sparkfund, predicted that demand growth and affordability challenges will drive innovation to make the most of distribution system resources.

“20th century solutions will not build a 21st century grid,” she said.

‘Visibility will be key to VPP proliferation’

2025 was a good year for distributed energy resources and virtual power plants.

The numbers of active company deployments, unique offtakers for VPP capacity and monetized VPP programs all grew by at least one-third year over year, according to a September analysis by Wood Mackenzie.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

But overall VPP capacity in North America grew only 13.7%, to 37.5 GW, a sign that the market is “broadening faster than it is deepening” due to persistent barriers to adoption, said Ben Hertz-Shargel, WoodMac’s Global Head of Grid Edge.

Many of these programs are still in pilot phase or otherwise limited in scope and effectiveness.

According to one recent analysis, VPPs are still a long way off from being considered an alternative to gas peaker plants.

The analysis from software provider EnergyHub proposed a Turing Test-inspired evaluation, called the “Huels Test” after one of the company’s data scientists, which compares a VPP’s performance against a peaker. On a scale of zero to four for “maturity” needed to pass the test by delivering “plant-like performance,” the most advanced VPPs only scored about a two.

2026 could be a decisive year for improving those scores.

Amid an unprecedented capital spending spree, utilities are poised to make foundational investments in distributed energy resource management systems, or DERMS, and data management systems to modernize their grids.

“Pressure on utilities to serve new loads will drive adoption of new system capabilities,” said Jen Downing, a former senior advisor in the Department of Energy and co-author of DOE’s VPP Lift-Off reports.

VPPs will not meet large baseload needs, but “for peak demand reductions of up to 20%, they are a proven cost-effective option,” she added. That could make them competitive against, for example, diesel generators deployed by hyperscalers to meet a daily two-hour peak, she said.

Of course, she noted that the total cost over time “is project-specific and depends on capital costs, fuel costs, the local grid and other variables.”

Prominent VPP technology providers expressed optimism about the sector’s outlook.

“Affordably meeting the new loads is the priority,” said Gisela Glandt, vice president of VPPs for grid edge software provider Uplight.

In 2026, utilities and their partners will develop “end-to-end distribution system management,” and “that visibility will be key to VPP proliferation,” she added.

Important federal policy shifts for distributed resources

At the federal level, regulatory, legislative and other policy decisions could have big impacts on VPPs and aggregated DER adoption.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump on July 4 cut incentives for both utility-scale and residential solar systems, as well as tax credits aimed at weatherization, energy efficiency and appliance upgrades. The administration has also moved to weaken support for electric vehicles, roll back efficiency standards, ease pollution rules and cancel clean energy grants and loans.

Taken together, these actions could slow the pace of electrification and the proliferation of resources like solar panels, electric vehicles, batteries, heat pumps, smart appliances and thermostats that could be harnessed into virtual power plants.

“The macro trends for utilities in 2026 will be driven by the loss of tax incentives for renewables and customer-owned resources,” said AspenTech’s Jacquemin.

And with increasing costs for transmission and distribution infrastructure, “pricing to consumers is what is most on utility executives’ minds,” she added.

At the same time, however, federal regulators – at the urging of the White House – are considering ways to accelerate the interconnection of data centers, which the administration considers critical to the economy and national security.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has initiated a rulemaking process for connecting large loads after Energy Secretary Chris Wright called for it to take a more active role, including by prioritizing flexibility.

Any order resulting from that process is likely to include flexibility requirements, said Nancy Chafetz, vice president of regulatory and government affairs for DER aggregator CPower.

The question in 2026 will be whether VPP compensation for energy, capacity and ancillary services at the wholesale and retail levels will be adequate to incentivize participation, she said.

Emerald AI, one of the most advanced providers of software to manage data center load flexibility, is in the process of including distribution system resources, including aggregated customer-owned DER, into its platform, said Varun Sivaram, its CEO. That capability should be in place in 2026, he added.

FERC will also continue to review compliance filings for 2020’s Order 2222, which required system operators to include aggregated DER in their wholesale markets.

But Kay Aikin, CEO of software platform provider Dynamic Grid, said “the lack of coordination at the wholesale-local market overlap will lead to operational issues.”

MISO’s Joundi, CPower’s Chafetz, and the Wood Mackenzie report also said they expected little from Order 2222 compliance.

Market rules shape incentives

Some of 2026’s most influential policy will be determined by system and market operators.

In 2025, federally-regulated regional systems integrated more VPP capacity than investor-owned utilities, Wood Mackenzie reported. Markets facing the biggest proposed data center loads – the PJM Interconnection and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas – used VPPs the most, it added.

But an October announcement from PJM, the biggest U.S. system operator, could have less favorable impacts for DER than it might seem.

PJM increased the Effective Load Carrying Capability, or ELCC, value for demand side resources in its 2027-28 capacity auction from 69% to 92%. ELCC is used to evaluate reliability and seeks to quantify a resource’s availability to reduce demand spikes.

The higher valuation favors distributed demand-side resources by effectively assigning them a greater reliability score. But narrowed eligibility requirements shut out many residential and smaller commercial participants, Uplight’s Glandt said.

Existing PJM rules credit demand resources for reducing load more than they actually do, which means that their “actual performance has never been good,” said Joe Bowring, president of PJM independent market watchdog Monitoring Analytics.

And PJM’s proposed rule revisions will not improve their performance because they do not link compensation to availability, he said. The new rules “are equivalent to the status quo that has increased the costs to PJM customers by about $16.6 billion over the last two capacity auctions,” Monitoring Analytics reported in November.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, capacity value methodology also significantly increased the value of flexible and demand resources in 2025, its 2025-26 Direct Loss of Load report showed.

Proposed MISO reforms would drive more flexibility in its load-modifying and demand response resources, said Zak Joundi, MISO’s head of market development. Under this system, new price signals will “support reliability by either reducing load or turning on distribution system generation,” he added.

Those reforms are still proposals that are expected to be reviewed for approval by MISO member states and FERC between 2026 and 2028, Zoundi said. And under the existing market incentives, use of demand resources could dip in 2026 if sudden demand peaks are less frequent, he added.

But, Zoundi stressed, “the business case for wholesale market resources that can come online faster and be more flexible will likely grow over time.”

Nicholas Papanastassiou, director of market development for software provider EnergyHub, agreed. But “targetedutility demand response programs” of aggregated DER “can more reliably shave demand peaks” and “deliver ratepayer savings without the complexities of wholesale market programs,” he added.

Use of DER has grown in the Texas Emergency Response Service program available through retail electric providers, Papanastassiou said. That shows the effectiveness of demand response for distribution system companies, he added.

Already, the market for aggregation and flexibility services appears to be growing.

Piclo marketplace, which launched in Massachusetts last July, is a flexibility services market that allows utilities to connect with DER aggregators and bid for the flexible services offered. It has over 100 aggregators and asset owners to date and will continueto add market participants and move intomore states in 2026, it reported.

States can move where federal government does not

While federal and regional market policies shake out, states could push for greater aggregation, policy advocates said. Public anger over rising power bills is already pushing some elected officials to take action.

On her first day in office Jan. 20, New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill declared an energy affordability crisis and issued executive orders that, among other things, directed state regulators to require utilities develop virtual power plant programs.

Her order came on the heels of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signing the Clean and Reliable Grid Act setting new storage targets and VPP requirements for that state.

A number of states are also weighing legislation to promote consumer access to small, plug-in “balcony” solar, heat pumps and other resources that could be aggregated. Others are proposing that large load data centers pay for customer-sited resources in return for the use of them during demand peaks.

“20th century solutions will not build a 21st century grid.”

Allison Wannop

Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and Wholesale Markets for Sparkfund

California, which advocates say boasts the largest virtual power plant in the country and possibly the world, has cut state funding for aggregation but continues to set new records for deployed capacity.

The growing role of states is the reason the Energy Policy Design Institute launched its VPP Convergence Project, a coalition of advocates attempting to standardize regulatory approaches to VPPs, said its Founder and Executive Director Ted Ko.

The variety of VPP business models, technologies, use cases and system services makes state regulators’ decision-making increasingly difficult, Ko said. The VPP Convergence Project, which is working with the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, intends to “bring clarity to those decisions,” he added.

Across the country, utilities, grid operators and other stakeholders are experimenting with different approaches to aggregated DER and VPPs, said Autumn Proudlove, managing director of policy and markets with the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center, or NCCETC.

She pointed to pilots from Dominion Virginia,Duke Energy,Pacific Power,Xcel Minnesota,DTE Michigan andArizona Public Service as just a few examples. But Proudlove said many utilities still do not appreciate the full value of aggregated DER in long-term planning.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ynH3-VmHynPF-tebTq8YcabwA-udqCmEJxPjKC7hwJs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9iYWxjb255X3NvbGFyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-27 12:32:40.687498

In Canada, two women were found dead during wellness checks in Montreal as utilities in Quebec and elsewhere struggled with power outages. In the U.S., Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration across 134 counties, while a self-described “methane hunter” reported dozens of emissions “events” in the state’s oil and gas industry.

“Remember: Oil and gas infrastructure is fragile. Any weather event causes problems,” Sharon Wilson wrote on LinkedIn. “The oil and gas industry cannot survive the extreme weather it is creating.”

‘Piercing Cold’

CBC reports “piercing cold”, record-breaking lows, power outages, and hundreds of cancelled flights across much of Canada, with a map that shows weather alerts in 10 out of 13 provinces and territories as of Monday afternoon. “A polar vortex has blanketed much of the country in recent days, prompting Environment Canada to issue orange alerts for many jurisdictions—denoting that it believes severe weather is likely to result in significant damage, disruption, or health impacts,” the news story states.

Montreal saw continuing power outages, with two women found dead during separate wellness checks in the Nôtre-Dame-de-Grace and Montreal West neighbourhoods. Atlantic Canada has seen a week of heavy snow, with provincial utility Nova Scotia Power reporting record electricity consumption and “localized issues and outages”. Newfoundland & Labrador Hydro said its Bay d’Espoir hydropower plant was gradually coming back online Sunday after divers removed ice sheets “the size of mattresses” from the equipment. The utility warned households they might still face rotating power shortages.

In the United States, the remaining staff at the National Weather Service (NWS) reported “life-threatening” conditions across the country as a dangerous winter storm killed at least seven people across four states, closed schools and roads, cancelled more than 11,000 flights, and cut off power to at least 800,000 households. the British Broadcasting Corporation reports. “The snow and the ice will be very, very slow to melt and won’t be going away anytime soon, and that’s going to hinder any recovery efforts,” said NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli.

“The polar vortex—a ring of strong westerly winds that form above the Arctic every winter containing a pool of very cold air—led to the powerful storm,” BBC writes, in a news item that also included a working definition of “freezing rain” for UK listeners and readers. “When the winds are strong, they stay in place, however when the winds weaken, the vortex loops further south and cold air plunges toward [southern Canada and] the U.S. As the cold air meets mild air in the south, the air rises and storm fronts form.”

Energy Infrastructure Can’t Take It

Even more in the U.S. than in Canada, energy infrastructure was vulnerable to the extreme cold—and consumers faced spiking fossil energy prices before the worst of the storms even hit.

“Natural gas prices are already soaring as a potentially historic winter storm is expected to sweep through the country this weekend,” Politico Power Switch wrote last Friday. “Customers could get slapped with record-high power bills as extreme cold, high winds, and blankets of ice, sleet, and snow threaten local power lines and the natural gas infrastructure needed to fuel gas-fired power plants.”

Last Thursday, Politico said, a White House spokesperson “dismissed concerns about the potential for a natural gas price spike, which would add to the political storm the Trump administration is already facing over the rise in electricity bills associated with the buildout of artificial intelligence data centres.”

Bloomberg News said gas prices had spiked 75% in three days—much to the delight of hedge fund investors who’d recently been moving away from those stocks. Reuters reported that the 67 million electricity customers in the PJM Interconnection grid, which serves the eastern and mid-Atlantic regions, paid more than $3,000 per megawatt-hour ($3 per kilowatt-hour) for electricity they consumed Saturday morning, compared to early rates below $200/MWh.

Bloomberg said more than 175 million people across the U.S. were facing intense winter conditions and extreme cold. By Monday, Politico reported, nearly a million households and businesses from Texas to Tennessee had lost power, “and that may just be the beginning,” with temperatures “expected to fall below zero over the Appalachian natural gas fields that help supply heat and power” to the eastern U.S. “The deep chill could threaten to freeze critical equipment for producing and distributing a fuel that accounts for more than 40% of the eastern United States’ electric power, and will test the industry’s efforts to winterize its gear.”

Over the weekend, Utility Dive writes, a series of emergency orders from the U.S. Department of Energy allowed grid operators in New England, Texas, and the mid-Atlantic states to waive air quality and other permit limitations to operate their available power plants at full capacity. In many jurisdictions, this type of order often involves heavily polluting diesel or natural gas “peaker” plants that are permitted to operate with fewer climate or other environmental controls on the basis that they’ll be used in relatively short bursts to help a utility grid meet maximum demand, not for extended time spans.

Major Methane Leaks in Texas Gas Fields

Methane hunter Sharon Wilson said the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality had reported 29 “emission events” as of Sunday and 38 by Monday. On LinkedIn, she explained why malfunctions at the midpoint in the natural gas production process lead to major methane leaks.

“Upstream is where holes are drilled. Midstream is where the gas processing plants and compressor stations are. Downstream is where the power plants and LNG terminals are, and where distribution to homes [takes place],” she wrote.

“A midstream upset at a gas processing plant can cause everything upstream to become over-pressured because it is likely there is nowhere for the gas to flow. It’s like putting a dam on a river. All the tributaries flowing into that river will flood because the water cannot flow downstream. Compressor stations push the gas through the pipelines from upstream facilities to the midstream processing plants”—and her post includes examples of the very large methane releases that result.

In a separate post, Wilson recalled the hundreds of Texans who died in 2021 when multiple generating facilities—mostly gas plants, but also wind, coal, and nuclear installations—tripped offline due to the extreme cold brought on by a winter storm. She asserted that one gas pipeline company “raked in $2.4 billion during the blackouts” and was later sued for “price gouging” by the municipal utility in San Antonio.

Climate Denial Delusions Debunked

Not to be outdone, as much of the United States faced numbing cold, treacherous ice, and heavy snow, Donald Trump used social media to dispute that the world is warming, The Associated Press reports.

In a 25-word post on his “Truth” “Social “account Friday, Trump questioned how the world can be warming when it is so cold, and called the temperatures nearly unprecedented. He also called advocates and scientists “environmental insurrectionists.”

More than a dozen scientists Friday told AP those claims were wrong, writes veteran science reporter Seth Borenstein. They point out that even in a warmer world, winter and cold occur, and they never said otherwise. They note that even as it is cold in the eastern United States (and across most of the northern half of North America), more of the world is warmer than average. They also stressed the difference between daily and local weather and long-term, planet-wide climate change.

Meteorologists also said global warming over the past couple of decades may make this cold seem unprecedented and record-smashing. But U.S. government records show it has been much colder in the past.

“This social media post crams a remarkable amount of inflammatory language and factually inaccurate assertions into a very short statement,” said climate scientist Daniel Swain of the California Institute for Water Resources. “First of all, global warming continues—and has in fact been progressing at an increased rate in recent years.”

Some research also links the relatively recent rise of the polar vortex to a weakened polar jet stream, brought on by a warming Arctic.

With much of North America shivering under Arctic temperatures, power utilities and the United States gas industry are buckling under the impact of the climate extremes they’ve played a central role in bringing about.

In Canada, two women were found dead during wellness checks in Montreal as utilities in Quebec and elsewhere struggled with power outages. In the U.S., Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration across 134 counties, while a self-described “methane hunter” reported dozens of emissions “events” in the state’s oil and gas industry.

“Remember: Oil and gas infrastructure is fragile. Any weather event causes problems,” Sharon Wilson wrote on LinkedIn. “The oil and gas industry cannot survive the extreme weather it is creating.”

‘Piercing Cold’

CBC reports “piercing cold”, record-breaking lows, power outages, and hundreds of cancelled flights across much of Canada, with a map that shows weather alerts in 10 out of 13 provinces and territories as of Monday afternoon. “A polar vortex has blanketed much of the country in recent days, prompting Environment Canada to issue orange alerts for many jurisdictions—denoting that it believes severe weather is likely to result in significant damage, disruption, or health impacts,” the news story states.

Montreal saw continuing power outages, with two women found dead during separate wellness checks in the Nôtre-Dame-de-Grace and Montreal West neighbourhoods. Atlantic Canada has seen a week of heavy snow, with provincial utility Nova Scotia Power reporting record electricity consumption and “localized issues and outages”. Newfoundland & Labrador Hydro said its Bay d’Espoir hydropower plant was gradually coming back online Sunday after divers removed ice sheets “the size of mattresses” from the equipment. The utility warned households they might still face rotating power shortages.

In the United States, the remaining staff at the National Weather Service (NWS) reported “life-threatening” conditions across the country as a dangerous winter storm killed at least seven people across four states, closed schools and roads, cancelled more than 11,000 flights, and cut off power to at least 800,000 households. the British Broadcasting Corporation reports. “The snow and the ice will be very, very slow to melt and won’t be going away anytime soon, and that’s going to hinder any recovery efforts,” said NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli.

“The polar vortex—a ring of strong westerly winds that form above the Arctic every winter containing a pool of very cold air—led to the powerful storm,” BBC writes, in a news item that also included a working definition of “freezing rain” for UK listeners and readers. “When the winds are strong, they stay in place, however when the winds weaken, the vortex loops further south and cold air plunges toward [southern Canada and] the U.S. As the cold air meets mild air in the south, the air rises and storm fronts form.”

Energy Infrastructure Can’t Take It

Even more in the U.S. than in Canada, energy infrastructure was vulnerable to the extreme cold—and consumers faced spiking fossil energy prices before the worst of the storms even hit.

“Natural gas prices are already soaring as a potentially historic winter storm is expected to sweep through the country this weekend,” Politico Power Switch wrote last Friday. “Customers could get slapped with record-high power bills as extreme cold, high winds, and blankets of ice, sleet, and snow threaten local power lines and the natural gas infrastructure needed to fuel gas-fired power plants.”

Last Thursday, Politico said, a White House spokesperson “dismissed concerns about the potential for a natural gas price spike, which would add to the political storm the Trump administration is already facing over the rise in electricity bills associated with the buildout of artificial intelligence data centres.”

Bloomberg News said gas prices had spiked 75% in three days—much to the delight of hedge fund investors who’d recently been moving away from those stocks. Reuters reported that the 67 million electricity customers in the PJM Interconnection grid, which serves the eastern and mid-Atlantic regions, paid more than $3,000 per megawatt-hour ($3 per kilowatt-hour) for electricity they consumed Saturday morning, compared to early rates below $200/MWh.

Bloomberg said more than 175 million people across the U.S. were facing intense winter conditions and extreme cold. By Monday, Politico reported, nearly a million households and businesses from Texas to Tennessee had lost power, “and that may just be the beginning,” with temperatures “expected to fall below zero over the Appalachian natural gas fields that help supply heat and power” to the eastern U.S. “The deep chill could threaten to freeze critical equipment for producing and distributing a fuel that accounts for more than 40% of the eastern United States’ electric power, and will test the industry’s efforts to winterize its gear.”

Over the weekend, Utility Dive writes, a series of emergency orders from the U.S. Department of Energy allowed grid operators in New England, Texas, and the mid-Atlantic states to waive air quality and other permit limitations to operate their available power plants at full capacity. In many jurisdictions, this type of order often involves heavily polluting diesel or natural gas “peaker” plants that are permitted to operate with fewer climate or other environmental controls on the basis that they’ll be used in relatively short bursts to help a utility grid meet maximum demand, not for extended time spans.

Major Methane Leaks in Texas Gas Fields

Methane hunter Sharon Wilson said the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality had reported 29 “emission events” as of Sunday and 38 by Monday. On LinkedIn, she explained why malfunctions at the midpoint in the natural gas production process lead to major methane leaks.

“Upstream is where holes are drilled. Midstream is where the gas processing plants and compressor stations are. Downstream is where the power plants and LNG terminals are, and where distribution to homes [takes place],” she wrote.

“A midstream upset at a gas processing plant can cause everything upstream to become over-pressured because it is likely there is nowhere for the gas to flow. It’s like putting a dam on a river. All the tributaries flowing into that river will flood because the water cannot flow downstream. Compressor stations push the gas through the pipelines from upstream facilities to the midstream processing plants”—and her post includes examples of the very large methane releases that result.

In a separate post, Wilson recalled the hundreds of Texans who died in 2021 when multiple generating facilities—mostly gas plants, but also wind, coal, and nuclear installations—tripped offline due to the extreme cold brought on by a winter storm. She asserted that one gas pipeline company “raked in $2.4 billion during the blackouts” and was later sued for “price gouging” by the municipal utility in San Antonio.

Climate Denial Delusions Debunked

Not to be outdone, as much of the United States faced numbing cold, treacherous ice, and heavy snow, Donald Trump used social media to dispute that the world is warming, The Associated Press reports.

In a 25-word post on his “Truth” “Social “account Friday, Trump questioned how the world can be warming when it is so cold, and called the temperatures nearly unprecedented. He also called advocates and scientists “environmental insurrectionists.”

More than a dozen scientists Friday told AP those claims were wrong, writes veteran science reporter Seth Borenstein. They point out that even in a warmer world, winter and cold occur, and they never said otherwise. They note that even as it is cold in the eastern United States (and across most of the northern half of North America), more of the world is warmer than average. They also stressed the difference between daily and local weather and long-term, planet-wide climate change.

Meteorologists also said global warming over the past couple of decades may make this cold seem unprecedented and record-smashing. But U.S. government records show it has been much colder in the past.

“This social media post crams a remarkable amount of inflammatory language and factually inaccurate assertions into a very short statement,” said climate scientist Daniel Swain of the California Institute for Water Resources. “First of all, global warming continues—and has in fact been progressing at an increased rate in recent years.”

Some research also links the relatively recent rise of the polar vortex to a weakened polar jet stream, brought on by a warming Arctic.

This takes the total gains since 19 January to almost 120%. Yet the move in US natural gas is even more astonishing when looking at the spot Henry Hub price, which briefly broke above $30/MMBtu in recent days. It’s been driven by a severe winter storm across the US. This is impacting natural gas production and boosting heating demand. The storm is estimated to have hit around 11% of US natural gas production. The key question for the outlook, obviously, is how long this disruption lasts. There are some signs that production is already recovering, with gas output from the Permian estimated to be up 11% day-on-day yesterday. If this trend continues, it suggests prices have likely peaked.

Developments in the US natural gas market remain a concern for the European market, as supply disruptions could weigh on US LNG exports to Europe. In recent days, US LNG plants have significantly reduced their gas intake, estimated to be down around 48%, which will translate into reduced LNG exports from these plants. TTF continues to trade at a healthy premium to Asian LNG to ensure LNG cargoes move into Europe, where storage has now fallen below 45% full. It’s looking increasingly likely that storage will end the 25/26 heating season at below 25% full. This would also be below the levels seen in 2022. The difference between 2022 and 2026 is that we are currently seeing significant LNG supply ramp-ups, which should help soothe supply concerns to some extent.

Oil prices settled lower yesterday, with ICE Brent closing down more than 0.4%. The US winter storm should also support demand for heating fuels, as reflected in the heating oil crack. Freezing conditions will disrupt US oil output. The weather has also affected refinery operations. So, refinery run rates have fallen in recent days.

There are also signs that the honeymoon phase between the US and the new Venezuelan leader may be coming to an end, with President Delcy Rodriguez saying Venezuela has had enough of US interference. While these comments may be more for internal consumption, they are certainly worth keeping an eye on, as they could alter the outlook for Venezuelan oil supply.

Kazakhstan’s oil output is set to recover, with Tengizchevroil restoring power to its Tengiz field. Operations at the Tengiz and Korolev fields, which produced around 890k b/d over the first three quarters of 2025, were halted last week due to power issues. Meanwhile, the completion of repair work at the CPC terminal should also support a recovery in export flows. A recovery in these flows should improve availability in the prompt market, putting some pressure on the Brent prompt spread, which has strengthened significantly through January. The strength in timespreads has been at odds with estimates for a large oil surplus.",https://think.ing.com/uploads/hero/_w800h450/shutterstock_440689339.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 12:32:45.384615

The Detroit automaker ended 2025 with more than 620,000 Super Cruise subscribers, an 80% increase from 2024.

At the same time, Super Cruise only drove about $234 million in revenue by the end of 2025.

General Motors' headline to investors today is that it weathered uneven electric-vehicle demand, regulatory whiplash, and a challenging tariff environment better than most automakers did in 2025. But one of its bigger wins from last year didn't come from selling cars.

Ahead of its fourth-quarter and 2025 annual earnings call today, GM announced that its software and subscription business is quickly gaining steam. The automaker said that last year, it recorded $5.4 billion in deferred revenue (meaning unearned revenue over time, through a recurring service) from its various OnStar-related connected services. These include various safety systems, in-car WiFi, access to audio streaming apps and more. GM is projecting deferred revenue from software to rise to $7.5 billion in 2026.

The bigger news, however, may be the user growth of Super Cruise, GM's hands-free highway automated driving assistance system (ADAS). GM says it ended 2025 with more than 620,000 Super Cruise subscribers, up 80% from the previous year. Super Cruise allows a driver to take their hands off the wheel while they monitor the road on more than 750,000 miles of mapped roads in the U.S. and Canada. By 2028, GM aims to take the technology ""eyes-off"" as well, starting with the lidar-equipped Cadillac Escalade IQ.

""When we sell a vehicle with Super Cruise, we include three years of prepaid services on that, so that balances over a three-year period,"" GM CFO Paul Jacobson said on today's earnings call. ""So what you're seeing is growth in those initial rates as we ramp up production and sales of vehicles equipped with Super Cruise.""

But Jacobson added that subscription renewals are on the rise as well. After three years, the ""low 40% range"" of customers opts to keep paying for it, he said.

On today's investor call, GM CEO Mary Barra declined to elaborate on what features might be added to Super Cruise over time as the company works toward eyes-off ADAS. ""We have a roadmap that we're working through, where we continue to expand and add more features that we haven't announced yet,"" Barra said. ""Stay tuned on that.""

GM also said that it's driving revenue through Super Cruise in used vehicle purchases, an area where automakers typically don't make money, aside from parts for repairs.

At the same time, Super Cruise generated $234 million in revenue in 2025. While GM said that number is expected to rise to ""almost $400 million"" in 2026, it's a long way to go to recoup the presumably copious investments in autonomous technology, including its now-scrapped Cruise robotaxi service.

But for GM’s balance sheet, the subscription and Super Cruise revenue growth shows progress toward what nearly every automaker now wants: making money beyond just selling cars one at a time. The global auto industry is chasing tech company-like valuations and seeking recurring revenue through subscriptions and software.

With this level of connectivity, GM hopes to add more digital features and upgrades to cars over time. ""OnStar is really laying the foundation for ... software-defined vehicles down the road,"" Jacobson said.

That will no doubt be on the minds of many investors and auto industry observers this year, including at Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday. The electric automaker, which just lost its EV sales crown to BYD amid a pivot away from new models toward autonomous driving, recently ended its Autopilot features in an apparent push toward subscription Full Self-Driving (Supervised). FSD costs $99 per month to use, but CEO Elon Musk has said that price will rise as ""capabilities improve.""

Many automakers are building similar playbooks around subscription features. Hands-free highway driving is among the top-requested features for car owners. On a compatible GM vehicle, Super Cruise costs about $40 per month, but it can also be bundled as a free trial.

In many instances, however, customers have balked at paying subscription fees for features that were once included upfront with their car purchase. BMW drew considerable ire from its drivers several years ago after charging a subscription fee for heated seats in some markets, leading it to quickly backtrack.

GM's decision not to use Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in its EVs—and over time, in its gas-powered cars too—has proven extremely controversial. In place of the popular smartphone mirroring systems, GM's EV proprieatry software uses various third-party apps like Spotify and Apple Music, but various features still require a paid subscription.

Meanwhile, GM reported adjusted earnings of $12.7 billion in 2025, a 15% decline compared to 2024. GM also incurred $3.1 billion in losses over new tariffs implemented by the Trump administration.

Still, it finished the year on the higher end of its guidance, even as it recorded a $6 billion loss to dial back EV production with demand expected to slow without the $7,500 tax credit.

""We continue to believe in EVs, and our portfolio brought almost 100,000 new customers to GM in 2025,"" Barra said in a letter to shareholders. ""We know these drivers do not often go back to gas, so we will continue executing our plan to reduce EV-related costs, and we remain confident in our path to EV profitability.""

Dispute Resolution Frameworks and Operational Performance: G2G Mechanisms Replacing ISDS TEPA grants G2G consultations by use of Joint Committee structures over investment arbitration as the main method of dispute settlement.","On 1 October 2025, India’s Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (“TEPA”) with the European Free Trade Association (“EFTA”), introduced a novel institutional framework that moves beyond traditional investor-state dispute settlement (“ISDS”) mechanisms. The TEPA operationalises binding government investment commitments (USD 100 billion over 15 years) paired with dedicated facilitation infrastructure (the India-EFTA Desk (“Desk”), operational since February 2025) and preventive dispute settlement mechanisms. This institutional architecture represents a pragmatic departure from arbitration-centric investment treaty design.

TEPA’s framework addresses a fundamental contradiction in India’s investment treaty strategy. In response to costly arbitration losses in Vodafone (2012) and Cairn Energy (2020), which resulted in tax liabilities of USD 2.6 billion and USD 1.2 billion respectively, the Indian government adopted a defensive 2015 Model Bilateral Investment Treaty (“Model BIT”). The Model BIT introduced a five-year local remedies exhaustion, a restrictive definition of fair and equitable treatment, and restricted most-favoured-nation clause. This treaty language signalled regulatory risk to capital-intensive sectors (that requires long-term policy stability), contributing to a decline in net FDI inflows from USD 49.4 billion (2022) to USD 28.2 billion (2023) and subsequently decreasing to USD 10.1 billion.

Thus, TEPA implies a pragmatic shift in BIT formulations from arbitration-centric towards facilitation-centric models. This article examines TEPA’s three institutional pillars, binding investment commitments, facilitation mechanisms, and government-to-government (“G2G”) dispute resolution against conventional ISDS frameworks. Furthermore, it provides implications for emerging market governments designing bilateral investment agreements.

Binding Investment Commitments and Government Credibility Signalling

Article 7.1 obligates EFTA states to direct USD 100 billion in FDI over 15 years through a binding framework grounded in institutional commitment theory. Unlike aspirational pledges or revocable unilateral statements, TEPA creates enforceable obligations subject to state-to-state dispute settlement instead of investment arbitration. This binding structure ensures that non-compliance is costly and establishes reciprocal accountability where India can initiate disputes if targets are missed to ensure mutual responsibility.

The binding nature minimises underlying macroeconomic uncertainty. Switzerland, which has put CHF 10 billion (approximately USD 11 billion) in India, creating 146,530 jobs in precision industries, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, can logically escalate capital commitments knowing the host government is legally obliged to facilitate investment.

Credibility of such commitment is enhanced by sectoral targeting. TEPA identifies renewable energy, life sciences, engineering, and digital transformation as the priority areas, creating measurable accountability metrics. Production-Linked Incentive schemes, state land allocation, enforcing the renewable energy purchase obligation, and grid connectivity protocols have an advantage in renewable energy investment. The investment in life sciences provides regulatory clarity on the timeline of pharmaceutical manufacturing, medical device approval, and protection of intellectual property. This specificity allows governments to align infrastructure and regulatory coverage with treaty obligations to establish institutional interconnections between commitment structures and actual facilitation results.

Institutional Mechanisms and Preventive Dispute Architecture: The India-EFTA Desk Model

The Desk Model, a single-window institution that aims to avert the occurrence of investment disputes with an initial institutional intervention for dispute prevention in the investment process. This institutional framework works in three sequential phases. Before the commitment of capital, pre-investment guidance offers all-inclusive sectoral information, regulatory mapping, clarification on the treatment of various taxes, and guidelines for the processes for EFTA investors. This minimises information asymmetries, which creates ex-post conflict. Shareholders will become aware that regulatory demands, approval processes, and policy pledges are met with less regulatory shock. The guidance covers requirements of the renewable energy sector (renewable energy certificate trading, compliance with the renewable purchase obligation, grid interconnection procedures), life sciences (regulatory pathways to approvals by the Drug Controller General, medical devices classification, biotech approvals), and the engineering sector (industrial licensing, foreign direct investment limits).

Implementation support (between the Indian government agencies and investors) provides institutional resolution for operational bottlenecks to replace the informal diplomacy or investor-state arbitration historically used by investors facing regulatory hurdles. The Desk coordinates across government structures to bypass conflict before formal claims arise, while escalation procedures address unresolved issues. Matters escalate within 30 days to senior government authorities (Joint Secretaries of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade and sectoral representatives) to establish clear political accountability for resolution.

Processing efficiency improvements prove to be an effective design of the institution. Under pre-TEPA, foreign investors faced multiple governmental agencies with procedural hurdles, where the clearance process took 120-180 days. The Desk reduced straightforward clearance timelines to 45-60 days for investments made in prescribed sectors, which was previously a complex procedure. This reduction reflects a decrease in regulatory uncertainty and an increase in the velocity of the capital deployment cycles.

Dispute Resolution Frameworks and Operational Performance: G2G Mechanisms Replacing ISDS

TEPA grants G2G consultations by use of Joint Committee structures over investment arbitration as the main method of dispute settlement. This prima facie realigns the dispute resolution away from adjudication and toward diplomatic negotiation.

G2G strategies maintain diplomatic channels essential for long-term bilateral relationships. Investment arbitration entrenches the legal positions, making it complex in law to strike a compromise in adversarial processes. The awards of arbitrations are conclusive. Face-saving diplomatic mechanisms that are not possible under litigation are made possible in G2G consultations. The home state governments acting on behalf of investors are able to seek solutions that not only include policy changes but also the gradual implementation of a sectoral reform that goes beyond the idea of monetary compensation. This framework also addresses the fundamental asymmetry of ISDS by establishing mutual responsibility (G2G consultations), where India can raise investor breaches of environmental or labour rules directly with home states. This two-way structure transforms inherently adversarial investor-versus-state relationships to cooperative government-to-government problem-solving.

The preliminary evidence of institutional efficiency is the working performance of TEPA between 1 October 2025 (the date of entry into force of TEPA) and 31 December 2025. The total investment interest announcement by EFTA entities has shown significant growth, with the top companies being renewable energy (Norwegian investors in solar and wind manufacturing) and life sciences (Swiss pharmaceutical and biotech investors in manufacturing). The rapid capital-growth signals investor confidence despite TEPA’s departure from traditional ISDS protections. The number of disputes has been low for the two months of operation. Regulatory controversies in 18-24 months were experienced in historical Indian investment agreements. The fact that TEPA has no formal disputes implies that preventative institutional architecture is functioning. The interest of other emerging markets in the policy indicates that the TEPA model is known. Discussions on the bilateral negotiation involving similar mechanisms of facilitation were initiated in Brazil, Mexico, Vietnam, and the UAE.

Comparative Analysis and Implications for BIT Architecture

TEPA exhibits three differentiated benefits over conventional ISDS-based models. First, binding government commitments establish accountability, which otherwise is not measurable in the traditional arbitration approach, where the host countries are liable, but the investors have no reciprocal liabilities to infringements on the regulations or deterioration of the environment. Second, the institutional mechanisms of facilitation have the proactive prevention of conflict by the time formal processes start, saving over USD 5-7 million per side in litigation expenses, and the relationships between the two institutions that should be vital in long-term capital collaboration. Third, the G2G consultation processes maintain diplomatic flexibility, which allows resolving issues that cut across legal determination that can only occur in the context of arbitration. These benefits work together and support each other mutually.

The architecture of TEPA implies viable lessons to the emerging market governments that are formulating bilateral investment structures. First, facilitation mechanisms should be institutionalised by having specific structures that have clear commitments on response time and have performance accountability. Ad hoc coordination forms uneven results and uncertainty for investors. Secondly, investment undertakings must be commitments that are binding and gradual, that establish government accountability, and allow gradualism. Sector-based commitments allow resources to be allocated to impactful sectors. Third, the prevention of disputes must be designed before the dispute resolution. The access to arbitration should be preceded by actual institutional problem-solving efforts. Fourth, ISDS needs to be accompanied by a counterparty government accountability via G2G mechanisms that will help in countering the asymmetry inherent in investor protection without compromising investor confidence.

These are not sideshows of the Texas political scene, distractions from turning the state blue.
This frequent gap between organizers and candidates sharpens into a set of questions that Mamdani’s victory makes salient: Do Texas candidates regularly embrace these fights as their own?
“Red Tom” Hickey gave Texas socialism a public voice through journalism and agitation when class politics still carried mass meaning.
Texas politics has been organized to frustrate efforts at getting those same elements to ever meet.","The ascent of Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old socialist Muslim, to New York City’s mayoralty once seemed an almost absurdist dream. Yet, propelled by an army of 100,000 volunteers who took on the city’s political machine from below, the question now is not whether someone like Mamdani can win but whether his victory can carry beyond the borders of the Big Apple.

Here in Texas, to the Republicans and the billionaires whose power they entrench, the prospect of the Lone Star State being swept up in a similarly insurgent candidacy still sounds like its own far-fetched fantasy. Perhaps fearful that movements here might recover our state’s buried but rich left-populist past, the GOP has spent decades building fail-safes against the emergence of grassroots power anywhere under these big blue skies.

Indeed, it would be implausible to say that Mamdani’s municipal victory bears directly on our infamously repressive state as an abstract unit. But Texas and the State of Texas are not exactly one—this sprawling place we call home contains five of the 15 most-populous cities in the country. All lean to the left, all see their power currently suppressed, and all are where the lessons of Mamdani can apply.

I have spent more than 10 years organizing in localities across this great state, participating in grassroots issue campaigns, labor union drives, voter registration and turnout efforts, and multiple legislative sessions. I’ve come to know hundreds of community organizers, from Denton to the Rio Grande Valley and everywhere in between. I’m a co-founder of a statewide nonprofit, and I’ve co-chaired a Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) chapter. More than mere credentialing, I share this background so you’ll know my optimism has survived the trenches—and to explain how I know there is a Texas Left out there waiting to be cohered, a disjointed chorus that could one day speak as one.

What Mamdani’s victory reveals for me, once stripped of novelty, is not really a suspension of political gravity but an alignment with forces that were waiting for the opportunity. Electoral success followed social organization. The campaign operated squarely inside a Democratic primary while rejecting the assumption that party politics must be donor-driven, consultant-managed, or ideologically thin. Independent organizations stepped into roles once filled by mass parties. Tenant unions, labor locals, socialist chapters of the DSA, and community groups built a base, trained leaders, disciplined messaging, and turned people out at scale. The formal party remained hollow; the social party did not.

This distinction matters because Texas Democrats have been attempting the inverse maneuver for a generation: trying to win elections without taking into account the eroded civic foundations of the state.

The last time Democrats won statewide office in Texas was 1994. That year coincides closely with an important index of organizational power: peak union density in the state. Since then, union membership has declined, along with one of the few remaining sites where ordinary people routinely practice collective decision-making. Unions do not simply bargain wages and benefits. They’re democracy in practice. When this erodes, campaigns lose their most reliable partners and are forced into a position of paltry substitution: mere messaging for the credible threat of deep organization.

Even the still-too-rare candidates who adopt a populist bent in their speeches can get only halfway there—naming Texas hardships but missing the link with organizations undertaking class formation to call upon. Calls to “get involved” are too vague. We need candidates who implore voters to form unions, who can teach the hows and whys of that process, precisely because they see themselves as organizers bound to a theory of change and not just as leaders pursuing their own ascent.

Texas is not truly devoid of forces like the tenant organizers and taxi drivers’ union of New York; they’re at work now, often in isolation from electoral politics. Starbucks workers striking across the state. Unite Here members walking out of Hilton hotels in Houston. Airport workers in the DFW region picketing for higher pay. Alongside them, community organizations are fighting against everything from omnipresent debt traps and predatory fines to voter intimidation and language exclusion. These are not sideshows of the Texas political scene, distractions from turning the state blue. They’re the nerve endings of Texans’ shared experience, yet they pass through election cycles largely unacknowledged.

This frequent gap between organizers and candidates sharpens into a set of questions that Mamdani’s victory makes salient: Do Texas candidates regularly embrace these fights as their own? Who has treated them as the base of a campaign rather than as background noise? Who has said plainly that winning office means carrying these struggles forward, co-planned the actions, and even engaged in civil disobedience?

The stakes of these questions could hardly be higher. We lead the nation in the share of residents without health insurance. After the state’s abortion ban took effect, hospitals reported sharp increases in severe pregnancy complications. These are not marginal injustices. They are life in Texas, and they demand a different politics than that offered by most of the state’s fleeting Democratic stars.

In reorienting the left politics of this state, we need to learn to use our history, as Mamdani did in hearkening back to his city’s earlier struggles over housing, labor, and public provision. Texas campaigns often shy away from this, yet our state has a deep and usable political history.

“Red Tom” Hickey gave Texas socialism a public voice through journalism and agitation when class politics still carried mass meaning. Emma Tenayuca helped lead the 1938 pecan shellers’ strike in my hometown of San Antonio, organizing thousands of Mexican-American women against starvation wages and brutal conditions. Jovita Idar used journalism and organizing along the border to confront segregation and build institutions for Mexican-American dignity. La Raza Unida Party and San Antonio’s Committee for Barrio Betterment demonstrate that independent political vehicles have been built when existing parties refused representation. Barbara Jordan and Ann Richards stand as reminders that movement pressure has, at moments, translated into governing power without surrendering moral clarity.

This historical reframing is especially crucial here. As Mamdani showed, you must love a place to lead it—and so you must love its story, yet Texas mythmaking has long reinforced the state’s reactionary spirit despite its long history of insurgence.

Mamdani’s strategy artfully mined New York City’s complexity, past and present, its richness and its diversity. People did not come together because they shared one identity. They came together because they were all trying, and often failing, to make ends meet as New Yorkers. Texas cities live inside the same reality. People may worship in different buildings and speak different languages, but they shop at the same grocery stores, ride the same buses, and open the same overdue bills.

The lesson worth carrying forward is not necessarily, then, about a city or a candidate but about what might be called syncretism. Mamdani’s campaign made clear that unlikely victories are built by bringing together things that are usually still avoided in mainstream politics. Texas politics has been organized to frustrate efforts at getting those same elements to ever meet. Union-busting, zealous preemption, and bootstrap austerity have hollowed out civic life, leaving campaigns and movements each adrift and bereft of one another. The affordability crisis is placed neatly into policy silos instead of being treated as the class war that stands between us and better lives. History is conceded, books are banned, and the grassroots is kept at arm’s length.

And yet the raw material remains: cities full of people facing the same costs, workers organizing against long odds, and a past that shows Texans have fought together before. The idea that a Mamdani-esque politics cannot happen here is not an iron law; it is a disbelief locked in place by power. It will break when candidates truly come from the rank and file and believe, as testified through consistent action, that they will accomplish little unless the ranks behind them grow alongside their electoral wins.",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MarchAprilEOT.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 14:00:40.386552

Read more instalments from our annual Year in Review Q&A series here.

What did 2025 mean for the energy storage industry from your company’s perspective and the bigger picture?

2025 was a turbulent year, but one that reinforced the fundamentals of energy storage. From our perspective at Lunar Energy, it showed that intelligent, flexible home energy solutions – hardware and software working in lockstep – continue to create value even when the policy environment is uncertain.

This year, batteries proved they sit at the intersection of lower bills, reliability, and customer control. That combination resonated in 2025 despite market noise, and it’s why residential energy storage continued to move forward while other parts of clean energy struggled.

What do you think 2026 will hold, in terms of both things to look forward to and in terms of challenges ahead?

In 2026, the grid will get more complicated. More dynamic energy rates and evolving market rules will add complexity for both customers and utilities.

At the same time, this creates opportunity. Smart devices and intelligent software are ready to turn that complexity into value. The challenge will be navigating a more competitive and localised market, while the opportunity is unlocking more savings and earnings for customers through storage and VPP participation.

We are also seeing a rapid proliferation of new third-party ownership (TPO) finance options capitalising on the 48E ITC. There’s a mix of promising challenger TPOs innovating on pricing, business models, and product offerings, alongside established players reacting with new offerings.

That choice feels positive for installers and for customers today, however there will be a graveyard of failed TPOs by the end of the year, so installers must choose their finance partners wisely.

Is there a growing understanding of what distributed energy resources (DERs) can do, especially when aggregated into VPPs, and what needs to happen for VPPs to ‘hit the mainstream’?

The world now knows that DERs can do more than provide backup power. In 2025, VPPs clearly demonstrated their ability to unlock real economic value for customers, particularly as energy rates continue to climb.

It’s easy to get carried away with the nerdy technical jargon and assume that consumers understand or care about the inner workings of VPPs. We cannot forget that the fundamentals remain the same: savings, ease, and trust.

Does VPP participation save or make me money? Can I participate in an easy way that doesn’t require me to be an energy expert? Do I trust that the VPP operator has my best interests at heart?

For VPPs to reach the mainstream, focusing on the fundamentals is crucial. That’s how adoption follows.

Where are the most significant evolutions taking place in the DERs and VPP spaces, either in terms of technology, business models, or both?

The most significant evolution is happening at the software layer. Our customers earned US$464, on average, by participating in VPP programmes in 2025. The next wave of growth will be driven by smarter AI, smarter rates, and smarter devices working together.

As DERs become able to respond in real-time to price signals and grid conditions, they can optimise both system reliability and customer economics. This shift is fundamentally changing the role of the consumer, moving households from passive energy users to active, flexible participants in the energy system.

VPP models have stakeholders both behind-the-meter and on the utility side. What are the keys to meeting the different priorities of these different stakeholders?

The key is capturing value in a way that works for everyone. Customers care about lowering bills, earning income, and maintaining control. Utilities care about reliability and predictable performance. Smart devices and intelligent software make it possible to meet both sets of priorities by coordinating DERs in ways that support the grid, while delivering tangible financial benefits to customers.

We see a quiet revolution taking place in the last few years: VPP hype has led to many VPP operators chasing the quickest buck but forgetting about the end customer on whose device the VPP is built upon. We take a different approach. Our experience has shown that optimising VPP performance in addition to managing the customer cost and value of participating very carefully, and managing the customer experience, yields the best outcomes for customers and the grid.

What should the industry’s priorities be in 2026 and beyond?

The priority should be simple: save customers money with the smartest product and help installers cut costs and reduce risk with the most stable and reliable solutions.

That means executing and scaling what already works: the smartest software, flexible storage, and American-built hardware that can bend the cost curve down over time and maximise stability of pricing and supply.

We have the workforce, the ports, the vessels, and the offshore infrastructure to support this next chapter.
Offshore wind development in the Gulf would not replace oil and gas jobs.
It is a practical, American approach that values workers, communities, and environmental responsibility at the same time.
Louisiana communities understand the cost of pollution and the cost of delay.","America’s energy strength has never come from choosing sides. It has come from building, adapting, and leading. That is why the Trump administration’s decision to suspend multiple offshore wind projects along the East Coast is deeply troubling, not only for clean energy advocates, but for workers, communities, and our national interest.

I represent Louisiana, a state that has powered this country for generations and a state where too many communities live with the consequences of environmental neglect. Our communities deserve clear air and clean water. They deserve to know that economic growth will not come at the expense of their health, their families, or their future.

I have long said that community and industry can coexist, but only when the health and welfare of communities are the focal points of any expansion.

Environmental justice is not a slogan. It is a responsibility.

Louisiana’s offshore workers, engineers, shipbuilders, and mariners built the oil and gas infrastructure that fuels the American economy. We know energy. We also know that energy security depends on diversity, reliability, and foresight.

Suspending fully permitted offshore wind projects sends the wrong message at the wrong time. It tells workers and investors that the rules can change midstream. It tells communities that long term planning is optional. And it tells the world that America is willing to slow its own progress while others move forward.

Offshore wind is not a threat to American energy independence. It is part of it. These projects have undergone years of federal review, including consultation with the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and other agencies. If legitimate security concerns exist, they should be addressed transparently and responsibly, not through open-ended pauses after permits have been granted.

The Gulf of Mexico offers a clear example of what responsible energy development can look like. Our region is uniquely positioned to integrate offshore wind alongside existing energy production. We have the workforce, the ports, the vessels, and the offshore infrastructure to support this next chapter. Offshore wind development in the Gulf would not replace oil and gas jobs. It would build on them, using the same skills Louisiana workers already possess, while reducing harmful emissions that disproportionately impact frontline communities.

This is not an either or choice. It is a practical, American approach that values workers, communities, and environmental responsibility at the same time. Offshore wind can support grid stability, meet growing electricity demand, and help protect public health by reducing pollution, all while keeping energy production domestic and affordable.

Energy diversity is national security. A resilient grid cannot depend on a single source of power. As electricity demand rises and extreme weather becomes more frequent, we must invest in solutions that strengthen reliability and protect the people who live closest to our energy infrastructure.

Louisiana communities understand the cost of pollution and the cost of delay. We also understand the dignity of work and the importance of fairness. Our energy future must honor all three.

The question before us is not whether America will continue to produce energy. It is whether we will do so in a way that protects communities, respects workers, and keeps our nation competitive. America has always done its best work when it chose leadership over fear and progress over retreat. We should do so again.

With Friday’s court order, Bonta, along with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, the California Department of Transportation, and the California Energy Commission, can now access $379 million in funding to support electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

In 2021, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. One provision of the IIJA appropriated $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure formula program for a national network of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the states. President Trump once in office issued an executive order directing federal agencies to immediately stop releasing certain funds appropriated through the IIJA, including $5 billion that Congress appropriated for electric vehicle charging stations under NEVI.",https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/social/opengraph/ij-social-default-1200x630.png,N,,2026-01-27 07:59:26.136164

The company led by Mary Barra announced a 20% dividend increase, despite over $7.2 billion in charges related to its EV business restructuring.

The Detroit automaker posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.51, beating estimates of $2.28.

Adjusted EBIT came in at $2.84 billion, above the $2.77 billion expected. Revenue of $45.29 billion slightly missed estimates of $45.37 billion and declined 5.1% year over year.

Fourth-quarter net income attributable to stockholders was a loss of $3.3 billion, reduced by more than $7.2 billion in special charges driven primarily by a realignment of EV capacity and investments to adjust to expected declines in consumer demand for EVs, the company said.

The charges also reflect US government policy changes including the termination of consumer incentives and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, GM said.

For the full year, GM reported net income attributable to stockholders of $2.7 billion and adjusted EBIT of $12.7 billion, at the high end of its guidance range.

“GM delivered full-year EBIT-adjusted at the high end of our guidance range, and we are pleased that we delivered a total return of 54% for our investors,” CEO Mary Barra said in the shareholder letter.

Barra added that GM recorded its highest US market share since 2015 “with low inventory, low incentives, and strong pricing.”

Shares of the Detroit automaker jumped by 5% to $83.55 on Tuesday’s pre-market session immediately after the results were announced.

2026 Outlook

GM issued 2026 guidance calling for net income attributable to stockholders of $10.3 billion to $11.7 billion, adjusted EBIT of $13.0 billion to $15.0 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS of $11.00 to $13.00.

The company expects automotive operating cash flow of $19.0 billion to $23.0 billion and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $9.0 billion to $11.0 billion.

Capital spending is anticipated at $10.0 billion to $12.0 billion, inclusive of the company’s battery cell manufacturing joint ventures.

EV Impairments

The fourth-quarter charges add to the $1.6 billion impairment GM announced in October ahead of its third-quarter earnings report, bringing total EV-related charges to approximately $7.6 billion.

UBS analyst Joseph Spak said earlier this month that the additional charges were “not surprising” as GM proceeds with EV business restructuring.

The company recently halted production of its BrightDrop fully electric commercial delivery van, affecting approximately 1,700 employees including those at its CAMI plant in Canada.

EV Sales

GM‘s EV sales declined 43% in the fourth quarter after steady increases in the first two quarters of 2025.

For the full year, electric vehicle sales rose 48% year over year to 169,887 units, making GM the second-largest EV seller in the US behind Tesla Inc.

Notably, though, Houston secured these events without having completed its $2 billion, 700,000-square-foot convention center upgrade.

Dallas’s Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center is getting a $3.5 billion rebuild, while neighboring Fort Worth’s convention center received a $700 million facelift as part of a $2 billion downtown redevelopment.","The phrase “everything is bigger in Texas” certainly applies to the state’s publicly funded stadiums and arenas. Now that Texas’s major cities are betting big on tourism, it will soon apply even more to its convention centers.

Eight Texas cities and counties—Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Corpus Christi, East Montgomery County, and College Station—are building, renovating, or planning convention centers. All come with glossy economic projections, drafted by consultants paid for such work.

Ask a local official why cities in such close proximity are investing in such outdated projects, and you’ll hear the consultant-inspired refrain: “they pay for themselves.” But if history is any guide, convention centers are more likely to become massive money pits, with taxpayers left on the hook long after the politicians who approved them are gone.

Of all the cities and counties, Houston probably has the best case for an upgraded convention center. This year, the Bayou City is slated to host seven FIFA World Cup matches, the World Baseball Classic, and the first of a three-year run of NCA All-Star Nationals (the nation’s largest cheerleading competition). The Republican National Convention will roll through in 2028, and the city hopes to host another Super Bowl in 2029. Notably, though, Houston secured these events without having completed its $2 billion, 700,000-square-foot convention center upgrade.

Other metros’ plans are similarly pricey. Austin is pursuing Unconventional-ATX, a $1.6 billion rebuild of its convention center that will double the venue’s size. Dallas’s Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center is getting a $3.5 billion rebuild, while neighboring Fort Worth’s convention center received a $700 million facelift as part of a $2 billion downtown redevelopment.

San Antonio is further expanding its Henry B. González Convention Center, planning an expansion running between $750 million and $900 million as part of its multibillion-dollar downtown redevelopment project. Corpus Christi just designated a Project Financing Zone (PFZ) around the American Bank Center Complex and expects to generate $70 million for critical upgrades. East Montgomery County, just north of Houston, is building the seventh-largest convention center in the state. College Station has its eye on a $500 million multipurpose convention and event center.

One would expect so many centers, so close together, to cannibalize each other’s markets. That’s not how the consultants see it.

Unconventional-ATX projects an added $285 million in spending and $13 million in new tax revenue every year. Houston’s projections are the boldest: $20.6 billion in new spending, $6 billion in new earnings and payroll, and $740 million in new tax revenue.

Consultants offer these rosy estimates despite a 2018 Texas comptroller’s office report finding that most convention centers “do not cover their operating costs, and competition among them has risen sharply.”

“Convention centers are highly expensive operations, and most don’t make a profit,” the report adds, “particularly when considering the debt service payments involved in their construction.”

Even without intense intrastate competition, convention centers almost never prove profitable. Two-thirds never cover direct operating costs, and more than half contribute nothing to debt service. Texas’s cities have seemingly adopted an arms-race logic: because our peers are building bigger, we must also build bigger, without considering whether enough demand exists to justify the venture.

Most convention center projects use one of two funding sources: local hotel-occupancy taxes and PFZs. Hotel-occupancy taxes are a revenue stream that must be used to encourage tourism, which cities are given broad discretion to define. When a PFZ is applied and approved by the state, a city continues to collect its local hotel-occupancy tax but is allowed, through the PFZ, to keep the state’s portion of the hotel-occupancy tax as well. The city also gets to keep revenue from the state sales tax and state mixed-beverage tax within a three-mile radius of convention centers, multipurpose arenas, or related infrastructure projects for up to 30 years.

But while visitors directly pay the taxes to fund these ventures, local taxpayers face real risk. If tourism underperforms and revenues come in below projections, Texas cities often use local tax dollars to cover convention center debt (and have faced credit downgrades because of it).

Unfortunately for taxpayers, the truth is that convention centers have not delivered economic boons; their real function is to provide a way for public officials to leave a symbol of their tenure. That’s a costly habit to maintain—and an even costlier one to remove.",https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/Texas-convention-centers-Houston-Austin-Dallas-San-Antonio.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 12:34:22.122591

“The City of Braidwood remains committed to responsible economic development and to ensuring that any future projects align with the city’s long-term infrastructure capacity and the best interests of our residents,” the city said.

Braidwood is a city in Will and Grundy counties, around 53 miles (85 km) southwest of Chicago and 18 miles (29 km) south of Joliet. The 2.2GW Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station, owned by Constellation, is located near the proposed development.

According to a previous post, the planned site is located near Interstate 55 and Reed Road. Site plans posted by local press suggest up to eight buildings and an on-site substation, though full details haven’t been shared.

The city has been exploring annexing the land in question into the city. The unnamed developer has reportedly closed on its acquisition of the land, according to local officials.

“Winter weather conditions can cause every step of the restoration process to be more complex, so we can’t thank our customers and communities enough for their patience and understanding as our crews work throughout the day and night in extreme temperatures to restore service,” said Frank Shannon, vice president of reliability for Entergy Texas. “With colder temperatures headed our way over the next few days, we’ll continue to monitor weather conditions and adjust our teams and resources as needed.”

Cold weather restoration requires extra care

Restoring power during prolonged cold conditions is different. When electricity is re-energized after an outage, many appliances and heating systems restart at once, creating a surge known as cold load pickup. To help reduce the strain on our equipment, customers experiencing an outage should turn off or unplug major appliances. Once power is restored, appliances should be turned back on gradually.

In the House, just seven Democrats voted for the bill to fund DHS, none of whom represent New Jersey seats.","WASHINGTON — A passenger rail project critical to New Jersey and the greater Northeast will receive $700 million under legislation likely to become law, a rebuke to President Donald Trump, who tried to terminate the project altogether.

The legislation also includes about $307 million in federal funding to extend the Second Avenue Subway line in Manhattan north to East Harlem and roughly $100 million for transit agencies and operating expenses for host cities of this year’s FIFA World Cup, the massive soccer tournament that will include matches in New Jersey.

The core of the infrastructure project, known as the Gateway Program, is a $16 billion public works effort decades in the making to upgrade two decrepit tunnels built in 1910 that run beneath the Hudson River and connect Newark’s train station and New York’s Penn Station.

In the fall, Trump tried to cancel federal funding for both the Gateway and subway projects during a federal government shutdown. In particular, Trump relished the move to eliminate money for Gateway as a way to skewer Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the U.S. Senate. “It’s billions and billions of dollars that Schumer has worked 20 years to get,” Trump, a former New Yorker himself, said in October. “Tell him it’s terminated.”

Months later, Gateway has not been terminated and Congress is poised to fund many of the agencies, programs and projects the president threatened with deep budget cuts last year, the first he made since in his second term.

The $700 million the spending bill sets aside for Gateway is specifically for the Hudson River tunnels, the program’s centerpiece.

“The money designated for the Gateway tunnel in the pending funding package represents a vital next step in the project’s growth,” Rep. Nellie Pou (D-9th) said in an emailed statement. “As New Jersey’s only Democratic member of the House transportation committee, I will remain aggressive in working to secure every nickel and penny of funding we need to keep the Gateway project on track and reverse the Trump hold on federal investment in this critical project.”

Money for Gateway and the Second Avenue subway is included in a broader array of legislation, pending before Congress, to fund the U.S. government through the current budget cycle, which ends in September. The money for the World Cup would be taken from funding Congress has already approved through other appropriations laws.

After immigration agents shot and killed a U.S. citizen over the weekend in Minnesota, Democrats in Congress are pushing to reform the Department of Homeland Security — in particular the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Border Patrol agencies, whose agents have flooded Democratic-leaning states and cities in recent months.

Schumer and other Senate Democrats said over the weekend and on Monday they would not vote for the bill the House passed last week to fund DHS, raising the odds of a partial government shutdown that would start at the end of the day Friday.

“I’m not voting to fund this lawless violence,” Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) said online Saturday about ICE funding. “Trump’s abuse of power is tearing us apart.”

“I will not vote for another dollar for a reckless ICE & DHS,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) said in a statement online Saturday.

Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate but need 60 votes total to advance most bills, including spending legislation. That shortfall means they will need Democratic support to pass the spending bills before them, giving Democrats leverage.

In the House, just seven Democrats voted for the bill to fund DHS, none of whom represent New Jersey seats. New Jersey’s three Republicans in Congress, Reps. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd), Chris Smith (R-4th) and Tom Kean Jr. (R-7th), voted for it.

The bill contains some language Democrats wanted, including $20 million for body cameras for ICE agents. That’s not sufficient, said Rep. Donald Norcross (D-1st), who voted against the bill.

“Money alone doesn’t guarantee those cameras get worn,” Norcross said last week, pushing for a bill of his that requires all “public-facing” immigration officers to wear cameras.

That DHS funding is part of a broader $1.2 trillion legislative spending package that funds a series of departments and policies, including the Pentagon, the departments of treasury, state and transportation, along with foreign aid, labor, education and public health programs. That measure passed the House last week.

A separate portion of the package, which contained less divisive measures, passed easily last week, on a vote of 341 to 88.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/10/Gateway-Tunnel-project-construction3.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 12:33:11.159241

Those include limits on coal ash that can contain heavy metals.
Under the 2024 rules, nearly all coal plants would have to come into compliance by 2029; if the standards could not be met, the plants would be retired.
Coal-fired power plants are prevalent in the Southeast, and North Carolina has a history with pollution from them.
“Communities along the Dan River have already had to deal with coal ash pollution, air pollution, and decades of ongoing dumping of toxic water pollution from the power plant.","Conservation groups have sued the Trump administration to try to keep it from allowing coal-fired power plants to dump heavy metals that end up in drinking water, including in North Carolina.

The Southern Environmental Law Center filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on behalf of Appalachian Voices and the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League. The suit seeks to uphold requirements put in place in 2024 to stop many of the largest and most harmful wastewater discharges from coal-fired power plants, the SELC said.

“Arsenic and mercury from coal-fired power plants can be stopped by readily available water pollution controls, but this administration wants these dirty, outdated plants to keep dumping their toxic pollution into our rivers and lakes for many years to come,” Nick Torrey, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said. “Our communities can’t afford more cancer-causing pollution in our waterways.”

The White House announced in April 2025 it would invigorate “America’s beautiful clean coal industry.” Last fall Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced the agency planned to extend the deadlines for coal-fired plants to meet Biden-era rules on wastewater discharge. Those include limits on coal ash that can contain heavy metals.

Under the 2024 rules, nearly all coal plants would have to come into compliance by 2029; if the standards could not be met, the plants would be retired. The Trump EPA would extend the deadline to 2034 and, environmental groups say, would likely extend it again beyond that date.

Several other conservation groups across the country have filed similar suits and Torrey, based in Chapel Hill, said the suits will be consolidated.

Coal-fired power plants are prevalent in the Southeast, and North Carolina has a history with pollution from them. Conservationists say the plants can be made to operate more safely with existing technology and that it’s worth the expense to install the equipment.

In February 2014, a stormwater pipe underneath the primary coal ash basin at the Duke Energy Dan River Steam Station in Eden failed, resulting in about 27 million gallons of coal ash wastewater and between 30,000 and 39,000 tons of coal ash spilling into the Dan River. The ash co-mingled with native sediment as far as 70 miles downstream, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.

In 2015, the state Department of Environmental Quality reached a settlement with Duke Energy holding the utility accountable for groundwater pollution at all 14 of its coal-ash facilities and requiring accelerated cleanup at sites in Wilmington, Asheville, Goldsboro and Belews Creek in Stokes County, northwest of Greensboro. In 2020, DEQ reached a settlement with Duke in which the company agreed to excavate nearly 80 million tons of coal ash at six facilities in the state.

“The Clean Water Act requires eliminating harmful water pollution from dirty old plants like Duke Energy’s Belews Creek, where Duke Energy says it wants to burn coal until 2040,” Ridge Graham, North Carolina program manager at Appalachian Voices, said in the release about the suit. “Communities along the Dan River have already had to deal with coal ash pollution, air pollution, and decades of ongoing dumping of toxic water pollution from the power plant. Enough is enough.”

Duke Energy did not respond to a request for comment on the suit.

The SELC and other clean-energy advocates have criticized Duke for planning to increase its use of nuclear and natural gas-burning power plants and delaying the planned retirement of coal plants in order to supply increasing power demands. Solar power with battery storage is the cheapest form of energy generation.

Duke has said North Carolina’s electricity demands will soar over the next 15 years and that it will need the fossil-fuel-burning plants to meet the need reliably and affordably.

The EPA’s plan to weaken the pollution rules on coal plants fits with the Trump administration’s move last year to drop regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. It would do so by rescinding a 2009 declaration that greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and therefore pose a threat to public health and welfare. That declaration is the basis for the EPA’s carbon-emissions standards under the Clean Air Act.

Torrey, of the SELC, said the administration has shown that it values profits over human health and safety.

Those include limits on coal ash that can contain heavy metals.
Under the 2024 rules, nearly all coal plants would have to come into compliance by 2029; if the standards could not be met, the plants would be retired.
Coal-fired power plants are prevalent in the Southeast, and North Carolina has a history with pollution from them.
“Communities along the Dan River have already had to deal with coal ash pollution, air pollution, and decades of ongoing dumping of toxic water pollution from the power plant.","Conservation groups have sued the Trump administration to try to keep it from allowing coal-fired power plants to dump heavy metals that end up in drinking water, including in North Carolina.

The Southern Environmental Law Center filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on behalf of Appalachian Voices and the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League. The suit seeks to uphold requirements put in place in 2024 to stop many of the largest and most harmful wastewater discharges from coal-fired power plants, the SELC said.

“Arsenic and mercury from coal-fired power plants can be stopped by readily available water pollution controls, but this administration wants these dirty, outdated plants to keep dumping their toxic pollution into our rivers and lakes for many years to come,” Nick Torrey, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said. “Our communities can’t afford more cancer-causing pollution in our waterways.”

The White House announced in April 2025 it would invigorate “America’s beautiful clean coal industry.” Last fall Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced the agency planned to extend the deadlines for coal-fired plants to meet Biden-era rules on wastewater discharge. Those include limits on coal ash that can contain heavy metals.

Under the 2024 rules, nearly all coal plants would have to come into compliance by 2029; if the standards could not be met, the plants would be retired. The Trump EPA would extend the deadline to 2034 and, environmental groups say, would likely extend it again beyond that date.

Several other conservation groups across the country have filed similar suits and Torrey, based in Chapel Hill, said the suits will be consolidated.

Coal-fired power plants are prevalent in the Southeast, and North Carolina has a history with pollution from them. Conservationists say the plants can be made to operate more safely with existing technology and that it’s worth the expense to install the equipment.

In February 2014, a stormwater pipe underneath the primary coal ash basin at the Duke Energy Dan River Steam Station in Eden failed, resulting in about 27 million gallons of coal ash wastewater and between 30,000 and 39,000 tons of coal ash spilling into the Dan River. The ash co-mingled with native sediment as far as 70 miles downstream, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.

In 2015, the state Department of Environmental Quality reached a settlement with Duke Energy holding the utility accountable for groundwater pollution at all 14 of its coal-ash facilities and requiring accelerated cleanup at sites in Wilmington, Asheville, Goldsboro and Belews Creek in Stokes County, northwest of Greensboro. In 2020, DEQ reached a settlement with Duke in which the company agreed to excavate nearly 80 million tons of coal ash at six facilities in the state.

“The Clean Water Act requires eliminating harmful water pollution from dirty old plants like Duke Energy’s Belews Creek, where Duke Energy says it wants to burn coal until 2040,” Ridge Graham, North Carolina program manager at Appalachian Voices, said in the release about the suit. “Communities along the Dan River have already had to deal with coal ash pollution, air pollution, and decades of ongoing dumping of toxic water pollution from the power plant. Enough is enough.”

Our dependence on oil and gas imports forces us to put moral and strategic concerns aside.
Neither LNG ships nor terminals, neither oil tankers nor a complex network of oil and gas pipelines under our soil are necessary.","‘Drill, drill, drill!’ — Donald Trump’s call for more oil and gas is more than just bad news for the planet. His fossil fuel policy also threatens Europe’s security. The US president wants to flood America with climate-damaging fuels and make the rest of the world dependent upon them. Under his erratic leadership, the US is striving to dominate global energy markets — not only for economic reasons, but also out of a desire for power.

The removal of Venezuelan President Maduro from power, the eyeing of Greenland’s mineral resources, the threatening gestures towards allies — all of this follows a logic that is older than Trump’s presidency, but has never been so bluntly articulated: whoever controls fossil resources dictates the rules. International law? An obstacle. The transatlantic partnership? Negotiable. The dignity of other heads of state? A minor issue.

In the first months of his second term, Trump abolished everything in his own country that had to do with climate and environmental protection — he even wants to burn up satellites in space that collect climate data. Wind farms are being stopped, US oil and gas companies are being courted, and environmental standards for drilling are being eliminated. Now he wants to bring the rest of the world into line with his agenda.

Energy policy is power politics. For a long time, German politicians failed to understand this truism, particularly with regard to Russia. The belief that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin could be converted into a democrat and kept in check through economic interests has failed. This naïve idea of ‘change through trade’ and supposedly reliable partnerships has, in 2022, brought Germany one of the biggest energy crises since the end of the Second World War. Now the Europeans are in the process of making the same mistake again. By now, at the latest, geopolitical events should be robbing all of us of our sleep.

Not a blame but a responsibility

There are many differences between the EU and the US. In terms of energy policy, however, there is one crucial difference: the US has oil and liquefied natural gas, which makes it self-sufficient and enables it to supply many countries. Germany and most of the 27 EU countries have no fossil fuels and have to import over 90 per cent of their energy. Without a steady supply of oil and gas, Germany would not be a world export champion, but a farming country.

No one is to blame for a country’s lack of resources. However, the fact that Germany has developed too few alternatives to fossil fuels is a political responsibility. Our dependence on oil and gas imports forces us to put moral and strategic concerns aside. In every Bundestag debate, MPs insist on principles, emphasising, for example, our duty to help the Ukrainian people out of humanitarian considerations. They argue that supplying weapons to Ukraine also protects Germany from future Russian attacks. But we are sacrificing morality and strategic thinking for gas and oil.

Germany and the EU have fallen into a trap that is now snapping shut. In this new world – dominated by men like Trump, Putin and Xi Jinping – dependencies are mercilessly exploited for power politics. But Germany and the EU remain dependent on imports, without which neither factories nor cars nor heating systems would function. This makes Europe vulnerable to blackmail. Nevertheless, the debate on security revolves almost exclusively around armament and hardly at all around energy independence.

As long as Europeans decide to buy their energy from an old boys’ club of oil autocrats, Trump supporters and backward-looking business representatives, they are at their mercy.

One explanation is that Europe is hoping the Trump era will soon come to an end. But the US president is not an accident of history who will soon disappear. His political line is here to stay: his most powerful supporters are already making plans for the post-Trump era, with JD Vance as his successor.

It can be assumed that European governments are aware of the serious consequences of our dependence. There are already many warning reports. One comes from Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank. He is certainly not a radical left-wing thinker. In his report on Europe’s competitiveness, he writes that Europe is in danger of becoming increasingly vulnerable to blackmail. Draghi speaks of a ‘slow agony’ — a gradual decline. One reason for this, he says, is that 50 per cent of imports come from countries with which Europeans have no strategic partnership, meaning that in case of doubt, they can force us to pay higher prices or abandon us altogether. ‘This dependence can become a geopolitical weapon’, the report says. As long as Europeans decide to buy their energy from an old boys’ club of oil autocrats, Trump supporters and backwards-looking business representatives, they are at their mercy.

These are not predictions; this is already happening. Four years ago, Putin turned off the Russian gas tap. Now, other once-reliable business partners are putting pressure on Europe. One way is through political blackmail: last year, EU Commission President von der Leyen had to agree to spend €750 billion on fossil fuels from the US to appease Trump in tariff negotiations. Recently, the US and Qatar imposed a harsh condition: the EU must weaken its supply chain law targeting climate goals and human rights in order to receive further LNG deliveries.

Dependence is weakness. Europe should therefore take it very seriously when the US government writes in its new security strategy: ‘Restoring American energy dominance is a key strategic priority.’

This shows that exporting countries can put pressure on Germany at any time. Another possible scenario: the US or countries in the Middle East reduce their supplies or arbitrarily increase prices. German industry collapses, barely able to sell its products on the world market. Many citizens suddenly have to pay more for their fuel and heating, because German gas and oil reserves only last for a few weeks. A shortage threatens the whole of society: no cars run, no fields are fertilised, no steel is produced. This is a serious security problem — our everyday life only functions thanks to these imports. Without them, jobs will disappear, unrest will threaten, government crises will arise, and low-income earners will face real hardship.

Dependence is weakness. Europe should therefore take it very seriously when the US government writes in its new security strategy: ‘Restoring American energy dominance is a key strategic priority.’

Meeting climate targets strengthens our security

But the federal government under Chancellor Merz seems to be ignoring the warnings — just as German politicians have downplayed dependence on Russia for decades. In Brussels, the CDU pushed for the ban on the sale of new combustion engine cars from 2035 to be relaxed. This will slow down the European car industry’s transition to electric cars that do not require petrol and diesel imports. Since taking office, Economics Minister Katherina Reiche has been trying to build as many gas-fired power plants as possible – as backup capacity for periods of low wind and low sunlight – without giving sufficient consideration to climate-friendly alternatives such as electricity storage. It is completely unclear when these planned gas-fired power plants will be converted to climate-friendly hydrogen. At the same time, she wants to continue to promote gas heating and is fuelling the false claim of a heat pump mandate, which in fact never existed. How Germany is supposed to achieve its climate targets with this policy remains completely unclear. Yet meeting climate targets strengthens our security because it drives the transition to renewable energies.

The major political misunderstanding is that solar and wind power are referred to as ‘green’ projects, primarily by the Union, but also by the AfD and other European right-wing populists. As if these cheap and domestic energy sources had a party membership card. Yet they make us less dependent on blackmail from the United States or the unstable Middle East.

With over 65 000 kilometres of coastline where the wind blows every day and the daily hours of sunshine in southern Europe, there are free domestic energy sources, made in Europe.

Of course, many will now object: Yes, but our solar panels and wind turbines come from China! And that is correct. Over the last 30 years, Europe has watched as almost all renewable energy technology has migrated to Asia. Chinese manufacturers produce extremely cheaply there. As a result, European companies have been filing for bankruptcy in droves for years. That is why we must take our dependence on China for renewables seriously. In the coming years, it will not only be a matter of phasing out fossil fuels as much as possible and reducing our dependence on them. It is just as important to make Germany and the EU the leading technology location for renewables once again. Nevertheless, there is a crucial difference between dependence on renewables and dependence on fossil fuels. Gas-fired power stations, cars and oil and gas heating systems need a constant supply of fuel; without it, the technology is useless. The energy source itself must therefore be imported on a permanent basis as long as the car is running or the gas-fired power station is operating. This dependence never ends.

A solar module, on the other hand, uses the sun as its energy source — free of charge and inexhaustible. There is no need for continuous imports. Neither LNG ships nor terminals, neither oil tankers nor a complex network of oil and gas pipelines under our soil are necessary. The dependency is one-off rather than perpetual. EU countries must therefore focus on their own resources. With over 65 000 kilometres of coastline where the wind blows every day and the daily hours of sunshine in southern Europe, there are free domestic energy sources, made in Europe. All we have to do is tap into them. Even if conservatives and right-wingers are currently calling for the opposite, the EU Commission’s Green Deal is not only urgently needed climate protection, but also a piece of patriotism. After all, not being susceptible to blackmail ultimately protects European democracy.",https://www.ips-journal.eu/fileadmin/_processed_/b/6/csm_Canva_energy_dependence_b7ff78d22f.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 06:59:00.885264

Therefore, as noted in this study, the use of wastewater to produce green hydrogen—considered to be the fuel of the future—is a sustainable process with great potential, since it contributes to saving drinking water, optimizing waste and reducing the use of fossil resources.

A new path

This research has precisely succeeded in optimizing the efficiency of this process, which is carried out through dark fermentation—a method that consists in using anaerobic microorganisms to break down the organic matter present in wastewater to produce bio-hydrogen—although, so far, it has been possible with variables that affect its efficiency and limits in its commercial use.

The proposed rule also changes how tribes can gain regulatory authority to assess water quality under the Treatment in a Similar Manner as a State program, or TAS.
To date, only 84 tribal nations have received TAS status, allowing them to review federal projects.
Currently, Section 401 of the Clean Water Act allows tribes that can demonstrate the capacity and resources the ability to review water quality standards, expanding regulatory powers beyond tribes with larger resources.
“‘You’re going to make it harder for us to exercise our sovereignty to protect our waters and protect our community.’” A 30-day public comment period on the proposed rule is currently underway.","Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposal to revise the Clean Water Act, specifically a section of the law that regulates water quality and limits states’ and tribes’ authority over federal projects, as well as how tribes can gain the authority to conduct those reviews. Experts say the move would dissolve one of the few tools tribes have to enforce treaty rights and hamper their ability to protect tribal citizens.

“What the Trump administration is proposing to modify here is a really important tool for states and tribes, because it gets at their ability to put conditions on or, in extreme cases, block projects that are either proposed by the federal government or under the jurisdiction of the federal government,” said Miles Johnson, legal director at Columbia Riverkeeper, an organization that works on issues affecting the Columbia River.

Developers seeking to build dams, mines, data centers, or pipelines must navigate a permitting process to do so. One requirement in the process is obtaining certification from a tribe or state confirming that the project meets federal water quality standards. Currently, tribes and states conduct holistic reviews of projects, known as “activity as a whole”, evaluating all potential impacts on water quality, including spill risks, threats to cultural resources, and impacts on wildlife. This approach was established under the Biden administration in 2023.

However, the newly proposed rule would limit reviews to “discharge only,” where both states and tribes are able to review projects solely based on how much pollution they would release, narrowing the scope of oversight.

The proposed rule also changes how tribes can gain regulatory authority to assess water quality under the Treatment in a Similar Manner as a State program, or TAS. Under that program, tribes are able to act as regulators, one of the few tools available to them, and directly set conditions to limit factors that would pollute waters near tribal lands. To date, only 84 tribal nations have received TAS status, allowing them to review federal projects. Currently, Section 401 of the Clean Water Act allows tribes that can demonstrate the capacity and resources the ability to review water quality standards, expanding regulatory powers beyond tribes with larger resources. The proposed change would shrink those powers, allowing only TAS tribes to perform evaluations through a separate, more rigorous authorization program.

“Treaty rights are one of the strongest mechanisms to enforce against the federal government, against the state, against third-party actors, and in litigation,” said Heather Tanana, a law professor at the University of Colorado. “It takes years, it takes money, it’s complicated to do, and so you want these other mechanisms.”

A reversion to pre-2023 rules, Tanana said, would put higher demands on tribes to show larger-scale capacity, often in the form of dedicated water departments.

“There’s such a wide variance in tribes of what resources are available to them. Do they have other sources of revenue, right? How many staff do they have? Do they have their own environmental departments? Is it one person, or is it 10?” said Tanana.

During the Biden administration, tribes advocated for a baseline rule allowing all tribes some input in federal projects while seeking TAS status, but industry pushback during the comment period and a Trump win during the general election in 2024 led to its withdrawal from the EPA in December.

Patrick Hunter, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, noted that of 7,500 projects submitted during the Biden administration, fewer than 1 percent were denied. Most were approved with conditions such as mitigation measures and sediment traps to prevent water pollution during construction. Tanana said tribal review outcomes were similar.

The EPA’s 2025 report on tribal consultations highlighted widespread opposition to changes. “The clear feedback from the tribes was, ‘Don’t change it,'” said Tanana. “‘You’re going to make it harder for us to exercise our sovereignty to protect our waters and protect our community.’”

A 30-day public comment period on the proposed rule is currently underway. The rule is expected to face litigation after finalization.

Michigan argues that if this hadn't happened, electric cars would have become popular and affordable many years ago.
New policies have rolled back fuel economy rules and eliminated tax credits that helped people buy electric cars.
Michigan is now among a growing list of states taking oil companies to court.
This means the case focuses on fair competition and the right of consumers to have access to new technology like electric cars.","Michigan is taking a legal stand against the biggest names in the petroleum business. Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a federal antitrust lawsuit that targets companies like BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and Shell. The legal filing also names the American Petroleum Institute, which is a major group representing the interests of these businesses. The state argues that these companies worked together like a ""cartel"" to stop the growth of electric cars and renewable energy.

The lawsuit spans 126 pages and contains serious accusations. It claims these companies held back innovation to keep people dependent on gasoline. By doing this, the state says the companies were able to keep energy prices high for everyone. Michigan argues that if this hadn't happened, electric cars would have become popular and affordable many years ago. Instead, the state claims the oil industry used its power to make sure cleaner options stayed out of reach for the average driver.

One of the most interesting parts of the lawsuit focuses on how these companies allegedly blocked progress. Michigan says the oil industry intentionally slowed down the installation of chargers for EVs at gas stations. It also accuses them of sitting on battery technology that they helped create decades ago. Essentially, the state believes the industry had the tools to help the world move away from oil but chose to hide them to protect their profits.

The lawsuit also points to a massive misinformation campaign. It alleges that the oil companies funded blogs, think tanks, and media outlets to spread false stories about electric cars, meant to make people doubt the reliability and benefits of EVs. The state says this made it harder for consumers to trust new technology, which kept them buying gasoline-powered vehicles instead of switching to cleaner alternatives.

The timing of the lawsuit is important because the American auto industry is currently at a crossroads. Companies like Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis are based in Michigan, and they have recently slowed down their plans for electric cars. They are putting more money back into gasoline engines, claiming that customers aren't ready to go fully electric yet. Michigan's lawsuit suggests that the reason customers aren't ready is because the oil industry has been working behind the scenes to make EVs less attractive.

Government changes are also playing a big role in the current car market. The Trump administration has taken steps to support the oil and gas industry. New policies have rolled back fuel economy rules and eliminated tax credits that helped people buy electric cars. There is also less federal money available for building the chargers that EVs need to travel long distances. While the government pivots toward fossil fuels, Michigan is using the courts to fight back and demand a different future.

The financial stakes in this case are incredibly high. Michigan is asking for a jury trial and wants the oil companies to pay back billions of dollars. This money would cover the ""overcharges"" that the state and its citizens paid for energy because of the alleged conspiracy. The state also wants the companies to hand over the profits they made from fossil fuels during the years they were supposedly suppressing competition.

Attorneys for the oil industry have already called the lawsuit ""baseless."" They argue that energy policy should be decided by Congress, not by judges in a courtroom. They also point out that Michigan's economy relies heavily on the oil and gas used by its own car factories. Despite these arguments, Michigan is moving forward. The state wants to prove that drivers are only using gas because they were denied a fair choice, not because gasoline is better or cheaper.

Michigan is now among a growing list of states taking oil companies to court. Other states like Maine and New Jersey have sued over climate change, but Michigan is the first to use antitrust laws this way. This means the case focuses on fair competition and the right of consumers to have access to new technology like electric cars.

WASHINGTON—The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today issued an emergency order to mitigate blackouts in North and South Carolina following Winter Storm Fern. Issued pursuant to Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, the order authorizes Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC and Duke Energy Progress (collectively, Duke Energy) to run specified resources located within the Duke Region, regardless of limits established by environmental permits or state law. The order will help Duke respond to extreme temperatures and storm damage across the Carolinas and reduce costs for Americans due to the winter storm.

""Winter Storm Fern continues to bring extreme cold and dangerous conditions across the country,"" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Maintaining affordable, reliable, and secure power in the Duke region is non-negotiable. The previous administration’s energy subtraction policies weakened the grid, leaving Americans more vulnerable during events like Winter Storm Fern. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are reversing those failures and using every available tool to keep the lights on and Americans safe following this storm.”

On day one, President Trump declared a national energy emergency(link is external) after the Biden administration’s energy subtraction agenda left behind a grid increasingly vulnerable to blackouts. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)(link is external), “Winter electricity demand is rising at the fastest rate in recent years,” while the premature forced closure of reliable generation such as coal and natural gas plants leaves American families vulnerable to power outages. The NERC 2025 – 2026 Winter Reliability Assessment(link is external) further warns that areas across the continental United States have an elevated risk of blackouts during extreme weather conditions.

Power outages cost the American people $44 billion per year, according to data(link is external) from DOE’s National Laboratories. This order will help mitigate power outages in the Carolinas and highlights the commonsense policies of the Trump Administration to ensure Americans have access to affordable, reliable and secure electricity.

The order is in effect from January 27—January 30, 2026.

First, there was fear-filled silence from Republican leaders when Trump threatened military action to take over Greenland.
Second, Republicans in Congress are sitting quietly while Trump sends massive numbers of federal agents into an American city.
But top Republicans in Congress, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.)
These “completely self-neutered,” Republicans in Congress, wrote Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, have left Americans wondering if they are being “ruled by a mad king?” Incredibly, even the most obsequious Republicans are being lashed by Trump.","Did you see that? A video from a Miami nightclub last week showed top-rated right-wing influencers partying to Kanye West’s Nazi song “Heil Hitler.” The crew included Nick Fuentes, famous for hating Jewish people, and the Tate brothers, famous for brutal approaches to women.

The video went to the top of right-wing social media. It is being widely condemned as obscene.

But what about the obscene muzzling of Republicans in Congress? Like hostages with their mouths taped shut they are unable to respond to reckless behavior by President Trump.

First, there was fear-filled silence from Republican leaders when Trump threatened military action to take over Greenland. His words led Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to call for new alliances apart from the U.S. because Trump had ended the “Old-World Order.”

The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial page said Trump’s act was “dangerous,” because China and Russia want to see a “rift that blows up NATO.”

Most of the Republican Congress didn’t see or say anything.

Second, Republicans in Congress are sitting quietly while Trump sends massive numbers of federal agents into an American city. That incursion resulted in an ICE agent shooting and killing an unarmed woman. And in response to protests against the shooting, Trump threatened to send in federal troops.

Again, the loud silence among congressional Republicans is enabling bad behavior. It is another obscenity.

Third, Trump’s Justice Department is going after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Powell announced that the Federal Reserve had been handed subpoenas and a threat of federal indictment for him. He called the possible “criminal charges” against him a crude threat against the agency’s independence.

It is obscene to see so many tongues being bitten bloody among the Republican majority in Congress.

Trump’s frantic, one-man takeover of the government is more in line with a king than a president. But top Republicans in Congress, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), have little to say about his abuse of power. Fear of Trump attacking them on social media or backing a rival in a primary race has them paralyzed. They are fixated on Trump’s dominance of the Republican base.

These “completely self-neutered,” Republicans in Congress, wrote Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, have left Americans wondering if they are being “ruled by a mad king?”

Incredibly, even the most obsequious Republicans are being lashed by Trump.

Take the sad tale of Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.).

She has been humiliated repeatedly for her fealty. She was promised the U.N. ambassadorship, only to be told she had to stay in Congress to bolster the thin Republican majority. Then she planned to run as a Trump-endorsed candidate for governor. But Trump not only denied her the endorsement but openly embraced her political foil, the socialist New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) is another Trump supplicant in Congress now being targeted.

A physician, Cassidy provided the critical support to confirm Trump’s pick to be secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert Kennedy Jr. He stood by Trump’s pick despite Kennedy’s long record of spreading vaccine misinformation. Cassidy’s reward for that moral abdication? Trump endorsed Cassidy’s Republican primary challenger last week. And measles outbreaks are surging nationwide.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) also got nothing for acquiescing to Trump. Collins famously defended Trump against congressional efforts to stop his imperial actions by saying she believed Trump had “learned a lesson.”

Then, recently, Trump profanely berated Collins after she voted against his use of the military in Venezuela without congressional approval. He later declared on Truth Social that Collins, along with others expressing concern, such as Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), “should never be elected to office again.”

Again, Collins’ only response was mild indignation — but no words or action to confront Trump’s indifference to the constitutional role of Congress.

The few Republicans willing to call out Trump’s behavior are retiring.

Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.) voiced objection to Trump’s Justice Department going after Powell.

“If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none… I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved.”

That did not prompt Trump to end the questionable probe of Powell.

Similarly, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) joined a bipartisan delegation to Greenland after Trump threatened to use military force to seize it.

“Safeguarding our relationships with our NATO allies should be paramount,” Murkowski said. “Greenland should be treated as a partner, not a possession.”

Notably, except for Murkowski, the Republicans who dared to join that delegation are retiring. Tillis and Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon took the trip. They found some courage after quitting Capitol Hill.

The Book of Matthew asks: “For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul?”

There are still ten months left in the 119th Congress.

What we need are Republican profiles in courage, not cowering.

Where is the end to the obscene fright being displayed by Republicans in the face of Trump’s threats to the constitutional order of American democracy?",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/AP26022429198890.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-27 04:00:02.544886

The proposed rule was delivered to the OMB by the U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service on Dec. 17. The OMB website indicates the agency scheduled 16 meetings with industry stakeholders in January to discuss the proposed guidance, with the final meeting held Jan. 23. Representatives of Amp Americas, WM, Fuels America, Continuum Ag, Growth Energy, NATSO/SIGMA, Aemetis Inc., Renewable Fuels Association, POET, National Grain and Feed Association, Clean Fuels Alliance America, RNG Coalition, Pivot Bio, American Soybean Association and Gevo Inc. and were among those to meet with OMB staff regarding the proposed 45Z rule.

According to information posted to the OMB website, the proposed rule was modified during the review process and is now moving forward. The OMB website estimates a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) is currently scheduled to be released for public comment in May.

The 45Z tax credit was first established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, providing a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The original version of the credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025. Under the OBBBA updates, the “special rate” for SAF will is eliminated beginning in 2026, effectively capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all fuels, including SAF. The OBBBA also extended 45Z for two additional years, through the of 2029. Legislative efforts are currently underway to reinstate the “special rate” for SAF and further extend the credit.

Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance. Guidance delays have been particularly harmful to the biobased diesel industry, with domestic production down significantly in 2025 when compared to the previous year.

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit. A companion notice, also issued in January 2025, included initial guidance on emissions rates under the 45Z credit, including an initial table that sets forth emissions rates for similar categories and types of fuel.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biodieselmagazine/posts/web/2015/05/omb-logo_14313847528429_14314399266097.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 02:58:39.611183

If finalized, it would mean that the EPA no longer has an active endangerment determination supporting greenhouse gas regulation under key Clean Air Act programs.
Even when administrations changed, they generally sought to revise or replace specific regulations rather than revoke the endangerment finding itself.
By rescinding the endangerment finding, the EPA would effectively remove the statutory trigger that requires or authorizes greenhouse gas regulation under multiple Clean Air Act provisions.
New York, for example, regulates greenhouse gas emissions under state statutes and regulations that are independent of the federal endangerment finding.","In early January 2026, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) submitted a draft final rule to the Trump administration for review that would repeal what is commonly known as the “endangerment finding” for greenhouse gases under the federal Clean Air Act. While the rule is not yet final, the submission marks a significant legal development with broad implications for environmental regulation, industry, and state and local governments, including New York.

To understand why this action is noteworthy, it is necessary to understand what the endangerment finding is, how it has functioned for more than a decade, and how the proposed repeal would alter the legal landscape.

What Is the Endangerment Finding?

The endangerment finding is a formal determination by the EPA that certain air pollutants “cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” In 2009, the EPA concluded that six greenhouse gases—including carbon dioxide and methane—met this standard.

That determination did not, by itself, impose emission limits. Instead, it served as the legal foundation that allowed the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants, and certain industrial sources under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act.

The legal basis for the finding traces back to a landmark Supreme Court decision in 2007, Massachusetts v. EPA, which held that greenhouse gases qualify as “air pollutants” under the Act and that EPA must determine whether they endanger public health or welfare. The 2009 finding was the agency’s response to that mandate.

Since then, the endangerment finding has served as the cornerstone for federal climate-related air regulations.

What the Draft Final Rule Proposes to Do

The draft final rule proposes to rescind the greenhouse gas endangerment finding entirely. In practical terms, this would remove the EPA’s determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare for purposes of the Clean Air Act.

Unlike prior regulatory actions, which often adjusted emission standards, compliance timelines, or sector-specific requirements, this proposal targets the underlying legal predicate itself. If finalized, it would mean that the EPA no longer has an active endangerment determination supporting greenhouse gas regulation under key Clean Air Act programs.

It is important to note that the rule is described as a “draft final” rule. Before it can take effect, it must complete Trump administration review and then be formally issued. Litigation is widely expected, but the proposal itself already has immediate legal and planning implications.

How This Differs from Past EPA Climate Rules

Most prior federal climate actions under the Clean Air Act accepted the endangerment finding as settled law. Regulatory debates tended to focus on questions such as:

How stringent emission limits should be;

Which sources should be regulated;

How compliance costs should be calculated; and/or

How federal rules interact with state programs.

Even when administrations changed, they generally sought to revise or replace specific regulations rather than revoke the endangerment finding itself.

This proposal is different in terms of both scope and strategy. By rescinding the endangerment finding, the EPA would effectively remove the statutory trigger that requires or authorizes greenhouse gas regulation under multiple Clean Air Act provisions. In that sense, the rule is structural rather than incremental.

Legal Consequences Under the Clean Air Act

If the endangerment finding is repealed and upheld, EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases under certain sections of the Clean Air Act would be significantly constrained. Regulations tied directly to that finding could be weakened, suspended, or rendered legally vulnerable.

However, this does not repeal the Clean Air Act itself, nor does it amend the statute. Congress would need to act to change the law. Instead, the proposal reflects a reinterpretation of how existing statutory terms, particularly “endangerment,” are applied to greenhouse gases.

The legal question is not whether climate change exists, but whether greenhouse gas emissions meet the statutory threshold that triggers Clean Air Act regulation. That distinction is likely to be central in any future court challenges.

Impacts on Industry and Development

For regulated industries, the proposal introduces both short-term uncertainty and potential long-term change.

Industries that have been subject to federal greenhouse gas permitting or emission standards—such as power generation, manufacturing, and large-scale development—may see changes in federal compliance obligations if the rule takes effect. However, the immediate effect is not deregulation across the board; existing rules remain in place unless and until they are revised or invalidated.

Developers and infrastructure sponsors should be aware that regulatory uncertainty can affect project timelines, financing, and permitting strategies. Lenders and investors often rely on stable regulatory assumptions; and so, shifts at the federal level can prompt closer scrutiny of risk allocation.

The Role of States Like New York

The proposed repeal does not eliminate state-level climate authority. New York, for example, regulates greenhouse gas emissions under state statutes and regulations that are independent of the federal endangerment finding. State environmental review, permitting, and climate laws would continue to apply regardless of federal action.

However, differences between federal and state regulatory approaches could widen. This raises questions about coordination, preemption, and the extent to which states may fill regulatory gaps left at the federal level.

For municipalities, the change may influence how local land use approvals, environmental reviews, and infrastructure planning are framed, particularly for energy, transportation, and industrial projects.

Why the Proposal Matters Now

The submission of the draft final rule signals that the EPA is moving beyond conceptual debate toward concrete legal change. Whether or not the rule ultimately survives judicial review, it marks a turning point in how the federal government approaches greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26d562_8586a8c3a2c54978a11751e5d7f3d16b~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_848,h_555,al_c,q_85/26d562_8586a8c3a2c54978a11751e5d7f3d16b~mv2.jpg",N,,2026-01-27 02:58:36.576965

For Trump, it might seem like Deja vu given that he came to Iowa in 2019 to sign an executive order creating year-round E15, but the rule drafted by EPA was thrown out by federal courts.

Iowa Corn and the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) on Monday released an open letter to the president, which thanked him ""for his constant support"" of E15 and asking the president to push E15 through Congress.

The groups took out a full-page ad that will be in the print edition of the Des Moines Register.

As DTN reported, Congress last week pulled E15 language from a funding bill and instead created the E15 Rural Domestic Energy Council, which is expected to develop bills and submit them to Congress no later than Feb. 15 with the House expected to consider such legislation no later than Feb. 25.

In a letter to Trump, Iowa Corn and IRFA stated, ""Without permanent access to this market, the long-term viability of our state's largest economic driver is at serious risk. Today, we are asking for your help to finally push E15 access through Congress.""

The letter continued: ""Removing the outdated regulatory hurdle for E15 is exactly the type of government efficiency you've worked for. We urgently seek your ongoing assistance as Congress debates E15 over the next month. Permanent nationwide access to E15 is a common-sense, no-cost solution to strengthen American energy dominance and provide a vital lifeline to Iowa's growers. We look forward to your continued leadership on this issue and remain ready to work alongside you to move this critical policy across the finish line. Now is the time.""

Separately, the American Soybean Association on Monday also raised concerns about the rural energy council and the scope of work for the ad-hoc congressional group.

""The American Soybean Association appreciates the continued work of the House of Representatives to champion domestic biofuel production, but the broad latitude provided to the E15 Rural Domestic Energy Council creates new threats to programs U.S. soybean farmers rely on to advance the production of soy-based fuels,"" said Ohio farmer Scott Metzger, ASA's president. ""ASA supports the sale of year-round E15 but is concerned about the Council's review of longstanding bipartisan policies that promote the production and consumption of biodiesel, renewable diesel, and other biofuels derived from soybeans. Congress and members of the Council must guard against all efforts that seek to weaken the Renewable Fuel Standard and other policies U.S. soybean farmers rely on for domestic market demand. The open-ended directives of this Council create a dangerous precedent that threatens the foundation of the U.S. biofuel industry.

ASA praised the Trump administration's 2026-27 Renewable Volume Obligations draft rule and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. Still, ASA added, ""Instead of studying biofuel policies with longstanding proven success, Congress should be working with the administration to ensure the swift finalization of 45Z tax guidance, robust RVOs, and finalizing EPA's proposed rule to give preference to domestic feedstocks and fuels. The work of the E15 Rural Domestic Energy Council cannot distract from getting these policies across the finish line.""

Issued pursuant to Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, the orders authorize PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) and Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC and Duke Energy Progress (collectively, Duke Energy), respectively, to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities.

Today’s action follows a letter Secretary Wright sent Thursday to grid operators asking them to be prepared to use backup generation if needed to mitigate the risk of blackouts from the storm. DOE estimates more than 35 GW of unused backup generation remains available nationwide. The order will help PJM and Duke respond to extreme temperatures and storm damage across the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas and reduce costs for Americans in the days following the storm.

These actions mark the second set of emergency orders issued to PJM and Duke during Winter Storm Fern, following earlier orders to run specified resources located within the PJM and Duke regions, regardless of limits established by environmental permits or state law.

“The Trump administration is committed to unleashing all available power generation needed to keep Americans safe during Winter Storm Fern,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Wright. “Unfortunately, the last administration had the nation on track to lose significant amounts of baseload power, but we are doing everything in our power to reverse those reckless decisions. The Trump administration will continue taking action to ensure that the 35 GW of untapped backup generation that exists across the country can be deployed as needed during Winter Storm Fern and in the future.”

On day one, President Trump declared a national energy emergency(link is external) after the Biden administration’s energy subtraction agenda left behind a grid increasingly vulnerable to blackouts. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)(link is external), “Winter electricity demand is rising at the fastest rate in recent years,” while the premature forced closure of reliable generation such as coal and natural gas plants leaves American families vulnerable to power outages. The NERC 2025 – 2026 Winter Reliability Assessment(link is external) further warns that areas across the continental United States have an elevated risk of blackouts during extreme weather conditions.

Power outages cost the American people $44 billion per year, according to data(link is external) from DOE’s National Laboratories. These orders will help mitigate power outages in the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas and highlights the commonsense policies of the Trump Administration to ensure Americans have access to affordable, reliable and secure electricity.

Earnings growth forecast to drop on sluggish EV business

Tesla’s results are tipped to show a sluggish quarter for the EV maker. Consensus estimates suggest decent top line growth of about 11% to take revenues to roughly $US28.1 billion. However, earnings per share are projected to slide 35% to $US0.43 per share. The results follow underwhelming deliveries data from Tesla recently, with the company revealing a drop of 16% in Q4 to 418,000 vehicles. The drop reflects the impact of expiring tax credits for EV vehicles and falling market share as global carmakers, especially in China, eat into the EV market. Despite this, Tesla’s gross margins are expected to lift a bit, to about 18%, even as the company maintains a competitive pricing strategy to ward off lower cost rivals.

Investors lock-in on guidance about robotics and batteries

Although Tesla’s EV business is experiencing material headwinds, optimism about the company’s automation and batteries business is keeping the stock price well supported. As a result, most of the focus in this quarter's results will be about the growth in both business segments and the guidance the company provides about it. CEO Elon Musk continues to emphasise that Tesla remains an energy and, increasingly, robotics and automation company. Investors will be locked into what vision Musk projects about this so-called “robot army” he is building, including the scaling up of the Robo-Taxi and humanoid robots.

Tesla shares search for spark to drive to new highs

Optimism about artificial intelligence, robotics and US rate cuts helped push Tesla to record highs at the end of 2025. Price momentum has since slowed, with Tesla stock dropping below the upward sloping trendline from the April post-Liberation day lows. The stock is currently finding some modest support from the 100-day moving average. A meaningful level of technical support could be found around $US380 per share, a break of which could negate the prevailing uptrend. Meanwhile, resistance is around $US500 per share, with a break of that level a signal of a continued uptrend.

To achieve this target, accelerating the development of wind and solar energy is essential.

Expanding wind and solar energy at this scale means making choices about where and how to build. Choices that will shape landscapes, communities and ecosystems for generations to come.

The Nature Conservancy's smart siting approach offers a practical roadmap for decision-makers, renewable energy actors and civil society to identify the optimal locations for renewable energy development, whilst avoiding conflict with areas of high biodiviersity or social value.

This study and guide brings together the best available science, policy context and local knowledge to answer a central question:

How can Montenegro accelerate renewable energy while protecting biodiversity and respecting social values?

The Smart Siting Approach

TNC's smart siting approach uses a robust data collection, analysis and presentation methodology to identify locations for solar and wind energy development that avoid conflict with areas of high biodiversity or social value.

Launched by TNC and local NGO Eco-Team in October 2024, the Montenegro Energy Growth and Acceleration (MEGA) project implemented TNC's smart siting approach to develop a low-conflict solar and wind siting scenario for the entire country.

Gathered around the Advisory Committee, the project was supported by the line ministries of the Government of Montenegro, International Financial Institutions and the Energy Community Secretariat, through data sharing, oversight of the study development process, verification and endorsement of the results.

The primary product of the study is granular mapping of renewable energy development potential across Montenegro, including sites suitable for Renewable Acceleration Area (RAA) designation.

Applying the approach in Montenegro can be broken down into four steps:

Identifying and applying constraints: Areas with factors that prevented utility-scale (>5MW) wind or solar development were eliminated, either for environmental reasons such as slope and terrain or legal reasons such as residential zones and zones of strict protection in national parks.

Calculating development potential: Parameters that affect the feasibility of wind and solar projects such as resource availability, (e.g. average wind speeds and solar irradiance), availability of infrastructure (e.g. proximity and capacity of electrical grids, roads) or proximity to load centers were assessed and assigned weighted values in calculations according to detailed expert input.

Estimating conflict potential: An array of datasets related to different conflict categories were compiled, such as places important for biodiversity (e.g. Important Bird Areas and other ecologically significant areas), areas of heightened socio-cultural value (e.g. sacral architecture, high landscape value viewsheds) or natural resources (e.g. valuable forests and high-value agricultural land).

Bringing all the data together: Steps 1-3 were visualised and overlaid onto maps to identify optimal locations, prioritizing places with a low potential for conflicts and high development potential.

Whilst the process was data intensive, this methodology produced a detailed and actionable mapping of renewable energy development potential and generated datasets on grid capacity, brownfield sites and rural settlements that added value beyond the project.

Contextual Challenges

Developer and investor interest is already high in Montenegro. However, development progress faces challenges that could stifle or prevent the fulfilment of the country's renewable energy potential.

These challenges - financing gaps, lengthy permitting processes and grid capacity - are magnified when projects intersect with other land uses and values, risking delays or cancellations.

These are all factors that have been highlighted as shaping the renewable energy development process and have been engaged with as part of this study

Breaking the Gridlock: The proximity of a prospective renewable energy project to high-voltage infrastructure means nothing if it's already carrying as much power as it physically can. Because the connection capacity of the electrical grid was repeatedly identified as one of the main bottlenecks, special attention was given to this criterion.

Montenegro's transmission system operator (Crnogorski elektroprenosni sistem-CGES), provided expertise and data to produce a bespoke nation-wide capacity model that was used to refine the study's development potential calculations.

Shaping Development Priorities: When identifying priority areas for development, asking the right people is just as important as having the right methodology. The MEGA project team comprised of national experts in energy, geospatial analysis, biodiversity, spatial planning and social values.

The methodology and results were verified by an independent peer-review panel, a high-level advisory board with representatives from all relevant institutions.

Two groups of subject matter experts were consulted to calculate weighting factors for Step 2 and 3 of the smart siting approach process using the well-supported Analytic Hierarchy Process. These weights were used to combine criteria into single development potential and conflict maps.

Using Brownfields to their Full Potential: Brownfields, i.e. already converted and underutilized or abandoned areas such as landfills and former industrial sites, are widely recognized as a sensible first target for development of renewable energy, firstly because their use for this purpose avoids conversion of more valuable natural or agricultural areas and secondly because they frequently possess the necessary infrastructure for development.

For these reasons, brownfields are recognized in the revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED) as priority areas for new renewable energy projects. In this analysis, particular attention was paid to brownfields by calculating their total potential separately from the other areas, but still taking into account the possible conflicts associated with their development.

MEGA Project Findings

The findings of the MEGA project are encouraging. Based on the identification and mapping of low-conflict, high development potential sites, Montenegro can meet its 2030 renewable energy targets by developing just 1/5th of the available low-conflict sites into new solar and wind plants.

Furthermore, the potential combined capacity from developing low-conflict sites, for solar and wind, is approximately 17 times larger than the current installed capacity of all energy plants in Montenegro.

Through smart siting and proactive investment, Montenegro can surpass its 50% renewable energy share target using exclusively low-conflict sites and scale up its energy production using purely renewable energy sources.

These findings strongly complement TNC's partnership agreement with the Energy Community Secretariat, supporting coordinated action on sustainable and just renewable energy deployment across the region and providing a strong analytical foundation for policy alignment.

Recommendations

Montenegro can emerge as a regional leader in accelerating renewable energy development, with a special emphasis on the potential of brownfield locations.

The approach used in Montenegro could inspire other countries in the Southeast Europe to adopt a similar strategy that balances decarbonization with biodiversity priorities, contributing to Europe’s progress towards a more sustainable energy future.

Following the findings of this study, TNC and Eco-team have developed a set of call-to-actions for stakeholders in Montenegro to help the country fulfil its renewable enery potential:

To improve the regulatory and institutional frameworks, we call on:

The Government of Montenegro to use these results as a basis for designating RAAs in national legislation and to integrate them into decarbonization measures within the national strategic documents.

Spatial planning authorities to take into account these maps when mapping locations for renewable energy development in both national and local spatial plans.

National grid operators to use the maps to inform grid optimization and development planning.

The Ministry of Energy and Mining to consider incorporating maps in the design of auctions, either as a tool for selecting locations for site-specific auctions or for assessing the sustainability of projects proposed by developers.

Competent authorities involved in renewable energy permitting to leverage the study maps to prioritize projects with low environmental and social conflicts over those following a business-as-usual approach.

To unlock investment potential, we can call on:

The Montenegrin Investment Agency to use the study findings to promote the renewable energy investments towards low-conflict locations.

Investors and commercial banks to consult maps to identify projects that are financially viable, climate neutral and sustainable, leading to reduced risk from public opposition and accelerated permitting.

financial institutions and donors to use the study results as a decision-making tool for directing financial and technical assistance to initiatives that contribute to the sustainable achievement of the national renewable energy targets.

Solar and wind are beating new power demand, steelmaking is slowly getting off coal, and more clean energy victories are clear. Despite Trump, clean energy is leading the way even in the US.

The Republicans kneecapped America's clean energy sector. Now Trump aims to squash it. The policies Trump is targeting were enacted to help US firms compete. Trump “doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that solar, wind, and batteries are the cheapest, quickest, made-in-America energy we can deploy.""

Trump’s Opposition to Clean Energy Is Costing You Money. Until this year, America was set to embark on its largest investments in history toward clean and affordable energy and good-paying jobs. Trump has tossed that progress out the window. It’s time for Congress to intervene.

Is the US headed toward an electricity crisis of its own making? Electricity demand will clearly outpace supply in the coming years, and Trump's policies are further reducing that supply. “Just get out of the way and stop blocking solar and wind permits.""

How clean energy could save us trillions. As clean energy prices fall, a fast transition to renewable energy is the cheapest option on the table. It could save us trillions in energy costs alone. Solar energy is half the cost of the cheapest fossil option and the gap will continue growing.

There’s a $10 Trillion Antidote to Trump’s Climate Backlash. An influx of at least $10 trillion in clean technology investment is offering promise that progress can still rapidly accelerate.

Green power is the cheapest power — despite what Trump says. Analysis shows states that are growing their wind and solar power typically have lower power costs. The findings undermine Trump's main justification for his aggressive rollback of federal clean energy policies.

Trump Is Cutting Billions in Clean Energy Investments—But the Savings Are Overstated. As prices for wind and solar drop, favoring fossil fuels means the US is “putting all of our money on a horse that’s already lost.” “So let’s be clear, this is a big step back for American competitiveness.""

How the Trump Administration is Obstructing Clean Energy – and Why it Raises Your Costs. Electricity prices are rising across the US. Yet instead of expanding low-cost, reliable clean power, Trump is making it worse. Wind and solar are the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power today.

Chart: Clean energy remains dominant in the US — despite Trump. Trump spent much of 2025 boosting fossil fuels and blocking renewables, but 92% of new additions were solar, wind, or batteries. Trump is playing with fire by trying to limit renewable energy right when electricity demand is spiking.",,N,,2026-01-26 23:58:54.503320

Today’s Good News (And Other Updates):

EPA Funded for FY26 Well Above President Trump’s Proposed Budget

– Trump signed a government funding bill on January 23 that funds the EPA at $8.82 billion – $4.7 billion above Trump’s original budget proposal and $1.8 billion above the House Republicans’ bill, both of which would have decimated the agency. Congress also rejected a number of policy proposals that, if enshrined into law, would have further undermined EPA’s long-term public health mission. EPN’s statement and a fact sheet from the appropriations committee can be found on our website. Note: There may still be a partial shutdown this week after Senate Democrats pulled their support for the last set of funding bills that includes Homeland Security (and ICE), which would not impact EPA or the other agencies that already had funding bills signed into law.

Legal Challenges Continue

– L4GG filed a reply brief in the Appalachian Voices v. EPA case challenging the agency’s elimination of the Section 138 program (Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants). Oral argument before the DC Circuit will take place on March 16.

– L4GG successfully quashed a DOJ subpoena demanding the medical records of over 3,000 transgender youth at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles by arguing that the government’s request violated patients’ constitutional right to privacy and exceeded the government’s legal authority. Read more here.

– Related Litigation Update: We received a not-so-great ruling from the 4th Circuit in Sustainability Institute et. al. v. Trump et. al. (4th Cir. Docket No. 15-1575, January 21, 2026). The Appeals Court vacated the South Carolina District Court’s finding that EPA and USDA violated the Administrative Procedures Act in terminating EJ grants on Tucker Act jurisdictional grounds, and expressed skepticism regarding the merits of the plaintiffs’ Constitutional and statutory claims.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July last year, Congress made substantial improvements to the credit that also need to be finalized. Again, moving forward quickly to provide reliable guidance would add certainty to the market, driving new demand for fuels and feedstock, adding jobs and economic activity in rural America.""

Kovarik said America's soybean and canola farmers, oilseed processors, livestock industry, and biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF producers need these policies finalized.

""Regulatory delays create intolerable market uncertainty, putting the biodiesel and soybean industry's investments and planned growth at risk,"" Kovarik told Trump.

""Providing market certainties through 45Z guidance and final RVO's would have a near-immediate impact on fuel production and domestic commodity demand.""

Kovarik said the three industries have built more than 6.5 billion gallons of fuel production capacity in the U.S. In 2024, the industries produced more than 5 billion gallons.

""U.S. biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF production represents 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown in the United States,"" the letter said.

""In the most recent market year, Iowa produced more than 595 million bushels of soybeans worth nearly $6 billion dollars. However, due to market uncertainty, Iowa's biodiesel production has fallen by a third this year. Producers are already idle or planning to idle. Our progress is threatened by delays in policy decisions that should have been made by the preceding administration. We anticipate that you will quickly finalize these policies and secure your promise as the most pro-biofuel president in history.""

What to expect during restoration

We understand how frustrating it can be to see crews leave an area before power is restored. Restoration follows a specific sequence based on how electricity flows through the system and prioritizes critical facilities such as hospitals. Crews will return as soon as upstream repairs are completed.

If you don’t see crews working nearby, they may be repairing another part of the system that must be restored before power can safely reach your home.

For safety reasons, customers are asked not to approach workers at job sites, as these areas can be dangerous and interruptions may slow restoration progress.

Workforce safety protocols

To protect worker safety and manage fatigue, restoration personnel generally do not work more than 16 hours in a 24-hour period and do not exceed 13 consecutive days without a rest period. These protocols ensure crews can work safely and effectively while restoring power as quickly as conditions allow.

Entergy Louisiana remains focused on restoring power as safely and quickly as possible and appreciates customers’ patience during this challenging winter weather event.

Customer safety and community resources

Now Beam has announced the sale of ten EV ARC off-grid EV charging systems to a new residential development in New York—the company’s largest sale of EV ARC systems into a residential development to date.
The EV ARC systems will provide on-site EV charging for residents without the need for construction, trenching, electrical upgrades or utility coordination.
The EV ARC systems also offer property owners more flexibility than fixed charging installations do.
“Beam Global is so much more than an American EV charging infrastructure company,” said Desmond Wheatley.","Beam Global makes portable off-grid solar-powered EV charging systems. Some of the company’s most reliable customers have been government agencies and municipalities. During 2025 however, the company diversified its customer base, and saw increasing demand from commercial customers.

Now Beam has announced the sale of ten EV ARC off-grid EV charging systems to a new residential development in New York—the company’s largest sale of EV ARC systems into a residential development to date.

As the company explains, many residential developments, particularly in dense urban environments like New York, face significant challenges deploying conventional EV charging due to lack of utility circuit capacity, complex permitting processes, long timelines and high construction costs. The EV ARC systems will provide on-site EV charging for residents without the need for construction, trenching, electrical upgrades or utility coordination.

The EV ARC systems also offer property owners more flexibility than fixed charging installations do. The systems can be relocated easily as parking layouts, tenant needs or vehicle demands change over time.

“Historically, Beam Global’s customer base has been led by federal, state and municipal agencies, but we are now seeing increasing interest from residential and commercial developers,” said Beam Global CEO Desmond Wheatley. “The tens of millions of apartments and condominiums in the US represent another excellent growth opportunity for Beam Global which we have previously not addressed aggressively. This deployment in New York demonstrates that EV ARC is well suited to dense urban residential environments where traditional charging infrastructure is often impractical.”

Beam Global recently announced preliminary fourth quarter revenue for 2025—revenue increased over 50% from the prior quarter, driven by new products, expanded international activity and increased sales to commercial customers.

In prior periods, US government sales have contributed the majority of Beam Global’s revenues, but non-government commercial revenues represented approximately 84% of revenues in the fourth quarter. EV ARC sales increased in Europe—international sales accounted for approximately half of Q4 revenue. Non-EV ARC products accounted for approximately 70% of fourth quarter revenue.

“Beam Global is so much more than an American EV charging infrastructure company,” said Desmond Wheatley. “We make energy security products, we make batteries for drones and robots, we are developing secret solutions for the defense industry, our smart cities infrastructure products are expanding, we are opening new markets in the Middle East and Europe. 2025 was a challenging year as the new administration paused the electrification of the federal fleet, but Beam Global transitioned from US government-generated revenues to a truly global footprint with an expansive product portfolio. We grew Q4 revenues by 50% by selling new products into new markets.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/A1-4-Beam-Global-Announces-Largest-Residential-Sale-of-EV-ARC™-Systems.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 21:58:49.664581

Front-month futures soared above $6 per million British thermal units for the first time since 2022. That followed a 70% rally last week, the biggest weekly advance in records going back to 1990.

The winter storm is estimated to have knocked offline almost 10% of US natural gas production, just as demand for the heating and power-plant fuel jumped. The big freeze has strained electricity grids and crippled transport links, grounding thousands of flights.

Traders are closely watching how long the disruption to US gas output will last as the storm sweeps in, and some were caught off guard by the scale of the disruptions in key export hubs such as Louisiana and Texas. Global gas markets have seen a volatile start of the year and a bigger impact than what’s already priced in could continue to send prices higher.

A massive winter storm reached the US Atlantic Coast on Sunday, bringing heavy snow and ice, straining power grids and grounding thousands of flights at levels not seen since the pandemic.

The largest US grid operator is pushing power plants to secure natural gas supplies through the week on expectations that frigid temperatures will drive electricity usage to a winter record. Gas flows to US liquefied natural gas export plants have dipped to the lowest in a year as the winter storm disrupts output.

Natural gas prices hit the highest since December 2022, when European demand for US liquefied supplies was booming after it lost supplies from Russia following the country’s invasion of Ukraine earlier in the year.

“US gas price volatility is set to become a much bigger driver of LNG market value and risk across the next five years,” Timera Energy analysts wrote in a note.

The impact on front-month prices is also being exacerbated because the February contract expires on Wednesday, leaving liquidity relatively thin. Open-interest was less than 25,000 contracts on Monday, compared with 340,000 contracts for March futures.

The March contract climbed as much as 11% to $3.997 per million Btu, while the one for February gained as much as 19%.

In the UK, the Construction Leadership Council’s Zero Diesel Sites Route Map sets a target to cut diesel use on construction sites by 78 percent by 20354, highlighting the urgency to replace conventional generators with cleaner alternatives.
Hitachi Energy supports these hubs with its broader offering, which includes mobile BESS, charging infrastructure, and advanced energy management systems.
HyFlex, an award-winning solution, plays a key role in making hybrid energy hubs practical and scalable for zero-emission construction sites.
During these initiatives, Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex®-powered construction sites, including electric construction machinery, operated in areas without access to the power grid.","Hitachi Energy has completed the deployment of a zero-emission construction site in the United Kingdom. For four weeks, the company powered its own construction site as part of a National Grid 400 kilovolt (kV) grid connection project in Rugeley, Staffordshire, mitigating emissions from conventional diesel generators. The self-funded initiative reflects the company’s commitment to sustainability and the targets of achieving net-zero by 2050¹.

During this time, the site relied on Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex® hydrogen-powered generator supplied with clean green hydrogen from Air Products, together with a battery energy storage system (BESS). Based on an estimated electricity consumption of up to 5.2 megawatt-hour (MWh), the project avoided around five tonnes of CO₂ emissions compared to conventional diesel generators during the four-week period—roughly equivalent to two round-trip economy-class flights between London and New York. This achievement demonstrates the technology readiness for real-world application and marks a significant step toward fossil-free construction.

Green hydrogen is becoming increasingly central to the energy transition. Its versatility as a clean energy carrier offers strong potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and indirectly electrify industrial processes. The construction sector alone accounts for over a third of global energy-related CO₂ emissions3, and the footprint of building operations continues to rise.

Policy momentum is accelerating this shift. In the UK, the Construction Leadership Council’s Zero Diesel Sites Route Map sets a target to cut diesel use on construction sites by 78 percent by 20354, highlighting the urgency to replace conventional generators with cleaner alternatives. As emission-free construction requirements expand across Europe, flexible energy hubs are a key enabler for sites that need affordable, reliable, and clean power. Hitachi Energy supports these hubs with its broader offering, which includes mobile BESS, charging infrastructure, and advanced energy management systems. HyFlex, an award-winning solution, plays a key role in making hybrid energy hubs practical and scalable for zero-emission construction sites.

The Rugeley case builds on the success of earlier pioneering HyFlex® deployments across Europe in collaborations involving leading companies such as Kanonaden, Volvo, the Port of Gothenburg, and Dura Vermeer. During these initiatives, Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex®-powered construction sites, including electric construction machinery, operated in areas without access to the power grid. It also enables zero emission of pollutants such as NOx and SOx, delivering very low noise and vibrations, which contributes to the wellbeing of site workers.",https://dynamicassets.hitachienergy.com/adobe/assets/urn:aaid:aem:edc28f52-658d-4997-bd57-677298415d54/as/hyflex.jpg?width=1440&height=810&smartcrop=16-9,N,,2026-01-26 21:58:36.371554

“The monument management plan was created by local officials, Tribes, and communities working together to provide certainty in how this national treasure is managed and protected.
The Trump administration eliminated the two most recently created national monuments in California, but then walked back that decision.
The administration’s threats to the nation’s national monuments have been met with protests across the country.
“Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument reflects a truth we hold sacred: the land is inseparable from who we are.","A recent, non-binding opinion from the Government Accountability Office may pave the way for Congress to begin rescinding management plans for national monuments across the country, environmentalists and experts say, potentially leading to protected areas being further opened up for resource extraction. And Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah is yet again at the center of the renewed threats to the nation’s monuments.

Designated by President Bill Clinton in 1996 and spanning 1.87 million acres of public land, it protects scores of wildlife, archeological resources and sacred sites for local tribes. Despite vast public support for the monument, Utah Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration for years worked to dismantle and downsize it, with the first Trump administration cutting 900,000 acres from the monument before the Biden administration restored it to its original size.

The monument’s resource management plan, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) opinion finds, must undergo Congressional review. Local tribes and environmental groups expect Utah’s congressional delegation to introduce a “resolution of disapproval” in the House of Representatives to overturn the monument’s management plan using the Congressional Review Act (CRA)—a 1996 law that Congress enacted to overturn certain federal agency actions through a special review process. Then Congress would have 60 days to vote on the matter. If the management plan is rescinded, the CRA requires any new plan to be substantially different from the current one that prioritizes conservation.

“Utah politicians are at it again, doing whatever they can to erode protections for our public lands,” said Tom Delehanty, senior attorney at Earthjustice, in a statement. “The monument management plan was created by local officials, Tribes, and communities working together to provide certainty in how this national treasure is managed and protected. Now Utah’s elected officials want to flush that effort down the toilet — a situation that benefits no one.”

Downsizing or rescinding national monuments has been a major goal of the Trump administration. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum issued secretarial orders calling for the review of national monuments to determine which should be downsized or eliminated to make way for more resource extraction. The Department of Justice, at the White House’s request, issued an opinion that the president has the power to review and eliminate national monuments. The Trump administration eliminated the two most recently created national monuments in California, but then walked back that decision.

The administration’s threats to the nation’s national monuments have been met with protests across the country. Polling has shown that presidential use of the Antiquities Act to create national monuments is widely popular, and polling in Utah shows that three-fourths of registered voters support Grand Staircase-Escalante.

Last year, the GAO issued similar opinions regarding resource management plans issued by BLM field offices, which Congress then struck down. But those previous decisions were all for general, multi-use public lands, not national monuments.

Steve Bloch, legal director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said the newest GAO opinion is a major escalation of efforts to upend land management plans, and targets national monuments specifically rather than public lands in general. This month, Congress has extended the use of the CRA to include overturning protections from mining for Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, an unprecedented move to rescind an executive mineral withdrawal to allow a mine to be permitted in the area.

Resource management plans are the blueprint for how the Bureau of Land Management, which manages Grand Staircase, and other land agencies oversee protected lands, he said, guiding everything from how to protect endangered species to where new bathrooms can be built. Unlike other overturned management plans under the CRA, the overarching priority for monuments is protecting resources, he said.

For Grand Staircase, those include preserved fossils, cultural sites and unique biology and geology, Bloch said. Overturning the plan will only lead to confusion.

“We know in a place like Grand Staircase, confusion can breed on the ground impacts,” he said.

Last June, Utah Rep. Celeste Maloy, a Republican representing the district encompassing Grand Staircase-Escalante and a vocal opponent of the Antiquities Act that allows presidents to designate national monuments, wrote a letter to the GAO requesting its opinion on whether the recently approved management plan for the monument was a formal “rule”—a legally binding decision issued by federal agencies. Management plans issued by the Bureau of Land Management or other land agencies have historically not been viewed as such and have consequently not been subject to the CRA.

But the GAO’s opinion found that a resource management plan is a formal rule because it has a “future effect” on how the land within the monument is managed and has “substantial effect on non-agency parties,” such as limiting cattle grazing, mining, logging and the use of off-highway vehicles in sensitive areas.

Many of the monuments targeted are significant to local tribes, which has been a top consideration in their management. Last year, the Hopi Tribe, the Navajo Nation, the Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians, the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and the Zuni Tribe formed the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument Inter-Tribal Coalition to advocate for the protection of the monument and help shape how it is managed. The coalition has strongly denounced the GAO’s opinion and has urged members of Congress not to overturn the current resource management plan.

Without a strong plan, the coalition said, the tribes’ ancestral lands and cultural sites will be at risk of looting and degradation.

“Whether it is through the careful stewardship of sacred sites, educating others about our respective cultures, or the deliberations that guide the balance between access and protection, our active participation in these processes reflects our sovereignty and our commitment to a shared future,” said Cassidy K. Morgan, programs and projects specialist with the Navajo Nation Heritage and Historic Preservation Department who is a member of the coalition, in a statement. “Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument reflects a truth we hold sacred: the land is inseparable from who we are. No matter the complexity of today’s debates, our guiding principle is clear: these places must be protected and honored as part of our shared heritage and as part of the life-giving system of Mother Earth.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Grosvenor-Arch-GSENM-c-Tim-Peterson.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 20:59:12.183572

This paper advocates an accelerated transition as a means not only to meet climate goals but also to improve the EU’s energy security. Our analysis highlights how the bloc’s reliance on imported fossil fuels is a major source of energy insecurity, explains why nuclear power cannot take up the slack (for reasons of cost, long development timeframes, and legacy reliance on Russian fuel and parts), and illustrates the ability of renewables to alleviate price volatility, insulate against supply shocks and mitigate the geopolitical risks associated with the EU’s fossil fuel demand. Also critical to the success of this transition are the electrification of transport and increased use of flexible, digitized grids to manage supply and demand more efficiently. The paper presents detailed proposals for policy changes that could be undertaken by the European Commission and its partners.",https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_1200_630/public/2026-01/2026-01-27-power-substation-rezekne-latvia-2197734675.jpg?itok=c-kcvVwt,N,,2026-01-26 23:59:06.354961

“All across the state, Washingtonians are embracing clean energy and switching to electric vehicles, and they need a robust network of charging stations,” Attorney General Nick Brown said. “That’s why my team and I have fought so hard to make sure the federal government follows the law and provides the funding that Congress intended.”

In the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Congress appropriated $5 billion for the NEVI Formula Program to facilitate nationwide deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and improve charging reliability for the public. States developed and were carrying out plans to build that network when President Trump, on day one of his administration, issued an executive order directing federal agencies to immediately stop releasing NEVI funds. Following that directive, DOT abruptly halted the NEVI program. A coalition of states led by the attorneys general of Washington, California, and Colorado sued in May and won a preliminary injunction from U.S. District Court Judge Tana Lin in June. Seven environmental non-profit organizations also joined the litigation.

Now, in her summary judgment order, Judge Lin said DOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) acted outside the law and their actions were arbitrary and capricious. She barred DOT and FHWA from suspending or revoking the plaintiff states’ approved electric vehicle infrastructure plans in the future and from withholding their NEVI Formula Program funds for any reason not expressly authorized by Congress in the IIJA.

“Such capriciousness runs counter to the Administrative Procedure Act; it is simply not how things are lawfully done,” Judge Lin wrote in her order.

The Energy Justice Leadership Program is environmental and energy justice in action.","Decisions related to energy utility services typically happen in spaces removed from the community members who those decisions impact — namely the everyday residential consumer, especially people with limited means. However, in the last three years, a noticeably higher number of community members have voiced their thoughts, questions, and concerns to energy decisionmakers.

Various factors have supported this surge in interest: rising utility rates; increased awareness of the many impacts of our energy system; and the work of partner organizations like the Citizens Utility Board of Oregon, the Community Energy Project, the Coalition of Communities of Color, and Verde that prioritize outreach and raise public awareness of important energy decisions.

Also driving this emerging engagement is the Energy Justice Leadership Program and the community leaders participating in it. Together, the participants have been working to make our energy system better serve Oregonians.

Now in its third year, the Energy Justice Leadership Program brings its participants, known as Energy Justice Leaders, together with advocates who engage in energy justice conversations as part of our work. The program fosters mutual learning about policy decisions ripe for community input, and about the priorities, needs, and solutions that the leaders see as crucial for the communities they work with. The leaders participating in this program are grassroots community activists from all over the state who bring a wide variety of perspectives and share the goal of making sure that decisions around Oregon energy utilities serve environmental justice communities and center their needs. Participants over the years have come from a stunning range of experiences and identities, including youth, elders, Tribal citizens, BIPOC community members, people living in rural communities, people experiencing disability, people with low incomes, environmental activists, local community activists, and more.

The obscure world of energy utility regulation

Multnomah County residents get their gas and electricity from utilities that have monopolies over their service territory, or the exclusive right to serve a particular area. That means that if a community member is unhappy with their gas or electric utility, they cannot switch to a competitor.

To make sure that customers are served well, states like Oregon established public entities to regulate these utilities. In Oregon, that regulator is a state agency called the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC). The OPUC’s three commissioners make final decisions on many utility-related matters, including whether to approve utilities’ requests to raise rates.

The OPUC holds meetings to hear from interested parties before making decisions. However, few people know about the commission, and even fewer participate in its complex and jargon-filled processes. Although a growing number of advocates representing environmental justice communities participate (and encourage community members’ participation), those representing the interests of industry are often significantly better resourced to attend and influence the meeting outcomes.

Supporting community leadership in energy decision making

Because of the way meeting awareness, participation, and attendance is tilted, OPUC commissioners do not hear often enough from community members most impacted by their decisions. But the Energy Justice Leadership Program has set out to change that.

Energy Justice Leaders are impacting Oregon energy policy. They have voiced their communities’ needs and concerns directly to the OPUC, as well as energy utilities and the Legislature, helping shape policies and outcomes on resilience, rates, the landscape faced by low-income customers, clean energy planning, and more.

The program’s model breaks down accessibility barriers in energy policy decision-making. The Multnomah County Office of Sustainability is proud to facilitate this program along with the Coalition of Communities of Color, Verde, the Oregon Just Transition Alliance, and the NW Energy Coalition.

“This Program has increased energy decision-makers’ and advocates’ awareness of the lived experience and priorities of community members that they would often not get to hear and learn from,” said Silvia Tanner, Senior Energy Policy and Legal Analyst at the Multnomah County Office of Sustainability. “As an energy justice advocate, I owe much to this program and to the expertise that the leaders so generously share.”

As the Office of Sustainability’s co-facilitator of the program, Silvia has been engaged since Day One and has co-designed curriculum and materials, presented on utility-related topics, led participants conversations in Spanish and English (translating and interpreting from English to Spanish when needed), contributed to fundraising applications, and helped build how the program engages with participants and how the facilitators work together.

Yet despite significant progress on accessibility, much work remains to ensure that OPUC processes are accessible and well-suited to incorporate the feedback and needs of impacted community members who engage. As a result, the programs’ participants and facilitators continue to dedicate significant time and energy to supporting more accessibility at the OPUC.

The Energy Justice Leadership Program is environmental and energy justice in action. The Office of Sustainability is committed to this program because we believe in the power of rooting policy in the realities of the people they impact — an essential part of our mission of centering the priorities of frontline communities.

“The clean energy transition is vital to protecting our climate and getting to a stronger and more stable economy, but we need more than decarbonizing our energy systems,” said Silvia.

“We need a just energy transition that recognizes the needs and realities of all of our community. Getting to 100% while too many in our community continue to be disconnected is not how we should define success.”

The Northwest Energy Coalition has been leading this work with support from the Office of Sustainability and other partners. Funding from Portland Energy Conservation (PECI) and Meyer Memorial Trust has supported this program in its last three years. Meyer Memorial Trust recently announced that it will provide important funding, with NW Energy Coalition as the lead organization, to sustain the program for an additional two years. We look forward to securing additional resources to ensure the continued success of the Energy Justice Leadership Program, and to two more years of ensuring that grassroot community voices shape our energy future!",https://multco.us/sites/default/files/2026-01/20251020_113916-cropped.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 23:59:01.540799

[3] President Trump followed this EO with four additional EOs designed to speed up the approval processes for nuclear reactors and to remove other barriers to developing the domestic supply of nuclear energy.","Key Takeaways

The nuclear power industry is experiencing renewed momentum in 2026, and recent federal actions—including bipartisan support, new tax credits, and regulatory streamlining by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)—aim to reduce permitting delays and encourage investment.

Project developers and hyperscalers face ongoing risks related to permitting, fuel procurement, interconnection logistics, and complex power purchase agreement (PPA) structures, especially as they navigate evolving market rules and supply chain uncertainties.

These developments signal a strategic bet by leading technology companies that nuclear energy will be essential for meeting long-term, reliable power needs, even as they accept the risks associated with new technologies and regulatory changes.

After a busy 2025 for the nuclear power industry and its federal regulators, the opening days of 2026 have made clear that this trend is only accelerating in the year ahead. With data centers, cloud computing, and AI driving electricity demand to previously unseen levels, and hyperscalers increasingly willing to think creatively about sources of clean, reliable, baseload power, the nuclear sector—including new and existing large-scale reactor sites and innovative small modular reactors (SMRs)—is poised for a decade of rejuvenation and reinvention. To do so, however, it must capitalize on recent developments at the NRC and DOE to overcome the regulatory red tape and cost overruns that have defined the industry in recent years, while securing the trust of local communities.

The first hyperscaler to move forward in 2026 is Meta, which announced on January 9 that it would procure up to 6.6 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear energy in the PJM market from three different partners, Vistra, TerraPower, and Oklo. This includes signing 20-year PPAs with Vistra to extend the life of two existing Vistra-owned plants in Ohio totaling more than 2.1 GW, and to uprate the capacity of both facilities and another plant in Beaver Valley, Pennsylvania, by 433 megawatts (MW) of cumulative additional power.

Also in the PJM market, Meta announced a new partnership with TerraPower to fund development of at least two 345 MW next-generation Natrium reactors to generate firm power as early as 2032, along with rights to procure up to a further 2.1 GW from six additional reactors later in the decade, paired with up to 1.2 GW of built-in energy storage capacity. Finally, Meta agreed to prepay Oklo for power offtake from a new 1.2 GW Aurora powerhouse situated on the former site of the decommissioned and decontaminated Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Ohio, which served as a nuclear enrichment facility for more than 60 years, ending in the early 2000s. Oklo plans to use this funding to support buildout of this flagship facility and to support fuel procurement.

Together, these partnerships build on a busy 2025 by Meta and other hyperscalers, with numerous announcements of offtake agreements for new, existing, and expanded or extended existing nuclear projects. This includes Meta’s 20-year PPA with Constellation for 1.1 GW of power from the Illinois Clinton Clean Energy Center (announced in June 2025); Amazon’s 1.9 GW deal with Talen Energy for nuclear power from its Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, facility (also announced in June 2025); and Google’s October 2025 announcement of its agreement with NextEra to restart and procure power from the previously decommissioned Duane Arnold facility in Iowa.

Taken together, these offtake agreements and investments in the nuclear fission industry, most of which will not come into effect until the first half of the 2030s, represent a clear calculation by some of the largest and most valuable technology companies in the world that the surge in demand for reliable energy and capacity that defines the current moment will extend well into the next decade. It is also a sign that GW-scale stable, reliable baseload is worth enough to these data center and AI operators that they will take a chance on new and untested SMR technologies and the kinds of larger-scale reactors that have run into extended and expensive regulatory and supply-chain delays.[1]

Part of the calculus for these new investments may be an emerging and seemingly bipartisan commitment to the nuclear industry at the federal level. After the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act created Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Tax Credits (aka 45U credits) for existing nuclear plants[2] and new incentives for SMRs, the Trump administration has doubled down on nuclear energy—a rare area of consensus and continuity.

The Trump administration’s support for nuclear energy has taken multiple forms and is closely connected to its prioritization of AI and data center buildout as a national security priority. On May 23, 2025, President Donald Trump signed four Executive Orders (EO) aimed at reinvigorating the American nuclear power sector, with a focus on speeding the permitting process for new reactors. Since then, DOE has sought to co-locate large AI data center complexes and new generation sources on federal lands, with an emphasis on using existing federal nuclear sites to build out new nuclear generation. Additionally, President Trump issued EO 14270 on April 9, 2025, directing certain agencies, including the NRC, DOE, and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to enact new rules to “sunset” many older regulations to streamline permitting and other processes for industry.[3]

In its most recent action on January 8, 2026, the NRC promulgated sunsetting rules pursuant to EO 14270[4] and established a default one-year sunset date for certain federal nuclear regulations on January 8, 2027, unless those rules are extended on a case-by-case basis by the NRC before that date following a public comment period. Most NRC regulations, including all those relating to its core statutory missions of protecting public health and safety and providing for the common defense, will remain unchanged by the new sunset rule. A number of duplicative and obsolete rules, however, such as those governing gaseous diffusion plants, which have been inoperable for decades (and are part of DOE’s plans to upcycle new nuclear sites), are now slated to be removed from the Federal Register early next year. Additionally, consistent with recent U.S. Supreme Court guidance in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo,[5] the NRC has targeted for removal a handful of regulations that are not directly grounded in statute, such as a rule stating that only written interpretations of NRC regulations issued by the NRC’s general counsel are binding on the commission.

One rule that was proposed for sunsetting attracted significant public comment and ultimately was reversed by the NRC upon publication of the direct final rule. The Aircraft Impact Assessment Rule was implemented in the wake of September 11, 2001, and requires each applicant to construct a new nuclear reactor in the United States to evaluate the impact of a large commercial aircraft colliding with the facility and to implement design features to keep the nuclear reactor and spent fuel areas cool and contained following such an impact.

Insights

Although efforts by the administration, NRC, and DOE to streamline regulations may bear meaningful fruit for nuclear project developers, permitting will remain a critical challenge. This is especially true for SMRs and other advanced nuclear technologies that lack an established permitting pathway for regulators to follow. Even as tech giants jockey for offtake from new nuclear projects in the coming years, project timelines will not leave much room for delays around permitting and financing, which are often issues for first-of-a-kind technologies. Additional hurdles may arise for projects built on federal DOE sites, where a history of nuclear activity and contamination may complicate both permitting and construction, and where environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act will proceed under new and untested DOE implementing procedures published in June 2025. New technologies that require design approval by the NRC also face uncertain timelines, even with the administration’s clear intent to move quickly. Accordingly, both nuclear project developers and AI and data center operators looking to partner with them must consider the risks associated with delays, especially in the context of hyperscalers who cannot accommodate significant delays to powering up new co-located facilities.

As discussed in several previous posts, FERC is currently very focused on the issue of interconnecting data centers behind the meter at existing generation sites. DOE has directed FERC to expedite rulemaking asserting jurisdiction over large load interconnections to the transmission grid. For developers and operators of large load sources like data centers, the ability to efficiently interconnect with large, co-located generating resources varies significantly by market and is often a black box with few published rules for interested parties to follow. With the recent surge in interest, this is beginning to change, as regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) explore a variety of new mechanisms to fast-track critical new generation—such as MISO’s new Expedited Resource Addition Study process—or pair generation and load for study.

In an era increasingly defined by global instability, issues may arise regarding future nuclear fuel procurement, especially given that as much as 40% of global uranium supply continues to be sourced from Russia, with roughly another 17% coming from China. DOE clearly recognizes the challenge this represents and has announced a $2.7 billion investment in strengthening domestic uranium enrichment capabilities over the next decade. Even so, given the long time-horizon of the investments and PPAs under consideration, some inescapable risk exists with respect to future cycles of reactor fuel procurement. In light of this, both large load offtakers and nuclear operators will need to negotiate who bears the risks associated with the costs of fuel procurement, when those costs are incurred, and who bears the risk of cost increases associated with procuring fuel from nations free of sanctions in an evolving market.

For projects connecting new load centers with restarted or uprated nuclear reactors, additional important nuances will exist in certain markets, such as MISO or PJM, where offtake must be “sleeved” through a local utility. Some of these utilities have small existing footprints and customer bases that make the addition of a new GW-scale data center a significant portion of their overall demand. This, in turn, introduces new risks for parties around RTO/ISO market participation, transferring power via the RTO/ISO markets, and managing financial carry costs, given the potential for large pricing impacts to load serving entities that buy from the market to serve their load and have to balance the timing of payments from the customer with the timing of settlements with MISO or other system operators for both demand and power. Extended nuclear reactor outages, such as for a refueling cycle or maintenance, are typically longer in duration than other kinds of resources that smaller utilities deal with, presenting unique challenges to supply power and capacity during these outages.

Although firm, reliable power supplying data center demand is a principal benefit of procuring power from a nuclear generator, common contracting concepts for firm power resources can create accounting challenges for offtakers. Specifically, offtakers must craft provisions around the impacts of a failure to deliver that do not create a notional quantity of power expected for each measurement period—which is more challenging to achieve with a firm resource than renewable intermittent resources—while still providing comfort to the offtaker that they will get the power that they need. Crafting PPAs that have appropriate teeth without creating a notional value requires careful balancing.

Finally, where generation sources like SMRs sign behind-the-meter PPAs co-located with load before the load is served by the grid (i.e., islanded for some period of time pending system upgrades), generators often seek capacity payments for that behind-the-meter generation, which can raise lease accounting concerns for buyers.

At OSEA, we focus on delivering practical, actionable strategies that directly address your environmental safety concerns, ensuring you stay compliant, avoid penalties, and create a safer working environment for your employees.

How Does Environmental Safety Consulting Protect Your Business?

1. Ensuring Compliance with Complex Regulations

Staying compliant with environmental laws can be daunting, especially with constantly changing rules and standards. Non-compliance can lead to hefty fines, legal issues, and even operational disruptions. Environmental safety consultants are experts in navigating the complexities of laws such as:

EPA regulations (Environmental Protection Agency)

OSHA safety standards (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)

State and local environmental laws (varied by jurisdiction)

Our consultants review your operations, ensuring that your practices align with these regulatory requirements. With their help, you can avoid violations, protect your business from legal consequences, and foster a reputation as a responsible corporate citizen.

2. Identifying and Mitigating Workplace Hazards

Every workplace is unique, and so are its environmental and safety risks. Our consultants conduct thorough environmental risk assessments to identify environmental and safety hazards specific to your operations in areas like:

Air quality

Waste management

Water contamination

Hazardous chemical exposure

Once identified, these risks are addressed through tailored safety plans that reduce accidents and health issues. By mitigating these risks proactively, your business can prevent costly accidents, avoid employee sick days, and protect its reputation.

3. Improving Operational Sustainability

Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword; it's a necessity for businesses looking to thrive in an eco-conscious world. Environmental safety consulting helps businesses not only meet regulatory requirements but also reduce their environmental footprint.

Our consultants work with you to implement pollution prevention strategies, waste reduction measures, and energy-saving practices that align with sustainable business practices. By adopting these measures, your company will reduce its carbon footprint, conserve resources, and become more energy-efficient, all while staying compliant with industry regulations.

Key Steps in Environmental Safety Consulting: A Strategic Partnership

Environmental safety consulting isn’t a one-time service; it’s an ongoing partnership that helps your business continuously improve and stay compliant. Here’s a breakdown of the typical consulting process:

1. Initial Environmental Risk Assessment

The journey starts with a comprehensive environmental risk assessment, which serves as a ""health check"" for your business. This assessment reviews your operations, identifies potential risks, and provides insight into areas that may need immediate attention. Our consultants will evaluate:

Workplace hazards (chemical spills, air quality issues, etc.)

Waste management processes

Past compliance records

This thorough evaluation gives your business a clear picture of its environmental responsibilities and helps set the stage for future improvements.

2. Regulatory Compliance Review

With the risk assessment complete, the next step is a regulatory compliance review. This involves ensuring that your company’s operations comply with all relevant environmental laws and regulations. Our consultants meticulously cross-check your processes against federal and state regulations, including those from the EPA, OSHA, and local environmental agencies.

3. Create a Tailored Environmental Management Plan (EMP)

Once risks and regulatory gaps are identified, the next step is to create a tailored Environmental Management Plan (EMP). This plan includes specific procedures for:

Unit 18 has already been down since July and would likely need six months to get back online, NIPSCO has disclosed.
A spokeswoman last week said the company had no updates on how it is working to carry out the federal order.
Environmental groups are challenging the emergency orders by contending the plants are old, outdated and expensive to run.
Environmental groups say that wind, solar and other energy sources can generate enough electricity without as much pollution and carbon emissions.","Seven environmental and consumer advocacy groups filed rehearing requests Thursday in response to the U.S. Department of Energy's December order to extend the life of NIPSCO's R.M. Schahfer Generating Station in Wheatfield and another coal-fired power plant in southern Indiana.

Just Transition Northwest Indiana, the Sierra Club, Environmental Law and Policy Center, Earthjustice, Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Hoosier Environmental Council and Public Citizen are challenging the Department of Energy's order mandating Merrillville-based NIPSCO keep Unit 17 and Unit 18 operating for 90 days past retirement that had been planned for the end of 2025, and that CenterPoint Energy keep running its 103.7 MW Unit 2 at the F.B. Culley Generating Station in Warrick County near Evansville in southern Indiana.

“This is a needless, last-ditch effort to resuscitate a dying industry to power the AI boom,” said Ashley Williams, executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana. “Our communities are organizing and confronting the Trump administration’s shameful actions. This order will have irreversible consequences, locking in generations more of climate-devastating pollution and toxic coal ash waste contaminating the waterways of Jasper County and beyond. It exacerbates an affordability crisis where families are sacrificing their basic needs to pay escalating utility bills, a reality Hoosiers know all too well.”

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright declared in late December that there was an emergency in portions of the Midwest due to energy shortages and ordered NIPSCO to keep Unit 17 and Unit 18 operating for 90 days past the end of 2025. Unit 18 has already been down since July and would likely need six months to get back online, NIPSCO has disclosed. A spokeswoman last week said the company had no updates on how it is working to carry out the federal order.

""As coal-fired facilities, it would be difficult for the Schahfer Units 17 and 18 to resume operations once they have been retired,"" the Department of Energy said in its order. ""Specifically, any stop and start of operation creates heating and cooling cycles that could cause an immediate failure that could take 30-60 days to repair if a unit comes offline.""

It added that other practical issues, such as employment, contracts and permits, may greatly increase the timeline for resumption of operations. There would be significant challenges if Schahfer were to begin disassembling the plant or other related facilities.

The R.M. Schahfer plant has been operating since 1976, and the F.B. Culley generating station has been running since 1966.

Environmental groups are challenging the emergency orders by contending the plants are old, outdated and expensive to run.

""The federal government has invented a grid reliability crisis in a transparent and illegal attempt to commandeer uneconomic, dilapidated power plants, force them to operate and stick us with the bill,"" said Ben Inskeep, program director at Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition. ""We are fighting back against the federal government's unprecedented overreach that will cause our utility bills to soar and choke Hoosier communities with more toxic pollution from coal.""

The DOE order said that there was not enough electric generation capacity to keep up with demand.

""Large quantities of existing generation capacity are projected to be retired each year while, at the same time, the demand for electricity is projected to increase at an accelerating pace,"" according to the order. ""Although the survey projects generation capacity to continue to increase in the coming years with the addition of new potential generation assets, the increase in capacity is largely offset by the projected retirements, and does not keep up with the growth in demand.""

Environmental groups say that wind, solar and other energy sources can generate enough electricity without as much pollution and carbon emissions.

“Cleaner power sources are available, and Schahfer and Culley were ready to stop burning coal, so the federal order for them to continue burning coal is an unwarranted extension of coal and coal ash pollution in Indiana,” said Indra Frank, coal ash advisor at Hoosier Environmental Council.

Especially when it comes to something as vital as the air we breathe. Recently, I came across a notice from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerning a proposed revision to West Virginia's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Parkersburg area. This isn't just bureaucratic jargon; it's about how we manage air quality, specifically concerning ozone.

The core of this proposal revolves around the Parkersburg 8-hour ozone maintenance area. Think of it as a plan to keep ozone levels in check, ensuring the air remains healthy for everyone. The EPA was looking at a revision submitted by West Virginia that would amend the motor vehicle emission budgets (MVEBs) for 2009 and 2018. Essentially, they were reallocating a portion of the 'safety margins' within these plans. This reallocation, in turn, would lead to an increase in these MVEBs.

What's interesting here is the EPA's approach. They intended to approve this revision as a 'direct final rule' without a prior proposal. This usually signals that the agency views the submission as non-controversial, anticipating no significant objections. The detailed reasoning behind this approval was laid out in the full text of the direct final rule. The idea was simple: if no adverse comments came in by the deadline – December 1, 2008, in this case – the approval would stand. If, however, concerns were raised, the direct final rule would be withdrawn, and all comments would be addressed in a subsequent final rule. No second comment period would be opened, so it was important for interested parties to voice their opinions promptly.

For anyone wanting to dive deeper or submit their thoughts, the EPA provided clear instructions. Comments could be submitted online via www.regulations.gov, by email to febbo.carol@epa.gov, or through traditional mail or hand delivery to the EPA Region III office in Philadelphia. The key was to identify comments with Docket ID Number EPA–R03–OAR–2008–0746. The EPA also made it clear that all comments received would be part of the public docket, available online, and would include any personal information provided, unless specifically marked as Confidential Business Information (CBI).

It's a reminder that environmental regulations, while complex, are a collaborative effort. Public input is a crucial part of the process, ensuring that decisions about our air quality are made with transparency and community involvement. The Parkersburg ozone maintenance plan is just one piece of this larger puzzle, but it highlights the ongoing work to protect our environment.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-26 19:58:37.250411

The North Sea has been one of the largest producers of oil and methane in the world since 1975. Today, there are as many as 500 drilling platforms in the area, although not all of them are in active production. It is fair to say the area has been a vital part of the economic engine that has powered the economies of many European countries for decades.

But fossil fuels have one significant drawback — their supply is finite and it takes millions of years to make more. Humans have blown through much of the available supply in less than 100 years with little thought for what will replace them when they are exhausted.

On January 26, 2026, nine European nations that border the North Sea — the UK, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Norway, plus Iceland — are scheduled to meet in Hamburg, Germany, to sign an Offshore Wind Investment Pack For The North Sea that will lead to the creation of a 100 GW network of wind turbines in that area. The total investment between now and the end of the decade is expected to exceed $11 billion.

Part of the agreement between the ten countries and over 100 industry suppliers is to harmonize and rationalize the specifications for wind turbines and the distribution systems that will bring the electricity ashore. The goal is to reduce the cost of offshore wind by 30% through more efficient design and permitting.

A Clean Energy Hub

When complete it will be “one of the world’s largest clean energy reservoirs,” according to UK energy minister Ed Miliband, who said the UK was “standing up for our national interest” by pushing for clean energy and getting “off the fossil fuel roller coaster.”

The new wind energy platform in the North Sea could help attract well over a trillion dollars in offshore wind investment by 2040, according to WindEurope. It says the Investment Pact will provide planning and investment security and de-risk offshore wind projects. It includes a commitment to provide two sided Contracts for Difference as the standard for offshore wind auction design. Those contracts are key to unlocking investments and reduce financing costs by providing greater clarify about expected revenues.

It also advocates for remove regulatory obstacles to power purchase agreements, the direct contractual understandings between electricity producers and corporate end-consumers. “The steady pipeline of offshore wind projects will bring the needed confidence to invest in new capacity for manufacturing, ports infrastructure and vessels,” WindEurope says. It projects the wind expansion in the North Sea will create more than 90,000 jobs for workers in clean energy industries.

“Today Europe doubles down on offshore wind. Government cooperation on offshore wind buildout can help crowd in €1trillion of investments in the next decade. This is the best possible response to those who doubt Europe. And our drive to deliver energy that is homegrown, secure and affordable.” said WindEurope CEO Malgosia Bartosik.

An Answer To Davos Tirade

The signing of the new agreement comes less than a week after the squalling man-child who is the alleged president of the United States harangued world leaders at the World Economic Conference in Davos, Switzerland and criticized the plans by the UK to phase out production of North Sea oil and gas.

“There are windmills all over Europe,” the mentally deranged doofus said. “There are windmills all over the place and they are losers. One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing.”

Katherina Reiche, the economic minister for Germany said this week’s North Sea conference is a “nice answer” to those lunatic ravings. “Today’s investment pact provides reliable perspectives for the offshore sector, secures creation of value in Europe and brings future-proof jobs,” Reiche added.

Bloomberg reports this latest agreement reaffirms Europe’s commitment to 300 GW of renewable energy by the middle of this century. Miliband will also sign a statement of intent with Germany, Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands to open up cross-border offshore electricity projects, with a focus on joint planning and cost sharing.

Energy UK, the sector’s trade association in the UK, said it fully backed the “landmark efforts … to transform the North Sea into a truly regional clean power hub.” Its executive director Dhara Vyas said, “This deeper cooperation on supply chains, standardization and shared infrastructure is not just a strategic necessity, it is the most effective way to bring down energy costs for households and businesses while fueling sustainable economic growth and high-value jobs for years to come.” Last year, wind and solar overtook fossil fuels in the EU’s power generation by generating 30% of its electricity.

Challenges

The governments involved in the North Sea wind energy pact are also pledging to bolster the push for clean power with their own domestic initiatives. While the UK has stepped up support for the technology, which resulted in a record wind auction earlier this month, the most recent zero subsidy tender in Germany attracted no bidders. Upcoming rounds also risk failure, Bloomberg said.

“In this respect, we will adjust the tender design and areas so that we can offer a good investment framework,” said Reiche, adding that the changes will be paired with so-called contracts for difference, which provide a minimum subsidy and an upper cap.

The North Sea summit follows two similar gatherings in the past three years in which countries bordering the North Sea set out plans to install 300 GW of capacity — up from about 35 GW currently — in response to the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. NATO and the European Commission are also taking part, with Iceland joining despite not being a North Sea nation.

Oil and gas extraction in the North Sea accounts for more than 9% of historical global greenhouse gas emissions, said climate non-profit 350.org, citing calculations by Oil Change International. “Transforming the North Sea into a renewable energy hub would not erase that damage, but it could begin to correct it,” said Clémence Dubois, the group’s campaign manager.

Closer cooperation between countries might also help protect conservation areas, according to Felix Schmidt, policy advisor for WWF Germany. “At the moment, biodiversity doesn’t have the priority in marine-protected areas in the North Sea, given the numerous economic uses that continue to take place within these areas,” he said.

Among its other advantages, the new offshore wind agreements will help deliver more clean energy at lower prices for people and businesses all across Europe. It’s hard to see why that would bother some people so much — unless they have a personal financial stake in selling fossil fuels.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/offshore-wind-farm-construction-maersk-vessel-800x416.png,N,,2026-01-26 18:59:16.764428

-30- Washington’s Attorney General serves the people and the state of Washington.","In a multi-state lawsuit co-led by Washington, California, and Colorado, a federal judge issued a final ruling that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) illegally withheld about $1 billion in funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program from 20 states and the District of Columbia.

“All across the state, Washingtonians are embracing clean energy and switching to electric vehicles, and they need a robust network of charging stations,” Attorney General Nick Brown said. “That’s why my team and I have fought so hard to make sure the federal government follows the law and provides the funding that Congress intended.”

In the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Congress appropriated $5 billion for the NEVI Formula Program to facilitate nationwide deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and improve charging reliability for the public. States developed and were carrying out plans to build that network when President Trump, on day one of his administration, issued an executive order directing federal agencies to immediately stop releasing NEVI funds. Following that directive, DOT abruptly halted the NEVI program. A coalition of states led by the attorneys general of Washington, California, and Colorado sued in May and won a preliminary injunction from U.S. District Court Judge Tana Lin in June. Seven environmental non-profit organizations also joined the litigation.

Now, in her summary judgment order, Judge Lin said DOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) acted outside the law and their actions were arbitrary and capricious. She barred DOT and FHWA from suspending or revoking the plaintiff states’ approved electric vehicle infrastructure plans in the future and from withholding their NEVI Formula Program funds for any reason not expressly authorized by Congress in the IIJA.

“Such capriciousness runs counter to the Administrative Procedure Act; it is simply not how things are lawfully done,” Judge Lin wrote in her order.

EV lease returns are projected to exceed 300,000 units in 2026, driven by heavy leasing in 2022–23.

Most off-lease vehicles will be low-mileage and warranty-backed, supporting CPO and retail opportunities.

Dealers who align acquisition and pricing with local demand are best positioned to capitalize on the influx.

More than 300,000 electric vehicles are expected to return from lease in 2026, representing an increase of more than 200% from the 123,000 units projected for 2025. The surge stems largely from elevated leasing activity in 2022 and 2023, when federal and state incentives sharply reduced monthly payments, according to CDK Global data.

That leasing wave was driven in part by provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that allowed leased EVs, classified as commercial vehicles, to qualify for the full $7,500 federal tax credit regardless of domestic sourcing requirements. Dealers were able to pass those savings on to consumers, even when the same vehicles did not qualify for incentives if purchased outright.

Sign up for CBT News’ daily newsletter and get the latest industry stories delivered straight to your inbox.

When combined with aggressive state-level incentives, lease payments fell dramatically in many markets, in some cases approaching zero dollars per month. As a result, EV lease penetration climbed from about 15% in 2022 to 67% by March 2025. During that period, nearly 1 million EV leases were written, accounting for close to half of all franchise EV sales.

Most vehicles returning in 2026 will be two- to three-year-old models from the 2022 and 2023 model years, typically with about 25,000 miles. Many will still carry factory warranties, including federally mandated battery coverage of eight years or 100,000 miles. That remaining coverage is expected to support resale demand, particularly among first-time EV buyers.

At the same time, the pre-owned EV market has begun to stabilize after several volatile years. Average used EV list prices hovered near $37,000 in 2025, with nearly one-third of listings priced below $25,000. As the market matures, depreciation rates have moderated, improving value retention for some models.

For dealers, acquisition dynamics are also shifting as many leases written in 2022 and 2023 assumed residual values near 50%, while current market estimates place actual residuals closer to 35% to 40%. That gap is expected to push more off-lease vehicles to auction, creating buying opportunities for retailers that understand their local demand patterns.

As the supply of used EVs grows, dealerships’ success will increasingly depend on a combination of local market insight and customer education. This is because demand is variable, influenced by factors like charging infrastructure, available incentives, and consumer familiarity. By providing customers with a clear understanding of ownership costs and warranty coverage, dealers will be better positioned in this evolving market.

As federal EV incentives decrease, the price gap between used EVs and comparable gas cars is narrowing.

Energy efficiency could lower power bills for households and reduce energy burdens in low-income communities.
But given the rapidly evolving risks that data centers pose to the grid, scaling up these programs now is instrumental in mitigating their impacts.","In November, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved a groundbreaking settlement agreement that establishes a new rate structure for large-load customers like data centers. The agreement brought together a diverse group of perspectives, including NRDC, the Data Center Coalition, Google, staff from the Kansas Corporation Commission and Kansas’s largest electric utility, Evergy.

The settlement agreement includes robust financial requirements, including up-front deposits, a minimum 12-year contract term, 80 percent minimum demand charges, and exit fees. Evergy’s approved rate also allows large-load customers to voluntarily invest in their own clean energy generating resources, similar to the terms that Nevada approved in NV Energy’s Clean Transition Tariff in May 2025.

What makes this settlement especially innovative is that in addition to bringing their own clean energy supply, large customers can also invest in distributed resources, including energy efficiency (EE), battery storage, and other demand-side management (DSM) programs.

Electrical grids are designed to meet electricity demand at its peak, which only occurs a few hours a year. These peaks determine how much generation, transmission, and distribution must be built, and how much customers must ultimately pay. The system often relies on the most expensive and often polluting resources to meet peak needs.

Massive data centers, most of which operate near full capacity 24/7, significantly raise these peaks, straining the grid and driving up costs. Programs that reduce demand during peak hours could defer or avoid the need for new generation and infrastructure investments, lowering bills for all customers.

To that end, the Kansas settlement incentivizes data centers to participate in demand response programs. However, only a small subset of data centers can currently reduce or shift their load, making it critical to look at other peak-reduction strategies.

Distributed resources are proven, cost-effective, and fast to deploy. EE, DSM, and battery storage bring with them grid benefits—they can help mitigate peak demand, enhance grid reliability, and reduce the need to rely on higher-emitting resources during peak hours or periods of system stress.

Importantly, well-designed, customer-sided programs can deliver benefits directly to the communities that need them the most. Energy efficiency could lower power bills for households and reduce energy burdens in low-income communities. Large-load customers are uniquely positioned to contribute to these outcomes by directly investing in community-focused programs.

Customer-funded EE and DSM programs are not new. But given the rapidly evolving risks that data centers pose to the grid, scaling up these programs now is instrumental in mitigating their impacts.

The settlement establishes these critically important pathways, yet participation remains voluntary. Realizing its potential depends on how data centers and regulators implement these programs.

Many data centers have corporate social and environmental goals aligned with these programs. Given the significant impacts of data center developments and the enormous wealth behind these developers, now is the time for data centers to deliver on the economic benefits they have promised by opting into these programs.

Demand-side solutions are gaining increasing attention in other states. Legislation recently passed in Minnesota makes it a requirement for data centers to pay into an energy conservation and weatherization fund to benefit low-income customers. And data centers might be required to curtail their load or provide capacity resources to reduce peak demand, such as in Texas’s passed legislation or in FERC’s recently issued order to PJM.

Data centers are reshaping our energy future. They can either deepen the challenges or help solve them. The Kansas settlement has shown that collaboration and innovation can create win-win solutions that protect affordability, reliability, and our climate.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2023-05/nrdc-media-logo-teaser.png?h=ec041e41&itok=UFakqxFX,N,,2026-01-26 21:58:41.039481

The full text of the letter is available below. The full list of signers is available here.

Dear Administrator Zeldin:

The undersigned conservative organizations want to commend you for your leadership in 2025 and look forward to working with you in 2026.

In your first year, you faced an incredible challenge to undo the damage from the previous administration. You have been successful in making this happen while simultaneously advancing a proactive agenda that recognizes environmental protection doesn’t require ignoring the rule of law or sound science.

A significant amount of attention has rightly been paid to the EPA’s decision to reconsider the 2009 endangerment finding. You didn’t back down from the scare tactics and handwringing from climate extremists over revisiting the flawed 2009 finding. Instead, the agency proposed a detailed rule outlining the problems with the endangerment finding. It also made an overwhelming case based on numerous legal arguments as to why the EPA doesn’t have statutory authority to promulgate greenhouse gas standards for new motor vehicles.

Your strong leadership goes well beyond the work on the endangerment finding. You led the fight against the Inflation Reduction Act’s abuse of taxpayer dollars, such as through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. In March 2025, you announced 31 deregulatory actions in what you called “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen.” This was not some mere announcement but a clear blueprint detailing what to expect from the agency. And you are delivering on this ambitious agenda.

The use of sound science is critical across the federal government, especially at the EPA. President Donald Trump has demonstrated his commitment to sound science through his May 2025 executive order “Restoring Gold Standard Science.” The executive order also demonstrates a commitment to properly consider risk. The executive order states “Highly unlikely and overly precautionary assumptions and scenarios should only be relied upon in agency decision-making where required by law or otherwise pertinent to the agency’s action.”

You have also demonstrated this commitment to sound science and proper risk assessment on issues ranging from Clean Air Act regulation to pesticide regulation. In the past, one of the biggest problems at the EPA has been statutory overreach. Another major problem though has been the agency’s use of junk science, unreasonable risk assessments, and the lack of transparency. The EPA under your leadership appears to recognize this problem.

Imposing an air standard that can have severe economic effects or not approving a chemical that can improve the day-to-day lives of Americans can hurt Americans, drive up prices, and restrict freedom. Therefore, it is critical that such an action is only taken when gold standard science has been the foundation of that action.

As we look back though on what you have accomplished, we want you to know that you have exceeded any reasonable expectations we could have had for a strong EPA administrator.

Please also know that we are available to help make 2026 at the EPA even better than 2025.

While rare earths are not, in fact, rare, it is harder to find them in high enough concentrations to economically mine and process them.
The heavier rare earths are even more difficult to extract in large enough amounts.
The government also has a deal with critical minerals processor, Indiana-based ReElement Technologies, for the rights to buy stock.
Lynas is the world’s largest rare earths player outside China and is currently considering developing projects in Texas.","Since Trump began his second term, the federal government has acquired ownership—or the right to purchase shares—in at least 10 companies. These include a “golden share” in Nippon Steel–owned U.S. Steel and becoming the largest shareholder in USA Rare Earth’s rival, MP Materials. The wave of dealmaking increasingly makes Trump the CEO-in-chief.

Six of the 10 pertain to the critical minerals industry, including rare earths, as the U.S. increasingly tries to break China’s near monopoly on a sector that’s vital to manufacturing everything from military equipment to cars to high-powered computing and data centers. Since Trump initiated tariff wars worldwide, China has leveraged its critical minerals and high-powered, magnet-manufacturing dominance.

“USA Rare Earth’s heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence,” said U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a statement. “This investment ensures our supply chains are resilient and no longer reliant on foreign nations.”

USA Rare Earth’s (USAR) stock jumped about 6% on Jan. 26 by afternoon trading after the deal was announced, increasing its market cap to about $3.7 billion. The stock is up 125% since the beginning of the year.

The government’s ownership stake could range from 8% to 16% depending on whether all the warrants are executed, according to an SEC filing Jan. 26. The deal includes $277 million in direct federal funding and a $1.3 billion loan through the CHIPS Act. USAR also announced a PIPE (private investment in public equity) deal for $1.5 billion led by large mutual fund players. In PIPE deals, public companies raise fast capital by selling securities directly to private, institutional investors at a negotiated price, typically at a discount.

Industry analyst Neal Dingmann of William Blair said in a note there’s a likely “assumption that there is more government rare earth funding to come” for other companies.

The USAR deal gave the U.S. government a nearly 31% discount on its shares compared with its Jan. 23 closing price. The agreement triggered a subsequent jump in the share price.

While the USAR deal comes through the Commerce Department, the previous one with MP Materials was via the Defense Department, showing a lack of consistency in how the deals are negotiated as the administration takes a bespoke approach.

Likewise, the government built a guaranteed price floor into the MP Materials deal, while the USAR agreement includes no such pricing mechanism—yet. The argument is the rare earths to be mined by USAR are less common and less subject to price dumping by China.

Future of USA Rare Earth

USAR doesn’t produce much yet either, but it’s on the cusp of doing so. Its Round Top rare earths mining and processing project in West Texas is slated to open by the end of 2028—two years earlier than prior projections—and its high-powered magnet manufacturing plant in Stillwater, Okla., is slated to open by the end of this spring.

Last year, USAR bought U.K.-based Less Common Metals, giving the company a processing and metal-making hub in the U.K. with a new facility beginning construction soon in France.

The goal for USAR is to become the only domestic mine-to-magnet manufacturer specializing in the rarer heavy rare earths, especially the dysprosium and terbium metals that are key to high-powered magnets. While rare earths are not, in fact, rare, it is harder to find them in high enough concentrations to economically mine and process them. The heavier rare earths are even more difficult to extract in large enough amounts.

MP Materials is currently the nation’s only mine-to-magnet manufacturer, but MP specializes in mining the lighter rare earths at its Mountain Pass hub in California.

As for the U.S. government’s other investments in critical minerals, the Trump administration has invested in two Canadian players, Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals—both of which are developing U.S. projects—and in North Carolina–based magnets manufacturer Vulcan Elements. The government also has a deal with critical minerals processor, Indiana-based ReElement Technologies, for the rights to buy stock.

Dingmann suggested keeping an eye on other players the administration could invest in, such as mining developers NioCorp Development, United States Antimony, and even Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths. Lynas is the world’s largest rare earths player outside China and is currently considering developing projects in Texas.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2247701721-e1769452471162.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-26 18:59:41.574915

Our Mission

Provide pertinent climate data and information services to State agencies and the public

Partner with the National Weather Service and the Rhode Island Water Resources Board to monitor drought

Advance the state's knowledge of climate change in alignment with the Act on Climate

Our History

2014 - Present

The Resilient Rhode Island Act was signed into law in 2014, which required the state to adaptively plan for and manage the impact of climate change. The position of State Climatologist was transitioned from URI to DEM's Office of Emergency Response to support the implementation of this new law. The transition from academia to a state agency was a pivotal moment, as the program's mission shifted from climate-agricultural research to operational climate services. Lenny Giuliano served as State Climatologist for over 10 years and formally established RISCO.

In 2021, the Resilient Rhode Island Act was succeeded by the Act on Climate, which requires the Rhode Island Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council (EC4) to “Advance the state’s understanding of the effects on climate change…” To aid the EC4 in this directive, the position of State Climatologist and the purview of RISCO was transitioned to DEM’s Office of Air Resources in 2025.

Since at least 1995, ALEC members have coalesced around common principles to guide state recycling policy, particularly on source reduction.
Some states are considering a regulatory tool called extended producer responsibility (EPR) to address recycling and solid waste consumers in the paper and packaging sectors.
First and foremost, packaging EPR programs should be a collaboration between the packaging industry and government—not driven by bans, mandates, or excessive regulation.
Meanwhile, California’s packaging EPR program will kick off in 2027 but not fully phase in until 2032.","Chairman Reeves, Chairman Todd, and Members of the Task Force:

My name is Jake Morabito, and I serve as Senior Director of Policy at the American Legislative Exchange Council. Thank you for the opportunity to speak before your committee today to share more about ALEC’s nonpartisan research and analysis on matters of recycling policy and solid waste management, as well as the efforts of our members across all 50 states to develop sound environmental policy rooted in market incentives and industry partnerships to achieve both a robust economy and the conservation of our nation’s precious natural resources and agricultural land.

In my capacity as Senior Policy Director, I also serve as director of ALEC’s Energy, Environment, and Agriculture Task Force, which consists of legislative leaders and policy experts from across the country committed to developing pragmatic and evidence-based model policy solutions across the EEA jurisdiction, including energy affordability and reliability, public lands policy and private property rights, chemical regulation and ensuring clean air to breath and fresh water to drink, and much more.

I hope you find this testimony valuable as Tennessee considers how to approach some of the emerging challenges facing not only everyday Tennesseans, but also the many small and medium-sized businesses that depend on healthy and dependable energy, environment, and agriculture to survive and thrive.

ALEC’s foundational principles of limited government, free markets, and federalism are crucial to developing effective solid waste policy in Tennessee, solving landfill capacity and strengthening Tennessee’s solid waste and recycling infrastructure for the future, all while avoiding unintended consequences for consumers and businesses.

And that brings me to the purpose of this task force and today’s meeting to address the urgent solid waste concerns facing the State of Tennessee. First, I will explain more about ALEC’s long-standing values on solid waste and recycling policy and our support for a market-oriented regulatory approach driven by incentives and partnership with industry instead of top-down government restrictions, prohibitions, or taxes. I will then dive deeper into ALEC’s model Resolution in Support of Recycling, which acknowledges the importance of sustainable product manufacturing and circularity of materials from both an environmental health and national security lens, while also ensuring that policy solutions are transparent, financially and environmentally sustainable, and grounded in tangible outcomes and measurable results, with the private sector playing a leading role. Finally, I will provide a snapshot of the state regulatory landscape as many jurisdictions work to implement new extended producer responsibility laws for the paper and packaging industries, and some lessons learned that Tennessee should keep in mind.

I should note that recycling and solid waste management are not new to the ALEC community. Since at least 1995, ALEC members have coalesced around common principles to guide state recycling policy, particularly on source reduction. ALEC’s model Resolution on Packaging and the Municipal Solid Waste Stream acknowledges that it was private sector innovation, market incentives, and public-private partnerships that helped achieve effective, integrated solid waste management programs across the country through the use of minimal packaging materials. Inefficient government prohibitions, restrictions, or new taxes on consumer packaging and solid waste only create barriers that limit industry’s ability to meet market demands.

Leading companies are already embracing what is often referred to as the “circular economy,” encouraging the reuse and recycling of materials to extend the life cycle of products, reduce the need for new resource extraction, and keep perfectly good products and resources out of the local landfill. In the technology sector, companies like Apple, Lenovo, LG, and Samsung are responding to strong signals from customers and shareholders who recognize that sustainable practices and repurposing consumer products and packaging materials just makes economic sense.

Fast forward to today. Some states are considering a regulatory tool called extended producer responsibility (EPR) to address recycling and solid waste consumers in the paper and packaging sectors. While some EPR laws have already been implemented in some sectors such as consumer electronics, batteries, and paint, the concept is now being tested in a handful of states in the paper, consumer, and commercial packaging industries.

Now, what exactly is EPR, and why is it considered a possible solution to address solid waste? In short, extended producer responsibility programs, as the name implies, seek to hold manufacturers and producers more responsible for the “end-of-life” of their products and packaging across the supply chain.

By shifting the cost and operational burden of recycling from municipalities and government entities to the product manufacturers themselves, proponents of EPR believe the program will incentivize producers to minimize packaging while adequately protecting expensive consumer goods, increasing recycling rates, promoting sustainable production, and easing pressure on landfills.

However, I will caution that not all packaging EPR laws are created equal. As I mentioned earlier, ALEC members developed a model Resolution in Support of Recycling in December 2024 that contains key principles and best practices for states considering EPR targeting the packaging industry.

First and foremost, packaging EPR programs should be a collaboration between the packaging industry and government—not driven by bans, mandates, or excessive regulation. ALEC recommends that EPR should not be administered by the Department of Environment or another government agency, but should instead be managed by a producer-led Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO).

As states select a PRO to implement EPR, all affected industry stakeholders and producers that EPR laws would regulate must be fairly represented at the table. To date, the majority of states undergoing implementation of EPR have selected one nonprofit organization to serve as their single PRO, the Circular Action Alliance (CAA), which states that they are “the only organization approved to implement U.S. EPR laws for paper and packaging.”

One of the PRO’s primary responsibilities is to collect producer fees from manufacturers and reinvest them in strengthening domestic recycling infrastructure. However, ALEC cautions that under no circumstances should these funds be diverted to general state funds or otherwise reallocated to other projects not related to EPR investments. EPR programs must be transparent and are not meant to be a piggy bank; such a move could erode trust and participation in the program among producers and consumers.

Next, EPR programs should make recycling convenient and simple for consumers to use, complement and optimize existing recycling efforts, and minimize financial burdens on both the manufacturers and consumers. Affordability should be a top priority, and states should be wary of any EPR proposals that would directly cause unreasonable price increases on the essential products and consumer brands that Tennessee families and businesses consume on a daily basis.

Instead of rushing into a full-fledged EPR program right off the bat, states may consider beginning with a needs assessment of the state’s recycling system to understand the ramifications of implementing such a program. And as some packaging EPR programs like Oregon’s begin to go online, state legislators and regulators should pay close attention to how implementation is faring, learn from their successes, and avoid repeating the mistakes of those who came before. Choosing smaller bites at the apple could be a prudent decision for states like Tennessee to begin, unlike California, which had some setbacks that caused implementation to move in fits and starts.

Finally, EPR programs should be grounded in tangible, measurable environmental outcomes, reducing packaging waste and minimizing environmental harm. Aligning state EPR programs in this way will help achieve both economic and ecological resilience while maintaining affordability and accessibility for consumers.

Before I close, I will quickly provide a snapshot of the current state legislative landscape on packaging EPR. As of January 2026, seven states have enacted new packaging EPR legislation: California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington. Oregon’s EPR took effect beginning last July, while requirements in other states like Colorado and Maine will begin to phase in as early as this year. Meanwhile, California’s packaging EPR program will kick off in 2027 but not fully phase in until 2032. Programs in Minnesota and Washington state are still far away from full implementation in 2029 or 2030.

As the task force considers solutions to address the pressing solid waste and recycling needs of your constituents, I encourage you to keep in mind that collaboration and partnership among state government, counties, and the private sector will be critical to getting this right. Tennessee can learn in real-time to see whether EPR programs in states like Oregon are living up to the promise of reducing packaging pollution and landfill excess without burdening businesses or raising prices for consumers. Buy-in from consumers and industry will be critical for the success of any recycling initiative or solid waste management reform. Thank you for the opportunity to speak this morning, and I welcome any questions.

For the majority of turbine subcategories, EPA determined the best system of emission reduction (BSER) for NOx remains advanced combustion controls (e.g., dry low‑NOx burners), while for new large, high‑utilization units (capacity factor above roughly 45%) BSER is combustion controls plus post‑combustion SCR.
For lower‑efficiency and medium‑sized units relying on combustion controls alone, the Rule imposes less stringent Nox limits.
Temporary turbines under this subcategory are subject to BSER of combustion controls and a NOx emission standard of 25 ppm when firing natural gas, reflecting achievable performance while recognizing their intermittent, short‑term role.
However, temporary units can substitute for offline permanent generators.","On Jan. 9, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a final rule to amend the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for Stationary Combustion Turbines and Stationary Gas Turbines, also known as the Rule. The Rule became effective on Jan. 15, and it comes nearly 20 years after the standards were last updated in 2006. According to EPA, the Rule is intended to reflect current control technology performance, reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution, and streamline compliance and permitting for certain units.

Specifically, the Rule includes the following key components:

Tightens and restructures NOx limits for gas turbines and combustion turbines constructed, modified, or reconstructed after Dec. 13, 2024;

Creates a new “temporary turbine” subcategory;

Leaves sulfur dioxide (SO₂) limits largely unchanged; and

Includes a new NSPS subpart—40 CFR part 60, subpart KKKKa—and amends existing turbine NSPS subparts GG and KKKK to address technical and editorial issues.

Notably, in its Economic Impact Analysis, EPA also changed how it evaluated potential public health benefits from the Rule, which was widely reported and discussed in a number of recent media stories.

Expected Emissions, Cost, and Industry Impacts

EPA projects that the NSPS will reduce annual NOx emissions by up to roughly a few hundred tons by 2032 compared with a no‑action baseline, although this is significantly less than reductions forecast under the more stringent 2024 proposal that required selective catalytic reduction (SCR) controls on more units. EPA also emphasizes that the Rule focuses SCR requirements on a narrow slice of large, high‑utilization turbines where control costs per ton are lowest, while allowing combustion‑controls‑only compliance for the majority of new, modified, or reconstructed turbines.

Of note, EPA did not quantify or monetize public health benefits for the Rule. Historically, EPA routinely estimated and monetized public health benefits from reduced air pollution under Clean Air Act rules, often finding that these benefits far exceed compliance costs. EPA previously analyzed the benefits of reducing pollution, including but not limited to improved health outcomes, avoided healthcare costs, fewer missed workdays, and the compliance costs for industry.

While commenters and public‑interest groups argued that omitting monetized health benefits in the Rule marks a departure from that long‑standing practice, and downplays the health value of NOx reductions that contribute to lower ozone and fine particulate levels, EPA stated that the health benefit estimates from changes in NOx (and resulting ozone and particulate matter) are too uncertain to rely on in a formal regulatory context, and that assigning dollar values to lives saved or health improvements from reduced air pollution can create a “false sense of precision.” See EPA’s Economic Impact Analysis for the New Source Performance Standards Review for Stationary Combustion Turbines: Final Rule, PDF p. 41. Ultimately, EPA limited its formal economic analysis to compliance costs and cost savings relative to a no‑action baseline, while qualitatively acknowledging that NOx reductions can improve air quality and health. EPA estimates that the Rule will save power plant owners approximately $87 million over eight years.

Subcategorization and BSER Determinations

The Rule establishes multiple subcategories based on turbine size (MMBtu/hr heat input), utilization (e.g., 12‑month capacity factor), fuel type, and design efficiency, with 38% efficiency on a higher heating value (HHV) basis used to distinguish “higher” from “lower” efficiency units. For the majority of turbine subcategories, EPA determined the best system of emission reduction (BSER) for NOx remains advanced combustion controls (e.g., dry low‑NOx burners), while for new large, high‑utilization units (capacity factor above roughly 45%) BSER is combustion controls plus post‑combustion SCR. The Rule maintains existing SO₂ limits while making limited clarifications and flexibilities in how SO₂ compliance is demonstrated, based on the determination that current SO₂ standards already reflect achievable control.

Amended Nox Standards and Performance Levels

The Rule revises NOx performance standards for selected subcategories to align with what EPA finds achievable using BSER, tightening the limit for some large high‑duty turbines and setting different limits for high‑ and low‑efficiency units. For new large turbines (greater than approximately 850 MMBtu/h) with high utilization and higher efficiency, the Rule includes a stringent NOx limit (on the order of single‑digit ppm when firing natural gas) based on combustion controls plus SCR. For lower‑efficiency and medium‑sized units relying on combustion controls alone, the Rule imposes less stringent Nox limits. The Rule, generally, specifies hourly NOx standards based on the assumption that natural gas firing and operation are above 70% of base load. There are separate provisions for non‑natural gas fuels and part‑load operation, and the Rule provides a table of size‑ and duty‑based ppm limits.

New Temporary Turbine Subcategory

The Rule creates a distinct subcategory for “stationary temporary combustion turbines,” covering small and medium turbines up to 850 MMBtu/h that operate in short‑term, temporary applications (e.g., to provide power during outages or maintenance at permanent units). Temporary turbines under this subcategory are subject to BSER of combustion controls and a NOx emission standard of 25 ppm when firing natural gas, reflecting achievable performance while recognizing their intermittent, short‑term role. The Rule restricts how long a unit can be treated as temporary turbine (typically up to 24 months on‑site) and prohibits serial replacement of one temporary turbine with another solely to extend “temporary” status beyond the intended period. However, temporary units can substitute for offline permanent generators.

Monitoring, Recordkeeping, and Permitting Flexibilities

The Rule substantially reduces monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for temporary turbines, in recognition that full NSPS‑level compliance programs can exceed the duration of temporary deployments and discourage use of such units for short‑term reliability needs. For temporary units, owners and operators must maintain on‑site documentation that each turbine is manufacturer‑certified to meet a 25‑ppm NOx rate and underwent a performance test at least once in the prior five years (for units older than five years since initial sale), rather than conducting frequent stack tests. The Rule also exempts certain combustion turbine sources from title V operating permit requirements and clarifies that some portable turbines regulated as nonroad engines under Title II are outside the scope of this NSPS, thereby reducing permitting burdens for qualifying units.

Looking Ahead

Project developers planning new large, baseload‑type gas turbines should consider whether their turbines must treat combustion controls plus SCR as the default design basis where its units exceed EPA’s high‑utilization threshold and efficiency criteria and should consider whether the turbine must meet the tighter single‑digit‑ppm‑range NOx limits in subpart KKKKa.

Owners of smaller, peaking, or intermediate‑duty turbines will, generally, meet revised limits through advanced combustion controls, but should confirm subcategory assignments (size, capacity factor, efficiency, and fuel use) early in project design to ensure the correct NSPS standard is applied.

Utilities and developers relying on short‑term power solutions should consider the use of the new temporary turbine subcategory to deploy certified low‑NOx temporary units with streamlined monitoring and permitting, while carefully managing deployment duration and documentation to maintain compliance with the temporary status limitations.

That’s according to SEMCOG planner Tyler Klifman, who spoke at a recent engagement session held in Detroit by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.

The SEMCOG plan proposes an $83.4 billion investment in climate work by 2050 to reach net zero emissions in the region, he said.

The council’s executive committee adopted the Southeast Michigan Healthy Climate Plan at its meeting Friday, a SEMCOG spokesperson told Planet Detroit. The plan will be submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Grosse Pointe Park Mayor Sheila Tomkowiak and Detroit City Council President Pro Tem Coleman A. Young II led the task force of about 80 that developed the plan.

In Southeast Michigan, 1.4 million residents living in 500 census tracts across 60 municipalities meet or exceed the criteria for equity and environmental justice burdens, according to his presentation.

Sixty-four-percent of Southeast Michigan’s greenhouse gas emissions are from residential and industrial buildings, the SEMCOG report said.

At the same time, SEMCOG found through engagement with the public that reducing utility costs is a priority, and the actions taken “should prioritize weatherization, no-cost energy audits, expanded rebates/grants, and equitable energy.”

EGLE director: Michigan is committed to climate work

Last year was “rough” in terms of federal support, but Michigan is staying the course on its climate goals, according to the state’s top environmental regulator.

“We’re just going to have to be more innovative in certain areas, and that’s part of why we’re here,” Phil Roos, the director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, said at the Jan. 14 Detroit gathering that focused on the role of justice and equity in Michigan’s climate work.

The 2022 MI Healthy Climate Plan sets a goal of 100% carbon neutrality by 2050.

The impact of climate change in the state is far from abstract, Roos said, giving the examples of basement flooding due to weather, severe heat events, and increased air pollution that exacerbates asthma and other conditions.

“That’s the beauty of this and the sadness of this, that we’re already there and experiencing this right now.”

The state is doing climate work for a reason, said Jordan Power, senior climate action officer in EGLE’s Office of Climate and Energy: “It’s to improve the lives of Michiganders.”

Power detailed Michigan’s 2021 greenhouse gas inventory at the engagement session, held at the IBEW Local 58 Zero Net Energy Center in Corktown.

The largest contributor to Michigan’s greenhouse gas emissions is electric power generation, Power said.

“As we look to decarbonize the grid, we also have opportunities to increase the resiliency of the grid.”

‘Positive and timely connection’

Attendees at the EGLE gathering held discussions at their tables on what they’re doing now as it relates to the MI Healthy Climate Plan; what the ideal future looks like; and what’s needed to get there.

Will Kitchen is new to Detroit, and told Planet Detroit he hopes to support and help move forward the climate goals as an individual and with the water technology nonprofit where he works, AquaAction.

“If there’s a downward trend in interest for solar, that means more smaller, residential installers may have to close or lay people off.”","RICHMOND — Clean-energy advocates are asking Virginia’s utility regulator to reject a proposal from Dominion Energy to change metering rules for new solar panel users.

The proposal by Dominion Energy means people with solar panels installed might end up having to pay the company, even when they generated enough electricity to cover their usage. It would also change how excess energy is measured – from a yearly measurement to one every 30 minutes.

That means it would be virtually impossible for people to bank kilowatts during low-usage months to make up for high-usage months – and lead to higher energy bills for solar users.

Brandon Praileau, the Virginia program director with Solar United Neighbors, said the proposal could make solar a bad investment for individuals and communities.

“They would then have to pay a little bit if they were to produce the same amount and consume the same amount,” said Praileau. “The new rate that Dominion is proposing would leave them with some financial balance to pay to Dominion towards their energy bill.”

Dominion has framed the issue as a matter of fairness to those who are not solar users – and reflects the real-time realities of energy usage that face the grid.

According to Environment Virginia, the Commonwealth is a leader in renewable energy generation. Solar arrays in Virginia generated enough electricity to power 750,000 homes in 2024.

Praileau added that if Dominion’s proposal is approved, it could force many solar installers, often local businesses, to cut jobs.

“This proposal would literally have an outsized impact on people’s abilities to feed their families,” said Praileau. “If there’s a downward trend in interest for solar, that means more smaller, residential installers may have to close or lay people off.”",https://images.wydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AdobeStock_489679479-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-26 21:58:45.447528

Among the most significant changes in the new updated Taxonomy is the addition of categories focused on climate transition, expanding the Taxonomy from its initial focus on only green categories.
In the updated Taxonomy, the HKMA said: “The inclusion of transition elements in the Taxonomy is critical for driving the decarbonisation of the real economy.
It enables the mobilisation and scaling up of transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing, to shift systematically towards more sustainable practices.
Another key change in the Taxonomy is the introduction of a Climate Change Adaptation category.","The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Hong Kong’s central banking institution, announced the release of the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance Phase 2A, expanding its classification system for identifying environmentally sustainable economic activities to include transition activities, climate adaptation, and a significantly broader range of sectors and economic activities.

The release of the new update follows the launch by the HKMA in May 2024 of its initial Taxonomy, aimed at providing a framework to allow investors to identify and invest in activities that generate a positive impact on the environment, and to avoid those with a negative impact, as well as to align investments with climate goals, and reduce the risk of investing in assets that are not aligned with a low-carbon future.

At the time, the HKMA said that it aimed to use a phased approach to establishing the Taxonomy, adding more sectors and categories over time, and the central bank subsequently launched a consultation on its proposed “Phase 2A” in September 2025.

Among the most significant changes in the new updated Taxonomy is the addition of categories focused on climate transition, expanding the Taxonomy from its initial focus on only green categories. With the update, the Hong Kong Taxonomy now categorizes climate mitigation activities as Green, indicating that they either already operate at net zero emissions or are aligned with a 1.5°C pathway; Transition, indicating that they are carbon-intensive activities that are on a time-bound decarbonization pathway to align with a 1.5°C trajectory that will ultimately reach net zero in 2050, or; Exclusion, indicating that they are not currently eligible under the Taxonomy, as they are either not aligned with Green or Transition criteria, are incompatible with a 1.5°C future, or are of low climate materiality, with minimal relevance to climate objectives.

In the updated Taxonomy, the HKMA said:

“The inclusion of transition elements in the Taxonomy is critical for driving the decarbonisation of the real economy. It enables the mobilisation and scaling up of transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing, to shift systematically towards more sustainable practices. By defining credible pathways for these sectors to align with net zero goals, the Taxonomy strives to minimise economic disruption in carbon-intensive industries and promote an orderly transition, with a view to balancing environmental imperatives with economic growth.”

The updated Taxonomy introduces two classifications under the Transition category, including “Transition Activity,” which refers to economic activities that are not yet aligned with a 1.5°C pathway but are progressing towards alignment, or enable significant short-term emissions reductions, and “Transition Measure,” referring to specific activity components that could partially improve the emission performance of the activity, such as the purchase of low-carbon energy for aluminum production.

Notably, the criteria utilized for the updated Taxonomy’s transition category include a requirement for the activity to be “time-bound,” with eligibility limited to a prescribed sunset date, which varies by sector and activity based on factors such as technological readiness, environmental impact, and regulatory policies, among others.

Another key change in the Taxonomy is the introduction of a Climate Change Adaptation category. The new category initially includes “adapting measures,” or subcomponents of activities rather than complete standalone activities, such as technologies, processes, materials, practices, or services that positively contribute to the resilience and adaptation of broader activities. The category also launches with a “whitelist” approach, with a curated list of measures that are automatically deemed eligible without the need to meet specific criteria. The HKMA said that in the future, “as global and local understanding of adaptation improve and Hong Kong-specific criteria and thresholds are more robustly established, other more sophisticated assessment approaches… may be explored.”

The HKMA said that development of the next phase of the Taxonomy is already underway, with additional activities such as nuclear and natural gas-fired power generation, hydrogen for electricity generation, sustainable aviation fuel, among others being considered for future development, as well as sectors such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage and waste and wastewater treatment, alongside further work on adaptation and the exploration of the role of “Do No Significant Harm.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hong-Kong-MA.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 19:58:29.798113

Cement, the main building block of concrete, is responsible for about 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions.

Limestone calcined clay cement, algae-based bio-cement, and carbon-negative cement from seawater are all innovative solutions that could help reduce emissions.

Sustainable concrete provides economic benefits like lower maintenance and life-cycle costs, as well as higher durability. The global green concrete market is projected to grow from $39 billion in 2024 to $102 billion by 2032.

The most-used substance on Earth after water is concrete. In fact, the world produced over four billion metric tonnes of cement, the binder in concrete, in 2023 alone. Concrete fuels industrial growth as it provides the physical foundation of schools, hospitals, and other critical buildings, as well as transportation infrastructure.

Concrete is formed by mixing aggregates (sand and gravel) with water and cement to bind the materials together. Portland cements are the most commonly used in the United States and are very energy-intensive. Both calcination itself (the chemical process triggered by heating limestone, which is part of the cement-making process) and the burning of fossil fuels to heat cement kilns emit carbon dioxide. Producing one kilogram of cement results in one kilogram of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere. If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. In total, cement is responsible for most of the carbon dioxide emissions associated with concrete and about 8% of carbon emissions globally. Mixing concrete releases additional greenhouse gases, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which can exacerbate local air pollution.

In 2019, the carbon intensity of U.S. cement production was around 20% higher than in the rest of the world, indicating a significant opportunity for domestic innovation in this space. One way to produce lower-carbon cement is to replace clinker, the main ingredient in cement, with supplementary cementitious materials. These materials are usually industrial byproducts like fly ash, slag cement, or silica fume. The American Cement Association plans to decrease its clinker-to-cement ratio using such alternatives, from its current average of 0.88 to 0.75 by 2050. The Global Cement and Concrete Association expects the global ratio will decrease from 0.76 to 0.52 by 2050.

Some companies and universities are getting ever more creative in trying to develop low-emission cement. For example, limestone calcined clay cement is made from blended limestone and calcined clay. Other efforts are focused on bio-cement, which can be made from algae-grown limestone, while Northwestern University created a carbon-negative cement from seawater, electricity, and carbon dioxide. As for concrete, low-carbon alternatives include aerated concrete (or aircrete) made from air bubble chemical reactions, green concrete from discarded materials, and hempcrete from biocomposite materials.

One barrier to innovation is the need to update codes and standards related to concrete. According to Abigail Regitsky of Blue Horizons Foundation, current concrete standards are largely prescriptive. “You can think of this like a recipe. You are told exactly how much water, how much cement, how much aggregate, and other things to mix into your concrete. That is really limiting to innovation of these new materials. And so there are efforts to change this from a prescriptive specification to performance specifications.” Performance-based standards, which would directly consider qualities like compressive strength and chloride permeability, would create a safe and uniform system for low-carbon concrete to be produced at scale.

Using low-emission green concrete offers long-term economic benefits as durability increases, energy efficiency improves, and maintenance costs decrease. Qatar University researchers found that buildings made with a concrete mix consisting of treated wastewater, recycled concrete aggregates, and 20% fly ash saw maintenance costs decrease by 60% and life-cycle costs by 19% because the final material is stronger and less vulnerable to corrosion. The global green concrete market was valued at $39 billion in 2024, and its revenue is expected to reach nearly $102 billion by 2032. Switching to low-emission concrete can increase profits for builders by 3% to 21%.

Technology companies are also making investments. Amazon Web Services uses low-carbon concrete from American Rock Products in its new U.S. data centers, while Meta has a similar data center partnership with CarbonBuilt. Central Concrete has partnered with CarbonCure to recycle carbon dioxide waste, which CarbonCure then injects into fresh concrete.

In addition to material innovation, increasing energy efficiency is key to driving down emissions. Kiln operations can implement waste heat recovery systems, which capture and reuse waste heat from the kiln exhaust. Fuel switching is another promising strategy, though it can be challenging because cement ingredients are heated to over 2,500°F. Biomass, industrial waste, and hydrogen have potential as alternative fuel sources, and carbon capture and utilization technologies can be used to safely dispose of remaining carbon emissions.

Congress has indicated interest in low-emission cement and concrete. Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) introduced the Concrete and Asphalt Innovation Act (S.1067) in March 2025 to accelerate the use of low-emission concrete and asphalt. As Sen. Tillis explained, “the Concrete and Asphalt Innovation Act is a smart, bipartisan investment in America’s industrial future, and it will strengthen domestic manufacturing, create jobs, and reduce emissions.” Meanwhile, the House passed the Innovative Mitigation Partnerships for Asphalt and Concrete Technologies (IMPACT) Act (H.R.1534), which was reintroduced by Reps. Max Miller (R-Ohio) and Valerie Foushee (D-N.C.). This legislation would establish a temporary low-emission cement, concrete, and asphalt program at the U.S. Department of Energy. According to Rep. Foushee, “We have a critical opportunity to reinvigorate our nation’s transportation infrastructure while making significant strides to reduce global emissions.” Both pieces of legislation underscore that investing in low-emission cement will keep the United States globally competitive and encourage economic growth.

With the global demand for concrete expected to increase 48% by 2050, the industry is ripe for investment to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions do not grow with it. Some companies are already finding ways to optimize concrete formulas and increase concrete recycling or material recovery. Sustainable concrete and cement production is a practical switch that can save money by building longer-lasting structures.",,N,,2026-01-26 16:59:12.678579

This interdependence is crucial: though 80% of EV charging happens at home, EVs require accessible public charging infrastructure to make long-distance travel feasible for drivers, while charging stations depend on growing EV adoption to sustain their operations. The Southeast U.S. has emerged as a critical region in this ecosystem, leading the nation in EV manufacturing and posting strong sales growth, making the buildout of robust regional charging networks especially vital to sustaining momentum.

Pulling the Plug

This critical relationship between the EV and charging infrastructure markets is what inspired the 117th Congress to fund the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program in 2022 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The NEVI program’s goal was to jump-start a reliable, accessible cross-country interstate charging network along America’s highways.

Beginning in 2022, NEVI funds were made available to state Departments of Transportation (DOTs), including $679 million to the states SACE works in: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. State DOTs engaged stakeholders to create state-specific EV infrastructure plans, had the plans approved by the federal government, and, by the end of 2024, began installing the NEVI network at scale.

While the NEVI program was advancing, the EV and charging infrastructure markets were growing rapidly. From 2020 to 2024, EV sales averaged 47% annual growth, while the number of public EV charging stations doubled, reaching 200,000. Which is why it is no surprise that, as the Trump Administration took the reins and ramped up its efforts to slow the country’s transition to electric transportation, it unlawfully froze funding for the NEVI program, a literal attempt to pull the plug on EVs.

Not so Fast, Mr. President

Like many of the Trump Administration’s efforts to claw back clean energy funding that Congress had appropriated and that only Congress has the legal authority to reconsider, the freezing of NEVI funding was ripe for a court challenge. The lawsuit was brought by attorneys general of nearly two dozen states, including North Carolina, and a handful of nonprofit groups representing states without participating attorneys general, including SACE. We were granted standing to represent our members in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee because they reside in those states, drive or want to drive an EV in our region and beyond, and were willing to testify about the negative impacts the funding freeze had on them.

Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Tana Lin of the Western District of Washington entered final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, requiring the federal government to honor its commitment and fully fund the NEVI program. The Court’s order clears the way for states to implement the NEVI plans they have worked for years to develop, and permanently bars the federal government from unlawfully withdrawing states’ funds or interfering with states’ implementation.

The Court’s ruling is a victory for the plaintiffs, EV drivers, and for the EV, battery, and charging infrastructure companies that have invested over $193 billion in domestic manufacturing, and the over 211,000 American workers that are filling the jobs these investments are creating, including in the Southeast—a critical manufacturing hub for electric vehicles.

Dr. Stephen A. Smith, Executive Director of Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said, “This is a great victory for clean energy while also overcoming an unnecessary roadblock to critical funding on the road to bringing the United States and our Southeast region into the 21st century. Electric vehicles, both large and small, are more efficient, have lower maintenance and fuel costs, and perform better than fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Electric mobility, with the significant electric vehicle manufacturing and growing battery supply chain infrastructure in the Southeast, brings good-paying jobs and makes our region and our country competitive as the world moves to an electric future. We are proud to be a part of the coalition that defeated this administration’s unlawful harassment of legally appropriated funds to grow the charging infrastructure necessary to build consumers’ confidence in driving electric.”

SACE Members Speak Up to Unlock NEVI Funds for Southeast States

As a region manufacturing EVs for the nation, the Southeast needs a reliable charging network that matches its production capacity. This is especially important now when many Southeastern families face affordability challenges. Access to reliable charging infrastructure removes a key barrier to EV ownership, and EVs offer a clear affordability solution—cheaper to operate and maintain than gas cars.

While 17 states initiated the legal challenge in April, no Southern states joined at the outset. Because only states that were formal parties to the lawsuit were guaranteed to benefit from the court’s ruling, this created a real risk that the Southeast would be left out if the court declined to grant nationwide relief. That is where SACE came in.

SACE is a member organization with over 35,000 members across the Southeast. We reached out to EV-driving and would-be EV-driving members in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee who were harmed by the NEVI program’s cancellation. Members from each state provided SACE’s legal partner, the Southern Environmental Law Center, with witness testimony describing how the lack of reliable, accessible fast charging along the region’s highways negatively impacts their ability to safely and securely own and operate an EV and reap the affordable, clean transportation benefits they sought.

Because of member testimony, SACE was granted standing in the lawsuit and served as a proxy for the states whose attorneys general chose not to participate, thereby allowing Southeastern states access to the region’s $679 million of NEVI funds. SACE and our members’ participation helped hold the Trump Administration accountable for its unlawful actions.

The successful outcome of this lawsuit ensures that the national EV fast-charging network will run through, not around, the Southeast. This is a win for the future—supporting the region’s job-creating EV supply chain manufacturers and helping remove a critical barrier to EV adoption by expanding drivers’ access to clean and affordable electric transportation through an accessible and reliable charging network.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-26 18:00:33.196331

Ald. Will White, at-large, recently announced that this year he’d be committing up to $10,000 in city funds toward the Aurora Solar and EV Charging Rebate Program. Qualifying residents, businesses and nonprofits can get up to $1,000 for installing solar panels or up to $500 for installing electric vehicle chargers.

“If we all work together towards sustainable living, I think Aurora can really be a frontrunner in the state of Illinois when it comes to energy conservation and energy efficiency,” White told The Beacon-News.

He noted that Aurora already has several high-level initiatives related to sustainability, such as its 2019 Sustainability Plan, the newly-created sustainability division and the planned CEJA Workforce Development Hub. With that in mind, he started to consider how residents could get involved.

So, his Aurora Solar and EV Charging Rebate Program will give residents the opportunity to reduce their own impact on global warming and other negative environmental effects, White said.

Because it is a rebate program, any work should already be complete before an application is made, according to White. To qualify, the work needs to have been done last year or this year, so between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2026, by an electrician or contractor who is licensed by the city and provides evidence of paying prevailing wage, according to the application.

Those who apply must also be in good standing with the city and present a proof of purchase. Plus, they must have obtained all necessary permits, passed required inspections and tried to obtain a quote from a business located within Aurora.

Applications can be found on White’s alderman webpage: yourvoice.aurora.il.us/aldermanatlarge2

“My goal is to have as many people apply now, so towards the end of the year I can explore what this rebate program looks like next year,” he said.

In recent years and particularly under Mayor John Laesch, Aurora has made sustainability a key goal. The city earned a statewide award last year for its commitment to making its fleet of vehicles more sustainable by adding electric and hybrid vehicles, created the first-ever director of sustainability role, started looking into energy stretch code adoption and placed a temporary moratorium on data centers, partially citing environmental reasons.

City staff members are also developing loan programs to support sustainable upgrades for commercial and residential properties. One such program, the Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy financing program, commonly called C-PACE, is set to go before the Aurora City Council for final approval Tuesday evening.

Sustainability, particularly through green building, was a large part of Laesch’s campaign platform last year. And when he was previously an alderman at-large, Laesch had a similar rebate program to the one White recently launched.

After Laesch was sworn in as mayor and White was appointed to take his place, White said he heard from people who were interested in seeing Laesch’s program continue, so he made some changes and launched it again.

Aldermen are allocated funds each year from the city’s tax on the local Hollywood Casino to spend on those they represent, and White is committing half of his yearly amount to this program.

As for the rest of the funds, White said he has other initiatives he is exploring. One high on his priority list is permanent supportive housing for the city’s homeless population, he said, and another is centered around job opportunities for those who graduate from the planned CEJA Workforce Development Hub.

By Rachael Rossmeissl-Stone, Senior Project Manager, Partner Engineering & Science, Inc.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has finalized stronger requirements about how lead dust hazards are identified and addressed in homes and child-occupied facilities built before 1978. These changes are part of the agency’s effort to reduce lead exposure, especially for young children who are most at risk from even small amounts of lead. The changes are part of EPA’s lead hazard standards and clearance levels under the Toxic Substances Control Act.

The rule became effective in 2025, and full compliance with key elements is required starting January 12, 2026.

Basics of the New Requirements

Under the updated standards, any detectable level of lead in dust on surfaces like floors and windowsills counts as a lead hazard for the purposes of a risk assessment if it is reported by an accredited laboratory. Known as Dust-Lead Reportable Level (DLRL), this is a significant change from the past when EPA used specific numerical thresholds to determine if lead dust qualified as a hazard.

In addition, after lead cleanup or abatement work, the amount of lead that can remain before EPA considers the work complete has been lowered. For example, the allowable lead dust on floors is now 5 micrograms per square foot, with stricter amounts also set for window sills and window troughs. These post-abatement levels are now referred to as Dust-Lead Action Level (DLAL).

Who and What is Covered

These rules apply to target housing and child-occupied facilities built before 1978. Target housing generally includes residential buildings built before lead-based paint was banned, with some exceptions, and places where young children are regularly present. The standards do not themselves require evaluations or abatement, but they do set the thresholds that define when a hazard exists and when cleanup has been satisfactorily achieved.

For commercial real estate buyers, owners, lenders, and property managers, this means that when you are conducting due diligence, managing leasing and occupancy, or planning renovation or maintenance in older buildings, lead dust assessments must take into account the new, stricter levels. If a risk assessment or clearance test shows any detectable lead dust above the laboratory’s reporting limit, professionals will consider that a lead hazard for disclosure. Once the hazard has been identified, the hazard must be addressed, even if the loan or transaction that triggered the lead assessment falls through.

Practical Implications for Commercial Real Estate

These changes matter in several common CRE scenarios:

When planning renovations that disturb painted surfaces in pre-1978 residential/child-occupied properties, certified lead professionals are required by EPA’s other lead rules to use lead-safe work practices and to conduct appropriate testing before and after work. The new action levels mean post-work cleanup must be more thorough to meet the updated criteria.

Lenders should be aware that lead hazard reports based on the new limits could influence appraisals, underwriting, and risk profiles for older properties.

Managers of childcare facilities or residential spaces need to ensure compliance and protect occupants by evaluating existing lead hazards under the new reporting framework.

Complying with the New Standards

A qualified lead assessment professional can provide accurate testing, interpretation, and documentation of the new EPA standards.

Solid-state batteries are standing at the critical point of this transformation.","As global competition in the electric vehicle (EV) industry enters deeper waters, Toyota is quietly betting on a core technology that could reshape the industry: solid-state batteries.

According to The Cool Down website, Toyota’s top management recently sent a clear signal: its solid-state battery research has entered a stage of substantial progress, and future models are expected to achieve generational improvements in range, charging efficiency, and safety. If successfully implemented, this technology could redefine the competitive boundary between electric and fuel-powered vehicles.

Technological leap: the reality of 10-minute charging and 700-mile range

According to Yahoo Finance, citing Toyota, EVs equipped with solid-state batteries could theoretically:

Reach a range of about 745 miles (~1,200 km)

Reduce charging time to about 10 minutes

Achieve significantly higher energy density than current lithium-ion batteries

Substantially lower fire risk

If these figures materialize, they would directly address the three core pain points of today’s EVs: range anxiety, charging time, and usage safety.

Compared with current mainstream liquid lithium-ion batteries, solid-state batteries use a solid electrolyte, which is not only more heat-resistant and stable but also better suited for high-power fast charging. This is the key reason traditional automakers like Toyota, BMW, and Honda have increased investment in this technology in recent years.

Consumer reality: EVs still haven’t crossed the ‘psychological barrier’

Despite optimistic technological prospects, the market still faces significant hurdles.

A joint survey by The Washington Post and the University of Maryland, involving 1,404 respondents, found:

74% believe fuel vehicles are more reliable for long-distance travel

Only 10% think pure EVs are “convenient enough” for refueling

This highlights a key issue: technological progress in EVs has not fully translated into consumer trust. Range anxiety, charging queues, and inconsistent charging standards remain major obstacles to widespread adoption. This also explains why Toyota has maintained a cautious approach to “full electrification” in recent years, rather than aggressively transforming like some other automakers.

Toyota’s realistic approach: technology maturity before market hype

At an October 2024 press event, Toyota President Koji Sato told the Financial Times: “The most important thing right now is to first truly bring solid-state batteries to market before considering scaling up.”

This statement reflects Toyota’s characteristic “engineer mindset”—preferring to move slowly rather than take risks. Unlike some new automakers who adopt a “launch first, improve later” strategy, Toyota emphasizes reliability, yield, and cost control. This means solid-state batteries will not rapidly proliferate in the short term, but once mass-produced, their stability could be higher.

Integration with Tesla’s system: strategic compromise in practice

At the infrastructure level, Toyota has begun aligning with industry realities.

In October 2024, Toyota announced it would adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) and integrate into Tesla’s network of roughly 12,000 Supercharger stations.

This move was regarded by Reuters and Bloomberg as an industry turning point—Tesla is effectively becoming the de facto standard-setter for North American EV charging.

The decision not only alleviates charging anxiety for Toyota users but also demonstrates traditional automakers’ heavy reliance on the broader “ecosystem” in their EV transition.

Environmental and policy perspective: solid-state batteries could be a key emission-reduction variable

Data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows that even when accounting for battery manufacturing, EVs’ lifetime carbon emissions remain significantly lower than those of fuel vehicles.

As battery recycling technology matures and the recycling rates of critical metals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel rise, the environmental advantages of solid-state batteries will expand further.

Multiple research institutions note that solid-state batteries:

Have longer lifespans

Use resources more efficiently

Pose lower fire risks

Help reduce the overall carbon footprint of EVs

If this technology scales between 2027 and 2030, the global auto industry’s pace of emissions reduction could accelerate markedly.

If the past decade was a “proof-of-concept” period for EVs, the next five years could mark a true structural replacement phase.

Retail competition is also associated with improvements in service quality and fosters innovation in product development and customer energy-management services.","For Hoosiers, the only thing as electrifying as Indiana University football is the literal need to electrify new industry. Powering data centers and manufacturers quickly, reliably, and cost-effectively fuels Indiana’s economic development engine. Furthermore, insulating existing customers from electric costs caused by new customers is key for new industries to secure a social license to operate.

To meet modern needs, Indiana must modernize its electric policies. Hoosiers remain wedded to an outdated electric supply model where the state grants a utility an exclusive franchise over the vertical supply chain to serve captive customers. Indiana adopted this arrangement in 1913 based on assumptions that are plainly outdated today. In exchange for monopoly rights, a utility would be subject to strict cost-of-service regulation by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC).

The role of the IURC in monopoly utility oversight is to substitute for competition. Such regulation is necessary because monopolies have a motive to overcharge customers, and the cost-of-service model creates a perverse incentive for the utility to overcapitalize its assets—upon which it earns a regulated rate of return—while socializing risk on captive ratepayers. This regulatory model does not work well for power generation and retail services because they are not natural monopolies. As witnessed in other states, competitive markets tend to outperform monopoly utilities. Transmission and distribution wires have some natural monopoly characteristics; thus, a more hands-on role for cost-of-service regulation is prudent to induce economic discipline.

Wisely, Indiana allows its utilities to participate in either the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) or the PJM Interconnection. Both MISO and PJM are independent system operators (ISOs) or regional transmission organizations (RTOs) that operate wholesale electricity markets and plan regional transmission. ISOs/RTOs induce cost savings and enhance reliability by playing the role of air traffic controller for regional grids.

The Merits of Markets

There are three main paradigms for wholesale and retail electric service. The most effective is the restructured model, wherein competitive markets prevail at both wholesale and retail levels. In other words, customers can choose a competitive retail supplier to buy power on their behalf on an ISO/RTO wholesale market consisting of competitively owned power plants. Most states, including Indiana, fall under the hybrid paradigm. This comprises a competitive wholesale market run by an ISO/RTO but with power generation and retail services remaining primarily under monopoly utility control. A dwindling number of states retain monopolies and do not participate in ISOs/RTOs.

The economic case for restructuring is convincing. Evidence clearly shows that competitively owned power plants operate more cost-effectively and induce innovation, including major efficiency gains in the fossil and nuclear fleets. Yet the core of the restructuring thesis—improving incentives for investment in new power plants—is chronically understudied. In 2025, an Indiana University scholar delineated the first causal evidence that competitive reforms affect investment patterns, suggesting economic efficiency gains. This is consistent with evidence from the practitioner domain. For example, competitive electricity markets are responsible for low-cost, high efficiency natural gas plants replacing higher-cost legacy power plants in PJM during the 2010s.

Importantly, these market advantages occurred in an era of fairly straightforward investment decisions between conventional power plants. States adopted restructuring in the 1990s largely because monopoly utilities made errors in technology choice and overinvested based on exaggerated demand forecasts. The resulting costs were not internalized by utilities; rather, they were socialized among captive customers.

Today’s technology landscape involves far more complex capital-investment decisions. Unconventional supply resources like wind, solar, and storage have reached economic parity, while demand-side resources remain largely untapped. This causes a breakdown in integrated resource planning (IRP) within monopoly states. State regulators like the IURC face a growing information deficit regarding which centrally planned utility investments constitute least-cost service. The return of highly uncertain levels of demand growth compounds this, creating a major risk that utilities will not identify the correct level of investment needed.

Under the monopoly model, such risks are borne by captive ratepayers. Under the market model, those risks are borne by competitive suppliers with a record of superior risk management. Although monopoly utilities strongly lobby to retain exclusive control over generation, a single utility often lacks the balance sheet to finance new investment. Conversely, independent producers are equipped to tap a robust private capital market for more expeditious, cost-effective, and lower-risk generation investments.

Markets are also better at insulating existing customers from the costs of servicing new industries, as they exclusively assign supply costs and risks to the competitive supplier and counterparty (e.g., data center). Traditional monopoly service socializes costs and risks across their customer rate base, prompting blowback of monopoly service for new loads from existing customer groups. Unsurprisingly, native customers and growing industries have attempted to serve new customers under a market model. Virginia, home of Data Center Alley, has entertained this strategy to avoid new, risky monopoly generation to cover data-center load growth.

Retail competition is essential for customers to take full advantage of generation competition. It has also produced an array of retail options that lets consumers choose supply arrangements best suited to their preferences regarding price, budget (e.g., payment structure), risk tolerance (e.g., fixed versus variable rates), and fuel or environmental factors. Retail competition is also associated with improvements in service quality and fosters innovation in product development and customer energy-management services. It requires well-informed consumers as well as protections from deceptive advertising or marketing practices.

With this in mind, R Street issued a state retail electric scorecard in 2025, with Indiana receiving a “D.” The state could improve its score by passing legislation that provides opportunities for customers to engage third parties for services currently available only through the utility. Further improvement is possible if the IURC ensures that utilities give consumers greater choice, avoiding monopoly activity beyond what is necessary to provide basic service.

Indiana’s neighbors all scored higher on R Street’s scorecard, with Illinois and Ohio each earning a “B+,” Kentucky a “D+,” and Michigan a “C.” A review of these and other hybrid states in MISO and PJM reveals momentum toward expanding retail competition:

Illinois restructured and experienced economic benefits. The Illinois Manufacturers’ Association has been a long-time proponent of retail choice. They and other consumer groups are largely concerned with the state’s tendency to interfere with markets.

Ohio also experienced economic benefits after restructuring. The state has had problems with ring-fencing distribution monopoly utilities, who engage in self-dealing with competitive affiliates in a manner that undermines the competitive generation and retail marketplace. Utilities now seek legislation to re-regulate power generation, which customer groups like the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association strongly oppose.

Michigan caps its retail choice to 10 percent of the market. The choice program is fully subscribed, and thousands of customers remain in the queue—a strong demonstration of market demand for choice. Michigan’s large energy users group, the Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity, has consistently pushed for expanded market competition through retail choice.

Kentucky utilities mostly reside in MISO or PJM and generally lack retail choice. However, large power users in the western part of the Commonwealth were given special disposition to procure power directly from the market.

Other MISO states (and some PJM states) fall under the hybrid model. Customer groups including the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group, Louisiana Energy Users Group, West Virginia Energy Users Group, Iowa Economic Alliance, Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers, and Virginia Customers for Energy Choice have been pushing for retail competition in their states for years

The clock is ticking in Indiana, which has seen the seventh-fastest increase in electric rates in the country from 2008 to 2023. Indiana’s energy competitiveness is falling behind nationally and regionally. In 2023, a peer-reviewed study found that restructuring decreased average electricity prices across the Midwest.

Although economic considerations take center stage, the environmental and governance advantages of competitive power markets are also worth noting. Markets lower emissions by enabling capital stock turnover, inducing operating efficiencies, integrating unconventional clean energy, spurring innovation, and letting environmentally inclined customers voluntarily pay a premium for cleaner supply options. Competitive markets are also associated with lower environmental compliance costs, while monopoly utilities have historically lobbied for higher-cost environmental compliance policies in order to justify expansion of their regulated rate base.

It is important to appreciate that the instrumental business interest of a cost-of-service monopoly is to secure favorable regulatory and political treatment. This perverse incentive structure has induced dozens of ethics scandals involving utilities, regulators, and legislators, including one in Indiana that resulted in the firing of the IURC chairman and three Duke Energy Indiana officials. Flipping this incentive is key to avoiding cronyism and corruption. Indeed, “accountability through competition” was part of the original restructuring thesis. The last two decades have provided evidence that competition is “the antidote for bad behavior.”

Transmission Scrutiny

Indiana is also overdue for transmission reform. Transmission expansion lags economic needs driven by load growth and generation changes, thereby increasing grid congestion costs. Meanwhile, transmission expansion costs are overly high. Transmission is the fastest-growing segment of industry capital costs over the last two decades. In the eyes of consumers and independent economists, the fault lies with a deeply flawed cost-of-service regulatory architecture.

Ideally, transmission investment policy would leverage economies of scale, advanced technologies, cost-efficient planning techniques, and competition. However, utilities centrally plan over 90 percent of new and replaced transmission expansion without economic criteria, competition, or effective cost-of-service oversight.

This results in:

Overbuilt inefficient, local transmission

Underbuilt efficient, regional and interregional transmission

Underutilization of competitive forces

Underuse of innovative technologies

Utilities are incentivized to overcapitalize their transmission rate base and stunt interstate transmission development in order to avoid lower-cost generation imports that could erode the utility’s justification for its generation rate base. A 2024 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research quantified this perverse incentive in the MISO footprint.

Unlike generation and retail supply, which reside squarely within state authority, transmission regulation is a mixture of state and federal responsibility. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has authority over the interstate transmission planning and cost allocation rules implemented by MISO and PJM. The IURC and similar organizations in other states play a prominent role in influencing MISO and PJM practices, and primary siting authority resides with states as well.

The best practice in independent transmission planning for regional and interregional transmission is to use robust cost-benefit analysis to identify needs before putting those needs out for competitive bid. Both MISO and PJM are updating their cost-benefit analysis approach to comply with a recent FERC rulemaking. The IURC could advocate for higher-quality analysis (especially transmission cost-savings accounting), as well as improved transparency and the use of independent expertise. All of this was mentioned in a 2025 FERC complaint on MISO’s current process.

Indiana undercut transmission competition in 2023 by passing a law giving incumbent utilities a right of first refusal (ROFR) to build new lines before those projects open to competitive bidding. Passed in response to a utility lobbying effort (over objections from consumers and the Indiana chapter of Americans for Prosperity), this law will prove costly. An R Street analysis estimated the added cost of Indiana’s ROFR at $129 million for just one set of MISO transmission projects, known as Tranche 1. The ROFR has faced a series of legal challenges, with a pending request for a permanent injunction. The case lies before the same judge who granted a preliminary injunction a year ago, making it likely that the courts will toss the ROFR law.

Not only is new transmission inefficiently developed, upgrades to the existing transmission system are grossly underused. Advanced transmission technologies (ATTs) are often highly cost-effective for expanding capacity on the existing system and reducing congestion costs. This, in turn, can accelerate new power plant development by alleviating the grid constraints that create generator interconnection queue backlogs. For example, one ATT pilot in MISO netted over $100 million in savings in 2024, while another in PJM saved $1 billion in annual production costs while unlocking six gigawatts of new generation interconnection. Unlike competitive markets, in which companies adopt cost-saving technologies voluntarily, the cost-of-service model’s perverse incentive means regulation must compel utilities to adopt ATTs consistent with “good utility practice.”

Given the interstate nature of most transmission, ATTs are best adopted by state leadership and coordinated within a regional context. Although FERC issued a rule requiring utilities to adopt one type of ATT, the catalyst of ATT adoption is more likely a bottom-up regional approach. Engagement with other MISO and PJM states by the IURC and the governor’s office is key to driving more independent assessments and connecting them with state utility prudence mechanisms.

Passed in 2025, Indiana’s SB 422 requires utilities to evaluate ATTs in their IRPs, makes ATTs eligible for cost recovery, and compels the IURC to issue a study on ATT use by 2026. This is a productive step, but insufficient by itself. IRPs alone do not directly translate into investment decisions in Indiana, and there is no prudence mechanism forcing utilities to adopt ATTs. This is largely because the IURC has little functional oversight over transmission.

The IURC has no process for scrutinizing transmission projects and lacks the institutional capacity to engage adequately with MISO and PJM on transmission or oversee local transmission within state jurisdiction. Leaders must work with their state counterparts to coordinate with FERC in closing the informational and regulatory gap over local transmission projects identified in 2022 as a core transmission cost management problem, triggering a flood of consumer complaints.

The IURC is not alone in lacking state capacity; in fact, only one of 15 MISO state utility regulators has a transmission expert on staff. Whether overseeing local transmission or engaging MISO and PJM on their regional transmission processes, the IURC needs proper staff, processes, and authority to ensure cost-effective transmission.

The Options Ahead

Indiana must avoid distractions in order to move forward. Last year, the IURC approved a proposal by the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) to create a separate entity (“GenCo”) to serve data centers, which the utility claims will isolate the cost of new growth. However, GenCo functionally creates an inferior monopoly within a monopoly, forcing data centers to deal with a new monopoly without the cost-of-service safeguards applicable to NIPSCO. GenCo will have reduced IURC oversight over new utility generation, and the utilities’ finances will be more opaque.

The notion of any “ring-fencing” benefits of GenCo to protect existing customers is an accounting illusion. GenCo and NIPSCO still share the same parent company. Any risk GenCo incurs (e.g., costs for a failed data center deal) still falls on the balance sheet of the parent company, with credit rating and borrowing cost increases passed on to NIPSCO’s other customers. True ring-fencing would entail removing the supply risk off the utility’s books entirely by letting new business choose a competitive supplier. In other words, monopoly utility reorganization is not a substitute for retail competition.

Nationwide, the main trend in monopoly states like Indiana is to enable retail choice for business customers. Although full restructuring of generation and retail competition for all customers would be best, political economy factors sometimes favor only business customers securing competitive reforms. In fact, Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers has long called for competition. Now is the time to get it over the finish line—and two bills introduced into the Indiana assembly this January would do just that.

SB 272 would let businesses over 1 megawatt (MW) choose their electric supplier while utilities continue their role in power delivery. Businesses under 1 MW could aggregate their demand to qualify. The bill contains provisions for utility transparency and to protect against cost-shifting between choice-eligible and ineligible customers, which would elevate Indiana from laggard to on par with most states.

HB 1276 would propel Indiana to leadership status by taking competition even further, letting all customer classes choose their supplier in a phased manner: industrial customers in 2028 and residential and commercial customers in 2029. It would functionally separate competitive supply from monopoly delivery services and require utilities to divest their generation assets. This is crucially important for restructuring correctly—referred to as “quarantining the monopoly” by economists—which Ohio paid the price for not doing.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Powerlines-Energy-Sunset-Power.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 16:59:25.065919

HOUSTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) – U.S. oil producers lost up to 2 million barrels per day or roughly 15% of national production over the weekend, analysts and traders estimated, as a winter storm swept across the country, straining energy infrastructure and power grids.

Oil production outages peaked on Saturday, consultancy ‍Energy Aspects estimated, with the Permian Basin likely to have experienced the largest share of that decline at around 1.5 million barrels per day. Production losses eased on Monday, with Permian shut-ins estimated at about 700,000 bpd and production set to be fully restored by January 30.

U.S. oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips’ Permian crude production was down by 175,000 bpd as of Sunday owing to frigid weather, according to a source familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak on the record.

ConocoPhillips typically does not comment on day-to-day operations, ‌a company spokesperson said.

Output in North Dakota, the third-largest oil-producing state, was estimated to be ‌down around 80,000 to 110,000 bpd as of Monday morning, said Justin Kringstad, Director of North Dakota Pipeline Authority. Associated wellhead natural gas production was estimated to be down by 0.24 to 0.33 billion cubic feet per day.

U.S. crude futures were trading at around $60.60 a barrel at 2:00 p.m. EDT, roughly 50 cents down on the day.

Chevron reported hatches were frozen open during the storm ​on Sunday in Midland, Texas, according to a regulatory filing, while several refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast reported issues related to the freezing weather. Exxon Mobil shut units at its Baytown, Texas, petrochemical complex on the east side of Houston.

There were ‍around two dozen reports of upsets at natural gas processing plants and ​compressor stations in Texas, according to regulatory filings over the weekend, but that paled in ​comparison to the more than 200 reported upsets during the first five days of a severe winter storm in 2021, TACenergy analysts ‍said in a note on Monday.

Average gas output in the Lower 48 states dropped to 106.9 bcfd so far in January, down from a monthly record high of 109.7 bcfd in December, according to LSEG, as producers shut in production.

Front-month gas futures were on track for their highest close since December 2022, rising 80 cents, or 15.2%, to $6.075 per million British thermal units.

POWER SECTOR UNDER STRAIN

Some 810,000 customers across the U.S. remained without power on Monday following the Arctic blast over ‍the weekend that brought heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from the Ohio Valley and mid-South to New England. Cold temperatures are expected to persist for parts of the country in coming days.

The weekend snow and ice storm knocked out power to more ‍than a million homes and businesses along ‍the U.S. Gulf Coast and Southeast, including in Texas.

The largest U.S. power grid, PJM, ​anticipated generation outages for Monday would rise to 22.4 GW, or about 16% of total ​committed capacity. ⁠Most of those outages are expected in Dominion Energy’s Mid-Atlantic territory, according to PJM data.

Demand ‌on PJM was 124 GW on Monday morning, above the forecast of 123.3 GW, but PJM continues to meet demand, PJM operations data show.

Spot wholesale electricity prices were around $200 per MWh, recovering from temporary spikes over the weekend that topped $3,000 per MWh.

Next-day prices in New England soared about 82% to $313 per megawatt hour, while PJM West prices in Pennsylvania and Maryland soared about 360% to around $413, their highest since January 2014.

EPA is requesting public comments on cleanup alternatives for the Terminal 25 South (also called T-25 South or T-25S) site area. The site is located along the southeast portion of the East Waterway Operable Unit of the Harbor Island Superfund site in Seattle.

The goal of the T-25S site Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis is to promptly reduce exposure risks to human health and the environment. The EE/CA proposes three cleanup alternatives to address contaminated sediments and soils within the in-water and upland portions. Each cleanup alternative includes varying amounts of removal, backfill, and capping any remaining contamination.

Following the removal action, the Port of Seattle will construct a habitat project at the T-25S site that will restore habitat by creating an off‐channel marsh and restored shoreline for fish and wildlife habitat.

A copy of the Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis document is available for review below.

EPA will accept public comments on the EE/CA for 30 days, from January 26 through February 25, 2026.

In the brief, the attorneys general urge the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts to grant a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the Agencies’ actions are arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because they unreasonably and unjustifiably target wind and solar development and no other energy sources.

“Wind and solar energy are more than just power sources — they lower energy bills and create good jobs, cleaner air, and a stronger future for our communities,” said Attorney General Bonta. “We will not stand by as federal actions attack these projects and take away opportunities for people to access reliable, affordable, and sustainable power. While the federal administration rigs the system for their fossil-fuel friends, we remain committed to ensuring that every family, community, and business has the chance to benefit from a clean energy future.”

The Agencies’ challenged actions make it harder to develop wind and solar projects. Each challenged action changes longstanding agency processes and legal determinations with the effect of delaying and preventing the permitting and construction of wind and solar facilities on both private and public lands. Together, the actions impose substantial and unprecedented obstacles to renewable energy development. The challenged actions include:

DOI’s unprecedented departmental review procedure, which requires wind and solar projects to be approved by three senior officials, including personal approval by the Secretary of the Interior, effectively freezing and delaying renewable energy permitting. This jeopardizes renewable project timelines and federal tax incentives.

DOI’s changes in project approval criteria to prioritize “capacity density,” a metric that inherently disadvantages wind and solar projects and effectively biases federal land permitting in favor of conventional energy sources.

Army Corps' changes in project approval criteria to consider capacity density and aesthetic impacts that systematically disadvantage wind and solar projects, including on private land, by favoring higher density conventional energy sources.

USFWS arbitrarily prohibiting wind facilities from obtaining eagle incidental take permits under Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act while allowing other energy technologies to receive such permits.

DOI arbitrarily denying wind and solar developers’ access to the publicly funded USFWS Information for Planning and Consultation database, impairing their ability to identify protected species and obtain necessary permits under the Endangered Species Act, while not imposing the same restriction on other energy technologies.

DOI’s reinstatement and reinterpretation of the Outer Continental Shelf Act, which reinterpreted the law in a narrow way to block new offshore wind projects, even though the law does not require such a prohibition.

In the amicus brief, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition support the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, asserting that the Agencies’ actions fail to provide a reasoned explanation, exceed their statutory authority, and are procedurally deficient because they were implemented without the required notice and comment process. The Agencies’ actions will not only derail the clean energy transition nationwide but will also threaten to increase consumer energy costs.

Take action: Urge Public Pensions to Adopt Climate Investment Principles

The report identifies six key takeaways that show how pensions can better manage climate risk and strengthen long-term retirement security.

1) Investing must focus on real-economy impacts, not portfolio metrics.

Because public pensions are long-term, diversified investors, their returns depend heavily on the overall health of the economy. To protect retirement savings from climate-related risks, pensions must address the root of climate-related financial risk: real-world climate impacts. One critical strategy is directing capital to projects and technologies that decarbonize the economy, build community resilience, and support a just transition.

Unfortunately, too many pensions prioritize achieving net-zero portfolio emissions over real-world emissions reductions, an approach that mostly shifts numbers on a balance sheet without reducing the underlying risks. Only investments that drive real-economy decarbonization can meaningfully protect beneficiaries’ long-term financial security. It’s critical that more pensions focus on strategies that help drive real-economy decarbonization and climate resilience, like investing in climate solutions.

2) More pensions need to set targets for climate-solutions investments.

While only a handful of pensions are taking meaningful steps today, important leadership is emerging. Five pensions have adopted time-bound, quantitative targets to invest billions in climate solutions over the next 5-10 years. Three pensions have disclosed strategies for climate-solution investments, but lack measurable targets to guide or scale these investments.

The fact that pensions of varying sizes, staffing structures, and political contexts are making these moves and setting targets demonstrates that fiduciaries view this strategy as prudent and fully consistent with fiduciary duty.

This report underscores that setting targets for climate-solutions investing is not only possible, but already underway across the public pension landscape.

3) Not all targets are created equal. Guardrails are needed.

While more pensions are beginning to set targets, not all targets are equally credible. They vary widely in scale and in whether they allow controversial technologies or false climate solutions to count toward their goals.

The most effective way for pensions to avoid greenwashing and to ensure their strategies are credible is to adopt the Principles for Climate Solutions Investments. Such policies clearly define what qualifies as a climate solution and what does not. Strong guardrails help prevent situations like classifying investments in major fossil fuel companies as “climate solutions” (which CalPERS is currently doing) and instead ensure that climate-solutions investments help drive real-economy decarbonization.

To ensure investments also support a just transition, pensions should pair these guardrails with strong labor and just transition principles.

4) Pensions need to realize that ""climate solutions” means more than clean energy.

The analysis revealed a clear trend: pensions are more heavily pursuing investments in clean energy than in any other category of climate solutions. This suggests that most pensions, and their fund managers, treat climate solutions primarily as an energy-sector issue, while overlooking other areas where investment is critically needed.

Clean energy investments are vital, but investment is needed across many sectors, including nature and biodiversity, just transition, and climate resilience.Broadening the scope of climate solutions also supports portfolio diversification, further strengthening risk management.

5) Pension boards need to be more involved in climate-risk investment strategies.

The analysis found that only 26% of pensions have boards actively engaged in a comprehensive climate strategy. Another 7% have boards focused solely on climate-related stewardship and proxy voting. This is a helpful first step, but not enough.

Boards are ultimately responsible for setting the pension’s direction and strategy, and are accountable as fiduciaries. As climate-related financial risks grow, it’s critical for boards to be actively involved in overseeing strategies that manage these risks across all investment decisions, not just stewardship.

6) Transparency and regular reporting are critical.

Regular progress reporting is essential for credible climate-strategy implementation. It enables fiduciaries, beneficiaries, and the public to understand whether commitments are being met and whether climate-related financial risks are being effectively managed.

Only four pensions analyzed provide consistent progress reports on stated climate-related targets. But even these leaders need to improve transparency, because without detailed holdings disclosures, it can be difficult to assess whether investments genuinely advance climate solutions or are greenwashing, such as counting fossil fuel investments toward climate goals.

The 2016 version of TSCA requires the EPA to affirm the safety of each new chemical before the substance enters the market.
“EPA does not meet the 90-day review deadline for the vast majority of all new chemicals submitted for EPA review,” Palmer said.
The draft bill is aimed at speeding up this process, he added.
Palmer said the draft bill will be revised in the coming weeks and eventually will be formally introduced in Congress.","Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives generally agree that a 2016 law is slowing the entry of new chemicals into the US market, including materials needed for artificial intelligence and military applications.

But they are at loggerheads on draft legislation that Republicans are promoting—and that the chemical industry is backing—to accelerate the pace of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s review of new substances before they enter commerce.

The EPA conducts those reviews under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which governs industrial chemicals. When Congress updated TSCA in 2016, both industry and environmental advocates initially praised the revised statute.

But within a year, industry began complaining about delays in getting new chemicals into commerce. The 2016 version of TSCA requires the EPA to affirm the safety of each new chemical before the substance enters the market. The requirements of the revised statute have slowed premanufacture review at the agency.

“This important law is still not working as Congress intended,” said Rep. Gary Palmer (R-AL), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment, at the panel’s Jan. 22 hearing on the draft bill to change TSCA. He deemed the process for reviewing new chemicals broken.

“EPA does not meet the 90-day review deadline for the vast majority of all new chemicals submitted for EPA review,” Palmer said. The draft bill is aimed at speeding up this process, he added.

Rep. Paul Tonko of New York, the top Democrat on the subcommittee, said he has deep concerns about part of the draft bill that would require the EPA to prioritize the use of industry-generated information in chemical reviews. Not allowing the EPA to use its expertise and experience to determine what kind of scientific data needed for a chemical review “will lead to a biased regulatory program,” Tonko said.

The draft bill would require the EPA to minimize any unreasonable risk posed by a new chemical to an extent that is reasonably feasible, said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the Energy and Commerce Committee’s top Democrat. The current standard in TSCA is for the agency to ensure that all unreasonable risks are eliminated.

Changing this standard to feasibility would mean the extent of risk-reduction requirements from the EPA, such as requiring that workers use certain types of protective equipment, would hinge on how much they cost a company, said Tracey J. Woodruff, a professor at University of California, San Francisco, medical school. Testifying at the hearing, Woodruff said such a change would endanger people’s health.

The agency’s current practice on worker exposure drew criticism from a representative of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the largest lobbying group of US chemical manufacturers.

“EPA has been making a fundamental mischaracterization of workplace exposure” in its new chemical reviews, said Kimberly Wise White, an ACC vice president. The agency currently assumes noncompliance with safety regulations, such as requirements that workers wear personal protective equipment, White testified at the hearing.

Instead, the EPA’s decisions “should be driven by empirical evidence, not default or overly conservative assumptions,” White said. The agency needs to consider whether existing workplace protections and Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal regulations are sufficient to control risks, she added.

Pallone suggested that lawmakers should call on EPA officials to discuss the review process for new chemicals and provide further insight for the next version of the draft bill.

The Honorable Gary Palmer

U.S. House of Representatives

Washington, DC 20515

Dear Representatives Crenshaw and Palmer

On behalf of the undersigned organizations, representing a broad coalition of taxpayer, free-market, and consumer advocates, we write to express our strong support for H.R. 6566, the Recycling Technology Innovation Act. This important legislation provides much-needed regulatory clarity for advanced recycling technologies, giving businesses the long-term certainty necessary to develop and succeed. We are proud to endorse H.R. 6566 and urge all Members of Congress to co-sponsor and support this legislation.

Plastics are a critical input for nearly every major manufacturing sector, including electronics, automotive production, medical equipment, and consumer staples. One of the key advantages of plastics is their ability to be broken down and recycled into new products. While plastics are initially derived from petroleum, recycling keeps these finite materials in circulation and reduces strain on local waste management systems that often depend on taxpayer funding. Advanced recycling technologies not only help divert plastic from landfills, incinerators, and the environment, but also keep valuable materials within the domestic economy—strengthening U.S. supply chains and supporting American jobs.

Aligning federal policy with existing state frameworks would promote regulatory consistency, reduce confusion, and enable businesses to plan and invest with greater certainty. Indeed, many have noted that the greatest barrier to expanding advanced recycling today is not a lack of technological capability, but burdensome and outdated government regulations.

While free-market actors have successfully built this important industry, the regulatory framework governing it has not kept pace. Federal regulators have applied inconsistent interpretations of the Clean Air Act, leaving companies uncertain about how advanced recycling will be regulated and exposing them to costly and protracted litigation. In addition, some states classify advanced recycling as “waste incineration,” a designation that often prevents new facilities from becoming operational.

The Recycling Technology Innovation Act addresses this problem by providing the regulatory certainty businesses need. H.R. 6566 clarifies that advanced recycling is not waste incineration, but a manufacturing process that converts used plastics into new materials. This clear distinction would prevent unnecessary regulatory barriers that increase costs, stifle innovation, and deter investment in modern recycling technologies. With 25 states already recognizing advanced recycling as manufacturing rather than incineration, updating federal policy would promote consistency and harmonize regulations nationwide.

As Congress considers comprehensive permitting reform to streamline government reviews of infrastructure and energy projects, we believe that this legislation would be a worthwhile inclusion in any such package. Many communities would benefit from new recycling facilities, but long and unpredictable review timelines often delay construction and increase costs. A more predictable and transparent permitting system for everything would help projects move forward on schedule, support better planning for local leaders, and reduce the financial risks that often discourage private investment.

Passing the Recycling Technology Innovation Act is a practical way to support economic growth, improve recycling, and encourage private sector investment. Pairing this effort with more reliable permitting processes would help ensure that new facilities can be built efficiently and begin delivering value to communities across the country. We are proud to support your proposal and look forward to working with you to help it become law.

In addition to Electrify America, GM has integrated other charging operators, too, including Ionna and Tesla’s Superchargers. All in all, GM says its EV drivers now have access to more than 250,000 public chargers across the U.S. and Canada.

“As EV travel continues to grow, so does the need for convenient charging experiences,” said Robert Barrosa, CEO and president of Electrify America. “Through this integration, GM EV drivers have more Hyper-Fast chargers to choose from and a seamless experience they can count on nationwide, helping them get to the places that matter.”

The apps provided by General Motors allow owners to find charging stations and see their real-time availability, plan routes with charging stops, monitor a charging session and pay for charging directly in the app.

Last year, GM set a new EV sales record, securing its place as the second largest EV maker in the U.S. The Chevy Equinox EV was the country’s best-selling non-Tesla EV in 2025, doubling its volume compared to 2024.

Meanwhile, Electrify America is not slowing down, despite headwinds in the industry. The company now has 1,116 stations in the U.S., with 5,405 ports open for business, according to the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center.

The Trump administration controversially halted EV requirements in the United States' largest auto market last year. But Stellantis — seemingly — remained bound through 2030 by a prior settlement agreement promising to comply with Golden State policies, regardless of any “judicial or federal action” preventing its latest rules from taking effect.

That might no longer be the case.

Stellantis dealers in California now have more flexibility in what vehicles they can sell, while state regulators are no longer projecting certainty over whether the company known for its gas-guzzling trucks will be held to account. Additionally, the automaker recently decided to kill plug-in hybrid Jeep and Chrysler models for the 2026 model year, making it all but impossible to meet a 35% ""zero-emission vehicle"" sales requirement.

That figure rises to 68% by 2030, the final year of Stellantis' settlement agreement with California. The 2024 deal, inked under embattled former CEO Carlos Tavares, was made in exchange for California forgiving past regulatory compliance shortfalls, and helped avoid potentially lengthy litigation between the two sides.

""Stellantis will continue to comply with applicable regulations,"" spokesperson Jodi Tinson said in a Jan. 16 statement. ""We remain committed to freedom of choice for our customers in 2026 with the all-new, fully electric Jeep Recon and range-extended Grand Wagoneer.""

Asked whether Stellantis still considered California's regulations ""applicable"" under its settlement agreement with the state, Tinson said the company is ""not going to elaborate further.""

The California Air Resources Board, which regulates vehicle emissions in the Golden State, declined to comment for this story. The agency previously told The Detroit News in June that the settlement agreement ""remains in place, and we fully expect Stellantis to comply.”

Less plug-in, more V-8

Sean Hogan, vice president of Sierra Auto Group in Southern California and the chairman of Stellantis' national dealer council, said this week that Golden State retailers are confident that they now have flexibility in which models they can sell.

That includes, he said, a recent shift allowing California dealers to sell the company's popular gas-guzzling V-8 and supercharged V8-powered models.

Stellantis recently advertised that its Hemi V-8 Jeep Wrangler Moab 392, which gets just 14 miles per gallon, is ""now available for order in all 50 states, including California, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Washington."" All are states that had adopted California's stricter emissions requirements before Trump halted them.

Many V8-powered Ram 1500 pickups and Dodge Durango SUVs are also currently listed for sale in California; the automaker previously was phasing out the larger engines on its trucks and SUVs due in part to the state's strict regulations. Under the Trump administration, the V-8 is back for the automaker, apparently even in California.

Stellantis isn't fully moving away from plug-in models. Despite killing the plug-in hybrid lineup, the automaker will soon sell an electric model called the Jeep Recon, and also plans to soon release range-extended hybrid Jeep and Ram models that have an option to run entirely on electricity.

But without its plug-in hybrid Jeeps and Chryslers — many of which were funneled to California in recent years to meet the stricter requirements — it's unclear how the automaker could meet the terms of its settlement with the state.

Daimler difficulties

Since issuing the statement in June that ""we fully expect Stellantis to comply"" with the settlement agreement, CARB has undergone a legal setback in a separate but related matter.

Truck makers Daimler North America LLC, International Motors LLC, Paccar Inc. and Volvo Group North America LLC sued California over attempts to enforce emissions regulations despite a Trump administration maneuver to cancel them. That maneuver, notably, is also being challenged in court by California and several other states with Democratic attorneys general.

Veteran environmental lawyer David Pettit of the Center for Biological Diversity said that an initial ruling in the Daimler case “did not go well” for CARB and could have implications for the Stellantis deal, too.

In the Daimler case — which the Trump administration joined as an intervenor on behalf of the plaintiffs — federal attorneys argued that a California agreement with truck-makers called the Clean Trucks Partnership is ""a regulatory enforcement tool styled as a 'contract' with certain truck manufacturers.""

A judge issued a preliminary injunction in October that effectively halted California from enforcing its rules via the partnership, though the case is still pending a final decision.

One factor in that decision: the question of whether California can do by contract what it is forbidden to do by regulation.

Pettit said in an interview that CARB has made missteps in its legal defense and is no longer in a strong position to enforce the previously agreed-upon EV targets for Stellantis.

“I've always thought as a lawyer — I've been a lawyer a long time — it's very bad karma to get too cocky about your case, especially in public,” the California-based attorney said, commenting on CARB’s projected confidence about Stellantis last year.

“History has shown that maybe being a little more nuanced would have been a good idea,” he added. “Now they don't seem confident about how they're moving in this area.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gmtoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/f1/9f1d702e-fd9f-48cf-8dae-547b698b4c04/69778221751a6.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-26 15:08:08.129802

Drivers of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac vehicles can now access over 5,000 DC fast chargers across the US.

The app integration lets users see real-time charger availability, plan routes with charging stops, track the progress of their charging sessions, and pay for charging — all in one place.

“Owners can navigate to the Public Charging page in their myBrand app and look for supported networks, enabling fast and convenient charging while traveling throughout the US,” the Detroit automaker explained.

Previously, the Electrify America charging network was also included within Rivian’s in-vehicle navigation app.

A recent Rivian software update allows the mobile app to suggest available chargers, display their power levels and user ratings. It also lets owners use Plug & Charge at Electrify America stations.

Charging Network

According to GM Energy’s VP Wade Sheffer, the company is “collaborating across the industry to deliver not just more chargers, but better public charging experiences.”

Across the US and Canada, GM drivers can access more than 250,000 public charging stations.

According to the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center, Electrify America represents 5,405 of these, placed within 1,116 stations.

But the network also includes over 3,100 Tesla Supercharging stations with more than 35,000 chargers in North America alone.

The automaker opened up access to Tesla Superchargers in late 2024, allowing owners to purchase a GM-approved NACS (North America Charging Standard) DC adapter for the chargers.

At that time, GM noted that Tesla operated about 17,800 Superchargers, which indicates that the company roughly doubled the number of chargers in the US and Canada in the past year.

Due to Tesla‘s lead in the charging industry, several automakers are now replacing their CSS (Combined Charging System) ports with the NACS standard.

EV Business

In the last quarter of 2025, electric vehicle sales in the United States fell overall, following the end of the federal EV tax credit.

General Motors’ EV sales declined by 43% in the final three months of 2025, after a steady increase in the first two quarters.

The total electric vehicles sold in 2025 have increased by 48% year over year, however, making GM the second best-seller in the EV segment last year, just after Tesla.

The company sold 169,887 electric vehicles last year, for a total of 2.85 million — representing a share of just 6% of the total units registered by the brand in 2025.

In October, ahead of its third-quarter earnings report, the Detroit automaker announced that it would take a $1.6 billion hit as it was restructuring its business, after the termination of the federal EV tax credit.

The company warned that it could face additional significant cash and non-cash charges in the future, which may affect its financial results and cash flow.

Last year, GM stopped production of several EV models, restructuring manufacturing operations for hybrid and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles instead.

The measure led to thousands of workers being laid off, including over 1,000 employees who worked at its CAMI plant in Canada, producing the BrightDrop commercial vans — which were also cancelled.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GM_converted.webp,N,,2026-01-26 13:59:43.569537

Eliot wrote in “The Waste Land” that “April is the cruelest month.” But today in America, January may prove to be the cruelest of all.

Why? January is the convergence of three highly disruptive and destructive forces. The first is the budget deadline. The continuing resolution expires at month’s end. It is not a good sign that the Senate was out of session last week. Suppose Congress cannot agree and is deadlocked. The government will shut down again, possibly for longer than the 43 days last fall.

Although it is in no one’s interest for this to happen again, Democrats and Republicans may be unable to compromise on what programs should be cut or funded. Health care is obviously a 5,000-pound gorilla. Huge increases for medical insurance have taken hold, by itself making this an explosive issue with the political effect of a thermonuclear bomb.

What people do not understand is the pernicious damage a continuing resolution does. The uncertainty of when a full budget is finally approved and signed into law makes planning virtually impossible for the executive branch.

Every day a continuing resolution is in place, the government loses about 15 percent of its purchasing power. In the corporate world, any company that operated this way would be out of business. But this is the way our government operates, as incredible as it may sound.

And at the end of the month, disruptive force number two activates — or, in this case, does not. On Feb. 5, the New START nuclear arms control agreement permanently expires. New START kept U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons limited to 1,550 warheads each. The treaty cannot be extended, although Moscow and Washington could honor those limits.

That is not the same guarantee as a legal document. Russia, which has been noncompliant with New START since 2022, could more easily expand its warhead count than the U.S. And the Trump administration’s emphasis on Golden Dome defense that could counter most or all attacks against the U.S. will almost certainly cause Moscow to increase its number of warheads and nuclear delivery systems.

Do we really want another nuclear arms race, especially when our replacement submarine, missile and bomber force replacements will cost many hundreds if not trillions of dollars? The answer would seem obvious.

Then there was Greenland, the third force. President Donald Trump has long held that Greenland is vital to American defenses. His arguments are not self-evident. The idea that the Arctic is strategically more vital due to the melting of ice and new sea routes that will cut transport costs substantially is fine. But the U.S. already has Alaska on the Arctic, as well as nearly unlimited restrictions on increasing its forces on Greenland, based on a 1951 treaty. And Russia and China are not that heavily engaged yet.

After Trump threatened to use military force to seize Greenland, the stock markets reacted and recorded huge losses. At the World Economic Forum last week, Trump withdrew the threat of military intervention. But the damage had already been done, even though the markets recovered. NATO’s Article Five states that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all. Greenland, belonging to Denmark, is part of NATO. Had anyone in the White House informed the president of the implications of his threat? Probably not.

With that matter now resolved, the reactions of European members of NATO cannot be reversed. This is not 1956, when NATO allies Britain and France, in concert with Israel, occupied the Suez Canal and defeated the Egyptian army. President Dwight D. Eisenhower rebuked America’s NATO allies in that case and the invading forces were withdrawn. The alliance was shaken as a consequence.

Now, the threat to invade Greenland has similarly shaken the alliance. The reason is simple: Allies can no longer depend on the U.S. under Trump. And this may be unfixable, no matter who is elected president in 2028. Trump, having additionally invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to join the Gaza peace panel, may accomplish what five Soviet and three Russian leaders failed to do: end the NATO alliance.

Arms control, budgets and Greenland have been unlikely cohorts and comrades in challenging America. How this turns out obviously is a work in progress. But I do not believe this will turn out well.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/trump_donald_01232026_AP26023097050864-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-26 15:07:57.659194

Dive Brief:

Renewable energy developer Exowatt has launched a business arm focused on providing land and energy infrastructure to support large or hyperscale data centers, the company announced Wednesday.

The company’s new arm, “ExoRise,” will lean on land, power and its novel P3 solar and battery technology — which stores energy in the form of heat and converts it to electricity on demand — to provide data centers with reliable power around the clock, Exowatt said in a press release.

The Miami, Florida-headquartered startup is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and others, and said it will develop the projects in areas with high solar exposure across the U.S. Southwest, such as New Mexico, west Texas, Arizona, and Nevada. Exowatt said the region offers ample land and solar resources which allows for faster deployment and has a minimal impact on local communities.

ExoRise will provide the startup’s customers with infrastructure that supports “behind-the-meter and off-grid deployment” based on remote land, a method Exowatt said is able to deliver large-scale power without increasing electricity costs for local ratepayers. The company said the approach will also encourage domestic growth of artificial intelligence and boost energy resilience.

Data centers consume increasing amounts of power, especially as companies in the tech sector continue to turn to AI. U.S. data center power demand could reach 106 gigawatts in 2035, according to a recent report from BloombergNEF. BNEF’s latest forecast is 36% higher than its April 2025 estimate released — a jump it attributed in part to the higher average size of the 150 significant U.S. data center projects announced in 2024, over a quarter of which are larger than 500 megawatts.

“The growth of AI is colliding with real limits on grid capacity,” Exowatt’s Chief Data Center Officer Nic Bustamante said in the release. “ExoRise is designed to solve that problem by delivering dependable power at the speed AI requires. We’re not just solving a business problem — we’re enabling the future of American AI leadership.”

Bustamante will lead partnerships with offtakers for hyperscale data centers and infrastructure financiers, Exowatt said.

Last year, the startup raised $70 million to commercialize its P3 solar technology. The funding round for the technology — marketed as a modular, always-on clean energy solution for data centers and other large industrial loads — was backed by HSBC’s venture capital arm, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and several prominent Silicon Valley investors.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ZdBhHW5atKyRzmekIlVbwXd1BpmdS1QlRTUO1h2hQr4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjQyMjk3MzE4X0wxeU5QcEkuanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-26 13:59:47.508437

Data centers have taken over as a huge boon for the local economy and additional regulation could place that cash flow at risk.","Staring down a dwindling energy supply and cracks in the grid’s reliability, Washington lawmakers aim to reel in the largely unregulated industry sucking up much of the region’s power: data centers.

A set of bills making their way through the statehouse propose a sweeping set of regulations to raise rates for data centers, require them to disclose the natural resources they use and ensure they’re among the first electrical users cut during energy shortages.

The time is now, said state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham. Data centers are popping up across the country. They’re drawing vast quantities of energy and water and driving up costs for neighboring ratepayers. And their thirst for electricity will only continue to rise.

“The growth is coming,” Shewmake said. “And we need to be prepared.”

Others, however, warned that additional regulation could drive future data centers out of the state, costing rural communities the tax boosts on which they’ve come to depend.

The companion measures — House Bill 2515 and Senate Bill 6171 — started off with public hearings in committees last week.

Early in his term, Gov. Bob Ferguson convened a working group to investigate the effects of data centers on Washington’s economy, tax revenue, energy use and environment. The decision came after a 2024 Seattle Times and ProPublica investigation into the clean energy and economic impacts of the state’s data center industry. The group included lawmakers, utilities, environmental advocates, tribes and scientists. They published their findings and recommendations in November, some of which are reflected in the measures now under consideration.

The bills would require public and private utilities to propose a new set of tariffs for data centers, effectively higher electric rates. Data centers with contracts or existing tariffs in place would be able to rely on their current agreements for a time.

The idea is to ensure the data centers pay for additional grid infrastructure they require to meet their massive demand. It would also aim to offset any rate increases from the facilities that might otherwise be pushed onto regular ratepayers.

This trend has been felt across the country. As data centers gobble up much of the available, less-expensive power in their regions, utilities must rely on more expensive options (often generated by fossil fuels) to meet rising demand, resulting in higher rates for people living in the area.

Data centers need to pay their fair share, Shewmake said, and ensure they don’t jack up electric rates on “grandma.”

Utilities would have to propose their increased rates for data centers by October, the bills say.

The data centers would also have to shoulder a flat fee, half a penny for every kilowatt hour of energy they use, said Zachariah Baker, regional and state policy director for the NW Energy Coalition. That money would go toward low-income bill assistance, weatherization projects and artificial intelligence education programs.

While data centers are known to draw large quantities of power and water, state officials don’t have a comprehensive understanding on the specifics. Often, that information can only be found between disparate utilities or service providers. The proposed measures would require new sustainability reporting on water and chemical use, Shewmake said. This would help state officials understand the size and scope of the problem before taking further action.

In support of the bill, Jeremy Takala, a council member with the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, testified Friday before the state Senate Committee on Environment, Energy & Technology. The rapid growth of data centers will increase the chance of power blackouts or brownouts more than 13% in a given year, Takala said.

The space between energy supply and demand is thinning in the Pacific Northwest with each passing year. Experts have warned that as early as 2030, energy demand could outpace supply during heat waves or cold snaps.

Baker pointed to a 2025 report from the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, which found that within the next five years, energy demand from the tech sector — largely driven by data centers — will increase so much that it would be as if two to four cities the size of Seattle had been added to the grid.

The proposed measures would ensure that during times of energy shortages, data centers would take power cuts before other, more critical customers like hospitals, said Shewmake, who chairs the Senate committee.

Laws like the Clean Energy Transformation Act already require utilities to shift away from fossil fuels but the proposed measures would expedite those rules for data centers, Baker said. By 2030, 80% of their power would have to come from new and renewable sources and five years later they’d have to consume exclusively renewable energy.

Sure, these measures pack in a lot of new regulation for the burgeoning industry, Baker said. But such a comprehensive approach is needed to protect ratepayers, grid reliability and the environment.

Not everybody agrees.

During the House and Senate’s public hearings last week, industry representatives alongside some local government officials testified against the package. They called the bills overly prescriptive and said that despite rising energy use and rates across the country, the tech industry is already doing enough to protect their neighbors.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, said the new regulations would unfairly single out data centers when instead all large energy users should be treated the same. Such a sweeping package would make Washington state a standout across the country. And, he noted that during times of insufficient energy supply, data centers can’t simply be turned off. Instead they’d be forced to rely on backup generation.

Others, representing local governments in Eastern Washington, also spoke against the measures. Data centers have taken over as a huge boon for the local economy and additional regulation could place that cash flow at risk.

Pat Haley, city administrator for Quincy, referred to the explosion of data centers in his community as the “Quincy miracle.” To date, nearly half of the city’s family-wage jobs stem from the industry and around 57% of its property tax base comes from data centers, he said.

These bills would inject uncertainty into the fast-growing industry and make Washington a less-appealing destination for new projects, opponents said.

Shewmake and Baker pushed back, though. Electricity in Washington is pretty affordable, compared with much of the rest of the country, they said. While these bills would increase rates for data centers, the state would remain a competitive destination for the industry.

Conversations surrounding the proposed data center regulations are sure to continue and face tweaks. While House and Senate committees held public hearings on the package last week, the measures have not yet gone to a vote.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01232026_TZR_Quincy-Data_Center-2024_tzr_133048.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-26 13:59:51.806708

The Environmental Law & Policy Center (“ELPC”) along with 5 other organizations filed a Title V Petition to Object (“Petition”) before the United State Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) related to the BP Products North America, Inc. (“BP”) refinery.

The refinery is located in Whiting, Indiana.

A Title V renewal permit is stated to have been issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (“IDEM”).

Title V of the Clean Air Act requires certain stationary sources of air pollution to obtain Operating Permits. States that administer Title V do so through adopted implementation plans. These plans are submitted to and approved by EPA.

The intent of a Title V Permit is to organize into a single document all of the requirements that apply to the Permit holder. 42 U.S.C. § 7661 requires that states submit each proposed Title V Permit to EPA for review. Section 505(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act requires that EPA object to the issuance of a proposed Title V Permit in writing within 45 days of the receipt of the proposed Permit (and all necessary supporting information) if the agency determines it is not in compliance with the applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.

If EPA does not object to a Permit, Section 505(b)(2) provides that any person may petition the EPA Administrator within 60 days of the expiration of the 45-day review period to object to the Permit.

The BP (Whiting Refinery) is stated to have operated since 1889 and is the largest such facility in the Midwest. It is stated to process up to 440,000 barrels of crude oil every day, producing:

10 million gallons of gasoline.

4 million gallons of diesel.

2 million gallons of jet fuel.

7% of all asphalt in the U.S.

The refinery is stated to be composed of multiple emission units and associated equipment.

ELPC argues that the EPA must object to the renewed Title V Permit because it fails to include and/or assure compliance with all requirements of the Clean Air Act. The arguments include:

Fails to include the PM10 limit contained in 326 IAC 6.8-2-6(a) of the Indiana State Implementation Plan, which is an applicable requirement that applies to all PM10 emissions from each boiler stack;

Fails to include the required Preventive Maintenance Plan; and

An $80 billion deal to deploy Westinghouse AP1000 reactors across the U.S. could boost the country’s nuclear supply chain and turn nuclear into a top energy provider for the data center boom.

January 26 - An agreement in October between the U.S. federal government and Westinghouse owners Brookfield Asset Management and Cameco was a key step by the Trump administration towards its goal of increasing nuclear capacity from around 100 GW today to 400 GW by 2050. The deal calls for 10 new large reactors under construction by 2030.

“We’ve eliminated the AP1000’s first-of-a-kind challenges and the American nuclear supply chain is ready now, following the completion of two AP1000 units at Plant Vogtle in Georgia,” said Brian McCrone, communications manager at Westinghouse, referring to the last two pressurized water reactors (PWRs) built in the U.S., which were brought online in 2023 and 2024.

The supply chain is “capable of handling multiple projects simultaneously,” he told Reuters Events.

In June 2025, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) extended the duration of the AP1000 standard design certification to 40 years, with an expiration date of February 2046.

“Our AP1000 reactor is the only fully licensed, construction-ready advanced reactor available in the U.S.,” McCrone noted.

Cameco said that under the deal, the government will provide near-term financing of long lead time items, which include Reactor Pressure Vessels (RPVs), steam generators, and coolant pumps.

The deal includes “unprecedented” government involvement in both financing and risk mitigation, which contrasts with typical nuclear projects where private companies bear most construction and regulatory risks, said Zoe Sulmont, Research Analyst, Energy Transition at Wood Mackenzie.

“The U.S. government will help Westinghouse secure land and permits, potentially offer loan guarantees, and assist with international business development,” Sulmont told Reuters Events.

This level of government backing could help revive U.S. nuclear competitiveness after decades of under-investment, ""as it effectively de-risks large capital expenditures, accelerates permitting timelines, and provides long-term policy certainty,” she added.

Sulmont said that the new AP1000s would restart the supply chain for specialised components.

“Repeat builds of the same design is an investment in standardization which reduces downstream risk and allows suppliers to operate more efficiently,” she added.

This would benefit Westinghouse's existing supply network, which includes major partners such as Curtiss-Wright, which manufactures coolant pumps and Siemens Energy, which produces massive steam turbines and generators.

But how fast the supply chain will grow and in what capacity is uncertain because the Trump administration has yet to announce details of the agreement, including a timeline or how the federal government would provide funds, said James Richards, manager of the Economics and Project Development Program at think tank Nuclear Innovation Alliance (NIA).

“How this takes shape is unclear without knowing some of the ins and outs of the deal,” James told Reuters Events.

In addition, this partnership is tied to a framework trade agreement signed between the U.S. and Japan in October. Under the deal, Japanese companies agreed to invest ""up to $332 billion to support critical energy infrastructure in the United States, including the construction of AP1000 and small modular reactors (SMRs), in partnership with Westinghouse,” the White House said at the time.

Historically, Westinghouse has a deep partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), which has manufactured many of the large-scale components for AP1000s built abroad. The deal also considers the involvement of Japanese suppliers with a history in heavy industry manufacturing, such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toshiba Group and IHI Corporation.

""The Japanese investment speeds up capital deployment reducing supplier financing risk ... [and] could ramp up supply chain development. However, it will take time,” Sulmont said.

Cost risks

Construction of Vogtle 2 and 3 was completed seven years behind schedule, and costs more than doubled from the initial projection of $14 billion.

Cost controls for Vogtle 2 and 3 improved after Southern Company took over the project in 2017, Richards said. However, the industry has to show additional improvements, or the risks of financing nuclear projects could become insurmountable, he added, citing the supply chain delays, the delivery of faulty components and workforce shortages that plagued the Vogtle projects.

CHART: US nuclear capacity additions by year of initial operation

But following completion of the reactors, “the workforce that built these units exists, which is an advantage over competitors,” Richards noted.

This workforce could benefit companies that announced plans in 2025 to build AP1000 reactors amid increasing demand for power from data centers.

Fermi America has filed applications with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to build four AP1000 at its “Hypergrid” project in Texas. According to the filing, construction of the first unit is projected to begin in 2026 with the initial unit expected to start producing power by April 2031.

South Carolina's state-owned utility and project owner Santee Cooper in October said it will install two AP1000 reactors at its VC Summer 2 and 3 nuclear power complex. When construction of Summer 2 and 3 was cancelled in 2017 due mainly to cost overruns and the bankruptcy of the primary contractor, Westinghouse, over $9 billion had been spent to complete less than 50% of the reactors.

Because the AP1000 design has already been approved by the NRC, obtaining construction permits should be “smooth as long as there is sufficient NRC staff,” James said.

Another advantage for the AP1000 is that it uses standard Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU), which has a solid supply chain that could be easily expanded.

Westinghouse manufactures LEU at its Columbia Fuel Fabrication Facility in Hopkins, South Carolina and began providing LEU+, which has a higher concentration of uranium, to Vogtle 2 in April 2025.

Cameco is a leading producer of uranium and has a 49% stake in the Global Laser Enrichment (GLE) project, which is working toward commercial production of LEU at its Paducah, Kentucky site.

Energy Saver NC is now available in all counties across North Carolina. The program launched in eastern North Carolina early last year. Community advocate Meech Carter is a member of the N.C. League of Conservation Voters, where she helps people get relief from burdensome utility bills. She said one of the highest bills she’d seen came from a homeowner in Edgecombe County, who paid $960 for electricity.

“That bill was from a woman who got an oversized heating unit during COVID because that's all there was,” Carter said.

The state-run program offers residents rebates on household upgrades that reduce monthly utility bills. Applicants may receive up to $16,000 toward new appliances, better insulation, or other purchases that help a home consume electricity more efficiently. That might include:

Heat pumps

Energy-efficient HVAC units

Electric stoves

Air sealing

The funds are included in the budget for the Department of Justice, signed Friday by President Trump.

The new center was included in a set of recommendations from the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice Veterans Justice Commission, which found that the justice system fails to consistently identify veterans and steer them away from incarceration.

“The lack of coordination between programs for justice-involved veterans results in the duplication of efforts, a lack of proper program evaluation, and an inability to disseminate best practices,” the Commission said in its 2023 report. “As a result, justice-involved veterans seeking assistance often confront a confusing and disjointed network of untested interventions.”

The national center marks a major milestone for efforts intended to address these shortcomings. The Commission said the center should be responsible for:

Enhancing the coordination of information, data, and best practices between and among programs serving justice-involved veterans

Identifying research gaps in veterans’ programs, and

Funding original research and technical assistance to fill those gaps and encouraging programmatic innovation to expand evidence-based practice for justice-involved veteran interventions.

“Service-related trauma and other legacies of deployment push too many veterans on a path toward our criminal justice system, and our nation has a responsibility to better understand and interrupt that trajectory,” said Brigadier General David “Mac” MacEwen, the commission’s director. “This center honors veterans’ sacrifices and will help us address their unique risk factors by serving as a hub for best practices, research, and coordination of federal, state, and local programs.”

The CCJ Veterans Justice Commission was comprised of 15 of the nation’s top military, veterans, and criminal justice leaders. It examined the risk factors that contribute to veterans’ involvement in the justice system, the adequacy of transitional support for service members reentering civilian life, and the effectiveness of justice system responses when veterans break the law. The commission produced a wide range of research and issued 11 recommendations.

CMI also convenes the flagship Annual Critical Minerals Institute Summit, a global gathering of government leaders, institutional investors, and industry executives.","As the global minerals race intensifies, the landscape is no longer merely defined by supply and demand curves—it is being redrawn by geopolitical fragmentation, industrial strategy, and economic nationalism. The upcoming Critical Minerals Institute (CMI) Masterclass, “The Competition for Critical Minerals in a Deglobalized World During the Next Decade (2026–2035),” could not be timelier. With Western governments moving from reactive policymaking to active market participation, and with China recalibrating its own leverage through pricing power and outbound capital, this session will bring overdue clarity to what lies ahead.

Moderated by geopolitical and macroeconomics expert and CMI Co-Chair Melissa “Mel” Sanderson and featuring strategic veterans such as Constantine Karayannopoulos and heralded international critical minerals expert and CMI-Co-Chair Jack Lifton, the Masterclass will dissect how emerging trade blocs, security-first supply policies, and rising export controls are transforming critical minerals from commodities into sovereign instruments. For those of us observing these shifts unfold in real time, the themes of this week’s report echo many of the questions this Masterclass intends to answer: What happens to market access when cooperation falters? Where is capital safest—and where is it most needed? And how will the next decade’s winners be defined not by reserves, but by the resilience and autonomy of their supply chains?

As the Masterclass preview makes clear, the 2026–2035 period will not be defined by globalization’s efficiencies, but by its unraveling—and what nations and industries choose to build in its place.

Now for this week’s Critical Minerals Report….

The global scramble for critical minerals hit a new inflection point this week. In Washington, the U.S. government made an unprecedented move by taking a direct 10% equity stake in USA Rare Earth, Inc. (NASDAQ: USAR) as part of a $1.6 billion package to develop a Texas rare earth mine and an Oklahoma magnet plant. This deal – to be unveiled today – marks the largest U.S. investment in the sector and follows last year’s government stakes in MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP), Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) and Trilogy Metals Inc. (TSX: TMQ). The White House has signaled more “historic deals” ahead to boost domestic output of lithium, rare earths, and other strategic materials.

The same strategic urgency is evident in a newly finalized U.S. rule to speed up deep-sea mining permits for critical minerals. The Trump administration ordered regulators to consolidate and shorten reviews for companies hunting metals on the ocean floor – a controversial bid to counter China’s dominance, even as environmental groups warn of “irreversible” damage to seabed ecosystems. And looking abroad, Washington is leveraging diplomacy: after brokering a minerals pact in Africa, Kinshasa has sent the U.S. a list of state-owned mining assets – from copper-cobalt deposits to lithium projects – now available for American investment. This joint U.S.-Congo initiative is the most tangible sign yet of U.S. efforts to pry critical supply chains out of China’s orbit in Africa. It also comes as Brazil emerges as a coveted partner: Preliminary talks between the Trump and Lula administrations are exploring a rare earths alliance, part of negotiations over U.S. tariffs on Brazilian steel. Brazil sits on the world’s second-largest rare earth reserves (about 21 million tonnes), and both Washington and Brussels are courting Brasília’s cooperation on lithium, nickel, and rare earth projects. Notably, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is convening a first-ever Critical Minerals Ministerial in Washington on February 4 with Brazil, Argentina, and other allies in attendance. The goal: to cement new supply partnerships and ensure Western economies are not beholden to a single foreign supplier in the future.

Major corporate moves are reinforcing these geopolitical shifts. Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU | TSX: EFR) announced a USD$299 million acquisition of Australia’s Australian Strategic Materials Ltd. (ASX: ASM), aiming to create the largest fully integrated rare earth producer outside China. The deal will link Energy Fuels’ rare earth processing plant in Utah with ASM’s critical metals facility in Korea, establishing a “mine-to-metal” supply chain spanning from raw minerals to magnet alloys. It directly addresses a longstanding weakness in the West’s supply chain by combining upstream mining and separation with downstream metal-making capacity, a capability largely monopolized by China today. Industry experts note that in 2025 the U.S. still imported 56% of its rare earth needs, so moves like this are crucial for reducing dependency. Meanwhile, Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. (ASX: LYC) – the world’s top producer outside China – reported a 43% surge in quarterly revenue despite output disruptions. CEO Amanda Lacaze credited government policies for “improving the function of the market” by supporting floor prices for non-Chinese rare earth suppliers. U.S. programs to ensure minimum prices (for example, stockpiling agreements benefiting producers like MP Materials) have lifted rare earth oxide prices to more sustainable levels. Lacaze told investors that geopolitical tailwinds – from export controls in China easing oversupply to multilateral discussions on pricing support – have turned policy into a real market driver. The result: rare earth prices in January are strengthening further and giving Western projects a fighting chance against China’s low-cost competitors.

Beijing, for its part, is hardly standing still. New figures show China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investment hit a record high in 2025, as Beijing pours cash into energy and mining projects worldwide in what observers call a “global resources grab.” Notably, about $18 billion of BRI financing went into wind, solar and waste-to-energy projects last year, underscoring China’s lead in exporting clean technology. At the same time, Chinese funding for overseas metals and mining projects surged to new heights, as China seeks to lock in long-term supplies of minerals from Latin America to Africa. This strategy was on display in Africa recently, where Chinese companies dominate cobalt and copper output in the Congo – a dominance the U.S. is now directly challenging via the new DRC-U.S. minerals pact. On the financial front, China moved to boost its influence over commodity pricing: regulators announced that foreign investors will be allowed to trade China’s domestic nickel and lithium futures for the first time. By opening these contracts on the Shanghai and Guangzhou exchanges to global participants, Beijing aims to internationalize its benchmarks for battery metals and erode the primacy of London and New York markets. This comes amid a rally in Chinese metals markets, where open interest in Shanghai base metals futures has hit record levels as investors bet on an EV-driven demand boom. In short, China is positioning itself not just as the world’s biggest buyer of critical minerals, but as a price-setter.

One arena where China’s strategy is unfolding in real time is the electric vehicle market. Chinese automakers, led by BYD Co. Ltd. (HKG:1211), have now eclipsed Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) in global EV sales, thanks to aggressive pricing and scale. This week brought a wake-up call for Detroit: Canada slashed its tariff on Chinese EVs from 100% to just 6%, effectively flinging open the door to China’s low-cost electric cars. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney had imposed the steep duties in solidarity with the U.S. (which cites national security to bar Chinese cars), but Ottawa reversed course in a bid to lower vehicle costs and spur competition. The implications for U.S. manufacturers are profound. Canada’s auto market is tightly integrated with America’s, so Chinese EVs gaining a foothold up north could be a trojan horse into the United States. Industry analysts say it’s likely just a matter of time before Americans are buying Chinese-made cars. In fact, President Donald Trump himself struck a surprisingly open tone, saying he welcomes Chinese automakers to build factories in the U.S. if they create American jobs. Such a shift would have been unthinkable a year ago. Now, with Chinese models already grabbing ~10% of new car sales in Europe and 20% in Mexico by undercutting Western rivals, Detroit’s Big Three – General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE: STLA) – may be forced to reinvent their EV offerings. Cheaper Chinese models like BYD’s ~$8,000 Seagull have exposed a price gap in the market. U.S. automakers will either have to drive down costs (perhaps via their own partnerships in China or new supply deals) or risk ceding ground. For critical minerals, this trend has a dual edge: it threatens Western carmakers even as it could spur more localized battery supply chains (for instance, Chinese firms might build battery plants in North America to avoid tariffs). Either way, the EV supply chain is becoming ever more globally entwined, blurring the line between foreign and domestic when it comes to sourcing lithium, nickel or rare earth magnets.

Europe, too, is rewriting its playbook to secure strategic minerals. After 25 years of talks, EU member states approved a landmark free trade accord with Mercosur this month – explicitly to “secure access to critical minerals” and offset China. The deal, set to be signed on January 17, will slash import tariffs and give Europe privileged access to South America’s vast lithium, copper, nickel and rare earth reserves. European officials argue that partnering with resource-rich democracies like Brazil is vital for the clean-energy transition (Brazil, for example, holds 90% of the world’s niobium and is a rising lithium supplier). Brussels also inked a cooperation agreement with Japan this week to coordinate investment and financing for mineral supply chains. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Japan’s industry minister and an EU commissioner affirmed they’ll “accelerate collaboration” – across both public and private sectors – to diversify supplies of rare earths and other materials away from China’s grip. Yet even as Europe reduces one dependency, another persists uncomfortably: Russian nuclear fuel. A Financial Times investigation found that nearly four years after the Ukraine invasion, Russia still supplies about 23% of Europe’s enriched uranium for power reactors. Western fuel executives warned that cheap Russian uranium and a lack of political will in the EU risk locking Europe into this strategic dependency for decades. While the U.S. has banned Russian nuclear imports effective 2028, the EU’s proposed ban is stalled by internal divisions (Hungary and others rely on Rosatom’s fuel and oppose cutting ties). This split was evident as some EU states quietly stockpile Russian fuel rods for their Soviet-designed reactors, even as countries like Sweden have eliminated Russian uranium from their supply. The EU’s dilemma over uranium parallels its past reliance on Russian gas – underlining that energy security and mineral security are now two sides of the same coin. It also highlights why Europe is racing to develop alternate sources, from funding uranium enrichment capacity in-house to supporting mining projects in Africa and Latin America.

Finally, on the metals front in the Americas, there was a notable investment in copper. Mitsubishi Corporation (TYO: 8058) agreed to spend nearly $600 million for a 30% stake in the Copper World mine in Arizona, a major new project by Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE: HBM). The deal, closed earlier this month, will make Copper World one of the largest U.S. copper producers by 2029 and boost Hudbay’s output by over 50%. It’s a striking example of Asian capital (in this case Japanese) helping develop American critical mineral assets. Mitsubishi’s investment will fund the mine’s final feasibility studies and initial construction, and in return the Japanese trading house secures a long-term supply of “Made in America” copper for the clean-energy supply chain. The partnership was lauded by Hudbay as a “long-term strategic” alignment that validates the project’s value. It also dovetails with Japan’s broader critical minerals strategy: Tokyo has been striking deals from Canada to Africa to ensure access to battery metals and rare earths, often teaming up with western allies. As for copper, demand is projected to soar (for electrification infrastructure, EVs and beyond), so securing new sources in politically stable regions is paramount. We see similar logic in other tie-ups, like BHP in Ecuador or Rio Tinto in Serbia; this week’s Arizona deal stands out because it directly strengthens a North American supply hub with foreign financing.

Across all these developments – U.S. public investment in mines, Chinese financing blitzes, trade alliances, and corporate mergers – the through-line is unmistakable. Critical minerals are now treated as strategic assets on par with oil. Governments are taking equity stakes and striking diplomatic accords once reserved for energy security. Companies are restructuring themselves to offer end-to-end supply chains outside of China. And new policies, from export controls to price supports, are rewriting the rules of global trade for metals. This past week’s cascade of news underscores an emerging consensus: the road to net-zero and advanced manufacturing runs through mines and mineral processing plants. Whether it’s rare earth magnets for fighter jets, lithium for batteries, or uranium for reactors, control of these inputs is shaping up to be a defining factor in economic and national security. The world’s major powers clearly recognize this – and they are acting with urgency, each in their own way, to ensure they won’t be left behind in the new resource race. In the process, the century-old resource order (long dominated by oil and gas geopolitics) is rapidly evolving. Critical Minerals have taken center stage, and the events of this week show that the scramble to secure them is only accelerating.

These forces now define what the Critical Minerals Institute describes as the New Critical Minerals Economy — an environment shaped less by geology than by policy, security considerations, and strategic alignment, and one that will increasingly determine how capital, industry, and governments interact across the global minerals landscape. CMI Summit V: The New Critical Minerals Economy will take place May 13–14, 2026, in Toronto. Click here to register or email tracy@criticalmineralsinstitute.com for further information.

Many of them would say the sooner the world can go all-zero emissions, the better off we’ll all be, and that hybrids risk prolonging our collective dependence on fossil fuels.

As for me, I’m generally pro-hybrid: I say don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and if buyers want electrified power, less gas use and fewer emissions, they should go for it. But I’ve never been a huge fan of plug-in hybrids—I’d rather own a car I have to plug in or fill with gas, but doing both feels rather cumbersome. Still, PHEVs make a ton of sense for a certain segment of buyers, even if that segment hasn't been very large in America.

But as the EV and regulatory landscape shifts, the case for PHEVs might not be as strong as it once was.

25%: Think The U.S. EV Market Is Weird? Plug-In Hybrids Are Even More Uncertain

PHEV EV Drivetrain

I do get the argument for PHEVs. You get a small amount of electric range for most of your daily driving because you plug in the car while it's parked, then you use the gas engine for your longer trips. Unfortunately, studies show many drivers just don’t plug them in, negating many of their benefits.

Now, something unexpected is happening in the U.S. market. Not only did EV tax credits go away last year, but they also vanished for PHEVs. And so did stricter fuel economy rules pushing automakers to build more efficient and electrified cars. At the same time, if you’re open to a plug-in car, a modern, 300-plus-mile EV may negate the case for some PHEVs entirely.

This has automakers and analysts asking: Are PHEVs even worth it anymore? That leads to this great Automotive News story today. Some highlights:

Instead, automakers are increasingly turning to traditional hybrids that don’t have a plug and extended-range electric vehicles, which also ease anxiety about needing to recharge but with less cost and complexity.

Long after General Motors introduced Americans to the segment with the 2011 Chevrolet Volt, consumers still haven’t shown much interest. Plug-in hybrids were less than 2% of the new-vehicle market last year, according to S&P Global Mobility registration data through November.

Automakers have used plug-in hybrid vehicles to help comply with emissions regulations set by California and, to a lesser extent, the federal government.

But without regulations and tax incentives pushing the segment toward that level of popularity, some automakers are deciding there isn’t enough demand to keep developing and building plug-in hybrids.

“It’s still confusing for consumers, and they don’t really fully get it,” said Stephanie Brinley, associate director of AutoIntelligence for S&P Global Mobility. “And the changes in regulatory requirements and compliance do mean it’s less necessary, or it’s a solution that you don’t necessarily need to push as hard.”

That story is worth a read in full. It’s like the current “EV slowdown” situation on steroids—except that automakers are probably less under the gun to make PHEVs as a long-term mobility solution, whereas most experts believe electric cars will have a more permanent place in the automotive landscape.

So automakers are now taking different approaches to their PHEV plans. Stellantis? Dead. General Motors? Studying the matter, and plans to release some in 2027. Toyota and Volvo? Much higher hopes, especially since they know PHEVs are a bigger deal in Europe and China.

The industry may soon move on to EREVs, or extended-range electric vehicles—EVs with gas engines as generators. But if automakers couldn’t solve the PHEV user confusion problem, how would they do the same for those cars? I haven’t heard a great answer there yet.

50%: The Rivian R2 Arrives This Spring. Prototypes Are Road-Tripping Right Now

Rivian R2 Manufacturing Validation Build

Photo by: Rivian

The Rivian R2 is getting its kicks on Route 66.

The electric automaker announced in a blog post Friday that “validation build” vehicles—essentially, advanced prototypes—have set off on a cross-country journey across the iconic Chicago-to-California freeway route. (Fun fact: Route 66 is now a historic designation, not an active part of the “official” highway system, as has been the case since the 1980s. I didn’t know that!)

Rivian’s post also gave us a clearer idea of when customers can expect the R2, and it’s coming soon:

These early builds represent an important phase in development where we validate and perfect the quality of vehicles coming off the line at our factory. As we head toward the start of production in spring, this continuous feedback loop of testing, refining and updating ensures we are delivering repeatable quality at scale building vehicles that exceed our customers’ expectations.

The R2 we drove across Route 66 is one of many early builds already out for real-world validation. The information we gather goes directly back to our engineering, software and manufacturing teams for optimizations. Every piece of information brings us a step closer to delivering R2 to customers.

The Rivian R2 is quite possibly the biggest EV debut of 2026. It’s a smaller, more affordable and more profitable electric SUV from Rivian that also boasts a considerably more advanced platform than the original R1S and R1T. Rivian has touted a $45,000 price tag for the EV, although Launch Edition models are expected to be more expensive.

Sales of the R2 are widely seen as crucial to Rivian’s ability to thrive as a mainstream, volume automaker—much as Tesla once achieved with the Model 3 and Model Y. And with Tesla losing interest in the EV field to focus on Robotaxis and robotics, Rivian is hoping the R2 can pick up the slack.

75%: On Tesla’s Earnings Call Wednesday, Investors Want Robotaxi Progress

Speaking of Tesla, its fourth-quarter and full-year-2025 earnings call happens on Wednesday. EV sales—still its core business—were down for the first time in a long time last year as Tesla handed its sales crown to BYD, but CEO Elon Musk is as adamant as ever that the future isn’t in builing cars anyway, but in autonomous driving.

Tesla has removed safety drivers from some of its Robotaxi vehicles in Austin and it hopes to expand that service more throughout the U.S. this year. Is that enough to keep investors happy, and to maintain Tesla’s sky-high stock price? Reuters explains:

But much of Tesla's $1.49 trillion market value rests on Musk's vision for self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

""Investors are largely looking past the near-term fundamentals. Market sentiment is being driven by Tesla's broader autonomy ambitions, including progress on the robotaxi platform and anticipation of the Cybercab entering full production in 2026,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, who personally holds Tesla shares.

With ""earnings likely to look soft, keeping the narrative firmly anchored on future growth is crucial in supporting Tesla's still-lofty valuation,"" he said.

Tesla's profit margins—the fact that it can make a profit on EVs—has long been core to its investor appeal, but this year the focus could turn to sales, after two years of decline. Wall Street broadly expects Tesla to return to deliveries growth in 2026, with about an 8% rise.

""The key signal for 2026 is that Tesla is intentionally trading near-term automotive margin for fleet scale since Elon understands that the value of the platform is not maximizing per-unit vehicle profitability today but maximizing the installed base that can later be monetized through autonomy and software,"" said Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities.

As I’ve written before, there are two distinct companies in play here: Tesla and $TSLA. One is an electric car company that earns its profits selling electric cars while making huge investments into autonomous vehicle technology.

The other is a $1.41 trillion market cap robotics and AI company that just hasn’t delivered on that stuff quite yet, but (hopefully) will someday.

Will we see an explanation of the roadmap to get there on Wednesday, or just more hype?

January 26, 2025

Published as part of The Headwaters Report

This article will provide an overview of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) hydropower licensing process, focusing on leverage points for Tribal engagement. Following a brief introduction on the relationship between Tribal Nations, hydropower dams, and FERC licensing, the first section provides a general description of FERC’s authority and structure, followed by a second section outlining the timeline of a FERC hydropower licensing process and how Tribal Nations can participate in these processes. The third section highlights several strategies for protecting Tribal rights and resources. The final section briefly addresses other important federal and state agencies involved in FERC licensing proceedings and how Tribal Nations may work with those agencies to accomplish their goals. This overview is not intended to discuss all the opportunities and challenges facing Tribal Nations in hydropower licensing processes, but instead to provide a starting point for Tribal Nations seeking to engage.

Introduction:

The same water resources that are sacred to Tribal Nations are often impacted by hydroelectric power projects such as hydropower dams and pumped storage projects. These projects have decimated salmon runs and disrupted other ecosystem functions on Tribal homelands by degrading water quality and blocking fish passage outright. Although hydroelectric energy has long been touted as a “clean” energy, hydropower projects have devastated Tribal Nations’ treaty-protected rights and resources—particularly salmon and other endangered fish species runs. Notably, fish runs on the Columbia, Snake, and Klamath Rivers in the Northwest plummeted after significant hydroelectric projects were built on those rivers. And over 1 million acres of Tribal lands have been flooded over 1.1 million acres by hundreds of dams built for hydropower and irrigation, displacing Tribal communities and destroying access to their traditional hunting and fishing grounds.

Hydropower project design has advanced to reduce some of these impacts, including by eliminating the need for dams, improving fish passage, and creating flexibility in dam management to ensure sufficient, consistent flows for all stages of the fish life cycle. Hydroelectric energy production does not inherently run counter to Tribal interests, and some Tribal Nations own and manage hydropower projects that provide electricity and revenue for their communities. But Tribal Nations have also spent decades advocating for protection of their Tribal resources in the face of unchecked public and private hydropower development in their watersheds and have consistently advocated for protection of their Tribal resources.

All non-federal hydroelectric power projects in the United States are permitted and regulated by FERC under the Federal Power Act (FPA).[1] These projects make up the majority of hydropower capacity in the country.[2] As sovereign governments with legal rights in FERC hydropower licensing processes, Tribal Nations can influence current management and operations and help shape the future of hydroelectric energy development in the United States.

Nearly 40% of all existing FERC licensed hydropower projects will be relicensed in the next decade.[3] Over the past several decades, relicensing has brought to the foreground many of the issues engrained in the early development of the federal hydropower permitting framework, including the complete exclusion of Tribal Nations from the original permitting decisions. As that regulatory framework has evolved to include Tribal involvement, Tribal Nations have engaged in successful campaigns to protect Tribal resources.

However, the process for hydropower licensing and relicensing is burdensome for Tribal Nations that seek to be involved. And recent changes eroding required environmental impacts analysis under the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), as well as a push by the Department of Energy (DOE) to reverse FERC’s 2024 policy decision to deny preliminary permits on Tribal land that are applied for without Tribal consent, threaten to make it significantly more difficult for Tribal Nations to protect their natural and cultural resources in hydropower permitting processes.

Section 1: Overview of FERC

Under the FPA, FERC possesses the exclusive authority to grant licenses permitting private and municipal developers to construct and operate hydropower projects. Many hydroelectric projects in the country were constructed between the 1940s and the 1960s,[4] and those operating permits were typically for between 30-50 years. For the past several decades, the bulk of FERC’s work on hydropower has been in permit relicensing processes, even as new projects continue to be developed.

FERC’s approach to licensing decisions is shaped by balancing requirements that can provide Tribal Nations with pathways to protect their rights and resources. The FPA was originally enacted to establish a federal regulatory framework for hydroelectric power projects. In 1986, the Electric Consumers Protection Act amended the FPA to require FERC to consider not only power production needs, but also the interests of fish, recreation, and environmental quality. When making licensing decisions FERC is now required to balance its purpose of energy production with “equal consideration to the purposes of energy conservation, the protection, mitigation of damage to, and enhancement of, fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat), the protection of recreational opportunities, and the preservation of other aspects of environmental quality.”[5] In its amended form, the FPA includes three significant sections for Tribal Nations—sections 4(e), 10(a), and 10(j). These sections, along with section 18, which deals with fishways, will be discussed in further detail below.

FERC operates as a federal agency made up of five commissioners who are appointed by the president. The agency is quasi-judicial, meaning its decision-making process is set up to resolve disputes among multiple parties, and those parties may challenge FERC decisions and seek review of FERC decisions by a federal court of appeals rather than going to a district court.

Because FERC operates as a quasi-judicial agency, it limits the communication that its decision-making staff can have with parties to a licensing proceeding. FERC’s goal in limiting communication is to ensure that all participants in a proceeding have access to the same information. In technical terms, this is called a restriction on ex-parte communication. This means that once a project proponent has submitted a licensing or relicensing application, FERC will restrict its staff from communicating with one party, without other participants present. Instead, FERC wants communication to be in writing and submitted to the publicly available docket.

All final decision-making authority technically rests with the commissioners. However, throughout a licensing process, lower-level FERC staff will make determinations and prepare documents, such as the environmental review documents under NEPA. Each project will have FERC staff assigned as project coordinators, and those project coordinators can answer procedural questions about the specific FERC process for that project. However, they cannot answer substantive questions, due to their “decisional” role once an application has been submitted.

Given the ex-parte communication constraints applied to FERC proceedings, it is important for Tribal Nations to know when and how they can communicate with FERC, as well as what resources are available to support Tribal engagement:

For additional questions from Tribal Nations, FERC’s Office of External Affairs interfaces with Tribal governments.

FERC’s Office of Public Participation can assist individual Tribal members with questions, and its staff are considered non-decisional.

FERC also established a Tribal Liaison position. The Tribal liaison position is intended to educate the Commission and Commission staff about Tribal governments and cultures, to serve as a guide for Tribal Nations navigating Commission processes, and to ensure that consultation requirements are met.

FERC has put together a Tribal Participation Guide for FERC Environmental Reviews resource that provides key information for Tribal Nations.

Section 2.1: How FERC Licensing Works

A project proponent can choose to follow one of three license processes: the Integrated License Process, the Traditional License Process, or the Alternative Licensing Process. Each process has different timelines, deadlines, and order of actions. The Integrated License Process (ILP) is the default, and this article focuses on the ILP framework, as defined in 18 C.F.R. Part 5.

The formal FERC licensing process is divided into two distinct periods: pre-application and post-filing activity. The pre-application period can be viewed as the information gathering phase, while the post filing period is FERC’s decision-making phase.

The pre-application period begins when the project proponent submits a notice to FERC proposing a new project or initiating the relicense of an existing project. The process next includes a scoping phase and a study plan determination phase to understand the impacts of the proposed project. Once there has been a determination on the study plan, the project proponent undertakes a two-year study process. Throughout this period, Tribal Nations, agencies, and all other members of the public can comment on study reports and otherwise engage in study development.

After completing the studies, the project proponent files a license application, which signals the start of the post-filing period. Once the application has been filed with FERC, Tribal Nations, agencies, and members of the public can submit proposed license conditions that create the rules for how the project proponent will construct and operate the project. FERC considers these license conditions when reviewing the project but is only obligated to accept those that are mandatory under sections 4(e) and 18 of the FPA. FERC then begins its environmental review under NEPA, which relies on the project proponent’s studies and information included in the application. The environmental review must include consideration of the draft license conditions. Next, FERC issues a final license order deciding whether to issue the license. If FERC does issue a license, the final order will include the conditions on that license.

In addition to the formal process discussed above, settlement negotiations can occur at any time before FERC issues a final license order.[6] Settlement negotiations allow the project proponent and other participants to come together and collaborate on an agreement for how the proposed project will operate. By engaging in the settlement process, Tribal Nations can have more influence on the license application and the conditions placed on the proposed project. A project proponent has an incentive to participate in the settlement process because certain federal and state agencies that have the authority to issue mandatory license conditions may come to the table for a more mutually beneficial outcome. Those agencies will be discussed in Sections 3 and 4, below. In general, FERC has a policy favoring settlement because it can resolve conflicts in highly contested hydropower licensing proceedings. However, Tribal Nations also face ongoing challenges with settlement inclusion and settlement enforcement.

A Recent Settlement on the Skagit: In December 2025, after over seven years, a comprehensive settlement was reached amongst the three Skagit River Tribes, Seattle City Light, the State Departments of Ecology and Fish & Wildlife, and federal regional leaders at the National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs and National Park Service Seattle for a new 50-year federal hydroelectric dam license for the City of Seattle’s three dams on the Skagit River. The settlement will “guide how Seattle will invest approximately $4 billion dollars in the Skagit River watershed for estuary and mainstem habitat restoration, flow protections for salmon at all life stages, adaptive management and scientific research, and fish passage.” (Statement from Chairman Edwards, Swinomish Indian Tribal Community.)

For each project, FERC creates an online docket that makes available all the applicant submissions, responses from FERC, and comments from Tribal Nations, agencies, any other participants, and the public. The docket system is difficult to navigate, unfortunately, but FERC provides instructions on how to file a comment. Alternatively, Tribal Nations can submit comments by mail.

Section 2.2: Tribal Engagement in FERC Proceedings

FERC’s Tribal consultation policy recognizes its trust responsibility to Tribal Nations.[7] The Policy requires the Commission to “assure that tribal concerns and interests are considered whenever the Commission’s actions or decisions have the potential to adversely affect Indian tribes, Indian trust resources, or treaty rights.”[8] And in addition to the provisions of the FPA, FERC licensing processes must also comply with other federal laws, including NEPA, the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA), each of which have its own Tribal consultation requirements.

During the pre-application phase, FERC is obligated to initiate consultation with affected Tribal Nations.[9] Tribal Nations also have the right to request government-to-government consultation by contacting FERC’s State, International, and Tribal Affairs Division, the point of contact listed in a letter or notice they received from FERC staff, or FERC’s Commissioners.[10] FERC outreach “extends both to federally recognized Tribal Nations located in the project area and to those Tribes with a historic interest in the project area,” and the consultation can address NEPA, NHPA, and other relevant analyses that FERC must consider in its decision-making.[11]

However, FERC’s restrictions on ex-parte communication create a major challenge for Tribal Nations seeking government-to-government consultation once an application has been submitted. As noted in Section 1, because FERC operates as a quasi-judicial agency, FERC limits the communication that its decision-making staff can have with Tribal Nations and all other parties to a licensing proceeding.

And even before a project proponent submits a final license application, FERC’s restrictions on consultation are poorly defined. Even in the pre-application phase, FERC will sometimes refuse to consult on issues that it believes are likely to be disputed later in the process. FERC’s policy does not define when it will deny a consultation request in the pre-application phase and instead decides on a “case-by-case” basis. The lack of guidance makes it difficult to predict when FERC may refuse to consult about an issue.

When to Seek Government-to-Government Consultation? It is important for Tribal Nations to be strategic about when they seek government-to-government consultation with FERC to make that consultation most effective. FERC typically does not intervene during the pre-application stage except as required by regulation to resolve disagreements and amend the approved study plan as appropriate, after the initial and updated study reports are filed. However, situations may arise in the pre-application phase where the project proponent is taking actions that actively harm Tribal interests. If the project proponent is acting in a way counter to a Tribal Nation’s interests and refusing to engage with the Tribal Nation, the Tribal Nation may consider requesting consultation with FERC.

Once a project proponent submits a final license application, FERC will no longer conduct government-to-government consultations with Tribal Nations off the record. FERC may agree to meet with a Tribal Nation, but anyone else will be allowed to come to the meeting, and FERC will issue a transcript or summary of the meeting for the public docket. However, Tribal Nations may still have off-the-record discussions with decisional FERC staff if they participate in the NEPA process as a cooperating agency. Regardless of the phase of the process, anyone can continue to ask FERC staff about procedural matters.

In addition to consultation, at every step of a FERC proceeding Tribal Nations can submit comments on the record. Tribal Nations should submit comments in response to specific documents during their relevant comment periods, but they can submit comments on the record at any point. Submitting comments on the record is critically important because FERC will respond to comments and make its decisions based on the information in the record. The Commission won’t necessarily raise an issue independently; for example, if a project proponent is failing to follow study requirements laid out in its approved study plan. There will typically be at least seven comment periods throughout the process. This provides an opportunity for Tribal Nations to participate in the licensing process but also requires substantial capacity.

Each licensing process will have different nuances that make engagement at individual stages particularly critical. Here we highlight three stages that are consistently important:

Study Plan.

FERC has its own requirements for studies, but by engaging in the process, Tribal Nations can seek to have additional studies included in the FERC-approved study plan, such as environmental, cultural resources, and economic studies. For example, FERC will not independently require studies considering climate change, its impact on future water flows, and how climate change might impact fish or the economic viability of a project.[12] This remains true even though changing weather patterns are impacting the reliability of hydropower projects. However, Tribal Nations can submit suggested studies on these topics and work with the project proponent to include them in the proposed study plan.

The project proponent submits a study plan to FERC in two phases: first a proposed plan that lays out the scope of the project proponent’s pre-application studies forming the basis for FERC’s environmental and cultural reviews of the proposed project, and second, a revised study plan that responds to comments. Commenting on both phases of the study plan provides an opportunity for Tribal Nations to shape the studies.

During the study period FERC often authorizes the project proponent to initiate informal consultation with Tribal Nations and other requisite state and federal agencies under Section 106 of the NHPA and Section 7 of the ESA, although FERC remains legally responsible for all findings and determinations.[13] Tribal Nations are not required to consult with the project proponent, but they may propose natural and cultural resource studies on the basis of FERC’s federal obligations.

Intervention and/or Participation as a Cooperating Agency under NEPA.

Tribal Nations and all other parties must formally intervene in a licensing proceeding to challenge a final FERC licensing decision. Intervention is required both to bring an agency rehearing challenge, and to bring a challenge in court. Intervention must occur during the 60-day comment period after an applicant submits a final license application.

A Note on Process: If a Tribal Nation is authorized by the Environmental Protection Agency to issue water quality certifications under Section 401 of the CWA, it may file a timely notice of intervention rather than a motion to intervene. See Section 3, Part B below for more information on the role of Section 401 certification in FERC hydropower processes.

Challenging a FERC decision starts with a request for an agency rehearing after FERC issues a final license order. If FERC denies the rehearing request, then an intervenor can appeal the decision to court.

Generally, intervention comes with no additional obligations other than a requirement to provide all other intervenors with copies of any documents filed on the FERC docket. However, due to the ex parte communication restrictions, FERC prevents agencies acting as cooperating agencies in the NEPA process, including Tribal Nations, from also intervening in the proceeding. Despite this general rule, in some instances, FERC will allow a Tribal Nation to participate as both an intervenor and a cooperating agency. However, Tribal staff working on the intervention must be separated from Tribal staff working on the environmental documents, and they cannot exchange information. FERC has discretion to approve or deny such an arrangement. Participating as both an intervenor and a cooperating agency gives Tribal Nations the maximum opportunity to advocate for their interests in the permitting process, but it requires significant capacity that many Tribal Nations do not have.

License Conditions.

License conditions place requirements on how a project proponent must construct, operate, and maintain their facility. License conditions are the primary method FERC uses to achieve its obligation to balance power and non-power values. FERC issues these conditions when it issues a license. Tribal Nations and all other participants can suggest conditions during the 60-day comment period after an applicant submits its final license [14]

License conditions will become the final rules that can serve to protect Tribal interests. For example, a license condition could protect fish passage by requiring fish screens on the intake or requiring ongoing fish monitoring. Some conditions can protect both fish and water quality through limits on the amount of flow that can be diverted or requiring a minimum amount of flow to be released. Additionally, for projects that create a reservoir, FERC typically requires the project proponent to construct recreational facilities such as a boat launch. Tribal Nations should submit proposed license conditions to ensure that the project proponent and FERC consider their interests and should engage with relevant agencies with license conditioning authority to advocate for conditions that protect Tribal interests.

License Conditions Can Lead to Salmon Restoration: In one of the most prominent campaigns to protect Tribal fishery resources through FERC relicensing, the Yurok, Karuk, Hoopa Valley, and Klamath Tribes fought for decades to restore salmon to the Klamath River and its tributaries. This effort ultimately led to the decommissioning and removal of four hydropower dams on the Klamath River. FERC issued the original dam licenses in 1954 which allowed the project to completely block salmon from returning to their spawning grounds in half of the basin. In the early 2000s, the project owner, PacifiCorp, filed a relicensing application. Right before the relicensing application was filed, the Klamath River experienced one of the largest fish kills recorded in United States history in 2002. After integrating recommendations from the Tribal Nations along the Klamath River, FERC’s draft license conditions demanded new provisions for fish passage.

PacifiCorp determined that implementing those conditions would require operating the project at a loss, which led the parties to begin settlement negotiations. Those negotiations eventually led to a revised proposal for the decommissioning and removal of dams. The dams were finally removed from the river in October 2024, freeing 420 miles of the Klamath River and its tributaries in California and Oregon. Since the dam removals, the Tribal Nations have seen the salmon return.

Amy Bowers Cordalis, Executive Director of the Ridges to Riffles Indigenous Conservation Group and former General Counsel for the Yurok Tribe, recently published a book on her family’s contributions to this campaign to restore the salmon, entitled The Water Remembers.

Section 3: Avenues for Protecting Tribal Rights and Resources

Despite the various requirements to consider Tribal interests at different stages of a FERC hydropower licensing process, the barriers to entry are high, and there are significant gaps in the statutory and regulatory framework that prevent Tribal Nations from protecting their rights and resources. Engaging in a licensing process requires substantial capacity and technical expertise. And even when Tribal Nations possess the necessary resources, it is difficult to know how to put them to efficient use. This section covers four opportunities that Tribal Nations should consider when deciding how to engage.

Mandatory Conditions Applying to Projects Located within a Federal Reservation

Section 4(e) of the FPA[15] places additional requirements on FERC when a proposed hydropower project is located within a federal reservation, including Tribal lands held in trust by the United States, or most federal public lands. To license a project on Tribal land, FERC must first find that the license will not “interfere or be inconsistent with the purposes for which the reservation was created or acquired.”[16] Second, FERC must include all the license conditions that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) determines are necessary for the “adequate protection and utilization of such reservation.”[17] The BIA has this authority because it is the agency within the Department of the Interior that manages Tribal trust lands on behalf of the federal government.

The BIA does not possess veto power for a hydropower license, but its conditions are mandatory. And unlike other participants, agencies with 4(e) authority can formally dispute the study plan determination, giving these agencies more sway at an earlier stage in the process.[18] The BIA Hydropower Compliance Program is the office that develops and imposes conditions deemed necessary for the adequate protection of Tribal rights and resources. Tribal Nations should reach out to this office as early as possible in the process to communicate the conditions that are necessary to protect their interests. Once a license has been issued, the BIA is also responsible for monitoring the project to ensure the final license conditions are implemented sufficiently to protect Tribal interests. The BIA also has limited funding available for Tribal technical support.

An additional challenge faced by Tribal Nations in Alaska is that only one out of 229 federally recognized Tribal Nations in the state has a reservation. This limits the potential for the 4(e) mandatory license conditions to be applicable for most Alaska Tribes.

Looking Forward: There has been at least one attempt to propose legislative reform shifting 4(e) mandatory conditioning authority away from the Department of the Interior and to the relevant Tribal Nation. The reform package did not pass, but these reforms remain potential solutions to some limitations that face Tribal Nations in FERC hydropower proceedings.

Leveraging Water Quality Certification under CWA Section 401(a)

FERC may only issue a hydropower license if the project is certified by the state or Tribal Nation with jurisdiction over the affected water body under CWA Section 401. If a Tribal Nation has “Treatment as a State” (TAS) authority under Section 401, FERC must include in its license any conditions that the Tribal Nation requires to certify that the project will not violate the applicable water quality standards.

More information on how a Tribal Nation obtains TAS jurisdiction under the CWA and what authority that grants Tribal Nations is available at An Introduction to the Clean Water Act.

If a Tribal Nation also has its own water quality standards under CWA Section 303, it may place conditions on the hydropower project based on those Tribally defined water quality standards, which may be set to protect ceremonial uses and culturally significant resources. A certification may establish a minimum flow schedule or flow storage or require certain types of fish passage. As with FPA Section 4(e) or 18 conditions, these are mandatory, and FERC may not amend or delete them from the license.

Protecting Properties of Traditional, Religious and Cultural Significance through NHPA Section 106

Prior to issuing a license, FERC is required to conduct an analysis under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).[19] This includes consulting with Tribal Nations to identify potentially affected properties of traditional, religious, and cultural significance, assessing the adverse effects of the proposed hydropower project on those properties, and developing and evaluating alternatives that could “avoid, minimize, or mitigate” those effects.

The project proponent assists FERC in meeting its obligations under Section 106 by following the applicable procedures.[20] However, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation’s Handbook on Consultation with Indian Tribes in the Section 106 Review Process states that “[e]ven when an Indian tribe agrees to coordinate with an applicant, the federal agency remains responsible for ensuring that the Section process is carried out properly, meeting the letter and spirit of the law, as well as resolving any issues or disputes.”

Under Section 106, FERC recognizes that Tribal Nations possess “special expertise” regarding the evaluation of these properties and how to resolve adverse effects to them. Participating as a consulting party in the Section 106 process is one way that Tribal Nations can seek to insert conditions or requirements into a hydropower license or can pursue an alternative binding commitment, such as a memorandum of agreement. Investing in the Section 106 process may also provide a Tribal Nation with more leverage to bring into settlement discussions.

Developing Comprehensive Plans for Affected Watersheds

Under Section 10(a) of the FPA,[21] FERC is required to consider how a proposed project fits within a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway based on equal consideration of both power and non-power values.[22] This includes the requirement to solicit and consider license conditions from Tribal Nations affected by the project.[23] Proposed licensing conditions submitted based on solicitation under Section 10(a) are not afforded any deference, but this clause provides a statutory mandate for Tribal involvement in FERC hydropower licensing processes. In addition, the project proponent’s application must include an explanation of whether the project would comply with any relevant comprehensive plan. If a Tribal Nation determines that the project would be inconsistent with such a plan, the project proponent must include that determination.[24]

Building on the statutory and regulatory language, FERC’s Tribal consultation policy explicitly requires the Commission to consider any comprehensive plans developed by Tribal Nations or inter-Tribal organizations for improving or conserving an affected waterway affected by the proposed project when evaluating a proposed hydroelectric project.[25] Thus, Tribal development of comprehensive plans for a waterway can help shape FERC’s analysis of a proposed project.

This section is far from exhaustive, and there are other ways for Tribal Nations to protect their resources during FERC proceedings that are not explored in depth below, including seeking protection through a “rights of nature” framework.

Section 4: Opportunities to Leverage Other Agencies

While FERC has the final say on whether to issue a license, other agencies have significant authority over the license conditions that FERC must include in a license. Tribal Nations can engage and coordinate directly with those agencies to share knowledge, and advocate for license conditions that protect Tribal interests.

Section 18: Mandatory Conditions Applying to Projects That May Affect Fish Passage

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) have the authority to issue mandatory license conditions that ensure “fishways” to ensure fish can safely travel up and downstream through the project.[26] These conditions are often called “fishway prescriptions” or “section 18 prescriptions,” in reference to a section of the Federal Power Act. [27] FERC does not have the discretion to change or reject these. [28]

Section 10(j): Requirement to Solicit Condition Recommendations from Other Agencies

Under Section 10(j) of the FPA,[29] FERC is required to include in any hydropower license conditions that “adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance, fish and wildlife” affected by the project. FERC is required to give deference to recommendations for these conditions from NMFS, USFWS, and State fish and wildlife agencies. The Commission is only allowed to reject these recommendations if it thinks they are inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or another law. [30] FERC is also required to work with agencies to resolve disagreements about their 10(j) recommendations, which may include convening a meeting or technical conference. If an agreement cannot be reached, FERC will publish its final decision rejecting the recommendations.

Dive Brief:

State utility regulators are urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to direct the Midcontinent Independent System Operator to hold a stakeholder process to determine how to allocate costs from power plants the U.S. Department of Energy orders to run past their planned retirements.

At the same time, the Sierra Club and five other groups asked DOE to reconsider its “emergency” orders directing Northern Indiana Public Service Co., a division of NiSource, and CenterPoint Energy to continue running three coal-fired units in Indiana totaling more than 950 MW. In the rehearing request — a possible precursor to a lawsuit — the groups contend MISO doesn’t face a resource adequacy emergency as DOE claims.

Operating NIPSCO’s Schahfer units 17 and 18 and CenterPoint’s Culley unit 2 for 90 days under the DOE orders will cost at least $20.6 million, according to a report Synapse Energy Economics prepared for the Sierra Club, the Environmental Law and Policy Center and Earthjustice. If DOE extends its 90-day orders, the units will require about $34 million in maintenance and environmental upgrade costs, the consulting firm said.

Dive Insight:

The filings at FERC from at least 10 states and at DOE are the latest steps related to the department’s efforts to use its emergency authority under the Federal Power Act’s section 202(c) to keep power plants from retiring.

DOE last year prevented six power plants totaling about 4,300 MW from retiring. Five of the power plants burn coal. They are in Colorado, Indiana, Michigan and Washington. DOE also ordered Constellation Energy to continue running two oil- and gas-fired units totaling 760 MW at its Eddystone plant in Pennsylvania. So far, DOE hasn’t let any of its 90-day orders for those power plants lapse.

The orders claim the regions where the plants are located face a severe power shortage that constitutes an emergency, necessitating the need to keep the plants online.

Lawsuits are pending in federal court to overturn some of those orders. In part, the suits say DOE failed to show there are emergencies affecting the power systems in the Upper Midwest or the Mid-Atlantic region.

Besides legal questions around DOE’s use of its emergency authority, one of the key questions is: who will pay to keep the power plants online?

Consumers Energy — the majority owner and operator of the 1,560-MW, coal-fired J.H. Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan — spent $164 million running the plant through its first 90-day order and part of the second one while incurring an $80 million loss, Synapse said, citing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

The Illinois Commerce Commission on Friday asked FERC to put a pause on CenterPoint’s request to recover its costs from ratepayers for keeping its Culley unit online to give MISO stakeholders time to vet a cost recovery mechanism.

FERC in mid-August rejected similar requests for a MISO stakeholder process to determine a cost allocation plan for the Campbell power plant. As a result, costs are set to be shared across MISO’s central and northern regions.

Since then, however, the circumstances have changed, according to the ICC.

“DOE’s emergency orders are becoming routine,” the utility regulators said. “It seems likely that current 202(c) orders will be extended and that more orders are likely to be issued, potentially for years. The likely frequency and length of these orders … is crucial in considering how to handle cost allocation for generating units that are unexpectedly and unnecessarily being retained on the system.”

The Organization of MISO States and the ICC made similar arguments at FERC in response to NIPSCO’s earlier request for cost recovery related to the DOE order on its Schahfer units.

“States must have a meaningful opportunity to evaluate impacts to their ratepayers and to represent those interests before the Commission reaches any final determination,” OMS said in a Jan. 20 filing at FERC.

If FERC routinely approves broad regional cost allocation for DOE’s emergency orders without showing the benefits from keeping the power plants online, utilities may be incentivized to speed up power plant retirements and “cash in” on shifting costs away from local customers and onto an 11-state region, OMS said.

“Under NIPSCO’s proposal, costs would be broadly allocated across MISO’s North and Central Subregions, including to customers and states for which no reliability benefit has been identified, including Indiana,” OMS said, noting that the PJM Interconnection had a stakeholder process to determine how to allocate costs from Constellation’s Eddystone units.

“That stakeholder-driven approach underscores a fundamental principle: meaningful engagement and transparent deliberation are essential before costs are imposed on customers, particularly where benefits are unclear or have not been demonstrated,” OMS said.

FERC should only approve a cost allocation plan that is based on “clear need and demonstrable benefits,” according to OMS. “Any such recovery must also include a detailed explanation of why existing MISO planning and cost allocation frameworks — designed precisely for evaluating regional needs and benefits — were inadequate or not followed.”

“OMS recognizes that the lack of a clear demonstration of need in DOE’s 202(c) orders has put the Commission in a position of having to approve cost allocation mechanisms where benefits may not exist or at best, are unclear,” the organization said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IyJhC9VkQ_83WIXj9pkLEqlQ7YjN-h2nA8BDpV1nStU/g:nowe:0:245/c:1280:723/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY2hhZmZlcl8yMTA1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-26 12:01:17.552642

Under the previous tax regime, businesses were forced to amortize their Research and Development (R&D) expenses over five years rather than deducting them immediately.
This new provision allows companies to fully and immediately deduct 100% of their domestic R&D costs—including software development—in the year they are incurred.
Not only did it restore R&D expensing, but it also reinstated 100% bonus depreciation for new manufacturing facilities and equipment.
The market’s reaction was swift; the industrial sector posted a 16% gain in 2025, marking its best year in a generation.","As of late January 2026, the United States is witnessing its most significant industrial transformation since the post-war era. What started as a policy debate over technical tax accounting has ballooned into a full-scale ""Manufacturing Renaissance,"" fueled by the landmark One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) signed into law in mid-2025. By reinstating immediate R&D expensing and introducing unprecedented incentives for domestic production, the federal government has effectively supercharged the balance sheets of American industrial giants.

The immediate implications are visible in both the skylines of the Rust Belt and the ticker tapes of Wall Street. For the first time in decades, the industrial sector has become a primary driver of stock market growth, outperforming even the technology sector in several months of late 2025. With an estimated $3.5 trillion in new manufacturing investments announced since the bill’s passage, the shift from a service-led economy back toward a high-tech industrial powerhouse appears not just possible, but inevitable.

The Legislative Spark: From Amortization to Acceleration

The catalyst for this surge was the resolution of a long-standing ""innovation tax"" that had plagued U.S. companies since 2022. Under the previous tax regime, businesses were forced to amortize their Research and Development (R&D) expenses over five years rather than deducting them immediately. This changed on July 4, 2025, when the OBBBA was signed, introducing Section 174A. This new provision allows companies to fully and immediately deduct 100% of their domestic R&D costs—including software development—in the year they are incurred.

The timeline leading to this moment was fraught with political gridlock. Following the failure of the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act in 2024, the manufacturing sector faced a ""capital crunch"" that threatened to derail the reshoring movement. However, the OBBBA went much further than its predecessors. Not only did it restore R&D expensing, but it also reinstated 100% bonus depreciation for new manufacturing facilities and equipment. This means a company building a $2 billion semiconductor plant or an automated assembly line can now write off the entire investment in year one, drastically increasing the net present value of domestic projects.

Key stakeholders, including the National Association of Manufacturers and major labor unions, have hailed the move as a ""Buy American"" masterstroke. By maintaining a 15-year amortization penalty for R&D conducted outside the U.S., the law has created a powerful financial gravity that is pulling technical teams and high-value laboratory work back to American soil. The market’s reaction was swift; the industrial sector posted a 16% gain in 2025, marking its best year in a generation.

The Winners' Circle: Industrial Titans Unleashed

The most profound impact of the tax changes is seen in the financial performance of R&D-heavy industrial leaders. GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) has emerged as a poster child for the renaissance, with its stock price surging over 60% in the last year. The company’s ability to immediately expense development costs for its next-generation engine programs has freed up billions in cash flow, allowing for record-breaking capital expenditures and share buybacks.

In the semiconductor space, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has utilized the expanded Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit—which the OBBBA increased from 25% to 35%—to offset the massive costs of its new domestic ""mega-fabs."" Analysts estimate that for a facility like Intel’s $40 billion site in New Mexico, these tax provisions could reduce the net cost by as much as $12 billion. Meanwhile, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) is seeing a significant EPS boost, as its customers in the construction and mining sectors take advantage of bonus depreciation to modernize their fleets with new, high-margin machinery.

Other major beneficiaries include:

Eaton Corporation (NYSE: ETN): Benefiting from the ""AI buildout,"" Eaton is seeing a flood of orders for electrical infrastructure, supported by OBBBA incentives for domestic transformer production.

Rockwell Automation (NYSE: ROK): As manufacturers rush to automate their new U.S.-based factories to offset labor costs, Rockwell’s digital manufacturing solutions have seen a double-digit spike in demand.

Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE: EMR): Despite global trade headwinds, Emerson has maintained strong margins by leveraging tax credits to optimize its own domestic footprint and cater to the booming energy-tech sector.

A Structural Shift in Global Competition

The significance of these tax changes extends far beyond corporate balance sheets; it marks a fundamental pivot in U.S. economic policy. By shifting the interest deductibility limits (Section 163(j)) back to an EBITDA-based calculation in 2025, the OBBBA has allowed capital-intensive manufacturers to take on more debt for expansion at a lower net cost. This moves the U.S. closer to the ""industrial policy"" models seen in East Asia, though with a distinctly American focus on private-sector incentives rather than direct state ownership.

This event fits into a broader trend of ""de-globalization"" and national security-focused economics. The ""Foreign Penalty"" within Section 174 has created a ripple effect among competitors. European and Asian manufacturers are now facing a choice: keep their R&D hubs at home and lose the American tax advantage, or relocate their most innovative divisions to the U.S. This ""brain drain"" toward the American industrial sector has already sparked trade tensions with the EU, which has characterized the OBBBA as a protectionist move similar to the early days of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Historically, this period is being compared to the industrial surge of the late 1940s. However, the 2026 version is uniquely digital. The integration of AI into manufacturing—which is expected to grow by 60% this year—is being directly subsidized by these R&D provisions, creating a ""smart manufacturing"" ecosystem that is increasingly difficult for overseas competitors to replicate.

The Road Ahead: Opportunities and Gridlocks

In the short term, the market expects the industrial sector to continue its upward trajectory as more companies ""catch up"" on their 2022–2024 tax filings and deploy the resulting cash into new projects. However, a major strategic pivot is already underway: companies are shifting their focus from pure capacity expansion to ""labor-saving innovation."" Because the U.S. is facing a severe shortage of skilled tradespeople—electricians, welders, and HVAC technicians—the next wave of CapEx will likely be dominated by robotics and autonomous logistics.

Market participants should be wary of potential ""pinch points."" The same tax breaks that are driving factory construction are also fueling the AI data center boom, leading to a fierce competition for energy grid access and electrical components. If the U.S. power grid cannot keep pace with the demand from these new industrial and tech hubs, the ""Renaissance"" could hit a physical ceiling.

Looking toward 2027 and 2028, the sustainability of this trend will depend on whether the federal government can address these infrastructure and labor bottlenecks. Investors should watch for strategic moves by companies like Eaton and GE Vernova as they attempt to modernize the grid.

Final Assessment: A New Era for Investors

The return to immediate R&D expensing has done more than just simplify the tax code; it has signaled to the world that the United States is serious about reclaiming its industrial crown. The OBBBA of 2025 has created a virtuous cycle where tax savings are reinvested into high-tech domestic facilities, which in turn drive demand for automation, power management, and advanced machinery.

For investors, the key takeaway is that the ""industrial"" label is no longer synonymous with ""slow growth."" In this new environment, companies like Intel, GE, and Rockwell Automation are behaving more like high-growth tech firms, with R&D-driven flywheels and significant government tailwinds. The sector is no longer just a defensive play; it is the engine of the current market cycle.

Moving forward, the market will be hyper-focused on quarterly CapEx announcements and the ""domestic content"" ratios in corporate earnings reports. As the tax benefits of the OBBBA fully bake into the numbers over the coming months, the gap between domestic-focused winners and globalized laggards will only continue to widen.

Commercial and industrial customers will see their monthly bills drop between 9.6% and 15.8% when compared to January.
Duke spokeswoman Aly Raschid said the company’s storm recovery plan helped them get the power back on as soon as possible following the 2024 hurricanes.
“Between our improvements to our plants in Bartow and St. Pete, we were able to shave off about $10 from all of our customers’ bills,” Raschid said.
“Duke has already fully recovered their storm costs, and that is why they need to stop collecting at the end of the month.","If you're a Duke Energy customer, your electricity bill could be cheaper starting next month.

But it's not because costs are coming down.

The reduction comes after the company received enough money from its customers to cover its $1.1 billion storm recovery effort.

According to the company, residential customers will receive about $33 off per 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) used.

Commercial and industrial customers will see their monthly bills drop between 9.6% and 15.8% when compared to January.

Moreover, residential electricity bills will be lower by an additional $11 per 1,000 kWh used starting in March, resulting in a total cutback of $44 compared to January.

Duke spokeswoman Aly Raschid said the company’s storm recovery plan helped them get the power back on as soon as possible following the 2024 hurricanes.

“We bring in a ton of resources to help us get the lights back on for our customers,” she said. “We’ve brought in crews from all over the country that we have to house and feed, and that’s where all of our costs came from. We were constantly monitoring to see where we were in the recovery process, and we found that we had enough funds to remove the cost, so we did that immediately.”

Last year, the company announced improvements to its infrastructure throughout the state.

“Between our improvements to our plants in Bartow and St. Pete, we were able to shave off about $10 from all of our customers’ bills,” Raschid said.

According to the company, those upgrades, along with $65 million in Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, will help lower customer bills even further in the future.

However, Food and Water Watch Florida State Director Brooke Ward said the decision to end the storm surcharge was not voluntary.

“Duke has already fully recovered their storm costs, and that is why they need to stop collecting at the end of the month. Otherwise, they would overcollect,” Ward said. “Duke bills are still up by over $25 per month from what they were five years ago, a 44% increase between December 2019 and June 2025, and they plan to increase rates again in the next year.”

Ward said she believes the decision followed a November hearing in which state regulators ordered Duke to end the charge early.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/850b98d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2009x1055+0+37/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6f%2F9c%2F10347443469cb8386ecc4a3212dc%2Fduke-energy.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:02:07.610999

From Native Americans to hunters of today, hunting has provided sustenance and connected people to the land. For nearly 100 years, hunters have played a vital role in funding the conservation of wildlife habitat through taxes on firearms, ammunition and archery equipment. Hunters brought in nearly $1 billion dollars in funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2025.

Despite this, many wildlife species are in decline. For example, in Idaho, you’ll find that even mule deer are experiencing a population decline in the state. There are similar stories of species, game and non-game, declining in states across the country.

It’s no surprise then that hunting business, clubs and more joined us in supporting a bill in Congress to conserve and enhance wildlife corridors.

Last fall, several of us at Environment America began reaching out to hunting related businesses and organizations to gauge their support for wildlife corridors. We found widespread support for a bipartisan wildlife corridors bill. In total, 82 outdoorsmen and women, outdoor recreation businesses and conservationists signed a letter to Congress urging passage of the Wildlife Movement Through Partnerships Act.

Sportsman’s clubs, rod and gun clubs, outfitters and guides, gun shops, and the like signed the letter to Congress asking it to ensure the survival of species and the heritage of the great outdoors for all Americans.

Wildlife populations declining

Wildlife populations have experienced a dramatic decline and continue to face significant threats throughout the U.S. In North America, monitored wildlife populations decreased 39 percent from 1970 to 2020. Habitat loss remains a huge challenge.

From elk to trout, panthers to mule deer, pronghorn to black bears, and more, animals need room to roam so they can migrate, hunt, graze and mate. They need habitat to support their movement and fewer barriers along migration routes.

To help support the conservation needs of wildlife, including connecting and protecting habitats, bi-partisan legislation called the Wildlife Movement Through Partnerships Act was introduced in 2025. The legislation introduced by Republican Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana and Democratic Representative Don Beyer of Virginia would conserve, restore and enhance habitat, migration routes and connectivity for wildlife all across this country.

In addition to habitat conservation along migration routes, the bill would fund mapping of wildlife movements and increased coordination and technical assistance between state, federal and tribal wildlife management agencies for the benefit of wildlife.

Based on some phone calls we made, we’re convinced that there’s deep support from the hunting and outdoors community, and we hope their support will spark action in Congress.

Investor attention has turned to regulatory shifts as China steers toward a more liberalised commodity futures market. In this context, china to open nickel and lithium futures to foreign investors is emerging as a crucial development. Furthermore, evolving market dynamics and global integration are making it imperative to understand how reform impacts pricing and risk management.

Investor sentiment is also influenced by emerging trends such as china demand trends and shifting market fundamentals. Additionally, policy changes have led to recalibrated investment flows globally.

Why Are Nickel and Lithium Strategic to China and the World?

Nickel and lithium are the backbone of the energy transition. They are vital for powering electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy storage, and next-generation battery chemistries. Their importance is amplified by China’s leading position in these value chains.

• China’s share of global battery manufacturing is projected at roughly 60-70% in 2025.

• Nickel’s role is growing, with global demand expected to reach 3.5 million tonnes by 2030.

• Lithium demand is outpacing supply forecasts with 1.5 million tonnes of LCE required annually by 2030.

• China’s consumption footprint accounts for 50-60% of global nickel production and 60% of lithium output each year.

These commodities remain tethered to international pricing benchmarks such as London and index-referenced contracts. Consequently, policymakers and industry players are reassessing strategies to mitigate price shocks.

How Have China’s Previous Commodity Futures Reforms Fared?

China’s commodity market opening is not new. However, previous attempts encountered structural headwinds. For instance, despite incremental progress, legacy pricing norms remain resilient.

Timeline of Key Reforms:

• Dalian Iron Ore Futures (2018) – modest foreign participation.

• SHFE Int’l Crude Oil Futures (2018) – moderate foreign share.

• SHFE Int’l Copper Futures (2020) – foreign volume below 30%.

Underlying issues have included capital controls, operational mismatches, and currency risks. Moreover, investors often cite US-China trade impacts when discussing market constraints.

While progress is evident, legacy benchmarks such as LME Nickel or ICE Brent Crude continue to dominate global pricing.

How Does Expanding Futures Market Access Impact Price Discovery and Global Trade?

Recent regulatory changes promise to reshape participation models and the mechanics of price discovery considerably. For instance, on 26 January 2026, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) designated 14 contracts—including nickel and lithium carbonate— for foreign participation.

What Are the Regulatory Changes Underway?

Both the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) and Guangzhou Futures Exchange (GFEX) are making operational upgrades. These include:

• Allowing foreign currency-posted collateral for yuan trades.

• Introduction of a global-style margin requirement.

• Streamlined onboarding processes and enhanced audit mechanisms.

Although neither the precise start date nor the complete contract list has been disclosed, market participants eagerly await the reforms. In addition, innovative strategies such as China’s mining strategy hint at broader ambitions.

What Mechanisms Enable Foreign Participation?

Regulatory innovations underpinning market liberalisation include:

• Collateral flexibility: Using major currencies as collateral.

• Risk management alignment: Harmonised margin calls and cross-border reporting.

• Evolving capital controls: Gradual relaxation without full convertibility.

These measures are expected to bolster trust among international participants. Notably, foreign nickel and lithium futures provide useful context regarding newly available hedging options.

What Are the Potential Effects on Commodity Pricing Power and Market Liquidity?

The impact of opening China’s futures markets depends on the pace at which these platforms match Western exchanges across several dimensions. China’s domestic exchanges must now contend with established players renowned for their liquidity and robust risk management frameworks.

How Do Domestic and International Exchanges Compete?

Foreign institutional investors tend to gravitate towards venues with:

• Ample liquidity and tight bid-ask spreads.

• Transparent and predictable regulations.

• Robust clearinghouse protections.

Meanwhile, markets such as SHFE and GFEX are rapidly adapting with new technical reforms. This is highlighted by their increasing influence in price discovery and risk management practices. As market evolution continues, additional insights such as lithium industry innovations further enhance strategic understanding.

What Could Dampen China’s Efforts to Dislodge Existing Benchmarks?

Factors that may dilute China’s ambitions include:

• Capital convertibility challenges: Investors may face delays in repatriating capital.

• Concerns about transparency: Building trust in new governance structures takes time.

• Operational interoperability issues: Discrepancies with Western exchange systems can reduce arbitrage efficiency.

These challenges underscore why, despite the momentum, reforms must address entrenched market practices.

How Might These Reforms Change Risk Management for Miners and Manufacturers?

Global participants will soon gain new hedging tools through enhanced market access. For instance, offshore miners and OEMs can directly engage with SHFE and GFEX contracts. China to open nickel and lithium futures to foreign investors is set to widen their risk management options, effectively linking physical operations with financial hedging strategies.

Proposed innovations include:

• Direct participation in newly updated futures contracts.

• Flexibility to post collateral in widely traded currencies such as USD, EUR, and HKD.

• New supply contract structures referencing domestic price benchmarks.

These measures are designed to lower hedging costs and improve operational synchronisation. Notably, nickel’s strategic role is fundamental to these changes, as it reinforces the importance of aligning operational cash flows with market expectations.

Step-by-Step: Foreign Access & Hedging

Account opening: Register with SHFE or GFEX following KYC/AML protocols.

Fund transfer: Remit acceptable foreign currency to a designated clearing bank.

Collateral posting: Margin is calculated using daily FX rates and published haircut percentages.

Execution: Engage in futures positions electronically.

Monitoring: Track positions and margin calls in real time.

Repatriation: Withdraw capital, subject to compliance reviews.

What Does This Mean for Global Supply Chains and Investment Flows?

Enhanced market access may redefine raw material sourcing by reducing pricing disparities between domestic and international markets. Improved transparency drives more unified pricing in long-term agreements and spot contracts. For instance, greater integration on SHFE and GFEX will likely encourage structured hedging for battery-grade nickel and lithium.

How Could Enhanced Market Access Redefine Raw Material Sourcing?

Future-based pricing models might replace conventional spot models. Benefits include:

• Reduction in pricing disparities.

• Increased transparency for exporters and importers alike.

• New commercial templates tailored for hedging critical inputs.

This evolution is expected to streamline negotiations and reduce supply chain volatility, ultimately benefitting both mining and manufacturing sectors.

What Role Do Policy Shifts Play in Attracting Global Institutional Capital?

Policy liberalisation has historically attracted significant capital inflows. For example, emerging markets like Brazil and India witnessed surges in foreign direct investments following deregulation. Similarly, China is opening its futures markets to unlock secondary market depth and primary investment in upstream production.

Investors must monitor regulatory developments closely. Moreover, overseas lithium market conditions also provide insight into how these policies might evolve.

Frequently Asked Questions about China’s Nickel and Lithium Futures Market Liberalisation

How will foreign investors physically access and settle trades on Chinese exchanges?

Foreign investors can register directly or via global affiliates. They need to fulfil KYC/AML requirements and post approved currency collateral. Settlement occurs in CNY, with repatriation options determined by regulatory guidelines.

What protections exist for overseas capital in China’s futures markets?

Capital is segregated within advanced clearing systems, and margin protocols align with global best practices. However, regulatory risks still exist, especially in times of rapid policy change.

Could this shift affect global electric vehicle and battery supply chain costs?

Yes, over time, as Chinese benchmarks gain traction, price negotiations may increasingly reference yuan-denominated contracts. This shift could impact procurement strategies and contract stability for manufacturers worldwide.

Conclusion: Will China Set the Future Agenda for Critical Minerals Trading?

China’s strategy is not merely about pricing influence. It represents a broader integration plan wherein china to open nickel and lithium futures to foreign investors serves as a cornerstone of this ambition. In addition, sustained regulatory reform and deepening market liquidity are pivotal to realising these goals.

Practical challenges remain, including capital controls and exchange-rate volatility. Nonetheless, if robust international standards are maintained, China’s exchanges could soon serve as credible alternatives for risk management and pricing discovery. Ultimately, stakeholders must adapt to a dual-benchmark environment that blends legacy platforms with innovative Chinese mechanisms.

China to open nickel and lithium futures to foreign investors marks a strategic milestone in global commodity trading. With consistent implementation, market participants may benefit from enhanced risk management, improved pricing transparency, and dynamic investment flows.

Installations passed 100 GW for the first time – a milestone achieved even as some of the largest energy markets grappled with significant policy shifts.

China, for instance, removed the mandate to install storage with new renewables. Instead, they will be relying on market mechanisms, introducing uncertainty into future revenue streams. Meanwhile in the US, storage kept its tax incentive, but this came with significant supply chain constraints that rule out Chinese modules.

What will the year ahead bring for energy storage in the US and China? Will growth continue to accelerate in the Middle East and Europe, where government-led tenders support new additions?

Fill in the form for your complimentary copy, and read on for a short introduction to some of the themes explored.

Restructuring in the global energy storage supply chain

China maintains its dominant position in energy storage supply chains across raw-material processing, component manufacturing, battery manufacturing and system integration. However, domestic overcapacity and escalating local content requirements are driving manufacturers to diversify investments beyond China's borders to circumvent tariffs.

Chinese suppliers are strategically positioning themselves to serve global demand, with expansion efforts focused on South and Southeast Asia, MENA and Europe.

Significant supply chain challenges loom in the near term, particularly in the US market. Chinese manufacturers are expected to announce new ownership structures in 2026 to regain US market access, reducing ownership below 25% to meet FEoC requirements. How will this impact the market? Will supply shortages persist – and how will prices be affected? Find out more in the full report.

Non-lithium technologies – including sodium-ion – emerging at scale

Clean energy is entering a critical decade. 2026 will be a turning point as evolving market forces and policy direction significantly accelerate momentum. Alternative storage technologies – including sodium-ion, flow batteries and iron-air systems – are gaining traction as supply chains for lithium grow more complicated, especially for the US market.

Increased investment and technology-specific RFP activity, particularly for non-lithium storage, is emerging across major markets such as China, Australia, Ireland, Spain, Germany, Italy and California.

The truth is that Chinese automakers are developing, producing, and selling some of the world's most advanced and most affordable EVs on the planet, and not only are the brands making inroads overseas in Europe, they have eyes on the U.S. market. It's likely not a matter of if, but when, Chinese brands enter the U.S. market, and Detroit automakers don't have long to prepare, adjust, and innovate to compete at the necessary price points and quality levels.

Years ago, analysts had scattered warnings about foreign automakers needing to pull back in China, but now the warnings are that the Chinese are heading to America, and long-term investors should keep an eye on these developments because Chinese vehicles in the U.S. will dramatically alter business, market share, and profitability and make returns much more uncertain.

The federal government’s interventions in climate policy have been erratic, driven by political polarization and alternating control of the White House. In contrast, state governments have engaged in steady campaigns to reduce carbon emissions. Some people seem to think this has been a recent innovation, but it has now been ongoing for a generation. Here are some the key milestone along the way.

1983. Iowa establishes the first Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which requires utilities to obtain a certain percentage of electricity from renewable sources. Similar requirements were then adopted by many other states.

2006. California passes Pavley Act, authorizing the Air Resources Board to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.

2006. California passes AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act, resulting in the creation of an ambitious carbon trading system.

2007.Supreme Court rules in Massachusetts v. EPA that states have standing to litigate climate change issues.

2009. RGGI – the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — is launched by Northeastern states, establishing a multi-state carbon trading system covering power plants.

2011. Supreme Court rejects Connecticut effort to seek remedies under federal law against utilities for their carbon emissions. The decisions leaves open the possibility of bringing similar claims under state law. The same year, the Bush EPA approves the California’s first zero-emission vehicle standard.

2013. Ninth Circuit rejects a claim that California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard is an unconstitutional barrier to interstate commerce, setting a broad precedent for upholding state climate policies.

2017. The United States Climate Alliance is formed by ten states in response to Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Twenty-two states, with over half of the U.S. population and GDP, are currently members.

2023. Hawaii Supreme Court rejects effort to dismiss Honolulu lawsuit in state court against oil companies for damages relating to climate change. U.S. Supreme Court ultimately denies review.

2024. Vermont passes first Climate Superfund Law, requiring fossil fuel producers to compensate the state for climate-related damages caused by their carbon emissions. The same year, Vermont becomes the 13th state to set a deadline for using 100% renewable power.

2025. President Trump issues an executive order entitled “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach.” The order describes state clean energy policies as “burdensome and ideologically motivated ‘climate change’ or energy policies that threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security.”

The order calls on the Attorney General to take action against these state laws, and she began to file lawsuits almost immediately.

____

Despite Trump’s attack on the constitutional power of states to adopt their own policies, it seems highly unlikely that he’ll succeed in expunging this basic feature of American federalism.

The agency kept in place the existing 24-hour PM 2.5 standard of 35 micrograms per cubic meter of air.
Last November, EPA attorneys filed a motion asking the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to vacate the standard.
Twenty-four states — including Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, West Virginia and Wyoming — joined industry groups in challenging the rule in March 2024.
They warned that tailpipe emissions remain “a significant source” of nitrogen oxides, non-methane organic gas, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter.","The Trump administration is moving closer to reworking a Biden-era standard for fine particulate matter that manufacturers have criticized as unachievable.

The U.S. EPA rule, which was finalized in March of 2024 and went into effect May 6 of that year, lowered the annual limit for PM 2.5 from 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air to nine.

The new standard was intended to “protect public health with an adequate margin of safety” in accordance with the Clean Air Act, based on mounting scientific evidence showing that long-term exposure to PM 2.5 causes premature death and increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory problems, the new rule noted. The EPA estimated at the time that the change could prevent 4,500 premature deaths and 290,000 lost workdays and yield $22 billion to $46 billion in benefits, while incurring an estimated $590 million in costs by 2032.

The agency kept in place the existing 24-hour PM 2.5 standard of 35 micrograms per cubic meter of air. That limit measures levels over a shorter time frame than the annual standard.

Industry groups warned that the stricter annual limit would force a wide range of key manufacturing industries — including cement makers, chemical manufacturers, steel mills, coal-fired power plants and battery manufacturers — to pull back on construction of new factories in many areas and would hurt the economy.

Last March, just after President Donald Trump began his second term, the EPA announced it would revisit the PM 2.5 rule, along with 30 other environmental regulations. In an agency video, Administrator Lee Zeldin said the rules need to be reworked to ease costs for businesses and “give power back to the states.” Several industry groups also challenged the Biden rule in court.

Last November, EPA attorneys filed a motion asking the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to vacate the standard. The Biden administration, they said, had taken a “regulatory shortcut” in adopting the tighter limit and did not conduct a thorough enough review. Biden’s EPA also failed to adequately consider the cost of complying with the new limit, the motion said.

Environmental groups, including the Clean Air Task Force, disputed those claims, noting that the Supreme Court has found that the Clean Air Act prohibits EPA from considering implementation costs when setting or revising National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

“An abundance of scientific evidence shows going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act, and, regardless of what EPA does, CATF will continue to defend this important rule in court,” Hayden Hashimoto, an attorney with the group, said in a statement issued after the EPA filed the motion to vacate.

California and several other states intervened to challenge the EPA’s motion, suggesting in a Dec. 16 filing that the agency had delayed revising the limit in hopes that the courts would strike down the rule.

States across the country have joined the legal fight over the new limit.

Twenty-four states — including Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, West Virginia and Wyoming — joined industry groups in challenging the rule in March 2024. Weeks later, 16 states — including Arizona, California, Maryland, Oregon and Wisconsin, as well as the District of Columbia and New York City — filed a motion to intervene to uphold the tighter limit, along with environmental groups.

In a legal filing in November, EPA urged the court to vacate the rule before the initial determination of which areas do not meet the new standard is due on Feb. 7. EPA Press Secretary Carolyn Holran declined to comment on the status of the effort to retool the rule. In an emailed statement, she said the Biden-era PM 2.5 standard “has raised serious concerns from states across the country and served as a major obstacle to permitting.”

Implementation plans from the states, which are charged with enacting and enforcing air quality standards, are due in April. Asked if the agency will uphold the Biden rule while retooling it, Holran said in an email that “EPA will always follow the law as we Power the Great American Comeback while carrying out our core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Manufacturers push for reverting to previous standard

The EPA’s move to revisit the rule has received praise from the National Association of Manufacturers and other industry groups, which have projected that the stricter standard would throw counties into non-attainment status that are home to 40% of the U.S. population, making it difficult to secure permits for new factories and other projects.

That would curtail manufacturing of a wide range of products, including the cement and steel needed for new US infrastructure, the groups said. The EPA had estimated in 2024 that most counties already meet the nine micrograms per cubic meter standard and that 99% of U.S. counties would do so by 2032.

The updated PM 2.5 standard was “one of the things we were most concerned about” during the Biden administration, said Brandon Farris, executive vice president of the Steel Manufacturers Association and former vice president of energy and resources policy at NAM.

“If you’re putting a shovel in the dirt anywhere, or you’re building a new manufacturing facility or operating your current ones or trying to do any upgrades, then the particulate matter is going to be one of the most burdensome rules,” he said.

Most companies could meet the previous standard of 12 micrograms per cubic meter or find a way to offset those emissions, but nine micrograms doesn’t allow for much headroom given existing background levels, Farris said.

“It’s pretty darn close to nine, just without manufacturing, in a lot of areas of the country,” he said. “I truly don’t know of many areas in the country that would be able to meet a standard of nine and allow for any growth.”

The tighter standard also places an unfair burden on manufacturing, which only accounts for 12% of PM 2.5 pollution, he added. “It’s wildfires, it’s dust storms, it’s unpaved roads,” Farris said. “This new standard essentially punishes manufacturing, [even though] manufacturing isn’t the largest source of this.”

SMA was one of 15 industry groups, including the Aluminum Association, the American Forest & Paper Association, and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers that signed a Jan. 6 letter urging the Trump administration to take “prompt action to correct an unlawful rule.” Members of the groups are already considering scaling back or relocating projects due to the revised standard, according to the letter.

Sean O’Neill, the American Cement Association’s senior vice president for government affairs, said he wasn’t aware of any specific projects in his industry that have been affected by the new standard yet. But he said the uncertainty around the future of the rule has made it difficult to plan future investments.

“We’re hopeful that this will be overturned,” he said. “If the standard was put back to where it was, I think you could see more capital investment occurring ... but it’s just a challenging time right now.”

AMA projects the lower standard could reduce domestic cement production, leading to layoffs and greater dependence on foreign imports. “We continue to be efficient at the plants, we continue to be innovative, but you can only do so much,” said O’Neill.

A 2025 report by the American Cement Association, one of the industry groups that initially filed suit against the lower limit, estimated that the U.S. will need 1 million metric tons of cement just to build the data centers needed to run artificial intelligence. By 2027, the number of data centers in the U.S. is expected to increase from 5,426 to 6,000, according to the report.

Vehicle rules revisited

Other air quality rules are getting a second look as well.

Aaron Szabo, EPA’s assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation, said in a Dec. 19 op-ed that the agency will move forward in early 2026 with plans to revisit two regulations aimed at cutting nitrogen oxide emissions from vehicles. Auto manufacturers opposed both rules, including a 2024 rule for light and medium-duty vehicles of model years 2027 and later, and a 2022 rule targeting heavy-duty vehicles.

Health advocacy groups warn that rolling back the new, stricter NAAQS for PM 2.5 and vehicle emissions favors industry at the expense of public health.

On Jan. 14, 75 groups and municipalities, including the Environmental Defense Fund, Clean Air Task Force, the City of Portland, Ore., and the Respiratory Health Association, sent a letter to the EPA opposing the overhaul of the vehicle standards.

They warned that tailpipe emissions remain “a significant source” of nitrogen oxides, non-methane organic gas, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. The group’s letter said “any rollback would lead directly to increased hospitalization rates, lost work and school days, and thousands of preventable deaths.” Weakening the rules would also make it more difficult for states to achieve the NAAQS for PM 2.5 and ozone, they added.

As Trump’s EPA reassesses air quality standards adopted by the Biden administration, the agency is also likely to calculate costs and benefits differently than in the past.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-8h5nd1HCb53sxIqgtEzMp7qIT7zdJ1DsDsXH54EFyU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfODkwMS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-26 11:02:27.083037

Volkswagen AG's plans for a possible Audi factory in the US aren't progressing as President Donald Trump's tariffs weigh and talks for local incentives haven't yielded results, Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume told Handelsblatt.

Europe's biggest carmaker has considered adding a second American manufacturing site on and off for some time, including dating back to 2018 during Trump's first presidency. Talks for an Audi plant have been ongoing, initially encouraged by subsidies making an investment economically viable.

That calculus has shifted as the Trump administration placed tariffs on European carmakers, Blume said in an interview with the German newspaper, citing duty costs of VW €2.1 billion ($2.5 billion) in the first nine months of 2025.

India plans to slash tariffs on cars imported from the European Union to 40% from as high as 110%, sources said, in the biggest opening yet of the country's vast market as the two sides close in on a free trade pact that could come as early as Tuesday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has agreed to immediately reduce the tax on a limited number of cars from the 27-nation bloc with an import price of more than 15,000 euros ($17,739), two sources briefed on the talks told Reuters.

This will be further lowered to 10% over time, they added, easing access to the Indian market for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/trump-defied-the-will-of-congress-in-cutting-ev-charger-funding-judge/l-intro-1769441430.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:01:46.255833

Two myths tend to shape how people talk about Kentucky and climate change. One is that the state is a “climate haven,” insulated from the worst effects of global warming. The other is that Kentuckians are hostile to climate action.

Officials pushing for change – researchers, environmental directors and more – say their conversations around climate are more nuanced than a red or blue ticket makes it look.

Kentucky is the sixth-most climate-vulnerable state, according to a report by Texas A&M University and the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. From 2020 to 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration documented 27 “billion-dollar” climate disasters in the state, including tornadoes that killed more than 50 people in western Kentucky and flash floods that killed 39 in the east.

From the outside, the Commonwealth’s politicians and residents – largely rural, with a reputation for voting conservative – may appear indifferent. Last year, state leaders passed S.B. 89, removing groundwater and wetland protections, and stood by President Donald Trump as he signed executive orders to boost the coal industry.

“I am delighted to share that that is a false assumption. And absolutely, it is an assumption that people make,” says Lauren Cagle, a professor at the University of Kentucky specializing in climate rhetoric.

Locally, municipalities varying in population density, income levels, and industry are teaming up to strengthen their own communities’ climate resilience through a six-county regional climate action plan. The draft Central Kentucky Climate Action Plan, published last fall through an Environmental Protection Agency grant, targets an area of more than half a million people. Their leaders say neither politics nor an urban-rural divide can predict the popularity and effectiveness of climate action.

“There are three parts to this, and it includes the environment, the people, and the economy. We believe if we focus on those three areas, then we can make our community stronger,” Jada Walker Griggs, the senior program manager in sustainability for Lexington-Fayette Urban City Government (LFUCG), explains.

Under the plan, the six counties – Bourbon, Clark, Fayette, Jessamine, Scott and Woodford — as well as municipal governments within will collaborate to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 23% by 2035 and 40% by 2050, as compared to 2021 levels.

“Since the early ’90s, we have seen this attempt to pit local and global versus each other. We’ve seen this attempt to pit individual choice versus systemic change against each other. And we’ve seen this attempt to pit urban versus rural. And these are all false choices,” says Cagle, who has closely followed the climate action plan’s development.

Inside the climate action plan

Regardless of federal and state action, the region is prioritizing initiatives that push actions countering and mitigating climate change. After all, Lexington aims to be carbon neutral by 2050.

Since 2004, the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government has implemented an energy management plan to reduce consumption of fuel, and leaders commissioned a greenhouse gas inventory in 2021. They had already published a sustainability plan as far back as 2012 under Empower Lexington.

But in 2023, when officials searched for implementation grants, they realized more funding would be accessible if they included the entire Lexington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

“That’s not only Fayette County,” Griggs said. “That’s Clark County, and Scott and Bourbon and Jessamine and Woodford Counties, and then their municipal governments.”

Fayette County fared better than most of the Commonwealth in Texas A&M’s report, scoring in the 58th percentile for climate vulnerability: While it doesn’t experience many extreme weather events, the area’s environmental factors like land use and pollution dragged down its score. Nearby Clark County ranked in the 91st percentile nationwide, and Bourbon County ranked 96th. The contrast between those counties, according to the report, is largely due to infrastructure differences and residents’ physical health.

Jada Walker Griggs is the senior program manager in sustainability for Lexington-Fayette Urban City Government .

The Central Kentucky Climate Action Plan, which shows how these governments can work in tandem to reduce harmful emissions, is funded by a $1 million EPA grant. It’s a collection of two documents.

The Priority Climate Action Plan provides quick, high-impact changes for central Kentucky communities to adopt, including plans for:

Studying the need for electric vehicle charging stations across the region

Planting a stronger urban tree canopy in Lexington to help mitigate rising temperatures

Building upon the work of the local program Solarize Lexington, which provides residential solar to homeowners and other property owners at discounted rates

The Comprehensive Climate Action Plan offers a more thorough analysis for long-term growth, based on detailed data about each county’s vulnerabilities, economics and how their emissions and goals vary by region and demographic. Its recommendations include:

Scaling up the work of Solarize Lexington to include the entire 6-county MSA

Considering a ‘Smart Agriculture’ coalition – which would lead outreach on fertilizer use, plant breeding, and other environmental factors for farmers in the MSA.

Implementing electric bus fleets for public transportation for Fayette County (Lextran) and beyond.

Long-term development of education materials and campaigns showing the benefits of these initiatives

Griggs explains it’s vital that people across the region understand the very basics of climate change and pollution, as well as why these actions help. That’s part of why the Climate Action Plan has gone through multiple rounds of community input, from public focus group gatherings to community ambassadors.

The spectrum of climate concern

When Cagle attended one of these focus groups in Lexington, she was amazed at how many passionate people showed up.

“It was [so] packed, we had to bring chairs in. People were showing up to participate. In that room of however many people, everybody was excited about this vision,” Cagle says. “There was one person there who [voiced skepticism] about the reality of anthropogenic climate change, but was also willing to have a conversation about the vision for the future.”

About 58% of the Lexington-Fayette Metropolitan Statistical Area is worried about climate change, according to a YALE Climate Communications report monitoring adults’ beliefs, risk perceptions and policy support around climate change. Likewise, 63% of Kentuckians surveyed expressed their belief that global warming exists.

“Kentucky tends to sit right about 10% below the national average, but it’s not this dramatic swing. The national average is 72, so [people assume] Kentucky must be way down in the 30s.”

Lauren Cagle is a professor at the University of Kentucky.

And the state’s urban centers, Lexington and Louisville, don’t dramatically drive up that number, she notes. The majority of people in every Kentucky county surveyed believe global warming is happening.

The YALE report doesn’t limit itself to the binary of people either believing or not believing in climate change itself, Cagle adds: Many people don’t center climate action in their lifestyles, but they’re still cautious or concerned.

“In our mental models of discourse around climate, we tend to sort people into the extremes– you’re either alarmed, or you’re dismissive … the folks who are like, ‘climate change is a hoax, I don’t think it’s happening at all,’” Cagle explains. It’s rarely so black and white.

“The reality is that people sit all along that spectrum. So just because someone is not a climate activist doesn’t mean that they don’t think climate change is real.”

The Central Kentucky Climate Action Plans challenge the idea that climate change is a rural and urban divide problem, Cagle says. These areas may have different needs, but most rural towns are not moving backwards compared to cities.

“As public opinion shifts further and further in favor of taking action on climate change across all spaces, urban and rural … there’s increased public support for making systemic changes that will make it easier for individuals to make choices that reduce their own emissions,” Cagle argues.

Individual action

Shanda Cecil wears many hats for the small city of Winchester, one county east of Lexington: She is its stormwater and floodplain coordinator, its code enforcement officer, and a correspondent for the Central Kentucky Climate Action Plan.

Cecil has been pushing for climate-forward initiatives in her community for years, from environmentally friendly practices in the local school system to Clark County’s farmland preservation and protection plan. These scopes differ from the rooftop solar and electric bus capabilities Lexington is shooting for.

In Clark County, Shanda Cecil is a correspondent for the Central Kentucky Climate Action Plan.

“Every county seems to have similar goals, but the way we go about it does seem to be different,” Cecil explains. “Our viewpoints around things are slightly different. I am usually very practical about approaches, so I always try to grab the low hanging fruit first.”

Her current focus is on the school system, which she has gotten to know well since becoming an environmental educator. Cecil says she is meeting with other local leaders to implement composting for wasted school lunches and work toward eliminating non-recyclable styrofoam lunch trays.

“I’ve tried in the past to get that changed, and with not a lot of success, but maybe the composting aspect might actually happen if we can get a grant [to] create a facility on site to help compost,” Cecil says. “Food waste is 30% of the waste stream.”

In the draft Comprehensive Climate Action Plan, composting measures are projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 300,000 metric tons regionally by 2050.

Many parts of the plan are oriented for the regional governments themselves to take on, but others – like recycling, reducing food waste and vehicle use – are based on individual habits changing. It also includes putting together public resources like the simple explanations of greenhouse gasses and climate change on the Climate Action Plan’s website.

“We’re putting together educational materials about recycling … in a way that I can forward it to the other communities so that they can put it on their website, and they can get it out to their residents,” Griggs says.

“This is not a perfect plan, but it is a plan that [means] anyone should be able to pick up and do something, regardless of what type of home you’re in, what size your business is – you can do something.”

Cecil, meanwhile, has grown more pessimistic about how much education can help drive change.

“I have been doing environmental education for about 23 years and I can tell you that it’s not that people don’t know,” Cecil says. The most difficult part of her work is getting people to act.

“It does not matter what political side you’re on. I don’t know why people don’t make these changes. I am starting to believe they just don’t care,” Cecil says. “I see people that will vote one way and, in their own personal life, do nothing to make a change.”

But she says this resistance has little to do with living in a more rural area.

“We’re all getting our kids ready in the mornings. We’re all going to work. We’re all mowing our yards. We’re all buying from Amazon.”

Williamson pointed to concerns such as equipment shortages, tariff-related cost increases, the elimination of federal tax incentives for renewable energy and tighter state rules around the use of renewable energy credits.
Katie Duckworth, a senior associate attorney at the Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center, said the explosion of data centers impacts the energy law.
It has said it is in final stages for up to 1 gigawatt combined from two other data centers, too.
DTE and Consumers executives declined to comment in detail on the interplay between the clean energy law and huge data centers until unveiling their IRPs.","The utilities' leaders have said multiple potential gigawatts of additional capacity from data centers are in the pipeline in their territories. The only facility to date with signed power contracts, Oracle's 1.4-gigawatt OpenAI project near Ann Arbor, would be the largest user in the state by far, consuming enough electricity for 1 million homes and accounting for a staggering 25% increase in DTE's regular load by the end of 2027.

Under the 2023 law, utilities will have to reach a 50% renewable energy credit portfolio four years from now, up from 15% today. That covers the Stargate facility in Washtenaw County's Saline Township and any other new data centers, too.

The threshold for wind, solar and other renewable sources rises to 60% in 2035. Also, there is an 80% clean energy standard in 2035 and 100% in 2040 — renewables plus nuclear and, if nascent carbon-capture technology is used, natural gas that has become more important as dirtier coal-fired plants are closed.

There are ""off-ramps,"" or delays, for utilities that show the Michigan Public Service Commission they cannot meet the deadlines. But the advent of ""hyperscale"" data centers means the renewable- and clean-energy standards should be reevaluated, said Rod Williamson, executive director of the Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity, which represents companies using large amounts of energy.

""A lot of the requirements that were put in place did not contemplate the amount and the speed of new load additions like these AI data centers,"" he said. ""Having some more robust off-ramps that do not cause a significant, fast escalation in electricity rates for customers or extending out these requirements to a longer timeframe, we think all of these things need to be considered along with just looking at things from a reliability standpoint and making sure that the blend of generation that we have is going to be able to meet the requirements of this new 24-hour, seven-day-a-week load addition.""

Williamson pointed to concerns such as equipment shortages, tariff-related cost increases, the elimination of federal tax incentives for renewable energy and tighter state rules around the use of renewable energy credits.

""We're looking at not just adding incremental growth to the utilities' electricity sales but step changes — significant step changes — to the utilities' electrical usage in a very fast timeframe,"" he said, noting that AI data centers use way more power than industrial manufacturers do.

Revisiting the 2023 law is very unlikely this year, as Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — who has championed it as being necessary to fight climate change and lower power costs — prepares to leave office and the Legislature is split politically. But energy and data centers are issues in the 2026 election and not going away in the future.

Case in point: Republican House Speaker Matt Hall said last week that ""there's no way to do the wind and solar"" standards and ""you need to build natural gas plants"" to power huge data centers — a position disputed by environmental organizations.

The buildout of utility-scale solar and wind, which is crucial for the requirements to be reached, is seen as cheaper and quicker than adding other types of new generation like gas plants and emerging, albeit unproven, small nuclear reactors. But wind and the sun are intermittent. While battery storage is on the rise and able to help with short-term peak needs, it is not a replacement for continuous power from nuclear or gas plants.

Katie Duckworth, a senior associate attorney at the Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center, said the explosion of data centers impacts the energy law.

""As load grows, they will have to procure or build more renewable energy. On their face, you can make that math work out. It involves more renewables,"" she said.

In seeking approval of the special contracts for Stargate, DTE said the new load would increase the utility's renewable portfolio standard target by around 30%. The company estimated needing an additional 443 megawatts of renewables by 2032 if it maximizes use of ""banked"" renewable energy credits.

It said it is actively developing new wind and solar facilities, pursuing power purchase agreements with third-party developers and, where feasible, will evaluate buying operational or near-operational renewable assets.

Environmental groups, Duckworth said, are advocating that there be a ""proactive"" approach to ensuring that as data centers come online there is not a ""mismatch"" between load growth and utilities' renewable and clean energy obligations.

""The risks are both the potential for jeopardizing the clean energy goals in a way that the utilities can't meet them at some point down the line or just making the compliance with those laws more expensive in a way that could impact other ratepayers,"" she said.

The groups, for instance, were disappointed that regulators deferred broader questions about how the Stargate data center will affect DTE's electricity mix until the Detroit-based company submits its integrated resource plan between July and September.

DTE has said it is in late-stage negotiations for an additional 3 gigawatts of data center load, which, if it materializes, would boost its typical load by over 50%. Jackson-based Consumers, which plans to unveil its IRP in June, may finalize a deal with an unspecified ""hyperscale"" data center that is expected to use up to 1 gigawatt starting in 2030. It has said it is in final stages for up to 1 gigawatt combined from two other data centers, too.

The utilities and Public Service Commission members have said new data centers will not raise rates on other customers. DTE and Consumers executives declined to comment in detail on the interplay between the clean energy law and huge data centers until unveiling their IRPs.

""As large customers come online in the future, our blueprint will transparently demonstrate how we will reliably and affordably meet the demand of all customers, including proposed economic development projects in Michigan's pipeline, while hitting targets set in the 2023 energy law,"" Consumers spoksperson Katie Carey said.

Laura Sherman, president of the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council, an advanced-energy group that supports the mandates, said she still believes the targets can be hit, even amid the Trump administration's emphasis on fossil fuels following the Biden administration's push for green energy.

""I always viewed the RPS as a really important backstop to what's happening anyway in the market. And I still view it that way,"" she said, calling renewables the most cost-effective options and questioning the value of new gas plants both from a cost and timeline perspective.

""I think the utilities will continue carrying (renewables) and will continue moving in that direction. But I do think these upcoming IRPs are going to be really important from many perspectives — from a job-creation perspective, an environmental perspective, an advancement of clean energy perspective. ... I don't think the utilities have expressed an interest in using those off-ramps, that I have heard yet. But it's definitely something we will be keeping a close eye on.""",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/0z1a2881_original%20%281%29.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:02:37.388426

China processes more than 90% of the world’s critical minerals and has used its dominance in the market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington.

USA Rare Earth said Monday that the U.S. Commerce Department is investing $1.6 billion in the company to advance work on a mine in Texas and to build a magnet manufacturing facility in Oklahoma.

Shares of USA Rare Earth jumped more than 13% before U.S. markets opened.

The agreement with the Commerce Department’s CHIPS program includes $277 million in proposed federal funding and a $1.3 billion senior secured loan. The Commerce Department will get 16.1 million shares of common stock in return, as well as rights to buy 17.6 million more.

“USA Rare Earth’s heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence,” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement. “This investment ensures our supply chains are resilient and no longer reliant on foreign nations.”

The Trump administration is intensifying efforts to build up the critical mineral industry in the United States to work to break the chokehold that China has on the global supply chain.

Industry insiders, analysts and lawmakers have warned for years that America’s dependence on China for critical minerals — a list of 50 minerals that includes 17 sought-after rare-earth elements — is a national security vulnerability.

Attempts by President Donald Trump to acquire Greenland is part of that push.

USA Rare Earth, based in Stillwater, Oklahoma, is the third U.S. operator in which the Trump administration has invested in recent months.

The Pentagon invested $400 million in rare-earth producer MP Materials. It gave the U.S. company a $150 million loan in August.

The Trump administration and private investors in November announced a partnership with rare earth startups Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies. The $1.4 billion deal is intended to scale up U.S. access to materials and technology that are crucial for producing an array of high-tech goods and military equipment.

The Trump administration’s tax and spending cut bill includes $2 billion for the Pentagon to boost the U.S. stockpile of critical minerals and $5 billion more through 2029 to invest in those supply chains.

Between 2020 and 2024, the Pentagon said it had awarded more than $439 million to establish supply chains for domestic rare earths.

(Nasdaq: USAR). Once a speculative venture aiming to revive the American ""mine-to-magnet"" supply chain, USAR has evolved into a strategic national asset. Today's landmark announcement of a $1.6 billion U.S. government investment package—comprised of direct grants and senior secured loans—marks the largest federal intervention in the critical minerals sector since the Second World War.

This capital infusion is not merely a corporate milestone; it is a decisive move by the U.S. Department of Commerce to break a decades-long Chinese monopoly on the rare earth elements (REEs) essential for electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, and advanced defense systems. With its flagship Round Top project in Texas and a newly commissioned magnet facility in Oklahoma, USA Rare Earth is attempting a feat of vertical integration that has eluded Western companies for thirty years. This feature explores the company's trajectory, its financial standing, and whether it can truly become the ""Exxon of the Green Revolution.""

Historical Background

The story of USA Rare Earth began with a recognition of the strategic vulnerability inherent in the global supply chain. Founded as a private entity, the company’s foundational move was the acquisition of an 80% interest in the Round Top Heavy Rare Earth and Critical Minerals Project in Sierra Blanca, Texas, in partnership with Texas Mineral Resources Corp (OTCQB: TMRC).

Throughout the early 2020s, USAR focused on a ""mine-to-magnet"" philosophy, realizing that simply mining ore was insufficient if the processing and manufacturing capabilities remained in China. In 2020, the company purchased the equipment from the only neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet plant in the U.S., which had been shuttered years prior, and began planning its revival.

The company’s transformation accelerated in March 2025, when it successfully went public on the Nasdaq through a merger with Inflection Point Acquisition Corp. This IPO provided the necessary ""dry powder"" to scale its processing technologies and finalize the acquisition of Less Common Metals (LCM) in the UK and France, cementing USAR’s presence on both sides of the Atlantic.

Business Model

USA Rare Earth operates a uniquely vertically integrated business model designed to capture value at every stage of the REE lifecycle. Unlike traditional miners that sell raw concentrate to third-party refiners (often in China), USAR’s model is built on four pillars:

Extraction: The Round Top deposit in Texas provides a massive, 130-year resource of heavy rare earths (Dysprosium, Terbium) and lithium.

Processing & Separation: Utilizing proprietary Continuous Ion Exchange (CIX) technology, the company separates mixed rare earth oxides into high-purity individual elements at its Colorado facility.

Metal & Alloy Production: Through its subsidiary LCM, the company converts these oxides into specialized metals and alloys.

Magnet Manufacturing: The final and most lucrative stage occurs at its Stillwater, Oklahoma plant, where metals are transformed into sintered NdFeB magnets for industrial and automotive customers.

By controlling the entire chain, USAR aims to eliminate ""midstream leak"" where domestic ore is shipped abroad for processing, thereby securing higher margins and ensuring supply chain transparency for Tier 1 OEMs.

Stock Performance Overview

Since its public debut in March 2025 at an initial price of $10.00 per share, USAR has experienced significant volatility, typical of the ""Critical Mineral 2.0"" era.

1-Year Performance: In the past 12 months, the stock has risen 85%, buoyed by the completion of its Stillwater facility and today’s $1.6 billion government announcement.

Post-IPO Trajectory: After hitting a low of $7.50 in mid-2025 amid concerns over permitting delays, the stock staged a massive rally in late 2025 as the U.S. government intensified its ""De-risking"" policy toward China.

Current Valuation: As of January 26, 2026, USAR trades at approximately $18.40 per share, with a market capitalization of $3.3 billion. While the company is still pre-revenue from its mining operations, the market is pricing in the strategic ""floor"" provided by the U.S. government’s 16% potential equity stake.

Financial Performance

USAR’s balance sheet underwent a radical transformation today. Prior to the government deal, the company was burning approximately $45 million per quarter on capital expenditures and R&D.

Key Financial Metrics (Estimated Jan 2026):

Cash Position: Post-investment, the company sits on roughly $1.9 billion in liquidity (including the $1.3 billion loan facility).

Government Stake: The U.S. government has secured warrants for up to 17.6 million shares, effectively making the taxpayer a major partner in the enterprise.

Projected Revenue: Analysts expect the first significant revenue from magnet sales to commence in H2 2026, with a massive ramp-up in 2028 when the Round Top mine comes online.

Debt-to-Equity: The $1.3 billion senior secured loan increases the company's leverage significantly, but the 15-year term and subsidized interest rates provide a manageable runway.

Leadership and Management

The leadership of USA Rare Earth was ""industrialized"" in late 2025 to prepare for the massive scale-up.

Barbara Humpton (CEO): The former CEO of Siemens USA (OTC: SIEGY) took the helm in October 2025. Her deep ties to the Department of Defense and Department of Energy were instrumental in securing the $1.6 billion federal package.

Thayer Smith (President): A veteran of the company’s early years, Smith remains the architect of the operational strategy. His focus is on the ""technical de-risking"" of the CIX separation technology and the mine build-out.

Board of Directors: The board includes former high-ranking officials from the U.S. Geological Survey and veterans from the automotive and defense sectors, reflecting the company’s dual role as a commercial entity and a national security asset.

Products, Services, and Innovations

The crown jewel of USAR’s innovation is its Continuous Ion Exchange (CIX) processing. Traditional solvent extraction is chemically intensive and environmentally taxing. CIX allows for the separation of rare earths with a much smaller footprint and lower water consumption, a critical factor for the arid West Texas climate.

In Stillwater, Oklahoma, the company’s magnet facility utilizes advanced sintering techniques to produce magnets with high coercivity—meaning they can operate at the high temperatures required for EV motors without losing their magnetic properties. Furthermore, USAR is developing a ""circular"" magnet recycling program, allowing it to recover REEs from end-of-life electronics and reintroduce them into the manufacturing stream.

Competitive Landscape

USAR operates in a landscape dominated by three major forces:

China (State-Owned Enterprises): China still controls over 85% of global rare earth processing. Their ability to flood the market and crash prices remains the primary external threat to USAR.

MP Materials (NYSE: MP): The current domestic leader. While MP Materials has a head start in mining at Mountain Pass, USAR’s focus on heavy rare earths (Dysprosium/Terbium) differentiates it, as MP primarily produces light rare earths (Neodymium/Praseodymium).

Lynas Rare Earths (ASX: LYC): The largest producer outside of China. USAR competes with Lynas for non-Chinese off-take agreements with European and American automakers.

Industry and Market Trends

The ""Great Re-Shoring"" is the dominant trend of 2026. As Western governments realize that the energy transition is impossible without REEs, industrial policy has replaced pure free-market dynamics.

EV Proliferation: Despite a plateau in some regions, the transition to permanent magnet motors in EVs continues to drive a 12% CAGR in NdFeB demand.

Geopolitical Bifurcation: The world is splitting into two mineral blocs. USAR is the flagship of the ""Mineral Security Partnership"" (MSP), an alliance of 14 countries aiming to build supply chains independent of Beijing.

Risks and Challenges

Investing in USAR is not without significant peril:

Execution Risk: Building a multi-billion-dollar mine and processing plant simultaneously is a Herculean task. Any delays at Round Top could starve the Oklahoma magnet plant of domestic feedstock.

Price Volatility: Rare earth prices are notoriously opaque and volatile. A sudden drop in prices orchestrated by Chinese state-owned firms could hurt USAR’s margins.

Regulatory Hurdles: Despite federal support, the Round Top project must navigate a complex web of environmental assessments and local permitting in Texas.

Opportunities and Catalysts

The primary catalyst is the Accelerated Mine Plan, which aims to bring Round Top into commercial production by 2028.

Defense Contracts: With the U.S. military moving toward a ""China-free"" supply chain for its F-35 fighter jets and Virginia-class submarines, USAR is perfectly positioned to secure high-margin defense off-take agreements.

Strategic Stockpiling: The U.S. government’s move to create a National Defense Stockpile of permanent magnets provides a guaranteed ""buyer of last resort"" for USAR’s production.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Wall Street sentiment has shifted from ""skeptical"" to ""strategic."" Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have recently initiated coverage on USAR, with ""Buy"" ratings predicated on the company’s unique position as a government-backed monopoly-challenger.

Institutional ownership has surged to 45%, with major positions held by BlackRock and the Vanguard Group. On retail forums, USAR is often discussed as a ""generational hold,"" with investors betting on the long-term inevitability of mineral de-coupling from China.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

The $1.6 billion investment is part of a broader suite of policies including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the CHIPS and Science Act. These laws provide production tax credits (Section 45X) that essentially subsidize the manufacturing of magnets on U.S. soil.

Geopolitically, the U.S. has signaled that it will use the ""Defense Production Act Title III"" to ensure that companies like USAR remain solvent even during periods of market manipulation. This ""sovereign backstop"" is perhaps the company’s greatest competitive advantage.

Conclusion

As of January 26, 2026, USA Rare Earth (Nasdaq: USAR) stands as a bold experiment in industrial policy. The $1.6 billion U.S. government investment has effectively ""de-risked"" the company’s capital structure, providing a bridge to 2028 when its domestic mining operations are slated to begin.

For investors, USAR represents a high-stakes bet on the future of the American energy transition. While operational and geopolitical risks remain substantial, the company’s ""mine-to-magnet"" vertical integration and unprecedented federal backing make it the most significant player in the Western quest for mineral independence. Investors should closely watch the commissioning of the Stillwater plant in Q1 2026 and the progress of environmental permitting at Round Top as the next major indicators of success.

The market was blossoming and would become the world's largest automotive market by 2009. However, the Chinese forced foreign automakers into joint ventures with domestic companies to earn their way into the market.

Because of these joint ventures, the Chinese automakers developed quickly, and years later, through government subsidies and other incentives, became advanced, particularly with electric vehicles (EVs). The problem for the likes of Ford Motor Company (F 1.25%) and General Motors (GM 0.16%), among others, is that now Chinese automakers are able to undercut on pricing and, due to an aggressive price war in China, are rapidly expanding across the globe.

Making matters worse for the two Detroit automakers was a recent shift in North American trade policy that could mean Chinese brands are a mere step away from the lucrative U.S. market.

What's going on?

Last week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a new strategic partnership with China that essentially reopens Canada to Chinese EVs. This is a reversal of recent history, as for the past two years, Canada has stood beside the U.S. regarding Chinese EV tariffs. After the Biden administration implemented 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, Canada followed with similar moves -- but that's changing.

Tucked away in a much broader trade agreement between Prime Minister Carney and Beijing, China, last week, Canada agreed to let in an annual quota of just under 50,000 Chinese EVs into the country at a tariff rate of only 6.1%. In return China will lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed from about 85% down to 15%, and to remove restrictions on lobster and crab.

At first glance, investors might brush this off due to the low annual volume, which represents less than 3% of the new-vehicle market in Canada. But brushing this development off could be a mistake.

This could be the first step of opening the Chinese EV floodgates into part of North America, especially with the government's prediction that within five years, ""more than 50% of these vehicles will be affordable EVs with an import price of less than $35,000,"" a price range that should remain competitive. Canada is attempting to lure some big Chinese companies to set up shop up north, with a closer eye on the lucrative U.S. market and smaller tariff headaches.

The market was blossoming and would become the world's largest automotive market by 2009. However, the Chinese forced foreign automakers into joint ventures with domestic companies to earn their way into the market.

Because of these joint ventures, the Chinese automakers developed quickly, and years later, through government subsidies and other incentives, became advanced, particularly with electric vehicles (EVs). The problem for the likes of Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM), among others, is that now Chinese automakers are able to undercut on pricing and, due to an aggressive price war in China, are rapidly expanding across the globe.

Making matters worse for the two Detroit automakers was a recent shift in North American trade policy that could mean Chinese brands are a mere step away from the lucrative U.S. market.

What's going on?

Last week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a new strategic partnership with China that essentially reopens Canada to Chinese EVs. This is a reversal of recent history, as for the past two years, Canada has stood beside the U.S. regarding Chinese EV tariffs. After the Biden administration implemented 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, Canada followed with similar moves -- but that's changing.

Tucked away in a much broader trade agreement between Prime Minister Carney and Beijing, China, last week, Canada agreed to let in an annual quota of just under 50,000 Chinese EVs into the country at a tariff rate of only 6.1%. In return China will lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed from about 85% down to 15%, and to remove restrictions on lobster and crab.

At first glance, investors might brush this off due to the low annual volume, which represents less than 3% of the new-vehicle market in Canada. But brushing this development off could be a mistake.

This could be the first step of opening the Chinese EV floodgates into part of North America, especially with the government's prediction that within five years, ""more than 50% of these vehicles will be affordable EVs with an import price of less than $35,000,"" a price range that should remain competitive. Canada is attempting to lure some big Chinese companies to set up shop up north, with a closer eye on the lucrative U.S. market and smaller tariff headaches.

What it all means

The truth is that Chinese automakers are developing, producing, and selling some of the world's most advanced and most affordable EVs on the planet, and not only are the brands making inroads overseas in Europe, they have eyes on the U.S. market. It's likely not a matter of if, but when, Chinese brands enter the U.S. market, and Detroit automakers don't have long to prepare, adjust, and innovate to compete at the necessary price points and quality levels.

Years ago, analysts had scattered warnings about foreign automakers needing to pull back in China, but now the warnings are that the Chinese are heading to America, and long-term investors should keep an eye on these developments because Chinese vehicles in the U.S. will dramatically alter business, market share, and profitability and make returns much more uncertain.",https://finviz.com/favicon_2x.png,N,,2026-01-26 12:01:54.207557

This story was originally published by Bridge Michigan, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news organization. To get regular coverage from Bridge Michigan, sign up for a free Bridge Michigan newsletter here.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is suing some of the world’s largest oil companies, accusing them of colluding for decades to keep renewable energy and electric vehicles on the margins.

The landmark lawsuit, filed Friday morning in the US District Court for the Western District of Michigan, seeks unspecified financial compensation and forfeiture of profits from oil giants BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell and their subsidiaries, as well as the industry lobbying group American Petroleum Institute.

Rather than a suit about environmental harm, “at the heart, this is an energy affordability case,” Nessel said in an interview with Bridge Michigan.

Michiganders pay among the nation’s highest residential energy rates — costs Nessel said “could have been prevented had the fossil fuel cartel not worked together to postpone innovation and to eliminate cost-effective alternatives.”

Ryan Meyers, senior vice president and general counsel for the American Petroleum Institute, criticized Nessel’s new suit. In a statement provided to Bridge, he called it part of “a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America’s economy, and is actively reducing emissions.”

With the suit, Michigan joins dozens of cities and states that have sued oil corporations, alleging they used illegal tactics to maintain market dominance and conceal the risks of their products.

Petroleum industry representatives have begun lobbying Congress for legal immunity, calling such lawsuits a waste of taxpayer resources.

Today’s suit comes more than a year-and-a-half after Nessel first announced plans to sue the fossil fuel industry over climate change.

While many other state and local lawsuits have accused oil companies of violating environmental and public trust laws, Michigan’s case hinges on antitrust laws designed to protect consumers from monopolies.

In the 126-page complaint, state lawyers argue the fossil fuel companies acted like a cartel, conspiring to thwart competition from EVs and renewable energy. That includes using “capture-and-kill tactics” such as buying renewable energy patents and then restricting their use, suing rival companies to keep them from deploying EVs and renewables, misleading the public about the risks of fossil fuels and hiring hackers to “surveil, intimidate and disrupt” investigations by journalists and activists.

Taken together, the lawsuit alleges, those actions amount to “an illicit conspiracy” to restrain free trade. In a world without such collusion, the lawsuit states, Michiganders would have more and cheaper transportation and energy options while avoiding the “staggering external costs” of climate change.

Oil company executives knew as far back as the 1960s that fossil fuels cause climate change, but spent decades publicly denying the science.

Greenhouse gas emissions caused by burning fossil fuels have destabilized Earth’s climate, prompting a global panel of experts to warn that humanity must stop emitting by 2050 or face dangerous “tipping points” such as mass extinction and runaway sea level rise, heatwaves, droughts and fires.

Last year was the third-hottest year on record, just barely cooler than 2023 and 2024.

While the lawsuit sparked effusive praise from environment advocates, it was harshly criticized by business groups.

Mike Alaimo of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce said Nessel’s lawsuit “weaponizes the Attorney General’s office against broad segments of Michigan’s economy,” arguing such moves inject “uncertainty into our business climate and jeopardizes our competitiveness.”

But the Michigan chapter of the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy organization, hailed the suit as a way to push back against longstanding industry influence.

“These companies have used their outsized political influence to preserve the status quo and pave the way for a wave of energy-intensive data center projects across the state, even as renewable energy remains the cheapest source of new power and what Michiganders deserve,” Sierra Club lobbyist Tim Minota said in a statement.

Michigan Climate Action Network Executive Director Denise Keele called lawsuits like Nessel’s “exactly the kinds of things that we need to be doing.” She argued fossil fuel companies “should be chipping in to pay for all these catastrophic (climate) impacts.”

Even before it was filed, Nessel’s lawsuit drew a rebuke from President Donald Trump’s administration. Michigan’s top Democratic prosecutor has filed or joined dozens of lawsuits against the administration, and has claimed they have resulted in more than $2 billion in funds returned to the state.

Trump, who campaigned on a promise to “unleash” American oil and gas, has spent the first year of his second term bolstering fossil fuels.

In May, his Department of Justice preemptively sued Michigan, with US Attorney General Pam Bondi arguing that state climate lawsuits “threaten American energy independence and our country’s economic and national security.”

That case is pending in US District Court.

In addition to rolling back regulations on greenhouse gases and toxic coal plant pollution, Trump has canceled tens of billions of dollars’ worth of federal climate grants and clean energy subsidies while pushing instead to expand subsidies for fossil fuels.

Some $540 million in climate-related grants to Michigan have been canceled or held up since Inauguration Day. Nessel has sued the administration in hopes of reversing some of those cuts.

Nessel’s antitrust case will likely not conclude before she leaves office at the end of 2026. She expressed hope that her successor will continue to pursue the case, regardless of their party affiliation.

“Michigan is facing this affordability crisis when it comes to our energy,” she said. “This is not a partisan issue.”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Nessel-3-1.webp,N,,2026-01-26 11:02:41.967694

Investment grew even in the U.S., despite a sweeping rollback of government support for clean energy.

Last year, investors poured $893 billion into electric vehicles, $690 billion into renewable power, and $483 billion into power grids, with additional funding going to heat pumps, battery storage, nuclear power, and other technologies that promise to curb demand for fossil fuels, according to a new report from BloombergNEF.

China remains the global leader in clean energy investment, though it saw a drop in funding for renewable power last year as new regulations came into force that slowed the buildout of wind and solar. Investment in India grew by 15 percent, and in Europe by 18 percent. In the U.S., investment climbed by just 3.5 percent amid a gutting of federal support for clean energy under President Trump.

While the shift to clean energy may be unstoppable, the analysis showed that it can be slowed. Before Trump returned to office, EVs were projected to reach nearly half of U.S. car sales by the end of this decade. Now, they are on course for roughly a third, according to BNEF.

Analysts warn of another trend that threatens to slow the shift to clean energy. While China currently dominates the manufacturing of solar, batteries, and EVs, manufacturing investment is growing in the U.S. and the E.U., where governments are looking to protect fledgling industries by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports.

Albert Cheung, a lead analyst at BNEF, warned that, with tariffs, Western leaders are driving up the cost of the shift to clean energy. Rather than blocking affordable imports from China, he said, governments should be “looking for other investment opportunities where their countries may possess competitive advantage.”

These will include new offshore wind “hybrid assets” – wind farms at sea that are directly connected to more than one country through multi-purpose interconnectors (MPIs).","Almost a dozen countries have rallied together to get off the “fossil fuel rollercoaster” and transform the wind energy sector.

Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK will today (26 January) sign the Hamburg Declaration – a landmark commitment to deliver 100GW of joint offshore wind projects across shared North Sea waters by 2050. This is enough electricity to power around 143 million homes.

The €9.5 billion pact aims to turn the North Sea into the world’s “largest clean energy reservoir” and mobilise €1 trillion of capital in Europe. It is also expected to create more than 90,000 jobs and reduce power production costs by 30 per cent in the next 15 years.

The Hamburg Declaration comes just days after Donald Trump dubbed countries investing in wind power as “losers”.

How the North Sea will become a haven for wind power

Three years ago, North Sea nations pledged to build 300GW of offshore wind in the North Sea by 2050 in response to Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and “weaponisation” of Europe’s energy supplies.

A third of that is now slated to come from joint clean-energy projects. These will include new offshore wind “hybrid assets” – wind farms at sea that are directly connected to more than one country through multi-purpose interconnectors (MPIs).

There is already a network of undersea cables that connect the electricity grids of European countries, but the Hamburg Declaration marks the first time that wind farms will be directly linked to multiple nations.

In a joint statement, industry body RenewableUK and National Grid Ventures – the commercial development arm of the UK’s National Grid – say using MPIs would reduce the amount of infrastructure needed to transport electricity, slashing the impact on coastal communities and the environment.

However, interconnectors have proved controversial in Norway following concerns that power generated from MPIs could be sold to foreign countries. This stops energy bills from going down for residents and reduces their energy supplies.

To prevent this from happening, governments have started to bring in strict new rules banning electricity exports when domestic supply could be at risk.

Getting off the ‘fossil fuel rollercoaster’

“We’re standing up for our national interest by driving for clean energy, which can get the UK off the fossil fuel rollercoaster and give us energy sovereignty and abundance,” says UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband.

“After our record renewables auction, we today went further by signing a clean energy security pact with European allies to ensure we maximise the clean energy potential for the North Sea.”

Germany’s economy minister Katherina Reiche says the pact provides “reliable perspectives” for the offshore sector, helping to future-proof jobs and secure “creation of value in Europe”.

Last year, solar and wind generated more EU electricity than fossil fuels for the first time. While the milestone has been praised by energy experts, many still believe the EU’s “outdated” grid is holding back progress.",https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/62/63/68/1200x675_cmsv2_908d2f1a-4ab2-5e71-9099-c750aab33a5b-9626368.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:00:35.968538

Data centers needed to power AI, electrification and industrial reshoring are expected to double electricity demand in some regions over the next five years.

Meeting this demand rapidly and affordably will require deployment of all available energy resources, from new hydrocarbon projects to boost U.S. production to nuclear, solar and wind, to form an abundant and resilient energy ecosystem.

As the Climate Intuition: Power Rewired: A New Map of Energy and Geopolitics report recently noted, governments not treating power as a strategic asset risk missing out on economic growth as AI transforms societies.

Strategic energy resources: A broader definition

For decades, reliable access to oil and gas defined energy security. Today, the definition is expanding as technologies and markets evolve. Energy security is increasingly a question of who controls minerals, grids, financing and technologies – prompting countries to look across a broad range of sources as they prioritize energy supply growth. Countries are also recognizing that a diversified energy mix can strengthen reliability, help to stabilize costs and enhance competitiveness.

JPMorganChase is working with clients to help expand reliable energy generation capacity and secure an affordable, diversified energy mix. It advised Constellation on its $16.4B acquisition of Calpine, merging Constellation's vast nuclear fleet with Calpine's extensive natural gas and geothermal assets and enabling them to diversify their power portfolio to meet growing customer demand.

Financing across this full range of energy solutions is not about promoting one technology over another. It’s about meeting client demand and enabling an energy supply that supports U.S. competitiveness and keeps prices affordable.

Building grid resilience

Modernizing the grid—physically, technologically, and in market design— while slowing rising costs is essential to grow the economy. A resilient grid is also an important part of U.S. national and economic security. Modernizing America’s transmission and distribution systems helps to prevent disruptions from storms, demand spikes and cyber threats. Distributed generation— from renewables, natural gas, or advanced nuclear—paired with advanced grid technology, strengthens the grid by decentralizing power and reducing the risk that any one failure can take down the system.

As outlined in Climate Intuition: Resilience: Where Climate Change and National Security Meet, Ukraine’s experience shows the value of decentralized and diversified infrastructure. Distributed renewable microgrids have been harder to target and faster to deploy during rebuilding than single-site large-scale energy plants.

JPMorganChase has supported clients working to build out grid modernization and storage capacity. It served as a joint bookrunner for VoltaGrid’s $5 billion comprehensive financing package, supporting their investment in behind-the-meter natural gas power solutions for data centers. This solution provides power for data centers without impacting the surrounding grid, thus enhancing grid resiliency.

Financing grid resilience goes beyond energy – it helps safeguard the U.S. economy.

Navigating uncertain supply chains

Supply chain resilience is increasingly important to bolstering America’s competitiveness in the global energy landscape. Also, by securing access to critical minerals, such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements, and investing in domestic mining, processing, and manufacturing, the U.S. can reduce its dependence on geopolitically sensitive regions and insulate itself from export restrictions or supply disruptions.

As part of the Security and Resiliency Initiative – a $1.5 trillion, 10-year plan to facilitate, finance and invest in industries critical to national economic security and resiliency – It made a strategic equity investment in Perpetua Resources, helping to strengthen the domestic supply of critical minerals. Additionally, J.P. Morgan advised Korea Zinc and provided critical financing for its landmark transaction to build a large-scale metals smelter in the U.S., onshoring processing of 11 critical materials such as germanium and gallium.

Energy abundance as strategic advantage

By approaching diversified energy sources as strategic resources and safeguarding the supply chains behind them, the U.S. can strengthen its economy, manage energy costs, reduce vulnerabilities, and lead the industries of the future.

JPMorganChase is proud to support clients driving this transformation by helping finance the secure, abundant, affordable energy system that will power America’s next era of growth and competitiveness.",https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmorganchase/images/newsroom/stories/header-americas-strategic-edge-in-an-evolving-energy-landscape.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:03:10.128684

The project will help close Bhutan’s seasonal energy gap, eliminating the need for costly energy imports in winter, and generating surplus energy during the summer and monsoons to export to India when domestic energy demands in Bhutan are low. The savings and revenues from the project will create fiscal space for social spending and other investments to benefit the people of Bhutan.

Lyonpo Lekey Dorji, Finance Minister, Royal Government of Bhutan, commented: “The Dorjilung hydroelectric power project is a national priority and will be transformational for Bhutan – delivering clean electricity, spurring economic growth, and advancing our carbon-negative commitment. Its innovative financing structure ensures that this project does not unduly burden public finances, allowing us to continue investing in our people.”

Dorjilung will be Bhutan’s largest hydropower project developed under a public-private partnership, marking a shift to a more sustainable financing model for hydropower development and paving the way for greater private sector investment in the hydropower sector. The World Bank Group financing of US$815 million will mobilise about US$900 million from private investors.

Xavier Furtado, the World Bank Group’s Country Manager for Bhutan, added: “The World Bank Group is bringing the full strength of its institutions – International Development Association (IDA), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and International Finance Corporation (IFC) – to support the Dorjilung hydroelectric power project in Bhutan. We’ve worked with the Royal Government of Bhutan to put together a financing package designed to keep sovereign borrowing to a minimum, catalyse private sector engagement, and carefully balance risks among public and private stakeholders. This approach can serve as a model for future sustainable hydro development in Bhutan and other countries.”

The project will create thousands of jobs during the dam construction and operation; catalyse local enterprises; and support livelihoods in Mongar and Lhuentse Districts, which face higher poverty, unemployment and out-migration than the national average. The project will also upgrade roads and enhance access to markets and essential services for local communities.

The World Bank Group financing package includes a US$150 million grant and a US$150 million credit from the IDA and a US$15 million enclave loan from the IBRD to the Government of Bhutan, as well as a US$200 million IBRD enclave loan and a US$300 million ‘A loan’ from the IFC to Dorjilung Hydro Power Ltd (DHPL).

UNDP experts analyzed the impact of climate change on energy infrastructure, especially power transmission lines, and concluded that adaptation can make a real difference.","International Clean Energy Day is another reminder to reflect on the connection between climate and energy. We often assume that energy systems affect the climate but increasingly, it’s the other way around.

We're used to thinking of energy as a powerful, resilient sector, insulated from the forces of nature. But in reality, it is becoming increasingly vulnerable. Strong winds, hurricanes, freezing temperatures, heatwaves, heavy rain, and droughts can damage power plants, down transmission lines, disable substations and hydropower plants.

Imagine your home losing heating in the middle of winter. Or summer heatwaves overloading the grid, cutting off electricity to homes, hospitals, and schools. These scenarios are no longer hypothetical; they're becoming a reality, causing outages and billions in economic losses around the world.

Let’s look at examples from other countries:

In Texas, USA, extreme cold in 2021 paralyzed the power system. The equipment froze, leaving four million households without electricity.

In France and Germany, rivers overheated during summer heatwaves, disrupting cooling systems for nuclear and thermal power plants. Energy output dropped by 30 percent, driving up production costs.

In China's Hainan province, intense rainfall flooded substations, halting metro services and factory operations.

In the Alps and Himalayas, glacial melt is already affecting hydropower operations. Initially, excess water can threaten infrastructure, but later, declining water levels cause energy shortages.

This is a serious challenge for the future, and losses are expected to grow without adaptation. The good news? By preparing through adaptation, we can limit outages, reduce economic losses, and safeguard our communities and infrastructure against climate impacts.

According to the OECD report Infrastructure for a Climate-Resilient Future(link is external), well-targeted and timely investments can help protect lives and livelihoods, improve service reliability, reduce maintenance costs, extend asset lifespans, and generate co-benefits. Every dollar invested in climate-resilient infrastructure yields about four dollars of benefits.

In Kazakhstan, hundreds of thousands of kilometers of power lines stretch across steppes, mountains, and flood-prone areas. According to UNDP assessments, the country is already experiencing more frequent heatwaves and deep freezes, heavier rainfall, more floods, higher winds, altered river flows, and glacial melt.

Economic modeling conducted by UNDP in Kazakhstan as part of the National Adaptation Plan process shows that climate-related losses could reach nearly 400 billion tenge by 2050, and up to 66.9 trillion tenge by 2100. These figures leave no doubt: energy is a critical pillar of climate adaptation.

UNDP experts analyzed the impact of climate change on energy infrastructure, especially power transmission lines, and concluded that adaptation can make a real difference. Measures such as upgrading power lines with weather-resistant materials, laying underground or insulated cables in vulnerable areas, developing smart grids and weather monitoring systems, and protecting substations from floods and overheating all bring measurable economic benefits. With investments of 2.9 trillion tenge by 2100, Kazakhstan could avoid 2.1 trillion tenge in losses from outages and disruptions.

Even if the savings don’t fully cover the costs, the strategic value of these investments is enormous: they increase energy reliability, reduce the frequency of breakdowns, and prevent cascading losses across industry, transport, and public services.

Adapting transmission lines is not just an expense, it’s a long-term investment in the country’s energy and economic security. And it requires action across the entire sector.

Priority adaptation measures for Kazakhstan include:

Upgrading transmission lines using climate-resilient materials;

Laying underground or insulated cables in high-risk zones;

Expanding smart grids and early warning systems for extreme weather;

Protecting substations from flooding and overheating;

Diversifying energy sources and scaling up renewable generation.

Clean energy is not only about reducing emissions it’s also about withstanding climate risks. On International Clean Energy Day, it’s worth remembering: resilience means protecting people, ensuring their safety and comfort, and securing the future of our country.",https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/styles/scaled_image_large/public/2026-01/ai_image_for_energy_blog.png?itok=jeeSq3xC,N,,2026-01-26 12:01:32.109373

HyFlex, an award-winning solution, plays a key role in making hybrid energy hubs practical and scalable for zero-emission construction sites.
During these initiatives, Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex®-powered construction sites, including electric construction machinery, operated in areas without access to the power grid.","Hitachi Energy has completed the deployment of a zero-emission construction site in the United Kingdom. For four weeks, the company powered its own construction site as part of a National Grid 400 kilovolt (kV) grid connection project in Rugeley, Staffordshire, mitigating emissions from conventional diesel generators. The self-funded initiative reflects the company’s commitment to sustainability and the targets of achieving net-zero by 2050¹.

During this time, the site relied on Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex® hydrogen-powered generator supplied with clean green hydrogen from Air Products, together with a battery energy storage system (BESS). Based on an estimated electricity consumption of up to 5.2 megawatt-hour (MWh), the project avoided around five tonnes of CO₂ emissions compared to conventional diesel generators during the four-week period—roughly equivalent to two round-trip economy-class flights between London and New York. This achievement demonstrates the technology readiness for real-world application and marks a significant step toward fossil-free construction.

Green hydrogen is becoming increasingly central to the energy transition. Its versatility as a clean energy carrier offers strong potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and indirectly electrify industrial processes. The construction sector alone accounts for over a third of global energy-related CO₂ emissions3, and the footprint of building operations continues to rise.

Policy momentum is accelerating this shift. In the UK, the Construction Leadership Council’s Zero Diesel Sites Route Map sets a target to cut diesel use on construction sites by 78 percent by 20354, highlighting the urgency to replace conventional generators with cleaner alternatives. As emission-free construction requirements expand across Europe, flexible energy hubs are a key enabler for sites that need affordable, reliable, and clean power. Hitachi Energy supports these hubs with its broader offering, which includes mobile BESS, charging infrastructure, and advanced energy management systems. HyFlex, an award-winning solution, plays a key role in making hybrid energy hubs practical and scalable for zero-emission construction sites.

The Rugeley case builds on the success of earlier pioneering HyFlex® deployments across Europe in collaborations involving leading companies such as Kanonaden, Volvo, the Port of Gothenburg, and Dura Vermeer. During these initiatives, Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex®-powered construction sites, including electric construction machinery, operated in areas without access to the power grid.

All that snow will intensify the cold for days ahead. It will never feel above zero today, according to 9 First Warning Weather. A cold weather advisory is in effect Monday because of the cold. That continues until 6 p.m. Then, starting at 6 p.m., an extreme cold warning begins for the Tri-State and will continue through 12 p.m. Tuesday.

This warning means that dangerously cold wind chills are expected.

Snow-covered Roads

Roads will remain in bad condition, though no new snow is in expected.

Road crews have been going non-stop since before the snow started Saturday. The Ohio Department of Transportation is responsible for the state highway system — that is state, federal and interstate routes outside of municipalities.

Public Information Officer Kathleen Fuller spoke with WVXU early Monday morning.

""Right now, we still have a lot of snow covered roads but we are making progress, particularly on the interstates in Hamilton County. We are getting some things, not fully cleared by any means, but we are seeing some pavement. There has been progress made,"" she said.

Fuller notes the extreme cold isn't going to help things any.

""There will be a tremendous impact. Because of the cold temperatures, materials are going to be somewhat ineffective. So it's really just a lot of having the plows down on the pavement and trying to push it off. We really just hope that ... the snow hasn't turned into some sort of ice and compacted to the pavement, and that is a real threat,"" she says.

The best way to help is to stay off the roads. If you do have to drive, give plows plenty of space to work.

As plow crews in your community get to clearing secondary streets and neighborhoods, officials have a big recommendation to save yourself a lot of headache: You should shovel snow to the right side of your driveway — that's to your right as you're facing the street. Doing this helps prevent snow from being pushed back into your driveway when the plow comes through.

Snow emergencies

As of 10:00 a.m. Hamilton County will drop down to a Level Two snow emergencies. The following emergency levels were in effect as of 10 a.m. Monday:

Level 3:

Ohio: Highland County

Kentucky: Bracken, Mason, Gallatin, Grant, Owen and Pendleton counties.

Power

There's good news from an energy standpoint. As of 7:30 a.m. Monday, Duke Energy was reporting only a handful of customers in the area without power.

We've, so far, dodged a potential catastrophe that could have been caused with ice build-up on power lines. Duke says half an inch of ice can down power lines. That's usually caused by freezing rain; sleet poses less of a risk because it doesn't accumulate on lines.

Photovoltaic solar energy conversion is of high importance in Europe’s transition toward a clean, resilient, and climate-neutral energy system. While silicon solar modules dominate today’s PV market, their rigidity, weight, and limited design flexibility constrain their use in many emerging applications. In contrast, next-generation thin-film photovoltaic technologies, particularly perovskite solar cells, enable solar energy generation in areas where conventional photovoltaics are less suitable.

Among these emerging technologies, perovskite solar cells have attracted great attention over the past decade. Their rapid rise in power conversion efficiency, now exceeding 27%, combined with low-temperature processing and compatibility with flexible substrates, positions them as a disruptive alternative to conventional photovoltaics. However, these high-performance perovskite solar cells contain lead, which raises environmental and societal concerns and could challenge large-scale deployment.

The EU-funded Horizon Europe project SMARTLINE-PV addresses this challenge by developing scalable, tin halide perovskite solar cells with the focus on innovative crystallisation technologies. By combining material innovation, plasma-assisted processing, ecodesign, and application-driven demonstrators, SMARTLINE-PV aims to unlock new areas of applications, in particular, in the rapidly growing fields of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV).

A strong European consortium driving innovation

SMARTLINE-PV brings together a multidisciplinary consortium of 13 partners from across Europe, combining academic and applied research expertise, and industrial know-how. The universities and research organisations (Graz University of Technology, HZB, Joanneum Research, CNR, Fraunhofer ISE, CEA, and bifa Umweltinstitut) lead the development of advanced tin perovskite materials, crystallisation chemistry, device architectures, module integration, sustainability assessment, and circularity, while the industrial partners (INO GmbH, temicon, Homerun Energy, COMTES FHT, Terran and FILBAU) focus on scalable processing, roll-to-roll compatibility, and market-oriented design. This tightly integrated collaboration enables SMARTLINE-PV to bridge the gap between fundamental materials research and industrially relevant photovoltaic solutions, enabling a transition from laboratory innovation to deployable clean-energy technologies.

From lead to tin: A sustainable materials shift

Replacing lead with tin in perovskite solar cells is a promising route towards environmentally friendly photovoltaics. Tin halide perovskites share many of the favourable optoelectronic properties of their lead-based counterparts, including strong light absorption and excellent charge transport. Encouragingly, tin-based perovskite solar cells have already demonstrated efficiencies exceeding 17%.

Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain. Tin perovskites are prone to fast crystallisation, high defect densities, and chemical instability, in particular, due to the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. These factors negatively impact device efficiency, reproducibility, long-term stability, and large-area fabrication.

SMARTLINE-PV tackles these issues through novel precursor chemistry and crystallisation control strategies. Innovative crystallisation mediators are designed to slow down the crystal formation process, allowing tin perovskite films to grow with fewer defects and improved structural uniformity. In parallel, the project explores non-oxidising solvents, hydrogen-bond interactions, and halide-halide interactions to stabilise the tin oxidation state and further improve film quality. These material innovations lay the foundation for high-performance, stable tin halide perovskite solar cells that are suitable not only for laboratory demonstrations, but also for industrially relevant manufacturing.

Plasma-assisted crystallisation for scalable manufacturing

Conventional perovskite fabrication often relies on anti-solvent dripping, a process that is difficult to control, solvent-intensive, and not well suited for large-area or roll-to-roll production. In contrast, the plasma-assisted approach, investigated in SMARTLINE-PV, enables fast, solvent-free crystallisation at low temperatures, offering good control over nucleation and crystal growth. By combining optimised precursor formulations with carefully tuned plasma conditions, uniform and high-quality perovskite films can be produced without anti-solvents. This process is also well compatible with roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing, enabling continuous deposition on large-area flexible substrates. This compatibility represents an important step toward industrial scalability, reduced energy consumption, and lower production costs.

Device engineering for efficiency and stability

In addition to the optimisation of the perovskite absorber, SMARTLINE-PV focuses on customising the device architecture specifically for tin perovskites. Tailored interlayers are developed to enhance charge extraction, suppress recombination losses, and protect sensitive interfaces within the solar cell stack. Novel device architectures are explored to improve mechanical flexibility and long-term operational stability under real-world conditions.

Through this integrated approach, SMARTLINE-PV aims to achieve efficiencies above 20% for tin-based perovskite solar cells, an ambitious but realistic target that would highlight the potential of this solar cell technology as a viable alternative to established thin-film technologies.

Coloured modules through the MorphoColor concept and building integration

In the built environment, solar energy systems are expected to combine performance with design and functionality. SMARTLINE-PV addresses this by enabling colour variation in tin perovskite solar cell modules through the MorphoColor concept, which is inspired by the structural colouration found in butterfly wings. The MorphoColor concept relies on photonic structures that combine geometrically patterned substrates with interference layers to create bright, customisable colours without relying on pigments. This approach enables perovskite solar modules with selectable colour, which are ideally suited for architectural integration.

For BIPV applications, this design freedom is transformative. Facades, sunshades, and roof elements can simultaneously generate electricity and contribute to the visual identity of buildings, an essential factor for deployment in urban and historic environments.

Ecodesign, circularity and low carbon footprint

Sustainability is a guiding principle throughout SMARTLINE-PV. The project integrates eco-design and circularity concepts across the entire lifecycle of the solar cells, from raw materials and manufacturing to use, recycling, and end-of-life considerations. Low-temperature, fast processing reduces energy demand during fabrication, contributing to a low carbon footprint compared to conventional photovoltaic technologies. The elimination of lead and solvent-intensive processing further enhances environmental compatibility and social acceptance.

Demonstrators supporting technology transfer

To bridge the gap between laboratory research and practical deployment, SMARTLINE-PV places strong emphasis on application-oriented demonstrators. Flexible tin perovskite solar modules are integrated into IoT devices, enabling autonomous, maintenance-free power supplies for sensors and smart systems.

In parallel, BIPV demonstrators showcase the integration of flexible, colour-selectable modules into building elements such as roof tiles and sunshades. These demonstrators are tested under real-world conditions, providing valuable data on performance, durability, and user acceptance.

Shaping the future of thin-film photovoltaics

By addressing efficiency, scalability, sustainability, and aesthetics through a holistic approach, SMARTLINE-PV represents a significant step toward a new generation of thin-film photovoltaics. The project demonstrates that tin-based perovskite solar cells can move beyond niche research topics and become viable candidates for real-world applications.

SMARTLINE-PV demonstrates how advanced materials research, innovative processing, and thoughtful design can be combined to develop practical and impactful photovoltaic solutions. By addressing both technical performance and integration aspects, the project supports the broader adoption of photovoltaics in everyday applications and contributes to a more sustainable built environment.

Around 65,000 new jobs are expected to be required across the UK battery supply chain as electrification accelerates.
Many of the core skills required for battery manufacturing already exist in adjacent industries.
Its training portfolio ranges from introductory courses explaining battery manufacturing fundamentals to deep-dive, hands-on experience on a live production line.
“We’re currently the only place in the world where you can get line-side experience in a real battery manufacturing environment,” Deeley-Williamson said.","By any measure, the UK’s transition to electrified transport is accelerating. Gigafactory announcements, electric vehicle (EV) targets and investment in battery research dominate headlines. Yet, as Jonty Deeley-Williamson, head of learning and development at the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC), argues, there is a critical enabler that remains consistently underplayed: skills

Speaking to an audience of engineers and industry leaders at Advanced Engineering, Deeley-Williamson was direct about the challenge. “People keep telling me how great their technology is, or how electrification will magically solve everything,” he said. “But when I ask about skills, I get blank looks. These factories don’t run themselves.”

UKBIC’S ROLE IN THE BATTERY ECOSYSTEM

UKBIC occupies a unique position in the UK and global battery landscape. Based in Coventry, it is the world’s only open-access battery manufacturing facility covering the full process chain from electrode manufacture through to module and pack assembly. Crucially, it does not retain intellectual property. Instead, it exists to de-risk manufacturing scale-up and develop capability. “We’re not here to own IP,” Deeley-Williamson explained. “What we care about is making sure people can actually run these processes at scale.”

That focus is timely. Around 65,000 new jobs are expected to be required across the UK battery supply chain as electrification accelerates. Without a coordinated approach to skills development, there is a real risk that capital investment in factories and R&D will outpace the availability of a trained workforce.

A WIDENING SKILLS GAP

The UK currently has only two confirmed large-scale battery manufacturing projects under construction: AESC in the North East and Agratas in the Midlands. To meet projected automotive demand alone, the UK would need to roughly double its planned gigafactory capacity. That figure excludes additional demand from heavy goods vehicles, off-highway machinery, rail, marine and stationary energy storage.

“These numbers are still educated guesses,” Deeley-Williamson noted. “But even the conservative estimates show we are several gigafactories short – and every one of those needs hundreds, if not thousands, of skilled operators and technicians.”

Compounding the issue is the reality that electrification is not a simple workforce transition from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to batteries. For the foreseeable future, both technologies will coexist. That limits the pool of experienced workers who can be directly redeployed.

“We’re not just flipping a switch,” he said. “You can’t assume the existing ICE workforce will simply move across. Many of the roles are different, and we need new entrants as well as reskilled staff.”

MANUFACTURING AT ALL LEVELS

According to Deely-Williamon, persistent misconception is that battery manufacturing is dominated by PhD-level scientists. In reality, around 80–90% of roles in a gigafactory are Level 2 or Level 3 technical and vocational positions. “This is normal manufacturing, just cleaner,” he said. “Production operators, maintenance technicians, quality technicians - these are the backbone of the industry.”

Each gigawatt-hour of battery manufacturing capacity typically supports around 180 direct manufacturing jobs, with at least 120 linked to automotive supply. As capacity scales, job creation is broadly linear. This has significant implications for education policy. While the UK has strong university-based battery research through organisations such as the Faraday Institution, vocational education and further education colleges have historically been under-supported. “We’ve invested heavily in universities, but we’ve left vocational education behind,” Deeley-Williamson said. “If we lose people at Level 2 and Level 3, the whole system falls over.”

TRANSFERABLE SKILLS: A HIDDEN ADVANTAGE

Despite the scale of the challenge, Deeley-Williamson is optimistic. Many of the core skills required for battery manufacturing already exist in adjacent industries. “If you walk through a battery plant, you’ll be surprised how much of the equipment comes from elsewhere,” he said. “Mixers came from concrete and food processing. Cell assembly looks a lot like electronics manufacturing. Maintenance and machine minding are universal skills.”

This creates an opportunity to reskill workers from industries in decline, rather than starting from scratch. Process control, statistical analysis, equipment maintenance and quality assurance are all transferable competencies.

UKBIC has built a structured skills ecosystem spanning Levels 2 to 5, complementing higher-level academic provision. Its training portfolio ranges from introductory courses explaining battery manufacturing fundamentals to deep-dive, hands-on experience on a live production line.

“We’re currently the only place in the world where you can get line-side experience in a real battery manufacturing environment,” Deeley-Williamson said. “Most commercial plants won’t let you anywhere near their lines.”

UKBIC has also led the development of the UK’s first Battery Manufacturing Technician apprenticeship standard, now adopted internationally in countries including Germany, France and Singapore. Additional short courses are being developed to support automotive workers, service leavers and those transitioning from ICE manufacturing.

Batteries account for around 62% of the value and weight of an electric vehicle. If the UK fails to build them domestically, it risks higher import costs, exposure to trade barriers and the loss of a strategically important manufacturing sector.

“We’re already seeing what happens when we don’t act,” Deeley-Williamson warned, pointing to the dominance of Asian manufacturers, who currently account for around 94% of global battery production. “This isn’t about losing a niche industry – it’s about losing the heart of future vehicle manufacturing.”",,N,,2026-01-26 08:58:40.609785

Cheap prices, government subsidies and a growing charging network all point to continued sales growth for China’s automakers in the country.

Mexico City is abuzz with cheap, battery-powered compacts made by the likes of China's BYD Co. The world’s largest EV maker nearly doubled its Mexican sales volume last year and now accounts for about 7 of every 10 electric and plugin hybrid vehicles sold there, according to estimates from BloombergNEF.

EVs or plugins account for 9% of new-car sales, making it a growing segment in Mexico that many other global brands have bypassed. It's a sign of how Chinese automakers see opportunity in developing economies with infrastructure challenges, fragmented distribution and lower income levels.

Middle-class city dwellers are lured by these EVs’ affordability. Mexico City resident Monica Reyes Rosas, a 49-year-old voice-over agent, is one of them. She drove a gas-powered Ford Ranger each day for the better part of six years until she made the switch last month to a BYD King plugin hybrid sedan that cost her $26,307. “You save a lot on gasoline and the price is extremely competitive,” Reyes said.

BYD’s Dolphin Mini EV, its most popular model, sells for about $2,000 less than its nearest competitor, the battery-powered Chevrolet Spark EUV, which was introduced to the market just over six months ago.

The swift incursion of Chinese cars has taken Mexico by surprise, leading to concerns by legacy carmakers with manufacturing operations in Mexico and pressure from the U.S. government. As part of a wider effort to address growing dependence on China, in September President Claudia Sheinbaum proposed tariffs as high as 50% on some products from countries that don’t have free trade deals with Mexico, which included Chinese auto imports.",https://cdn.magzter.com/images/refer/referandearn/MagzterGoldShare.png,N,,2026-01-26 12:02:58.807947

The department claimed around US$85 billion of these loans had been “rushed out of the door” after Donald Trump’s second-term election victory last November.

It said EDF had completed or was in the process of de-obligating US$30 billion of the loans, with the other US$53 billion under revision.

A statement on the move provided no details on the projects that would be losing funding or on how those under revision would be revised. But it said the EDF had already “eliminated” around US$9.5 billion in “government-subsidised, intermittent wind and solar projects” and was “replacing them with investments in natural gas and nuclear uprates that provide more affordable and reliable energy for the American people”.

According to the DOE, the EDF has US$289 billion in available loan authority, and has already closed three loans, including one to a nuclear restart project in Pennsylvania and another to a coal and ammonia fertiliser facility in Indiana.

Energy secretary Chris Wright said: “Over the past year, the Energy Department individually reviewed our entire loan portfolio to ensure the responsible investment of taxpayer dollars. We found more dollars were rushed out the door of the Loan Programs Office in the final months of the Biden Administration than had been disbursed in over fifteen years.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/US-energy-secretary-Chris-Wright.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 09:59:03.853665

When the Senate passes the last of the appropriations bills — which is supposed to happen this week — Republicans and Democrats will have secured more than 8,400 earmarks collectively worth more than $15.7 billion for projects in their home states and districts.

The approval of those earmarks will be a welcome development for lawmakers who have waited nearly two years to secure funding for local initiatives such as road and transit improvements, dam and lock maintenance, wildfire mitigation, and wastewater and sewer projects.

That’s because the earmarks in the fiscal 2026 bills are the first since fiscal 2024. Congress passed a continuing resolution for fiscal 2025 that deprived members of their allocations.

In some cases, the lack of statutory direction in the funding patch allowed the Trump administration to more easily freeze or cancel funds, including for water infrastructure projects led by the Army Corps of Engineers.

Now, lawmakers are making up for lost time and celebrating the massive hauls many of them are about to get.

“My message to [President] Donald Trump: Don’t mess with our water. Don’t mess with our fish,” said Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray (D-Wash.) in a speech last week, touting a $190 million earmark she secured for a dam project along with Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.).

“Just like salmon, I’m never giving up,” Murray said. “We’re going to muscle upstream and get this project and win this fight.”

Lawmakers are set to win many of the earmarks they requested last year, and in some cases two years ago. Republicans — especially senior appropriators — are poised to reap the largest windfalls.

Still, hurdles remain. Some fiscal conservatives have been speaking out about the earmarks. And Democrats want to renegotiate the Homeland Security spending bill after federal agents killed a second person in Minnesota amid protests against the administration’s immigration enforcement actions.

Six fiscal 2026 bills already cleared Congress — including Energy-Water and Interior-Environment — but the Homeland Security measure is packaged with five others that remain pending.

But even if Democrats succeed in isolating the Homeland Security bill, that would only jeopardize a fraction of planned earmarks. There is little appetite for a partial government shutdown.

Army Corps projects win big

Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), chair of the House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, will have his name on the largest earmark across all spending bills: a $213 million designation for a long-running Army Corps project at the Chickamauga Lock in Tennessee.

The blockbuster earmark is Fleischmann’s latest major contribution to the lock project. In fiscal 2024, he led all House members in earmarked dollars, including a $236.8 million request for the Chickamauga Lock.

Fleischmann has called it “a critically important project for Tennessee,” and he noted in his fiscal 2026 request that delays have necessitated more funding. The upgrades, he said, will help make cargo transport more efficient — including for the movement of equipment needed to produce nuclear power.

Cantwell and Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, are set to come away with the $190 million earmark for the Hanson Dam, which would go toward a water storage and fish passage project.

At a press conference just downstream of the dam, Murray said the project is intended to reduce flood risk and support long-term water availability for more than 1 million residents.

The next-largest earmark, also in the compromise Energy-Water bill, would provide $183.8 million for construction at Montgomery Locks and Dam on the Ohio River.

It was requested by Sens. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) and Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), as well as Reps. Chris Deluzio (D-Pa.) and Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.).

Deluzio and Reschenthaler said in their joint request that the locks modernization effort would help boost the region’s economy, support shipping and supply chains, and result in “significant environmental advantages.”

A major hurricane damage mitigation system in coastal Louisiana will benefit from the fourth-largest earmark across all spending bills: $131.5 million.

The earmark for the Morganza to the Gulf project likely benefited from the backing of powerful lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), chair of the Senate’s Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee.

“My approach on the Senate Appropriations Committee is simple,” Kennedy said in a statement. “I won’t ask for a penny more than Louisiana needs, and I won’t take a penny less than Louisiana deserves.”

Money for climate corps, pipelines

The fiscal 2026 funding bills are loaded with thousands of smaller earmarks for a variety of projects.

The vast majority of earmarks in the Interior-Environment bill draw from EPA’s Clean and Drinking Water state revolving funds. Most of them will fund local wastewater, sewage and irrigation projects.

The Labor-HHS-Education bill contains a $1.03 million request from Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) that would go toward a “Climate Corps Fellowship.”

Conservative Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) called out the earmark earlier this month as one that he wanted congressional leaders to consider scrapping.

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) was granted a vote on an amendment to remove earmarks from the Labor-HHS-Education bill; it failed easily.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), chair of the Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, secured a $730,000 earmark to fund job training for renewable energy development in her home state.

The senior appropriator is also getting a $2.5 million request to fund training and equipment for constructing and maintaining pipelines.

Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) has secured $11 million for a well-field pipeline project.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) is set to bring home $10 million for a Forest Service ranger station in the White Mountain National Forest.

Even Republicans who consider themselves fiscally conservative and have openly criticized earmarks are set to come away with funding for their districts.

House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) previously blasted a large earmark secured by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Two years ago, he fought to eliminate an earmark for a nonprofit that provided services to LGBTQ+ individuals.

For fiscal 2026, Harris, who chairs the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, has secured tens of millions of dollars for projects in his home district, including Army Corps maintenance projects, a wastewater treatment plant and a youth crisis center.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/bf/5c/73e960dd4aeba0bb620eb41e3421/u-s-congress-30745.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 07:59:11.300772

PJM predicts demand at 147.2 gigawatts, which would beat the current record winter electricity demand of 143.7 GW set in January 2025.

Dominion was not immediately available to comment about Sunday’s price moves. In the utility’s zone of the PJM territory, demand approached about 23 gigawatts per hour at 10 a.m. EDT, about 5% higher than the original forecast, according to PJM data.

Spot wholesale electricity prices across the U.S. have been elevated throughout the weekend as regional grids strain to meet surging demand. When demand is higher than the forecasts for utility companies, they can be forced to pay elevated spot prices for electricity to meet the demands of their residential and business customers.

Regional grids feed their power into the local distribution lines that bring electricity to homes and businesses. Those local power lines are showing disruptions, with nearly 900,000 customers without power on Sunday, according to PowerOutage.us, with more than 300,000 in Tennessee and more than 100,000 each in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana. Other states affected included Kentucky, Georgia, Virginia and Alabama.

Despite Musk’s active presence on X, electric vehicles remain the core of Tesla’s business. However, Tesla has lost its top spot as the world’s leading EV manufacturer. The company recently reported delivering approximately 1.6 million vehicles last year—a 9% decline from 2024—while China’s BYD sold 2.3 million units, overtaking Tesla.

The company faces both industry-wide and unique challenges. The end of certain U.S. tax credits and competitive pricing for used EVs have impacted sales, while Tesla-specific issues include some owners expressing dissatisfaction by purchasing “Elon Sucks” bumper stickers.

Both Tesla and its investors are shifting their attention to new priorities:

Next-Gen Roadster and Shareholder Focus: Tesla engineer Lars Marovy described the upcoming Roadster, which could enter production as early as next year, as “the last best driver’s car.” Meanwhile, four of the top five questions shareholders want addressed at the earnings call relate to full self-driving and the Optimus robot, with another question about whether Tesla shareholders will get priority if SpaceX goes public (source, source).

Mixed Progress on Innovation: Last week, Tesla introduced a small fleet of driverless robotaxis in Austin, relying solely on cameras rather than additional sensors—a move that has sparked concern among critics about the technology’s readiness for broader deployment (source). Production of Cybercabs is slated to begin this year, with Optimus robots potentially following next year.

Tech Giants and Market Sentiment

Magnificent 7 or MANGO? Tesla is among the first of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies to report earnings this season, alongside Meta and Microsoft. However, as generative AI firms increasingly capture attention, some question whether these tech giants’ results still best reflect overall investor sentiment. Online discussions have even proposed a new acronym—MANGO—standing for Microsoft, Anthropic, Nvidia, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI (source).

The promise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in residential energy is consumer empowerment, yet without appropriate governance the emerging reality may be its opposite. As households become data producers, behavioural subjects, and operational assets within intelligent electricity networks, a troubling asymmetry is taking shape: while consumers gain new modes of participation and value creation, they simultaneously face deepening opacity, dependency, and systemic exposure.

This asymmetry stems from a quiet migration of control. As optimisation and coordination become automated, decision-making shifts from individual households to platform operators, aggregators, and technology providers. A new layer of intermediation emerges-one where consumers engage markets not directly, but through algorithmic interfaces whose logic, data practices, and profit distribution remain largely invisible to them.

More subtly, AI is beginning to govern household behaviour itself. Nudges and adaptive controls embedded in everyday devices steer users toward predefined goals-efficiency, load shifting-often without explicit awareness. These systems learn habits, anticipate preferences, and adjust operations accordingly, gradually transforming voluntary decisions into algorithmically mediated routines. The shift is foundational: from enabling informed choice to shaping choice itself.

Yet this trajectory is not inevitable. The central argument of this paper is that AI’s impact on the consumer-energy relationship depends less on technology than on the institutions governing it. Without proactive oversight, digitalisation risks entrenching inequality and eroding agency; with adaptive, transparent regulation, it can democratise participation and accelerate clean energy transitions. To navigate this, the paper proposes a framework linking consumer, system, and institutional governance to eight guiding principles: privacy, autonomy, fairness, coordination, stability, resilience, transparency, and accountability.

Using municipal bond climate risk disclosures to identify gaps in water utility climate risk preparedness The developed water utility climate risk index captures the determinants of risk (hazard, exposure, and vulnerability) but does not include any utility actions aimed at addressing climate change.","Drinking water climate exposure and vulnerability indexes

It is challenging to compare climate vulnerabilities among utilities and validate comparisons as there are few databases with publicly accessible information25. Existing drinking water vulnerability and performance indices, which do not address climate risks, have been developed using regional datasets or case study approaches25,26,27. Our goal was to develop open access drinking water utility vulnerability and exposure indexes for as many systems as possible in the United States, given data availability limitations.

Nine indicators were drawn from three different public databases (Table 1 and SI Fig. S1) to capture dimensions of climate vulnerability and exposure of drinking water utilities. These include five utility system characteristics chosen to capture dimensions of vulnerability and four chosen to capture dimensions of exposure. The choices of indicators and utility system characteristics were informed by data availability, and data limitations restrict the number of utilities assessed in the analysis. To enable comparison of the climate risk index with information from municipal bonds, the analysis was further limited to municipal water utilities that have issued a municipal bond in the past 10 years. See Methods for additional details about the data sources.

Distributions of the vulnerability indicators (Fig. 1, left) reveal the relative numbers of utilities experiencing each aspect of vulnerability. The wide distribution for infrastructure age indicates that some utilities are older and others are younger, while the heavily right skewed distribution for water quality health indicates most utilities are currently in compliance with regulations. There is a minimal correlation between physical system health and financial health (R2 = 0.25), indicating that, for this subset of utilities, a utility’s finances do not guarantee a reliable physical infrastructure system. The five indicators were combined into an overall vulnerability index (see “Methods” section for more details). The map in Fig. 1 identifies the utilities with combined vulnerability indexes at the 90th percentile or higher. Around 70% of the most vulnerable utilities are located in the Upper Midwest, Ohio Valley, and Northeast. This is due to older infrastructure, slightly lower operating ratios, and in the Upper Midwest and Northeast, higher drinking water non-compliance scores. For these most vulnerable utilities, vulnerability is mainly concentrated in one dimension (i.e., poor physical system health or poor financial health), with around half of the utilities (48.5%) showing high physical vulnerability, 28.3% showing high financial vulnerability, and 26.1% high in both dimensions of vulnerability. Many of these utilities, including Toledo, OH; Troy, NY; and Saginaw, MI, have been identified previously as vulnerable utilities by other composite indices using different indicators25,27.

Most utilities have overall lower exposure to climate change compared to a few highly exposed systems and the distributions of the four exposure indicators (Fig. 2, left) are all very narrow, indicating limited variations between utilities. The four exposure indicators were combined into an overall exposure index (see “Methods” section for more details). The map in Fig. 2 shows that the utilities with relatively higher exposure (90th percentile exposure index) are distributed across the country; every region has some exposed utilities. Many of the most exposed utilities have high per capita employment rates. Texas has a large portion of the most exposed utilities with high per capita service connections or service areas. Some cities, including Hillsborough, CA and Ferndale, MI, have high annual costs of service and thus larger exposure of their finances if disruptions to the system were to occur.

Combined climate risk scores

Drinking water utility climate risk is calculated from the product of the individual exposure and vulnerability indices, as well as mid-century climate change projection hazard index values (see Methods section)1. The distribution of the combined risk index (Fig. S8) is right skewed; a few utilities have comparatively higher climate risk. The hazard index values are larger on average than the other indices, meaning this component has a greater influence on the combined risk index. This is an accurate representation of how climate risk will manifest in drinking water utilities; most will experience changes in climate hazards, while few have notably higher exposure or vulnerability. This is an important property of this risk model because the changes in climate hazards are external stressors that might be unknown to the system, compared to other system financial or infrastructure characteristics that the utility has more ability to affect.

Drinking water utility climate risk is geographically distributed across the US (Fig. 3). The regions with the highest average risk are the Northeast and West (Fig. S9) but the South, Upper Midwest, and Ohio Valley also have large numbers of utilities classified as higher risk (Fig. S10). While Western US regions are likely to see comparatively larger changes in climate hazards, smaller magnitude changes in hazards in the Northeast, South, Upper Midwest, and Ohio Valley coupled with existing vulnerabilities and exposure, means these utilities are also at risk. These utilities could experience more difficulty recovering from climate change hazards, given the lack of current adaptive capacity. Surface water systems have a higher average climate risk score than groundwater systems (Fig. S14) and a slightly larger portion of utilities that use surface water (27%, 264 out of 991 systems) are classified as having high climate risk, compared to those that use groundwater (21%, 93 out of 442 systems), see SI Fig. S15. Utilities serving more than 1 million customers have the highest average climate risk scores, likely due to their proximity to the coasts, though overall there are minimal differences in average climate risk score by population size served (Fig. S16). The utilities with high or moderate climate risk scores serve ~67 million customers.

One indicator from each of the vulnerability, exposure, and hazard indices was omitted (infrastructure age, service costs, and sea level rise projections) to assess how sensitive the climate risk index is to the included indicators. Infrastructure age (represented through a proxy of median housing age) was included in the index to capture the health of infrastructure assets. There is regional variation in housing age across the country so removing this indicator from the index had an effect on regional averages (Fig. S11). The Northeast, Upper Midwest, and Ohio Valley had comparatively lower risk values when infrastructure age was not considered, though the modified index was strongly correlated with the original index (R2 = 0.80). The service cost of delivering a set amount of water per household was included in the index to capture utility financial exposure. Service costs also vary widely across the country, and there were numerous utilities included in the sample with missing cost data (regional medians were used instead). Omitting service costs had a minimal overall effect on the risk index (correlation between modified index values and original was significant, R2 = 0.88). Higher service costs in California meant the West region had a lower average risk index value when this indicator was omitted (Fig. S12). Sea level rise was included in the original hazard index because it can affect groundwater systems and buried infrastructure. Omitting sea level rise had a minimal effect on regional averages of the risk index, as so many utilities are unaffected (R2 = 0.96), see Fig. S13.

Gaps in water utility climate risk understanding

The developed index identifies which utilities face the highest risks from climate hazards but does not account for any actions the utility might have taken to address climate change and reduce their risk. Twenty-three percent (378 out of 1611 utilities) of all the analyzed municipal bond official statements mentioned climate change, though a higher portion of revenue bonds (33.0%) compared to general obligation bonds (19.7%) mentioned climate change. A similar fraction (30%) of all municipal offering statements mention climate change42. This could indicate a recognition by municipalities that repayment based on income from service rates is more susceptible to climate hazards than repayment based on taxes, or there could be a confounding size effect as larger utilities might be more likely to issue revenue bonds than general obligation bonds. Prior work also found that many drinking water utility managers do not consider their systems to be at risk20. Looking at trends in population served and geographical region (Figs. S17 and S18), utilities serving larger population sizes and located in the West or Northwest disclosed climate risk more often than other utilities. Climate change mentions are becoming more common, with 30% of the utilities discussing climate change within their bond statements in 2023 and 2024 (Fig. S19), compared with only 9.1% of utilities in statements from before 2020.

Utilities that mention climate change in their municipal bond official statements have similar distributions of bond ratings (Fig. S20) and climate risk (Fig. S21) when compared with those that do not disclose such climate risk (i.e., there are no discernible effects of mentioning climate risk within an official statement on having a better bond rating). Similarly, there is no observed relationship between the drinking water bond ratings and climate risk disclosures (R2 = 0.12) and a slightly negative relationship between bond ratings and climate risk index values (R2 = −0.39). This aligns with other research findings that physical climate risks are largely not yet factored into municipal bond markets or ratings43,44.

A comparison of calculated climate risk index values and climate change awareness identified high risk utilities that might not be aware of their risks. This category of utilities are good candidates for policy interventions that educate systems about all potential links between climate hazards and utility functions20. A larger proportion of utilities classified as having high climate risk mentioned climate change in bond statements, compared to those with lower overall climate risk (Fig. S22). This could indicate current guidance and recommendations are successfully being communicated to the highest risk utilities. Similarly, a slightly higher percentage of utilities exposed to multiple types of climate hazards (27.3%) mentioned climate change in their bond statements, compared to only 22.9% of utilities that are not projected to exceed multiple climate thresholds (Fig. S23).

Of the 146 drinking water utilities within the 90th percentile of climate risk scores, a majority (65%, 95 utilities) did not mention climate change in their official bond statements. Most of these utilities are located in the South (the majority of which are located in Texas), Ohio Valley, or Midwest. Of the high-risk utilities that did mention climate change, most are located in the West (mainly California). About half of the most at-risk utilities in the Northeast mentioned climate change in their bond statements and half didn’t; there is no discernable difference in the characteristics of either group of utilities.

Along with overall mentions of climate change, the frequency with which the drinking water utilities mentioned specific hazards (drought, flooding, wildfires, extreme heat, and sea level rise) within their bond statements was considered. Of the identified climate hazards, flooding risk was mentioned most frequently, followed by drought (Table S8). Some of the hazards were mentioned more frequently alongside mentions of climate change; most of the bonds that mentioned extreme heat and sea level rise also mentioned climate change (94.9% and 88.6%, respectfully) while only around half of the bonds that mentioned drought or flooding also mentioned climate change (Table S9). This could indicate that utilities perceive extreme heat and sea level risk as climate-related while drought and flooding are less climate-related. The utilities that mentioned drought and wildfires are projected to see larger changes in these hazards, indicating an alignment of risk perceptions and actual risk (Fig. S24). The opposite was observed for flooding and extreme heat (i.e., the systems that mentioned these hazards have lower projected changes in these hazards), indicating drinking water utilities might need more targeted guidance about whether and how extreme precipitation and extreme heat can affect their system’s reliability. There might be institutional understanding gaps about which hazards climate change will exacerbate and which of these pose the greatest risks to system reliability. Historical flood and drought may bring these more to mind than slower changes associated with increasing extreme heat.

The overall climate risk index captures the system’s risk while their bond official statement captures their risk awareness; combining both reveals which utilities are potential candidates for climate adaptation or resiliency planning assistance (Fig. 4). Utilities classified as Low Priority are those that have lower climate risk index values and mentioned climate change within their bond statements, indicating that they might be taking proactive actions. Those classified as High Priority have higher climate risk index values and did not mention climate change in their bond statements. The portion of analyzed utilities classified as High Priority systems (36%) reflects an important misalignment between risk awareness and risk disclosure. Many of the Low Priority utilities are suburban and in close proximity to others with the same classification (for instance, the suburbs around Nashville, TN and Chicago, IL), compared to the higher priority utilities. Many of the High Priority utilities serve smaller population sizes; the average population size served by a High Priority system is around 52,000, compared to 137,000 people served by a Low Priority system. A larger fraction of smaller systems is classified as High Priority systems (Fig. S25). This is notable, as smaller utilities have lower adaptive capacity21,22 and the analysis does not include even smaller utilities (those serving fewer than 10,000 customers). The utilities omitted from this analysis likely experience similar climate hazards to those included in the analysis that are geographically close to them, but more information is needed about their exposure and vulnerability. Omitting these utilities biases our findings toward larger systems, which may have more resources and are more often in urban areas. This bias may mask additional risk associated with small systems, which may have fewer resources and be found disproportionately in rural areas.

Validating the results of this work is challenging, as utilities will likely not experience the full effects of climate change hazards for multiple decades. However, recent extreme weather events that have disrupted drinking water utility operations and caused financial losses can provide context to the identified classifications. For instance, in 2022, a flooding event coupled with existing system vulnerabilities left 180,000 residents in Jackson, MI without drinking water45. This work classifies Jackson, MI as a High Priority system.

US drinking water utilities are at risk from climate change, regardless of location, size, and source water, and utilities with higher climate risk scores serve around 67 million customers. While the climate risk index was developed using a sample of only 1455 municipal drinking water utilities, the simplicity of the model and accessibility of input data allows any US drinking water utility to calculate its own climate risk and compare it to other utilities. Drinking water utility managers should gather their own system’s data for the indicators from Table 1, assess climate projections for their system1, calculate their system’s climate risk index using Eqs. 1 and 2, and produce these assessments for the public. The developed index is intended to be useful in comparing climate risks facing utilities across the country, but the most accurate picture of actual risk requires in-depth climate impact assessments by individual systems.

A primary limitation of this work is that, due to data availability, it was developed for municipally-owned drinking water utilities serving more than 10,000 customers that had issued bonds recently. Many smaller systems likely have high climate risks and limited resources to access hazard projections necessary to plan for those risks. Future work should expand the climate risk index to include all drinking water utilities to enable prioritization of planning and financial assistance decisions. This would require public reporting of infrastructure health and financial data for all utilities. Additional studies could also further explore how to overcome institutional knowledge gaps about which climate hazards pose risks to system reliability and how these risks should be disclosed to the public. Although all contiguous US drinking water utilities are projected to experience changes in climate hazards by mid-century1, this work identifies a subset of High Priority utilities that are potentially misaligned in their technical risk and risk disclosure. These utilities, with high physical risk but no mention of this risk in their municipal bonds, should be prioritized for assistance in climate resilience and adaptation planning. For instance, this prioritization could be directly tied to funding instruments such as Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, which allow states to determine whether and how funding assistance is awarded. While many utilities in the Western US are seemingly aware of their climate risk, utilities in the South, Ohio Valley, Midwest, and to a lesser extent, Northeast, may not be as aware, based on information disclosed in their bond official statements.

While there are limitations to using municipal bond statements to assess climate risk disclosures (see “Limitations” section), the low fraction of utilities mentioning climate issues in bond disclosures (23%) suggests that there is likely a considerable amount of undisclosed financial liability associated with at-risk utilities. The municipal bonds analyzed in this study represent a total of $39.3 billion dollars of debt, most of which will mature within the next 20 years (Fig. S26). Of that total amount, $9.2 billion (23%) has been issued by utilities that we project to have high climate risk and potentially limited risk awareness. This large amount of capital is a financial liability for the issuers and owners of the municipal debt, as well as the community members dependent on the long-term reliability of these drinking water systems. This section offers practical suggestions for how drinking water utility managers, bond purchasers, and governmental agencies can utilize the climate risk index and the findings in this work to increase their climate preparedness.

Ensuring High Priority utilities get the assistance they need in preparing for climate change requires governmental support. Federal and state regulatory bodies should use these results to target climate adaptation planning resources and available funding. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law46 recommends states incorporate climate resilience criteria into Drinking Water State Revolving Fund programs47; the climate risk index could serve as one metric included in that prioritization. Government agencies must play a role in requiring climate adaptation and providing publicly-accessible, high-quality climate risk information. Utilities vary in awareness of how climate change might pose risks to the reliability of their systems20 and in their access to private-sector climate information services4, leading to information asymmetry. Dependence on the federal government as a backstop may lead to less local investment in resiliency measures, creating a moral hazard. Thus, it is critical that public sector agencies work to improve risk awareness of drinking water utilities and require adaptation planning.

At the state-level, the presented drinking water utility prioritization classifications reveal which states have the most at-risk utilities (Fig. 5). Texas, the state with the largest number of High Priority drinking water utilities (74) does not have a state-led climate adaptation plan48 and has a very low rate of climate change mentions within bond statements (5%). Requiring climate assessments for drinking water utilities at the state-level in Texas could improve climate risk awareness for those utilities. This finding highlights the importance of state-level policies to target gaps in climate planning and adaptation. The prioritization is also useful in assessing which utilities might require less attention. For instance, many utilities in Colorado have high climate hazard index values, but their low exposure and vulnerability index values combined with an awareness of and investment in climate resilience has resulted in extensive climate adaptation planning49,50.

Bond purchasers and ratings agencies are interested in the financial liability of the debt issued by the most at-risk utilities. While physical climate risks do not yet appear to be factored into bond ratings, the Low Priority utilities have a higher average bond value ($57.6 million) and longer time to maturity (16.4 years) compared to the High Priority utilities ($17.5 million value, 11.7 years). Municipal issuers with relatively lower-value and shorter time-to-maturity bonds could have limited access to credit, which further diminishes their ability to invest in resilience and adaptation measures. Utilities omitted from this analysis because they have not issued a bond in the past 10 years also have a limited ability to invest in large capital projects, highlighting another layer of financial inequalities. Climate risk is more relevant to longer-term municipal bonds, as these bonds will mature closer to when the climate hazards are projected to be experienced. This complements other research findings that long-term municipal bonds are more affected by climate risk compared to short-term bonds38,44,51.

The total amount of bonds held by High Priority drinking water utilities (Table S10) can offer insights into the total value of risk, though the amounts presented in this work only reflect the most recent bond issuances, not the total amount of issued debt. Six states (Michigan, Illinois, California, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Texas) have High Priority municipal drinking water utilities with total recent bond debt around or above $500 million dollars and an average bond maturity of over 10 years (Fig. 6); the purchasers of these municipal bonds might not be aware of the risks facing these drinking water utilities. Ratings agencies should consider adjusting ratings to reflect climate risk, even for short-term issuances. To more accurately quantify the value of risk facing utilities, the Environmental Protection Agency could require utility managers to estimate capital improvements needed to address future climate hazards within the next Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment52.

The developed drinking water utility climate risk index is useful for multiple stakeholders, including utility customers, bond purchasers, and regulatory agencies. It provides drinking water utilities with a better understanding of the projected future risk they face and allows them to compare their risk with other utilities serving different population sizes, using different source waters, and located in different regions. Utilities can use this information for planning and decision-making. This climate risk index also allows for more accurate climate risk disclosures, especially in the municipal bond market. Further, the proposed classifications identify which utilities should be prioritized when government agencies provide climate resilience planning and assistance; these utilities are candidates for immediate federal or state support for climate adaptation.

A dataset of mid-century climate change projections and hazard index values for 42,786 drinking water utilities across the contiguous US was used as the core dataset for this analysis1. This dataset was created using a multi-hazard approach, accounting for changes in extreme heat, extreme precipitation, freeze-thaw cycles, sea level rise, wildfires, and water supply stress, as well as gradual changes in average temperature and precipitation (captured through the proxy of utility energy demand), and drew on climate projections from the U.S. Government’s Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation tool53 and the Climate Risk and Resilience Portal (ClimRR) dataset54. The mid-century, Relative Concentration Pathway 4.5 climate emission scenario was used and both sets of projections were derived from Localized Constructed Analogs (LOCA) downscaled climate model ensembles55. Existing research analyzing multi-hazard climate risks to drinking water systems outside the US combines hazards with information about utility system infrastructure56. In this work, we link service area boundaries for all US community water systems57 and system information from the Safe Drinking Water Information System database (SDWIS) for all utilities using Public Water System Identification Numbers. Public water systems are required to annually report water quality violation and enforcement information, as well as facility and infrastructure information to SDWIS58. The SDWIS database was further used to compile information about populations served, the number of service connections, and the length and duration of water quality violations (captured through the Drinking Water Non-Compliance Score). Added context about the utility’s financial, environmental, and demographic conditions were acquired from the Municipal Drinking Water Database (MDWD)59. This dataset contains demographic information, details about the municipal government structure, and financial measures as reported in the Government Finance Database60. The MDWD was used for data about municipal employees, the age of infrastructure, and the prevalence of poverty rates within the utility’s customer base.

While the MDWD includes financial metrics about the overall municipality linked to the drinking water utility, it does not include direct measures of a utility’s financial health or service rates. The Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) database was used to extract water utility financial information from municipal bond official statements for each municipal drinking water system. Many municipal drinking water utilities use municipal bonds to finance capital improvement projects35,36, and bond statements can offer information about current utility financial and operational weaknesses. Official bond statements are disclosure documents published by municipal issuers that list information about the bond offering, including operating expenses and revenue (including service rates), other financial information, and bond ratings61. Issued municipal bonds are given ratings by external ratings agencies using holistic and case-based analysis, including information from official statements, that reflects a rating agency’s opinions on the bond’s default risk62. Municipal bond official statements have previously been used to collect information about drinking water utility customers and water rates63. We conducted searches for each municipal drinking water system within EMMA and extracted the most recent bond official statement issued by that utility or its associated municipality over the past 10 years. In addition to providing information about utility operating ratios, bond rating, and service costs, the bonds were also used to provide insights into climate risk awareness. This is discussed in the Using Municipal Bond Climate Risk Disclosures to Identify Gaps in Water Utility Climate Risk Preparedness section.

Evaluated drinking water utility systems

We evaluate 1455 of the more than 50,000 community drinking water utilities in the contiguous US. The main data limitation was the use of data from the MDWD, which includes only drinking water utilities serving more than 10,000 people (2219 utilities). Of those utilities, only 1609 were linked to municipalities that issued bonds in the last 10 years. Of the analyzed 1609 utilities, some were missing data (reported as NA) for one or more of the nine exposure and vulnerability indicators needed to create the indices. Some of these NA values were able to be replaced with data from the MDWD or median values, so the final dataset contains 1455 utilities. The indicator with the largest portion of missing data was utility service costs; these were extracted from bond statements and not every utility included service rates. These missing values were replaced with median regional service costs. Omitting this indicator was assessed in the sensitivity analysis. See SI Fig. S1 for details of the dataset restrictions and Table S1 for more details about how the treatment of missing values. Drinking water utilities specifically mentioned in this article were contacted and none provided comments.

The analyzed sample of utilities serves a combined 113.7 million people, or 33% of the total US population. See SI Figs. S2–S4 for details about population served, source water supply, location, and projected climate hazard index values for the utilities included in the sample. In addition to omitting smaller drinking water utilities in the US, this sample has a smaller proportion of utilities served by groundwater and a much larger proportion served by surface water. In terms of regional representation, the sample overrepresents utilities located in the Ohio Valley and Upper Midwest and underrepresents utilities in the Northern Rockies and Plains, Southeast, and Southwest; regions were designated using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Regions (Fig. S5)64. The states with the largest number of utilities included in the sample are Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, and California (Fig. S6). See SI Table S3 for more details comparing the sample with all drinking water utilities. Despite the limitations imposed by the availability of data in national datasets, the underlying model structure was designed so that individual utilities can use their own system’s data to determine a climate risk score for comparison.

Looking at the municipal bond data, this sample of 1455 utilities has bonds with an average maturity date of 2037, an average issuance of $25.9 million dollars, and an average rating of Aa2/AA/AA (Table S4). Thirty-six percent of the bonds were issued directly by a drinking water utility, while the rest were issued by a municipality that oversees the water utility as a business-type activity. Most of the analyzed bonds were issued in the past 5 years and are general obligation bonds (Fig. S7), in which the issuer guarantees repayment using government taxation power. Bonds issued directly by the water utility are more likely to be revenue bonds that guarantee repayment based on income from service rates.

Climate vulnerability index development

Indicators included in the vulnerability index (Fig. 7) were chosen to capture financial and physical utility system characteristics that affect its propensity to be adversely affected by climate change. Financial dimensions of vulnerability capture the ability of a utility to pay for treatment and delivery of clean water and maintain its fiscal health into the future26, as well as the socioeconomics of the utility customer base, which may affect its ability to fund and maintain system improvements through rate increases. Physical utility system characteristics, or the utility’s infrastructure health, are those that make it potentially vulnerable to the climate hazards identified in the combined hazard index2,3,25 and those that affect the reliability of the utility’s infrastructure assets. The intersection of physical and financial aspects affects the ability of the utility to invest in repairs or prevent infrastructure failure.

Three factors are included as indicators of utility system financial health: utility operating ratio, municipal bond rating, and percentage of served population below the poverty line. A utility operating ratio, or the ratio of operating revenues to operating expenses, is used in assessments of drinking water financial capability and capacity because they capture a utility’s cost recovery. Ratios greater than or equal to one indicate the utility can cover expenses through revenue sources26,65.

Bond ratings are also included as an indicator as they measure perceived risks of a utility’s creditworthiness, or the reliability a system can repay debt. Most utility infrastructure financing relies on the bond market and a change in rating can signal management or financial issues facing a utility35,63,65. The nomenclature of ratings and results vary slightly across rating agencies but take the form of very highly rated bonds with the lowest risk (e.g., AAA) to bonds with the highest risk of default (e.g., C), see Table S2. Lower municipal bond ratings can affect borrowing costs, limiting capital investment programs63. While bond ratings are not commonly included in drinking water vulnerability assessment due to data limitations, they have been used in other analyses of utility financial health63.

Poverty rates are an important inclusion in social vulnerability indices66 and previous assessments of drinking water-specific vulnerability identified the influence of a utility’s social vulnerability, captured through poverty prevalence, on the utility’s financial vulnerability25,26. Utilities with high populations served below the poverty line have challenges raising rates to increase revenue without causing affordability issues or increasing numbers of delinquent accounts67.

Physical dimensions of water utility vulnerability capture the ability of a utility’s infrastructure system to maintain service given changes in severity, frequency, or duration of climate hazards. The health of a utility’s physical system depends on asset conditions; infrastructure in poorer conditions is more likely to be damaged when exposed to hazards. Age of the infrastructure system is used to capture infrastructure condition, as older infrastructure is closer to its end-of-life and is more likely to be compromised by climate hazards68. Exact ages for different infrastructure components are not commonly accessible, so median housing age in the utility service area is used as a proxy for infrastructure health. Comparing median housing age data to pipe age data69 for a subset of the data shows a correlation (R2 = 0.63), with the housing age about 4 years older than the pipe age, on average. A similar validation was used and found by Hughes25.

Another aspect of a utility’s physical system health is how well it meets drinking water quality standards. Complying with water quality regulation violations is an important performance outcome for utilities26, and violations can reveal underlying limitations in a system’s ability to properly treat drinking water. From a utility management perspective, violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act reflect existing operational vulnerabilities. Violations can be health-based, revealing exceedances of maximum contaminant levels for contaminants or failure to meet treatment technique requirements, or non-health-based, revealing failures in reporting or public notification). While the health-based violations reveal the largest vulnerabilities in a system’s ability to produce safe water, non-health-violations are also important inclusions in drinking water vulnerability assessments26 because they may indicate administrative capacity limitations. The Drinking Water Non-Compliance Score is included as an indicator because it accounts for the severity and duration of both health and non-health water quality violations70. This indicator is used to capture the challenges a system has complying with water quality regulations; higher scores indicate more challenges faced by the utility71. The two physical system health indicators, Drinking Water Non-Compliance Score and infrastructure age, were averaged to create one physical system indicator, that was then combined with equal weighting with the financial health indicator for the vulnerability index.

Climate exposure index development

Climate exposure is defined from the perspective of the water utility; it is the people and assets of the water utility that could be negatively affected by climate hazards2,3. A utility is considered more exposed to climate change if it has more assets on a per capita basis (i.e., a utility has more exposed assets when delivering water to the same number of people). The indicators included in the exposure index (Fig. 8) capture the different facets of a utility’s assets: infrastructure, workforce, and finances.

The infrastructure assets the utility owns include the distribution system, pump stations, treatment plants, and any storage facilities. While utilities have extensive information on their facilities, this information is not gathered in any public centralized database for all US utilities. Limited information, including the number of treatment plants and the number of service connections are available from SDWIS. The number of service connections per capita and the service area per capita, considered together, are used as a proxy for total exposed assets (i.e., how much more infrastructure the system maintains on a per capita basis). As the size of the distribution system affects economies of scale for the utility72,73, the service area per capita is used to capture the relative length and complexity of the utility’s infrastructure. The service connections per capita captures the relative exposure of the utility’s service lines27. The Climate Vulnerability Index, a measure that characterizes vulnerability and exposure generally, uses a similar per capita for lane miles to capture transportation infrastructure exposure74. There are limitations to using this proxy measure for total exposed assets, namely that the exact location and size of utility infrastructure assets affect exposure as well (i.e., a large treatment plant in a flood zone is more exposed than a smaller treatment plant outside a flood zone). This index is intended to provide insights for the entire country, but individual utilities should use more detailed information about their facilities to properly assess their individual exposure. Furthermore, while source water supplies can affect a utility’s exposure to different climate hazards75,76, this index does not distinguish between surface water and groundwater systems. Differences in source water were considered in analyzing the trends in climate risk index values.

Also included in this exposure index are utility personnel; these personnel are susceptible to negative consequences of extreme climate hazards like heat waves and flooding events. Drinking water utilities have identified their employees as exposed to these climate hazards18. The number of employees per capita was used because a utility has increased workforce exposure if it has more employees per capita. As each utility’s total personnel is not publicly available, the number of municipal employees per capita was used as a proxy. Comparing the number of municipal full-time employees to drinking water utility full time employees for a subset of Wisconsin utilities69, there was a strong correlation (R2 = 0.85) between the values, with the overall municipality having about 20 times as many employees as the utility, on average.

Finally, the utility’s financial exposure can be captured in the cost of delivering a set amount of water per household. Utilities generate revenue through service rate charges and the affordability of these rates has consequences for how much revenue the utility earns65. Comparing household service charges reveals how financially exposed a utility is, were a climate hazard to interrupt service or reduce a customer’s ability to pay their water bills. The household annual cost of service was calculated using water rates reported in utility bond official statements, assuming 2.65 people per household each consuming 50 gallons per day77.

Not included in this combined exposure index is the exposure of the customers the system serves. These customers are exposed to the effects of climate hazards on their drinking water utility, and they may experience negative effects of those climate hazards, depending upon the actions the utility takes to mitigate those effects. However, the scope of this work focuses on exposure of the water utility itself.

Combined climate risk index development

Composite indices for drinking water climate exposure and climate vulnerability were combined with the previously developed drinking water climate hazard index database1. The composite index approach captures multidimensional facets and assumes each indicator component has a distinct influence on the combined index78. The different indicators \(({X}_{i})\) were normalized (scale 0 to 1) using a min-max normalization79,80. This approach is minimizes the effects of extreme values32,79, and has been used in other drinking water and climate indices81,82, see Eq. 1.

$${X}_{(V,E),\,i}=\frac{x-\min \left(x\right)}{\max \left(x\right)-{\mathrm{min}}\left(x\right)}$$

(1)

The combined exposure and vulnerability indexes were then aggregated and divided by their number of components30, see Eq. 2. The indicators were all weighted equally31,83, which is the best choice when there is a lack of theoretical justification for a different weighting scheme31,83. Other drinking water and climate risk indices also used this weighting scheme25,32. The final combined climate risk index was calculated using the product of the exposure and vulnerability indices, along with the hazard index1, see Eq. 2. This formulation follows IPCC frameworks for modeling climate risk2,3 and has been used in other approaches that developed separate hazard, exposure, and vulnerability indices, assigned equal weights, and then multiplied them together for a composite index of climate risk32.

$${Risk}=\sum \frac{{X}_{H,\,i}\left(0,1\right)}{k}* \sum \frac{{X}_{E,\,i}\left(0,1\right)}{k}* \sum \frac{{X}_{V,\,i}\left(0,1\right)}{k}$$

Sensitivity analysis

Composite indices are useful for modeling multidimensional system properties that are not directly measurable, but decisions about their construction, including which indicators to include and how they are combined, affect whether the results are meaningful83,84,85.

The min-max method used to normalize the indictors reduces the effects of outliers because all indicators have identical ranges32,79. The linear aggregation method used to combine the indicators assumes compensation, or that one indicator’s lower can be compensated by another’s higher value31,86. An important consideration when constructing composite indices is whether the individual indicators are related, as the assumption is each indicator has a distinct effect. Different aspects of utility vulnerability are expected to be related26, and socially vulnerable communities experience increased risks of drinking water quality violations87. Indicators were chosen to capture different facets of vulnerability and exposure, and indicator collinearity was tested to assess whether the individual indicators are independent of one another78. Low collinearity was observed between the indicators (SI Tables S5 and S6), suggesting the selected indicators represent different aspects of exposure and vulnerability, and that they can be used together.

The climate risk index was developed from the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability indices, including a total of 16 indicators. Correlation analyses were performed to examine the relationships between each indicator component and the composite index (SI Table S7). The overall vulnerability index and exposure index are moderately correlated with the risk index (R2 = 0.75 and R2 = 0.62, respectively) while the hazard index is not correlated (R2 = 0.20). Infrastructure age (captured by the proxy of median housing age) is the individual indicator with the strongest correlation with the risk index (R2 = 0.66). The exposure, vulnerability, and hazard indices have low multicollinearity between themselves, indicating each is contributing a unique aspect to the overall climate risk index.

The sensitivity of the climate risk index to the included indicators can be analyzed by assessing how results change when certain indicators are omitted. Indicators from each of the vulnerability, exposure, and hazard indices were omitted (Infrastructure Age, Service Costs, and Sea Level Rise) to analyze how the climate risk index changed. Infrastructure age was chosen because while median housing age has been used as a proxy for infrastructure age in other work25, a utility’s pipes might be considerably older or younger than the housing stock and age itself is only an indirect measure of asset health. Service costs were chosen because this indicator had the most missing data (median service costs within a NOAA Region were used instead). Sea level rise was chosen for the hazard index because of its difficulty to predict88 and because it only affects coastal utilities (an uneven regional distribution).

Using municipal bond climate risk disclosures to identify gaps in water utility climate risk preparedness

The developed water utility climate risk index captures the determinants of risk (hazard, exposure, and vulnerability) but does not include any utility actions aimed at addressing climate change. The actions a system takes in response to climate change are also important drivers of overall risk89. While research has found a lack of climate adaptation planning occurring at drinking water utilities20, climate risk disclosures from bond official statements offer important insights about which utilities have acknowledged potential risks of climate change. Issued municipal bonds are given ratings by external ratings agencies using holistic and case-based analysis, including information from official statements, that reflects a rating agency’s opinions on the bond’s default risk62. Rating agencies have begun to consider physical climate risks to municipal debt issuers when assigning bond ratings90,91, making bond official statements an important source of information for climate risk disclosures. S&P Global rates water and sewer utilities as having strong identification of operation risks if “climate risk assessment is incorporated into planning and operations as a potential risk to the system.”90 Utilities may score as vulnerable if they have not explicitly addressed climate risk either in plans or operations. There are mixed conclusions about whether physical climate risk is actually linked to lower bond ratings. Some research has found links between increased exposure to certain climate hazards (like sea level rise) and lower municipal bond ratings and higher borrowing costs38,44,51. Research focused on municipal water bonds found that specific hazards like droughts and floods were factored into bond markets37. Other work has found that the full scope of physical climate hazard risk has not yet been priced into the municipal market43. Regardless, professional organizations recommend that water utilities provide information to bond rating agencies about climate risk and adaptation planning92, making bond official statements a useful source of information about their perceptions of climate risk.

In addition to using municipal bond official statements to extract drinking water utility financial information (described previously), these statements were also searched for mentions of climate change and resilience, as well as mentions of specific climate hazards, including drought, flood, wildfire, heat, and sea level rise. Given that rating agencies explicitly consider physical climate risks when assessing their ratings90,91, these mentions were assumed to capture utility awareness of and possible responses to climate change. While the lack of mentions was assumed to indicate less awareness or concern from the utility about climate risk, utilities might have other reasons for not explicitly using the term climate change, which are discussed further in the Limitations section. The climate risk awareness identified in the bond official statements was also compared to and combined with the calculated climate risk index scores for each utility to reveal which utilities might be uninformed about their future climate risk and which might need targeted climate adaptation assistance.

Limitations

A primary limitation is the drinking water utility sample analyzed in this work; focusing on municipal utilities that serve more than 10,000 customers and have issued a municipal bond in the past 10 years limits the applicability of the complete model to utilities serving smaller population sizes. The larger the system, the greater its adaptive capacity, or ability to respond to changes21,22. While utilities serving fewer than 10,000 customers might have lower exposure (i.e., fewer assets and smaller systems), these systems likely have much higher existing vulnerabilities (i.e., more susceptible to disruptions) because of lower adaptive capacity. Smaller utilities have more drinking water quality violations and less capacity to comply with regulations93. Omitting smaller systems from this analysis likely underestimates the number of systems nationwide that have higher climate risks and that should be prioritized for adaptation assistance. Additional analyses will be needed to prioritize assistance among these smaller systems.

Many smaller systems are groundwater systems, and an additional limitation of this work is that the index does not distinguish between surface water and groundwater systems. Source water supply type can affect exposure to different climate hazards, but there is limited work quantifying how climate hazards affect the operations and infrastructure of groundwater systems differently from surface water systems. Future work could model how certain climate hazards damage infrastructure and disrupt operations differently. Segmenting the sample to drinking water utilities that have recently issued bonds also introduces biases, as these omitted utilities might have decided against bond issuance because of an underlying financial or operational vulnerability. A larger portion of the utilities that have not issued bonds (1.5%) are in the 98th percentile for WQ non-compliance scores than the utilities that have issued bonds (0.5%).

There are also limitations associated with using mentions of climate change within municipal bonds to identify risk awareness and preparedness. “Climate change” as a term has a range of associated political framings and misunderstandings94, which influence use of the term. Political affiliations and personal experiences of extreme weather affect perceptions of climate risk95,96,97 and there are regional differences in public understanding of whether global climate change is happening and whether it could harm people in the US98,99. Given these differences, some municipalities and utilities might be hesitant to explicitly use the term in their bond official statements even while rating agencies are requiring a consideration of these physical climate risks when assigning ratings90,91. Lastly, many ratings agencies are focused on short-term creditworthiness and utilities might have disclosed longer-term climate risks or concerns directly to ratings agencies and not explicitly mentioned them in official statements. Searching the bond statements for explicit mentions of certain climate-related hazards (drought, flooding, heat, sea level rise) alongside explicit mentions of climate change revealed only a small fraction of the bonds that mentioned climate change didn’t mention one of the hazards (3.2%) and around a third (27.3%) of those that mentioned a hazard didn’t mention of climate change.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-03044-z/MediaObjects/43247_2025_3044_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2026-01-26 05:59:21.359257

Freetown, 26 January 2026: The Salone Off-Grid Renewable Energy Acceleration (SOGREA) Initiative today launched its first Call for Pre-Qualification Applications, inviting private sector companies to develop and upgrade green mini-grids in rural communities across Sierra Leone. The call marks a major step forward in accelerating universal energy access while unlocking new opportunities for renewable energy investors and developers.

Delivered in partnership with the Government of Sierra Leone, SOGREA aims to crowd in private capital to expand clean, reliable electricity to underserved communities, strengthening local economies and supporting climate-resilient development. The announcement was made during a live-streamed event hosted by Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) marking the International Day of Clean Energy.

The SOGREA is funded by the European Union and the Government of Denmark and totals EUR 24 million in catalytic funding. The three-year programme is designed to reduce investment risk and boost the commercial viability of rural electrification in Sierra Leone. The initiative provides performance-based capital support to cover a portion of upfront development costs for green mini-grids, with payments released against independently verified milestones.

By bridging the gap between the true cost of electricity supply and what rural households and businesses can afford, SOGREA helps lower tariffs while expanding connections. The approach builds on Sierra Leone’s recent mini-grid sector reforms, including progressive regulation and transparent tariff-setting mechanisms that provide long-term certainty for investors.

The Call for Pre-Qualification Applications is open to eligible applicants, who are licensed, for-profit mini-grid developers registered to operate in Sierra Leone, with proven experience operating green mini-grids in Sub-Saharan Africa, the capacity to deliver new projects within 12 months, smart-meter integration capability, compliance with UEF requirements and at least 30% female representation across administrative and operational roles. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, with Pre-Qualification submissions closing on 9 March 2026. Successfully pre-qualified companies will be invited to submit site-specific proposals for development of new or upgrade of already existing green mini-grid projects. Funding decisions will be made on a first-come, first-served basis until available resources are fully allocated.

This performance-based capital support reflects the EU and Denmark’s commitment to advancing clean energy access, sustainable investment and climate action in Africa. The initiative is implemented by UNOPS, with its host entity Sustainable Energy for All, in close partnership with the Government of Sierra Leone.

Washington’s Department of Commerce, which works on state energy policy, has offered up state employees to help the federal Bonneville Power Administration process its backlog of renewable energy projects — though it remains uncertain whether the agency will accept the offer. Bonneville, which owns 75% of the Northwest’s power grid, must sign off before wind and solar developers who wish to connect to its grid can break ground.

Meanwhile, four state agencies have recommended that Washington’s Legislature provide incentives for utilities to upgrade transmission lines, plan out “microgrid” energy projects that don’t need to connect to Bonneville’s power lines and create a new state agency that would plan and potentially pay for major new transmission corridors. A bill to create such an authority had a hearing on Jan 21.

The Commerce Department, Department of Ecology, Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council and Utilities and Transportation Commission are also meeting regularly to diagnose what’s holding up more than a dozen high-priority wind, solar and energy storage projects that could make an outsize difference.

Joe Nguyễn, who recently stepped down as the state’s commerce director, said there’s added urgency to get the work done since OPB and ProPublica last year showed that other states like Iowa and Texas have made far more progress than Washington.

“We’re forcing these tough conversations that have never been done before,” Nguyễn, a former state senator who helped pass Washington’s law setting a deadline to go carbon-free, said during a recent public forum. He spoke at the panel just before leaving the state Commerce Department in January to take a job as head of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce.

“We probably have to modify some policies, we’re going to amend some things, we have to make strategic investments, but I think that’s a good thing,” Nguyễn said at the forum. “I’m not daunted by the task.”

Under Bonneville, projects face longer odds of successfully connecting to the electrical grid than anywhere else in the country, OPB and ProPublica found.

The federal agency weighs how many new transmission lines and substations will be needed to carry the added load, and it has historically been slow to pay for such upgrades, renewable energy advocates have said. Often the burden falls on the builders of the wind and solar projects.

Washington and Oregon lawmakers failed to account for this obstacle when they required electric utilities to phase out fossil fuels. Combined with rapid growth in electricity demand from new data centers powering artificial intelligence, studies now predict rolling blackouts in the Pacific Northwest within the next five years.

Inspired by OPB and ProPublica’s reporting, the Seattle nonprofit Clean & Prosperous published a report this month identifying energy high-potential projects that could generate enough power for 7 million homes and contribute $195 billion to the state’s economy if built by 2030. Kevin Tempest, research director for Clean & Prosperous, said the fact that Washington ranked 50th nationally for green power growth was poorly understood until the recent news coverage.

“I don’t think that we were aware of just how stark it was,” said Tempest, whose group advocates for “entrepreneurial approaches” to eliminating fossil fuels and promoting economic growth. “So that really opened our eyes and, I think, accelerated a lot of conversations.”

Separately, in Oregon, Gov. Tina Kotek recently signed two executive orders intended to speed up the construction of energy projects. Kotek, too, said the news reports helped galvanize policymakers.

Nguyễn told OPB and ProPublica their reporting made him realize “the people who talk about clean energy are not actually doing it.” But now, he said, “Washington state’s desperately trying.”

“Things That We Can Control”

Most of the high-priority projects identified by the state and by Clean & Prosperous are waiting for approval to connect to Bonneville’s substations and transmission lines so that developers move toward construction.

The federal agency’s review process historically has been sluggish and often puts the onus on a single energy developer to invest tens of millions of dollars in upgrades or else wait until another developer comes along to shoulder some of the cost. In addition, state officials in Oregon and Washington must also sign off on the location planned for new power lines and wind or solar farms — a process with its own bottlenecks.

“There are a myriad of reasons why projects are not happening,” Tempest said. “It’s different for each case.”

But he said across all projects, Bonneville is “a common feature for some of the new facilities not breaking ground.”

Bonneville spokesperson Kevin Wingert said in an email that the agency has implemented several reforms over the past year to enable faster connections to its grid. For example, the agency began studying clusters of projects collectively, based on their readiness, and expects its first study to be done at the end of the month.

Wingert said the agency has identified 7 gigawatts worth of projects — roughly the capacity of Grand Coulee hydroelectric dam, Washington’s largest power plant — that it says it’s on pace to have online within five years. It expects to have more than double that amount connected and energized by 2035.

In the near term, the state is focusing on grid improvements to the transmission system it can make without Bonneville, according to Casey Sixkiller, director of the Washington Department of Ecology.

He said Washington will work to help projects connect to some part of the roughly 25% of the region’s grid that is operated by investor-owned and public utilities.

“I think the point is for us in Washington trying to find, as we wait for BPA, who’s years behind, what are the other things that we can control that we should be prioritizing and trying to move forward?” Sixkiller said.

Kurt Beckett, chair of Washington’s Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, which issues site permits for energy projects, said localized improvements that can be made outside of Bonneville’s grid are cheaper and will have tangible, immediate results. They also have the benefit of “buying time for the bigger, harder upgrades that Bonneville’s in charge of.”

Bonneville says it plans to spend $5 billion on nearly two dozen transmission line and substation improvements, but many of those projects are years away with no firm deadline.

What’s within Washington’s control in the near term is to streamline state permitting of projects that have received or don’t need Bonneville’s approval.

The need was highlighted by the passage last year of President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will phase out key federal energy tax credits and sets a July 4 deadline for projects to break ground. The credits cover as much as 50% of construction costs for most solar and wind farms.

More than 200 wind, solar and battery storage projects theoretically could meet the deadline “should development processes improve,” Clean & Prosperous concluded in its report. The group said it was a reference to both Bonneville’s role and the state’s.

Sixkiller said Washington leaders are prioritizing a smaller list of 19 proposed projects they think have the best chance of beating the July deadline. In some cases, the developers already have a connection agreement with Bonneville in place. In two, the projects will connect to power lines run by a utility.

An Offer of Help

In addition to actions taken by state agencies, Washington lawmakers are considering a bill that would ease the state’s reliance on Bonneville to build new power lines. That would come in the form of a state transmission authority — a new state agency in charge of planning transmission routes, acquiring land and working with developers to build new lines. It could also eventually pay for projects. Washington lawmakers are calling for a report on what financing tools, such as the ability to issue bonds, the new transmission authority will need.

The bill has support from environmental groups, labor unions and energy developers. However, lobbyists for large industrial energy consumers and for Bonneville’s public utility customers opposed the bill, saying they supported the intention to build more transmission but wanted the state to focus on relaxing its permitting requirements to let utilities solve the problem.

For the time being, state officials told OPB and ProPublica they are working to shore up Bonneville’s ability to do the work that the region’s grid needs.

Beckett said he hopes the state can help Bonneville with the agency’s self-imposed goal of cutting the average time a project spends in the queue from 15 years down to five or six.

Agencies have offered Bonneville some of their staff to help its analysts complete grid connection studies, which Washington officials said makes sense because the state in many cases is already reviewing the same projects that are awaiting the federal agency’s permission to connect.

Bonneville hasn’t said yes yet. Wingert said Bonneville’s interconnection studies have “numerous technical and regulatory requirements” that make them “inappropriate or infeasible” for the state to conduct on BPA’s behalf.

But, he said, the agency was open to working with the state to speed projects up at some point.

“There may be opportunities to coordinate efficiencies between state policies and BPA’s interconnection processes in the future,” Wingert said.

Nguyễn said that technical requirements shouldn’t keep Bonneville from accepting the state’s help in vetting projects or analyzing their impact on the grid, and that state employees could help with the less technical aspects of the report if needed.

“If you want us to bring you lunch so your analysts can go faster, we will do it,” he said. “That’s the level of seriousness I have about getting transmission built.”","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/groundbreaking1-8-11-25-social_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg?resize=2000,1050",N,,2026-01-26 05:59:15.961676

The tech industry is spending millions to rebrand them.,Sophie Hurwitz,,,,,https://grist.org/energy/data-centers-are-facing-an-image-problem-the-tech-industry-is-spending-millions-to-rebrand-them/,"With community opposition growing, data center backers are going on a full-scale public relations blitz.
Around Christmas in Virginia, which boasts the highest concentration of data centers in the country, one advertisement seemed to air nonstop.
“Virginia’s data centers are … investing billions in clean energy,” a voiceover intoned over sweeping shots of shiny solar panels.
According to Data Center Watch, a project run by AI security company 10a labs, nearly 200 community groups are currently active and have blocked or delayed 20 data center projects representing $98 billion of potential investment between April and June 2025 alone.
The changes, which will take effect in 2027, are designed to protect household customers from costs associated with data center expansion.","With community opposition growing, data center backers are going on a full-scale public relations blitz. Around Christmas in Virginia, which boasts the highest concentration of data centers in the country, one advertisement seemed to air nonstop. “Virginia’s data centers are … investing billions in clean energy,” a voiceover intoned over sweeping shots of shiny solar panels. “Creating good-paying jobs” — cue men in yellow safety vests and hard hats — “and building a better energy future.”

The ad was sponsored by Virginia Connects, an industry-affiliated group that spent at least $700,000 on digital marketing in the state in fiscal year 2024. The spot emphasized that data centers are paying their own energy costs, framing this as a buffer that might help lower residential bills, and portrayed the facilities as engines of local job creation.

The reality is murkier. Although industry groups claim that each new data center creates “dozens to hundreds” of “high-wage, high-skill jobs,” some researchers say data centers generate far fewer jobs than other industries, such as manufacturing and warehousing. Greg LeRoy, the founder of the research and advocacy group Good Jobs First, said that in his first major study of data center jobs nine years ago, he found that developers pocketed well over a million dollars in state subsidies for every permanent job they created. With the rise of hyperscalers, LeRoy said, that number is “still very much in the ballpark.”

Other experts reflect that finding. A 2025 brief from University of Michigan researchers put it bluntly: “Data centers do not bring high-paying tech jobs to local communities.” A recent analysis from Food & Water Watch, a nonprofit tracking corporate overreach, found that in Virginia, the investment required to create a permanent data center job was nearly 100 times higher than what was required to create comparable jobs in other industries.

“Data centers are the extreme of hyper-capital intensity in manufacturing,” LeRoy said. “Once they’re built, the number of people monitoring them is really small.” Contractors may be called in if something breaks, and equipment is replaced every few years. “But that’s not permanent labor,” he said.

Jon Hukill, a spokesperson for the Data Center Coalition, the industry lobbying group that established Virginia Connects in 2024, said that the industry “is committed to paying its full cost of service for the energy it uses” and is trying to“meet this moment in a way that supports both data center development and an affordable, reliable electricity grid for all customers.” Nationally, Hukill said, the industry “supported 4.7 million jobs and contributed $162 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2023.”

Dozens of community groups across the country have mobilized against data center buildout, citing fears that the facilities will drain water supplies, overwhelm electric grids, and pollute the air around them. According to Data Center Watch, a project run by AI security company 10a labs, nearly 200 community groups are currently active and have blocked or delayed 20 data center projects representing $98 billion of potential investment between April and June 2025 alone.

The backlash has exposed a growing image problem for the AI industry. “Too often, we’re portrayed as energy-hungry, water-intensive, and environmentally damaging,” data center marketer Steve Lim recently wrote. That narrative, he argued, “misrepresents our role in society and potentially hinders our ability to grow.” In response, the industry is stepping up its messaging.

Some developers, like Starwood Digital Ventures in Delaware, are turning to Facebook ads to make their case to residents. Its ads make the case that data center development might help keep property taxes low, bring jobs to Delaware, and protect the integrity of nearby wetlands. According to reporting from Spotlight Delaware, the company has also boasted that it will create three times as many jobs as it initially told local officials.

Nationally, Meta has spent months running TV spots showcasing data center work as a viable replacement for lost industrial and farming jobs. One advertisement spotlights the small city of Altoona, Iowa. “I grew up in Altoona, and I wanted my kids to be able to do the same,” a voice narrates over softly-lit scenes of small-town Americana: a Route 66 diner, a farm, and a water tower. “So, when work started to slow down, we looked for new opportunities … and we welcomed Meta, which opened a data center in our town. Now, we’re bringing jobs here — for us, and for our next generation.” The advertisement ends with a promise superimposed over images of a football game: “Meta is investing $600 billion in American infrastructure and jobs.”

In reality, Altoona’s data center is a hulking, windowless, warehouse complex that broke ground in 2013, long before the current data center boom. Altoona is not quite the beleaguered farm town Meta’s advertisements portray but a suburb of 19,000, roughly 16 minutes from downtown Des Moines, the most populous city in Iowa. Meta says it has supported “400+ operational jobs” in Altoona. In comparison, the local casino employs nearly 1,000 residents, according to the local economic development agency.

Ultimately, those details may not matter much to the ad’s intended audience. As Politico reported, the advertisement may have been targeted at policymakers on the coasts more than the residents of towns like Altoona. Meta has spent at least $5 million airing the spot in places like Sacramento and Washington, D.C.

The community backlash has also made data centers a political flashpoint. In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won November’s gubernatorial election in part on promises to regulate the industry and make developers pay their “fair share” of the electricity they use. State lawmakers also considered 30 bills attempting to regulate data centers. In response to concerns about rising electricity prices, Virginia regulators approved a new rate structure for AI data centers and other large electricity users. The changes, which will take effect in 2027, are designed to protect household customers from costs associated with data center expansion.

These developments may only encourage companies to spend more on image-building. In Virginia’s Data Center Alley, the ads show no sign of stopping. Elena Schlossberg, an anti-data-center activist based in Prince William County, says her mailbox has been flooded with fliers from Virginia Connects for the past eight months.

The promises of lower electric bills, good jobs, and climate responsibility, she said, remind her of cigarette ads she saw decades ago touting the health benefits of smoking. But Schlossberg isn’t sure the marketing’s going to work. One recent poll showed that 73 percent of Virginians blame data centers for their rising electricity costs.

“There’s no putting the toothpaste back in the tube,” she said. “People already know we’re still covering their costs. People know that.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/data-center-jobs-pr.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-26 08:59:35.288285

Trump’s climate blitzkrieg may be the starkest example yet of the benefits and drawbacks of that model.","This story was first published by Grist.

One year ago, with one of the first strokes of his presidential Sharpie, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a ​“national energy emergency,” making good on a campaign promise to ​“drill, baby, drill.” It was the first of many such orders, signaling that the championing of fossil fuels would be a cornerstone of the new administration: A subsequent order pledged to revitalize America’s waning coal industry, eliminate subsidies for electric vehicles approved by Congress under former President Joe Biden, and loosen regulations for domestic producers of fossil fuels. Yet another executive order withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the nearly unanimously adopted international treaty that coordinates the global fight against climate change. He resumed liquefied natural gas permitting paused by his predecessor and reopened United States coastlines to drilling.

In the days following his inauguration, Trump killed a climate jobs training program, closed off millions of acres of federal water designated for offshore wind development, and scrubbed mentions of climate change from some federal agency websites. To many observers, it looked like the most comprehensive reorientation of the executive branch’s environmental and climate priorities in American history.

On paper, it certainly appears as though Trump has continued to make good on these early promises. He pushed Congress to pass the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, which phases out an extensive set of tax credits — for wind and solar energy, electric vehicles, and other decarbonization tools — that were responsible for much of the progress the U.S. was expected to make toward its Paris Agreement commitments. (That move has already led some companies to abandon new clean energy projects.) Trump’s attacks on the nation’s offshore wind industry, which he recently called ​“so pathetic and so bad,” have been unrelenting, culminating in a blanket ban on offshore leases last month. A few weeks ago, he upped the ante on his earlier withdrawal from the Paris Agreement by severing ties with the United Nations framework that facilitates international cooperation on matters of climate change, environmental health, and resilience — a treaty that was ratified unanimously by the U.S. Senate in 1992.

“It has been an extraordinarily destructive year,” said Rachel Cleetus, climate and energy policy director at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. It’s not hard to find specific moves that have already done tangible harm to the climate: The EPA, for instance, delayed a requirement that oil and gas operators reduce emissions of methane, an ultra-potent and fast-acting greenhouse gas, for a full year. The Interior Department announced a $625 million investment to ​“reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry” and directed a costly Michigan coal plant on the verge of closure to stay open.

However, while these moves have been effective in sowing panic and uncertainty, their long-term effects on the country’s climate policy framework are far from certain. Indeed, only a small fraction of the climate damage threatened by Trump is truly permanent, experts told Grist. That’s not only because many of Trump’s moves may ultimately be ruled illegal — federal judges in Rhode Island, New York, and Virginia, for instance, allowed offshore wind farms in those states to resume construction just last week — but also because executive actions can be reversed by a future president. And the president has not shown much interest in passing energy- or climate-related legislation, a far more durable form of policymaking than executive decree. Despite claims to the contrary, Trump has signed fewer bills than any president since Dwight D. Eisenhower.

“He is not changing law,” said Elaine Kamarck, who worked in the Clinton administration and is the founding director of the Brookings Institution’s Center for Effective Public Management. ​“He is changing practice.”

Even something as unprecedented as the EPA’s moves to relinquish its own authority to regulate the emissions that affect human health — a responsibility that is a core tenet part of the agency’s mission and is therefore widely regarded as unlikely to hold up in court — could be unraveled by a future administration even if it’s ruled to be legal, though that process would take years.

“You can’t make up for the lost time, the increased emissions, and the extent that new areas are opened up for [fossil fuel] exploration,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. ​“But from a regulatory perspective, what this administration is doing to EPA and the other agencies are all executive actions that can be undone in the same way they were done.”

The major exception is the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA. If a future administration wants to restore expansive tax credits for wind and solar energy, that president will have to push Congress to pass new climate legislation. But the climate-relevant portions of OBBBA are noteworthy for being subtractive rather than additive — and are perhaps more accurately viewed as a representation of Trump’s quest to refute Biden’s legacy than as a desire to radically alter U.S. energy law. Indeed, the new law left in place the tax credits for other sources of carbon-free energy, including nuclear and geothermal — something that more moderate Republicans who do not share the president’s dismissal of climate science have been quick to note.

“We like to point out that the baseload clean energy credits were maintained,” said Luke Bolar, head of external affairs and communications at ClearPath, a think tank that develops conservative climate policies. Sean Casten, a Democratic U.S. representative from Illinois, said that the goal of the Biden-era climate legislation — ensuring that U.S. clean energy can be built in a cost-competitive way — has largely been achieved even if specific parts of the law have been repealed.

“Every single zero-carbon power source … is still cheaper on the margin than a fuel energy source,” he said.

The relative fragility of Trump’s assault on bedrock environmental and climate laws could be a product of the president’s prioritization of political dominance over lasting change, said Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way.

For example, the administration has taken steps to shield the American coal industry from the punishing blows of competition, environmental regulation, and the rising costs of mining. Trump has signed an executive order aimed at ​“reinvigorating America’s beautiful clean coal industry,” granted coal-fired power plants temporary exemptions from emissions limits, and ended a federal moratorium on coal leasing. But those interventions will do little in the long run to reverse a decline driven mainly by economics: The nation’s aging coal plants are becoming increasingly expensive to run while natural gas and solar energy have only gotten cheaper. And they certainly don’t help the president’s stated goal of reducing household energy costs.

To attempt to make sense of the president’s crusade to save coal is to assume there is a larger political strategy at play — which may not be the case, Freed said.

“There’s no reason to bring back coal other than to show that the administration can bring back coal,” he said. ​“It’s not like there’s this huge lobbying effort or donor base that will be of significant benefit to MAGA or Republicans if they do it.”

A style of governance motivated by political dominance is a good way to make headlines, but it’s not a particularly effective way to build a lasting legacy. Trump’s efforts to buoy coal may help the industry in the short term, but experts are broadly in agreement that coal can’t be ​“saved” without sustained support from the federal government. And an industry that can survive only with a coal-friendly Republican in the Oval Office isn’t exactly thriving.

“When you have to get the government to step in to put its thumb on the scale in order to help your industry,” Sean Feaster, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told my colleagues earlier this week, ​“it’s a sign that you’re not particularly competitive, right?”

For decades now, the pendulum of U.S. climate policy has swung left and right, reflecting the priorities of the sitting president. Trump’s climate blitzkrieg may be the starkest example yet of the benefits and drawbacks of that model. But despite his best efforts to stand out from the pack, the president’s first year back in office fits a well-worn pattern. As a result, his victories may not last much longer than his presidency.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Trump-hand-with-Sharpie_Getty-Images.webp?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=953dd3c9c80b54f8f6487f70729bfc17,N,,2026-01-26 04:58:44.052988

Fifteen years gets you to 2041, and who is footing the bill?” Bensusan noted that the technology risk seems significant, particularly for the AI-driven component of the rise in energy demand.
I have a 15-year PPA that’s $300 per MWh,’” Bensusan said, noting that technology risks apply also to energy generation, and that solar could become significantly cheaper and more reliable, particularly with battery storage over that time period.
“One thing that jumped out to me was the 15-year price certainty term that was mentioned in the statement of principles.
“This prescription for a 15-year term of price certainty could be attractive to developers and investors if the price is right.","The US Department of Energy and PJM’s own board put forward plans on the same day in mid-January to address the needs of the mid-Atlantic states where demand for power continues to rise along with rates and frustration.

The Department of Energy’s announcement, part of the administration’s plan to “Build Big Power Plants Again,” came with the announcement that an agreement between the region’s governors and the National Energy Dominance Council to bring $15 billion of baseload generation online while urging PJM, the largest US regional grid interconnection, to focus on “reliable” generation.

Natural gas accounts for about 45 percent of the PJM electricity mix, spanning across 13 states, followed by nuclear, although about 2.8GW of the new 3GW generation added in 2025 came from solar.

The agreement itself does not provide details about how the goals will be pursued, but a number of announcements asserted that it will serve to “accelerate development of reliable power generation by providing 15-year revenue certainty for new power plants”.

PJM, for its part, published a letter highlighting efforts to improve load forecasting, create an interconnection fast-track for industrial customers and announced plans to hold a future “emergency backstop capacity auction” without becoming the long-term procurement authority.

‘At what point will people revolt?’

Izzet Bensusan, CEO and founder of Captona, a New York-based energy transition investment firm with $3 billion in AUM, told Infrastructure Investor the announcements called to mind previous efforts to protect pricing guarantees, such as the Mobile Sierra Doctrine that raises the bar for FERC intervention into projects.

“It has pros and cons. As somebody who invests in plants, and in this case, we are looking to buy into three nuclear projects that are in development,” Bensusan said, “at the end of the day for an investor it could be good because I know I can finance against it.

“For me as an investor it’s a good incentive to start buying these assets and either retrofitting or repowering them. On the other hand, I have the following concerns: Most of our plants we’ve bought and owned now for 11, 12 years and things change over time. Fifteen years gets you to 2041, and who is footing the bill?”

Bensusan noted that the technology risk seems significant, particularly for the AI-driven component of the rise in energy demand. The facilities for training AI currently being built for hyperscalers may not serve much purpose once the shift to inferencing happens. “If we are going to invest and borrow money, the prudent thing to do is to get your equity back, if not with some return within seven, eight years,” he said.

”We’re signing up to power prices that [are] going to be much higher than the market, and then if the market goes down, at what point will people revolt and say, ‘Hey, you know what? I have a 15-year PPA that’s $300 per MWh,’” Bensusan said, noting that technology risks apply also to energy generation, and that solar could become significantly cheaper and more reliable, particularly with battery storage over that time period.

“So, we can invest more, but we would like to get the return on the capital sooner. On the con side, I think the long term of this is very unknown and somewhat the risk of who foots the bill at the end of the day.”

A big splash

Diana Jeschke, a senior energy regulatory attorney at law firm Linklaters, said those concerns are common among investors.

“Both items made a big splash, but from my perspective there is still a lot that needs to be worked out,” Jeschke said. “At a high level both actions seem to highlight the need for changes. There’s clearly a need to do something about all the new large loads that are coming on and make sure there will be reliable generation on the other end to serve them.”

Jeschke said there was significant overlap in the actions called for by both from the PJM board of directors and the Department of Energy.

“Even on the face of the documents there’s going to be uncertainty about where it’s going to land,” she said.

Jeschke added that there will likely be jurisdictional issues, particularly as pertains to efforts to tie the costs of data centres directly to the centres, which could require action by individual states as well as PJM.

“One thing that jumped out to me was the 15-year price certainty term that was mentioned in the statement of principles. There’s been an ongoing question about whether the capacity market framework as it currently exists is still sufficient to incentivise new generation,” Jeschke said, noting that currently PJM exists as a three-year forward market with price commitments coming in annual increments.

“This prescription for a 15-year term of price certainty could be attractive to developers and investors if the price is right. But I’m wondering how that’s going to work. Would there literally be an agreement or more of a price lock worked out to the PJM tariff?

“The auctions as they stand right now are designed for the loads or entities, mostly utilities, to be the buyers. It would be a change to have data centres participating directly in these auctions and I’m not sure that all of them would be willing to do that.”

‘Classical economics’

Dennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which has previously highlighted concerns about generation issues in PJM, said the moves by both organisations are unlikely to accomplish their stated goals of developing new baseload power, keeping prices down, and doing so fast.

“In a nutshell: I’m not sure how effective it’s going to be,” Wamsted said, adding that the release from the Department of Energy in particular “mis-categorised the PJM market completely”.

“PJM is a market right now. It may not work the way you or I want it to, and it may have its up and downs, but it’s designed to be a market. In the late 2010s and early 2020s that market was paying a very low price for capacity,” said Wamsted. “Part of the reason they were really low is because there was a big build out of gas earlier in the decade and there was very low demand growth.”

According to Wamsted, while problems with the PJM interconnect queue worsened matters, “classical economics” was in fact working to balance the supply and demand for capacity. Political pressure to keep prices for consumers low also made new installation a more difficult prospect, and many developers at the time were unmoved by PJM’s prices.

“You combine that with power that retired because most of it was old and most of it was economically inefficient, that has led to this shortage coming forward.”

PJM said last August that it studied nearly 140GW of generation interconnection projects since July 2023. The interconnection queue had been reduced to about 63GW of projects as of June 2025, all of which it said will be processed in 2025 and 2026.

“Turbines are hard to come by, and even if you could get one it would take you a minimum of three years to build and bring the operation online, and that assumes you already have permitting,” Wamsted said.",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1303511343.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 04:58:48.636044

The Hamburg declaration includes Germany, Norway, France and Denmark and aims to ""escape the fossil fuel rollercoaster"" and power homes and businesses across the continent, it added.

It will be signed at a summit in the German port city on Monday – three years after North Sea countries pledged to build 300GW of offshore wind in that sea by 2050, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ""weaponisation"" of European energy supplies.

North Sea countries will agree to deliver 100GW of that offshore wind power through joint clean energy projects, including wind farms at sea that are linked between multiple countries.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said in a statement: ""We are standing up for our national interest by driving for clean energy, which can get the UK off the fossil fuel rollercoaster and give us energy sovereignty and abundance.

""After our record renewables auction, we today go further by signing a clean energy security pact with European allies to ensure we maximise the clean energy potential for the North Sea.""

The government expects industry will respond by unveiling new projects to end Europe's ""reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets controlled by petrostates and dictators"".

An agreement on connecting the offshore grid between Britain, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands is also expected to be signed at the Future of the North Seas Summit.

The statement of intent is to focus on speeding up delivery by joint planning, cost sharing and market arrangements.

A framework to deepen German and UK collaboration on subsea energy infrastructure is also to be agreed.

The partnership would ""put UK firms at the forefront of grid technology"", the government said.

Agreements will also be made between Nato and Europe, particularly on cyber security co-operation in the North Sea.

Germany's minister of economics and energy Katherina Reiche said: ""The North Sea is a strategic key area for Europe's energy and supply security.

""By planning expansion, grids and industry together and implementing them across borders, we are creating clean and affordable energy, strengthening our industrial base and increasing Europe's strategic sovereignty.

""Today's investment pact provides reliable perspectives for the offshore sector, secures creation of value in Europe and brings future-proof jobs.""

The head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, which represents thousands of UK firms, welcomed the co-operation with European allies.

William Bain added in the statement: ""The commitments set out in the Hamburg Declaration will deliver on that, allowing our businesses to work on joint projects on renewables, interconnectors and other vital energy infrastructure.

""But we must not stop there. Action is also needed to ensure the competitiveness of oil and gas extraction and refining in the UK.

""This is a vital part of our energy mix in an uncertain world where we face multiple geopolitical and security threats.""

He said the current tax regime remains unsustainable and that the energy profits levy – the windfall tax on oil and gas companies – will have a negative impact on jobs and investment if it is not changed.

Bain added: ""The government must move to the recently announced oil and gas price mechanism as soon as possible, 2030 will be too late.""

Offshore hydrogen exports from the UK, and carbon capture and storage need to be explored too, he said, adding that European partners have focused on those aspects for energy security.

The spike has reverberated across overseas markets, underlining the growing globalization of the U.S.-dominated liquefied natural gas trade.

U.S. natural gas futures have surged by almost 70% over the last week to $5.35 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their highest since December 2022. The cold spell is set to lift domestic gas demand this week to 156 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), compared with a five-year January average of 137 bcfd, according to LSEG forecasts.

The Week in Breakingviews newsletter offers insights and ideas from Reuters' global financial commentary team. Sign up here.

At the same time, icy conditions are forcing drillers in regions such as the Permian shale basin in Texas and New Mexico to curb output due to “freeze‑offs,” when water and other liquids in the gas stream freeze. The trend will likely intensify as temperatures drop further.

Average gas output in the U.S. has already slipped to 108.4 bcfd so far in January, down from a record 109.7 bcfd in December, LSEG data showed, partly due to the cold weather. Tighter U.S. supply could reduce LNG exports, as liquefaction plants receive less feedgas.

Severe cold has curtailed oil and gas production several times in recent years. A 10-day cold spell in January 2024 led to a 3% drop in average monthly dry gas output, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

And three years earlier in February 2021, Winter Storm Uri led to a drop of over 20% in gas output at the lowest point compared with pre-storm levels. LNG feedgas fell by as much as 75% during the storm, leading to a 30% drop in February LNG exports that year, according to Kpler.

In each of these past Arctic blasts, output generally rebounded within a month or two. But since Uri, the U.S. has nearly doubled its liquefaction capacity, becoming the world's top LNG exporter, meaning a disruption today could create a much larger shortfall.

GLOBAL KNOCK-ON EFFECT

What has changed in recent years is that cold weather conditions in the U.S. can now lead to higher gas prices in Asia and especially Europe, which is heavily dependent on U.S. LNG after Russia slashed pipeline flows following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The U.S. has since 2023 dominated the LNG market, becoming the first country to export over 100 million metric tons per year in 2025. Around two-thirds of that was delivered to Europe, according to data analytics firm Kpler.

Benchmark European TTF gas prices gained over 6% last week to almost 40 euros per megawatt hour, or $13.75 per mmBtu, the highest since June 2025. Prices have risen by 38% so far this month, driven by a rapid depletion of regional gas stocks, which are currently 48% of capacity, far below last year's level of roughly 58%.

Europe is expected to import a record amount of LNG this year, the International Energy Agency said on Friday, with the bulk of the increase expected to come from the U.S.

To be sure, the current rally pales in comparison to the post-invasion spike in 2022, when TTF prices quadrupled to more than 300 euros per MWh.

Global LNG prices eventually returned to near pre‑invasion levels, helped by surging new supply that is expected to keep prices relatively low in coming years.

Between 2025 and 2030, new LNG export capacity is expected to grow some 50%, or by 300 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year globally, driven mainly by the U.S. and Qatar, according to the IEA.

INTERCONNECTED MARKET

Yet, the increasingly interconnected LNG market means that when sudden shifts in supply or demand do occur in major producing areas, whether due to outages or extreme weather, the global impact will be more pronounced than in the past.

And, importantly, climate change is likely to make such extreme weather events more frequent.

""The global gas market has become far more interconnected,"" said Mashal Jaffery, partner at gas and LNG commercial advisory Baringa. ""Regardless of their absolute price levels, markets such as TTF and (U.S.) Henry Hub are now structurally more volatile and increasingly exposed to supply, demand, and geopolitical dynamics originating outside their own regions.""

Of course, the global gas market has adapted. A larger number of LNG cargoes are now held at sea, enabling traders to respond more quickly to regional price swings. This can help the market respond to short‑term demand spikes and ultimately smooth volatility.

In other words, the gas market – which has long been highly regional in nature – is now starting to look like the modern, highly liquid oil market.

As the world’s fastest-growing major economy, its energy demand is rising at nearly three times the global average, and India is expected to account for around 25% of global energy demand growth over the next two decades.

To manage this responsibly, under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India has built its strategy on four strong pillars. The first is diversification of supplies. The country has expanded its crude oil import basket from 27 countries in 2014 to over 40 countries today, insulating the economy from global volatility. The second pillar is affordability for the common citizen. Despite significant global price shocks, India is among the few countries where fuel prices have declined over the last three years. This has been achieved through calibrated tax interventions and proactive management by public sector oil marketing companies.

Third, India is steadily transitioning towards a gas-based economy. Natural gas is viewed as a critical bridge fuel, and efforts are underway to raise its share in the energy mix from about 6% today to 15% by 2030 through rapid expansion of pipelines, LNG terminals, and city gas distribution networks.

The fourth pillar is the biofuel revolution, which has emerged as a clear success story. India achieved 10% ethanol blending ahead of schedule and is firmly on track to reach 20% by 2025, five years ahead of the original target. Together, these measures enable rapid economic growth while keeping energy secure, affordable, and progressively cleaner.

India is no longer a passive participant in the global energy system. Today, it is a structural growth engine and an increasingly important stabilising force. India sees its role as that of a global bridge, connecting producers and consumers, the developed world and the Global South, and traditional energy systems with emerging clean technologies.

Initiatives such as the Global Biofuels Alliance, which now brings together over 29 countries and 14 international organisations, demonstrate how India is helping to create sustainable and circular energy economies at scale.

Similarly, the India–Middle East– Europe Economic Corridor reflects India’s vision of integrated energy, trade, and digital infrastructure, with clean fuels such as green hydrogen at its core.

Most importantly, India brings a balanced and realistic voice to global energy conversations. For 1.4 billion Indians, and for billions across the developing world, energy security is not solely about decarbonisation. It is about development with dignity. India’s leadership seeks to ensure that the global energy transition remains just, inclusive, and equitable.

Green hydrogen represents one of the most significant opportunities for India. Under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the country is targeting annual production of 5 million metric tonnes by 2030, with the potential to scale further as export markets develop. Capacities for electrolyser manufacturing and hydrogen production are already being awarded, positioning India as a competitive global hub for green molecules.

Beyond hydrogen, India is making strong progress across several other key areas. Compressed bio-gas is one example, with more than 130 plants already operational and many more under development, converting agricultural waste into clean energy while generating additional income for farmers.

India is also accelerating work on sustainable aviation fuel to decarbonise one of the hardest-to-abate sectors, as well as on second-generation ethanol and waste-to-energy projects that combine technological innovation with social and environmental benefits.

Digitalisation is another important enabler. The use of AI, data analytics, and advanced monitoring systems is improving efficiency across exploration and production, refining, and the rapidly expanding city gas distribution networks. When aligned with policy and scale, technology becomes a powerful driver of transition.

India Energy Week has quickly established itself as one of the world’s most consequential energy platforms, and the 2026 edition will reflect India’s “energy abundance” mindset.

The event will move beyond a simplistic division between traditional and renewable energy. Instead, it will showcase how India is greening its conventional energy sectors through efficiency improvements and emerging solutions, while simultaneously scaling up the fuels and technologies of the future.

India Energy Week provides a space where policy, industry, technology, and investment converge.

Morrisey’s 50 by 50 plan was first announced last summer.
During the 2025 Governor’s Energy Summit last November, Morrisey announced several economic development projects related to energy that could add 1.9 gigawatts of energy towards his 50 by 50 plan.
Those projects included a $2.5 billion FirstEnergy natural gas power plant with additional 70 megawatts of utility-scale solar power generation, and the $1.2 billion Wolf Summit Energy 625-megawatt natural gas power plant in Harrison County.","CHARLESTON — Gov. Patrick Morrisey told attendees of one of the largest natural gas events in West Virginia that the latest announcement about Houston-based Calpine LLC building a natural gas power plant in Marshall County is another example of his 50 by 50 plan gaining support.

Morrisey spoke Thursday morning at the Gas and Oil Association of West Virginia’s 2026 winter meeting at the Marriott Town Center Hotel in downtown Charleston.

“West Virginia is on the rise, and gas is playing a major role in that,” Morrisey told the crowd. “I’ve always thought that West Virginia is America’s energy state and just keeps needing a little bit more kick to get it to the next level.

“There is room for you to be strong, there is room for you to be dominant, and there’s room for other forms of energy to be strong and dominant as well,” Morrisey continued. “Because for West Virginia to truly change and transform to the kind of state we want it to be, it’s going to rely heavily on all the people in this room.”

Morrisey announced that Calpine, a subsidiary of Baltimore-based energy management services company Constellation Energy, has finalized its project to build a 500-megawatt natural gas power plant in Moundsville. The proposed $1 billion investment would involve 400 construction jobs and 25 permanent jobs when complete.

“That’s great. That’s good stuff,” Morrisey said. “This is a major vote of confidence for our state.”

Morrisey said the potential of another 500 megawatts of electric power was proof that companies were heeding his call to increase the number of megawatts produced by West Virginia from 16 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts by 2050. Morrisey’s 50 by 50 plan was first announced last summer.

The plan focuses on easing regulatory hurdles for power producers in order to increase the state’s base load electric generating capacity from 16 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts in the next 25 years to meet the growing demand for electricity by AI programs and data centers in the PJM Interconnection grid, and to remain competitive with other nations, such as China.

During the 2025 Governor’s Energy Summit last November, Morrisey announced several economic development projects related to energy that could add 1.9 gigawatts of energy towards his 50 by 50 plan. Those projects included a $2.5 billion FirstEnergy natural gas power plant with additional 70 megawatts of utility-scale solar power generation, and the $1.2 billion Wolf Summit Energy 625-megawatt natural gas power plant in Harrison County.

With the Calpine announcement, Morrisey said that brings the state to 2.35 gigawatts in proposed new natural gas power generation, with the potential for future announcements that could result in between seven to 10 gigawatts of new electric generation.

“I know a lot of people thought that we were on the sauce a little bit when we went from 16 gigawatts in our plan to 50 by 2050,” Morrisey said. “The demand is certainly there. And now the key is we’re really taking advantage of our energy resources in a way we haven’t seen before … That is the plan, and it’s a good plan. And I’m not going to let any media or anyone come in our way.”

Morrisey told attendees that a key driver of anticipated future energy demand is the technology sector, particularly the development of data centers. West Virginia has taken legislative action to position itself as a prime location for this industry through the passage last year of House Bill 2014, the bill creating data center and microgrid districts.

“I went out to California. I spent a lot of time with data center companies and a lot of the tech companies. And West Virginia wasn’t on the map in terms of the data center front,” Morrisey said. “I said, ‘you know what?

Canada Systematically Destroying Itself, Says Trump

In a post on the social media platform X on Sunday, Transport Secretary Sean Duffy shared a clip posted by Trump on Truth Social, which criticized Canada's EV trade agreement with China.

""Canada is systematically destroying itself,"" Trump said in the post. He added that the agreement with China was ""a disaster"" deal and would go down as ""one of the worst deals, of any kind, in history.""

Trump also said that Canada's businesses were moving to the U.S., though he did not provide any additional information or elaborate on that claim. ""I want to see Canada SURVIVE AND THRIVE!"" he said.

Canada's trade deal with China outlines lower tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles coming into the country. As part of the agreement, Ottawa will initially permit up to 49,000 EVs from China at a 6.1% tariff.

Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs

The news comes as Trump threatened to levy 100% tariffs on Canada. ""If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A,"" Trump said.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, however, shared during a press briefing on Sunday that Canada's deal with China was consistent with the conditions outlined in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

The agreement has been criticized by Duffy, who shared that the country would ""live to regret"" the decision of letting Chinese-made EVs into the country. Chinese-made EVs have also raised concerns in Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) CEO Jim Farley.

A clean energy future is within reach.","On this International Day of Clean Energy, we can feel the world shifting – but we must pick up the pace.

The science tells us we are heading for a temporary overshoot above 1.5 degrees Celsius. Our responsibility is to make that breach as small, as short, and as safe as possible – through a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.

Renewables are the engine that can drive this transition. They are the cheapest source of new power in most places. And last year, for the first time, wind, solar, and other renewables generated more electricity worldwide than coal.

Renewable energy connects communities still left in the dark, provides clean cooking, and opens the door to better health, education, and opportunities. Renewables anchor new industries, create decent jobs and lower energy costs, while shielding countries from geopolitical shocks and market volatility.

Even so, the renewables revolution is not moving fast enough or far enough. Grid infrastructure is lagging well behind the expansion of clean energy capacity, and high costs continue to shut many countries out of the transition entirely.

The roadmap is clear: we must triple global renewable capacity by 2030, by lifting barriers, cutting costs, and connecting clean power to people and industry – with scale, speed, and solidarity.

Regulators must adopt policies that reward clean power and streamline permitting while protecting people and nature. Utilities must upgrade, expand, and digitize grids and interconnections, to carry clean power where it is needed, and scale storage so power systems stay steady as renewables grow. Industry must diversify supply chains so more countries can manufacture, install, and maintain clean energy systems. This includes the critical minerals essential to the transition, which must benefit producing countries and communities – not just global markets.

Finance must bring down the cost of capital, especially for developing countries with vast renewable potential. And multilateral development banks must reduce risk and unlock far greater private investment.

Most importantly, we must ensure this transition is just – protecting workers and communities, supporting education, industrial development, and opportunity for all as energy systems evolve.

Hong Kong IPO candidate Wuxi Lead Intelligent commands 15.5% of the global market for lithium battery manufacturing equipment, benefiting from China’s EV dominance

Solid-state battery equipment offers major growth potential for the company, but the industry’s highly cyclical nature requires careful capital management

By Hugh Chen

Everyone knows that China dominates battery manufacturing, home to global leader CATL as well as smaller players like CALB and Gotion High Tech (002074.SZ). But far less visible is China’s equally commanding position in the upstream manufacturing equipment segment behind the finished product.

The leader in that space is Wuxi Lead Intelligent Equipement Co. Ltd. (300450.SZ), whose plan for a second listing in Hong Kong, complementing its current listing in Shenzhen, made a key advance last week after receiving approval from China’s securities regulator.

As the leader in its class, the company is hoping to follow in the footsteps of CATL, one of its top customers, whose shares have nearly doubled since its own second listing last May that was Hong Kong’s largest for the year, raising more than $4.6 billion.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission’s (CSRC) approval is the latest advance in a rocky overseas listing journey for Wuxi Lead Equipment, which terminated plans for a Switzerland listing in early 2025. It then pivoted to Hong Kong with its submission of an IPO prospectus, but that filing lapsed, and the company had to submit an updated version in August last year.

Wuxi Lead Equipment filed an updated prospectus on Sunday after the CSRC approval, suggesting the listing is likely to move forward quickly after clearing the key regulator advance.

The company, which has been listed in Shenzhen since 2015, didn’t announce how much it would raise. But its selection of A-listed underwriters JPMorgan and Citic Securities suggests the offering size should be substantial, attracting both Asian and global investors.

Those investors are likely eying the company’s leading position in battery equipment, similar to CATL’s position for finished batteries. Its investments in emerging solid-state battery equipment technology and diversification into photovoltaic manufacturing equipment could serve as additional attractions. However, investors also need to consider certain risks, including the cyclical nature of both the battery and photovoltaic industries.

We’ll examine these risks in greater detail shortly, but first we’ll begin with a review of the company’s core business and development story.

Wuxi Lead Intelligent was founded in 2002 by Wang Yanqing, 58, who got his start as an engineer making radio components. The company began by manufacturing equipment to make the capacitors that are energy storage components used in various electronic devices, including mobile phones and home appliances. It became a major player in this space and secured contracts to supply machinery to electronics giants including Japan’s Panasonic.

Over that time, Wang observed that lithium battery manufacturing shared fundamental processes with capacitor production, leading him to establish a lithium battery equipment division in 2008. The timing proved fortuitous, coinciding with the lithium battery industry’s rise driven by surging smartphone demand.

Riding EV growth

The company’s big break came after it identified opportunities in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, which the Chinese government designated as a strategic industry around 2010. Wuxi Lead Intelligent was among the earliest to capitalize on the resulting boom in battery equipment demand. It secured key backing from CATL, with the battery giant naming Wuxi Lead Intelligent as a core supplier in 2014.

CATL’s orders helped the company record more than 70% revenue growth the following year. As EV sales in China took off, battery companies like CATL expanded rapidly, lifting battery equipment providers as well. Wuxi Lead Intelligent emerged as a major beneficiary thanks to its strong technical expertise, and quickly expanded its customer base beyond CATL to major domestic and international players including Sony, Panasonic, LG, Tesla and BYD.

According to third-party research cited in its prospectus, the company was the world’s largest lithium-ion battery intelligent equipment provider in 2024, commanding 15.5% of the global market. Its dominance is even more pronounced in China, where it holds a 19% market share.

The company’s growth momentum has slowed considerably in recent years due to oversupply in the battery market after a massive buildup. Its revenue rose just 19% in 2023 before contracting 29% in 2024. Profitability trended similarly, with net profit plunging from 1.8 billion yuan ($258 million) in 2023 to just 268 million yuan in 2024.

This underscores the cyclical nature of the battery industry. Since the second half of 2023, the lithium battery supply chain has entered an adjustment period, with downstream players slowing capacity expansion amid a brutal price war in the EV sector.

Things began to pick up last year. Revenue resumed growth in the first three quarters of 2025, rising 15% year-on-year to 10.4 billion yuan, while the company’s net profit nearly doubled to 1.2 billion yuan.

Wuxi Lead Intelligent is now emphasizing the opportunity presented by solid-state battery equipment. Compared to traditional liquid-based lithium-ion batteries, solid-state batteries offer advantages in safety and energy density, and carmakers are increasingly shifting toward them. Solid-state batteries have already begun contributing to revenue, though they are still at an early stage. Solid-state battery equipment generated between 400 million yuan and 500 million yuan in the first half of 2025, according to an October research note from Citi.

Nomura said in a November report that it expects Wuxi Lead Intelligent’s order book momentum to continue into 2026, driven largely by demand from solid-state battery commercialization as well as capacity expansion for energy storage systems associated with solar and wind power plants — another area the company has identified for growth.

Wuxi Lead Intelligent has also recently ramped up efforts to expand into other equipment types, most notably photovoltaic equipment, an area it first entered in 2009. However, despite years of development, photovoltaic equipment revenue remains modest, contributing just 9% of the company’s total in the first three quarters of 2025, while battery intelligent equipment accounted for the majority at 67%.

Its difficulty breaking into the photovoltaic equipment market partly reflects the challenges of adapting battery manufacturing technology to a different sector, and also underscores the intensely competitive nature of the photovoltaic industry.

In the battery equipment space, Wuxi Lead Intelligent faces competition from the three largest players: Shenzhen Yinghe Technology (300457.SZ), Zhejiang Hangke Technology (688006.SS) and Guangdong Lyric Robot Automation (688499.SS). In the photovoltaic equipment space, it faces much larger rivals such as Naura (002371.SZ) and Shenzhen S.C New Energy Technology (300724.SZ). Wuxi Lead Intelligent acknowledges in its prospectus that its position in the photovoltaic equipment market is negligible.

At the end of the day, solid-state batteries offer the biggest growth opportunity for the company right now, and its secondary IPO comes at an opportune time to raise additional capital for continued technology investment. Given the cyclical nature of both the battery and photovoltaic industries, the company will need to carefully manage its capital allocation and maintain financial flexibility to weather industry downturns while positioning itself to capture growth when demand recovers.",https://thebambooworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Wuxi-Lead-0126.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 01:58:18.351442

Ten years ago, switching from burning coal to gas was a key element of China’s policy to reduce severe air pollution.

However, while gas is seen in some countries as a “bridging” fuel to move away from coal use, rapid electrification, uncompetitiveness and supply concerns have suppressed its share in China’s energy mix.

As such, while China’s gas demand has more than doubled over the past decade, the fuel is not currently playing a decisive role in the country’s strategy to tackle climate change.

Instead, renewables are now the leading replacement for coal demand in China, with growth in solar and wind generation largely keeping emissions growth from China’s power sector flat.

While gas could play a role in decarbonising some aspects of China’s energy demand – particularly in terms of meeting power demand peaks and fuelling heavy industry – multiple factors would need to change to make it a more attractive alternative.

Small, but impactful

The share of gas in China’s primary energy demand is small and has remained relatively unchanged at around 8-9% over the past five years.

It also comprises 7% of China’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fuel combustion, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Gas combustion in China added 755m tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2) into the atmosphere in 2023 – double the total amount of CO2 emitted by the UK.

However, its emissions profile in China lags well behind that of coal, which represented 79% of China’s fuel-linked CO2 emissions and was responsible for almost 9bn tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2023, according to the same IEA data.

Gas consumption continues to grow in line with an overall uptick in total energy demand. Chinese gas demand, driven by industry use, grew by around 7-8% year-on-year in 2024, according to different estimates.

This rapid growth is, nevertheless, slightly below the 9% average annual rise in China’s gas demand over the past decade, during which consumption has more than doubled overall, as shown in the figure below.

Total demand for gas in China, 1965-2024, billion cubic metres. Source: Energy Institute statistical review of world energy 2025.

The state-run oil and gas company China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) forecast in 2025 that demand growth for the year may slow further to just over 6%.

The majority of China’s gas demand in 2023 was met by domestic gas supply, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

Most of this supply comes from conventional gas sources. But incremental Chinese domestic gas supply in recent years has come from harder-to-extract unconventional sources, including shale gas, which accounted for as much as 45% of gas production in 2024.

Despite China’s large recoverable shale-gas resources and subsidies to encourage production, geographical and technical limitations have capped production levels relative to the US, which is the world’s largest gas producer by far.

CNPC estimates Chinese gas output will grow by just 4% in 2025, compared with 6% growth in 2024. Nevertheless, output is still expected to exceed the 230bn cubic metre national target for 2025.

Liquified natural gas (LNG) is China’s second most-common source of gas, imported via giant super-cooled tankers from countries including Australia, Qatar, Malaysia and Russia.

This is followed by pipeline imports – which are seen as cheaper, but less reliable – from Russia and central Asia.

One particularly high-profile pipeline project is the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline project. However, Beijing has yet to explicitly agree to investing in or purchasing the gas delivered by the project. Disagreements around pricing and logistics have hindered progress.

Evolving role

Beijing initially aimed for gas to displace coal as part of a broader policy to tackle air pollution.

A three-year action plan from 2018-2020, dubbed the “blue-sky campaign”, helped to accelerate gas use in the industrial and residential sectors, as gas displaced consumption of “dispersed coal” (散煤)”– referring to improperly processed coal that emits more pollutants.

Meanwhile, several cities across northern and central China were also mandated to curtail coal usage and switch to gas instead. Many of these cities were based in provinces with a strong coal mining economy or higher winter heating demand.

China’s pollution levels saw “drastic improvement” as a result, according to a report by research institute the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).

(In January 2026, there were widespread media reports of households choosing not to use gas heating despite freezing temperatures, as a result of high prices following the expiry of subsidies for gas use.)

Industry remains the largest gas user in China, with “city gas” – gas delivered by pipeline to urban areas – trailing in second, as shown in the figure below. Power generation is a distant third.

Gas has never gained momentum in China’s power sector, with its share of power generation remaining at 4% while wind and solar power’s share has soared from 4% to 22% over the past decade, Yu Aiqun, a research analyst at the US-based thinktank Global Energy Monitor, tells Carbon Brief.

Yu adds that this stagnation is largely due to insufficient and unreliable gas supply, which drives up prices and makes gas less competitive compared to coal and renewables. She says:

“With the rapid expansion of renewables and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, I don’t foresee a bright future for gas power.”

Average on-grid gas-fired power prices of 0.56-0.58 yuan per kilowatt hour (yuan/kWh) in China are far higher than that of around 0.3-0.4 yuan/kWh for coal power, according to some industry estimates. Recent auction prices for renewables are even cheaper than this.

Meanwhile, the share of renewables in China’s power capacity stood at 55% in 2024, compared with gas at around 4%.

Generation from wind and solar in particular has increased by more than 1,250 terawatt-hours (TWh) in China since 2015, while gas-fired generation has increased by just 140TWh, according to IEEFA.

As the share of coal has shrunk from 70% to 61% during this period, IEEFA suggests that renewables – rather than gas – are displacing coal’s share in the generation mix.

However, China’s gas capacity may still rise from approximately 150 gigawatts (GW) in 2025 to 200GW by 2030, Bloomberg reports.

A report by the National Energy Administration (NEA) on development of the sector notes that gas will continue to play a “critical role” in “peak shaving”, where gas turbines can be used for short periods to meet daily spikes in demand. As such, the NEA says gas will be an “important pillar” in China’s energy transition.

In 2024, a new policy on gas utilisation also “explicitly promoted” the use of gas peak-shaving power plants, according to industry outlet MySteel.

China’s current gas storage capacity is “insufficient”, according to CNPC, reducing its ability to meet peak-shaving demand. The country built 38 underground gas storage sites with peak-shaving capacity of 26.7bn cubic metres in 2024, but this accounts for just 6% of its annual gas demand.

Transport use

Gas is instead playing a bigger part in the displacement of diesel in the transport sector, due to the higher cost competitiveness of LNG as a fuel – particularly in the trucking sector.

CNPC expects that LNG displaced around 28-30m tonnes of diesel in the trucking sector in 2025, accounting for 15% of total diesel demand in China.

This is further aided by policy support from Beijing’s equipment trade-in programme, part of efforts to stimulate the economy.

However, gas is not necessarily a better option for heavy-duty, long-haul transportation, due to poorer fuel efficiency compared with electric vehicles (EVs).

In fact, “new-energy vehicles” (NEVs) – including hydrogen fuel-cell, pure-electric and hybrid-electric trucks – are displacing both LNG-fueled trucks and diesel heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs).

In the first half of 2025, battery-electric models accounted for 22% of all HDV sales, a year-on-year increase of 9%, while market share for LNG-fueled trucks fell from 30% in 2024 to 26%.

Gas can be cheaper than oil but is not competitive with EVs and – with the emergence of zero-emission fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia – gas may eventually lose even this niche market, says Yu.

Supply security

Chinese government officials frequently note that China is “rich in coal, poor in oil and short of gas” (“富煤贫油少气”). Concerns around import dependence have underpinned China’s focus on coal as a source of energy security.

However, Beijing increasingly sees electrification as a more strategic way to decarbonise its transport sector, according to some analysts.

“Overall, electrification is a clear energy security strategy to reduce exposure to global fossil fuel markets,” says Michal Meidan, head of the China energy research programme at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

Chinese oil and gas production grew dramatically in the last few years under a seven-year action plan from 2019-25, as Beijing ordered its state oil firms to ramp up output to ensure energy security.

Despite this, gas import dependency still hovers at around 40% of demand. This, according to assessments in government documents, exposes the country to price shocks and geopolitical risks.

The graph below shows the share of domestically produced gas (dark blue), LNG imports (mid-blue) and pipeline imports (light blue), in China’s overall gas supply between 2017 and 2024.

China’s gas supply by source, 2017-2024, billion cubic metres (bcm). Source: IEEFA.

“Gas use is unlikely to play a significant role in decarbonising the power system, but could be more significant in industrial decarbonisation,” Meidan tells Carbon Brief.

She estimates that if LNG prices fall to $6 per million British thermal units (btu), compared to an average of $11 in 2024-25, this could encourage fuel switching in the steel, chemical manufacturing, textiles, ceramics and food processing industries.

The chart below shows the year-on-year change in gas demand between 2001-2022.

Year-on-year changes in Chinese industry’s gas demand by sector, 2001-2023, bcm. Source: National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), OIES.

Growth in gas demand has been decelerating in some industries in recent years, such as refining. But it also remains unclear if Beijing will adopt more aggressive policies favouring gas, Meidan adds.

A roadmap developed by the Energy Research Institute (ERI), a thinktank under the National Development and Reform Commission’s Academy of Macroeconomic Research, finds that gas only begins to play an equivalent or greater role in China’s energy mix than coal by 2050 at the earliest – 10 years ahead of China’s target for achieving carbon neutrality.

Both fossil fuels play a significantly smaller role than clean-energy sources at this point.

Wang Zhongying and Kaare Sandholt, both experts at the ERI, write in Carbon Brief:

“Gas does not play a significant role in the power sector in our scenarios, as solar and wind can provide cheaper electricity while existing coal power plants – together with scaled-up expansion of energy storage and demand-side response facilities – can provide sufficient flexibility and peak-load capacity.”

Ultimately, China’s push for gas will be contingent on its own development goals. Its next five-year plan, from 2026-2030, will build a framework for China’s shift to controlling absolute carbon emissions, rather than carbon intensity.

Recent recommendations by top Chinese policymakers on priorities for the next five-year plan did not explicitly mention gas. Instead, the government endorses “raising the level of electrification in end-use energy consumption” while also “promoting peaking of coal and oil consumption”.

The Chinese government feels that gas is “nice to have…if available and cost-competitive but is not the only avenue for China’s energy transition,” says Meidan.

While improvements in vehicle battery technology have led to increased battery range, consumers are still left wondering how long they can expect their vehicle battery to last. After all, the battery pack is the most expensive part of an electric car, with a new battery costing upwards of $20,000.

So what can you expect for an electric vehicle’s battery lifespan? We have the important answers.

What are EV Batteries?

Internal combustion engined cars are powered by gasoline, while EVs are powered by a battery pack driving one or more electric motors. The batteries that power electric cars are rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which is the same type of battery found in cell phones and other consumer electronics. Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density than lead-acid or nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, which means they don’t take up as much space while providing an equivalent level of power. A vehicle’s battery capacity is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh), so a vehicle with a higher kWh rating means it has more range.

How Long Do EV Batteries Last?

The lifespan of an EV battery depends on a number of factors. While battery life can vary, EV manufacturers are generally required to issue a warranty for at least 8 years or 100,000 miles. However, some manufacturers offer longer warranties. Kia offers a battery pack warranty for 10 years or 100,000 miles, and Hyundai provides warranty coverage on EV batteries for the vehicle’s entire lifetime. Battery warranties vary not only by time but also by the nature of the coverage. Some automakers will only replace the battery if it completely fails, while others, like BMW, Tesla, and Volkswagen, will cover a battery if its capacity falls below a certain percentage.

Recent studies show that EV batteries may retain around 90% capacity after 100,000 kilometers and about 87% after 300,000 kilometers, with an annual degradation rate of approximately 1.8%. For example, a Tesla Model S only loses an estimated five percent of battery capacity over its first 50,000 miles. As battery technology continues to evolve, companies are creating larger batteries with increased range and reduced degradation. The first-generation Nissan LEAF had a maximum range of 84 miles, while the newest LEAF has a maximum range of 212 miles.

Modern electric car batteries are increasingly designed to last the entire life of the vehicle, reducing the likelihood of needing a battery replacement. With advancements in battery management systems and engineering, an EV battery is expected to last 10-20 years, depending on maintenance and care.

How to Prolong the Life of Your Electric Vehicle Battery

Just like there are preventative maintenance measures to extend the life of your gasoline vehicle, there are EV charging measures you can take to prolong your EV’s battery life. Here are the top tips to protect your EV battery’s health:

1. Avoid parking in extreme temperatures

Lithium batteries have thermal management systems that will heat or cool themselves, which in turn uses energy and drains EV battery packs. Try to park in the shade if possible on hot days and inside in extreme cold temperatures to assist battery longevity.

2. Don’t Charge Your Car Too Much or Too Little

Modern electric cars are equipped with management systems that avoid charging and discharging at the maximum and minimum charging levels. You should avoid charging your vehicle above 80 percent or below 20 percent to extend EV battery life.

3. Minimize Use of Fast Charging Stations

DC fast charging stations can bring your battery level up to 80 percent in as little as 30 minutes. With this convenience comes a strain on your EV battery. For optimal battery life, you should limit how often you plug in to these fast charging stations for occasional scenarios, like road trips.

4. Maintain Optimal State of Charge While Vehicle is Stored

If you are planning on storing your vehicle for a long time, make sure that your battery does not have an empty or full charge. With a timed charger, you can set it to maintain the charging level between 25 and 75 percent.

Second Life of EV Batteries

When an automotive EV battery’s performance dips below 70 percent, it can have a second life when it is no longer useful to power a vehicle. There are many applications to repurpose EV batteries for renewable energy sources including home battery storage systems and powering manufacturing plants. In Japan, Toyota has installed EV batteries to store power generated from solar panels.

Bottom Line

While an electric car’s battery life can vary, advancements in technology have helped ensure that it typically lasts for the lifespan of a vehicle. The main factor for prolonging a battery’s life expectancy is to limit the number of charging cycles each battery cell goes through. Battery cells die when a battery reaches its empty or full state of charge for too long, so make sure you charge your vehicle according to the manufacturer’s instructions to minimize battery degradation.

Where it is safe to do so, crews have begun restoring power to customers who lost service but continued icy road conditions may delay teams from safely traveling to restore power. With temperatures dropping below freezing overnight, there is a threat of refreezing on untreated surfaces, which could hamper traveling until roads thaw. We continue to monitor the forecast and are prepared to respond where it is safe to do so.

As of 2 p.m., we have approximately 3,200 company employees, contractors and mutual aid resources in Louisiana, with more anticipated to arrive.

Estimated restoration times will be available on Monday, January 26.

Ice storms cause delays because the damage doesn’t happen all at once. Unlike wind events or hurricanes, ice storms often unfold over many hours or even days, leading to outages that occur in waves.

As freezing rain falls, ice steadily accumulates on power lines, trees and poles, adding layer upon layer of weight. Equipment may hold initially, then fail hours or days later as stress increases. Even small amounts of ice can add hundreds of pounds, causing lines to sag, tree limbs to snap, or poles to be pulled down well after precipitation ends. Trees often fail gradually, with ice-laden branches cracking or falling later as temperatures fluctuate, sometimes bringing down lines after crews have already restored nearby power. Repeated freezing, slight melting and refreezing further strain equipment, weakening components and triggering new outages over time.

Restoring power during winter storms is different from other weather events and requires a careful, step-by-step approach to protect both customers, workers and the electric grid.

Before power can be restored, damage to infrastructure must be assessed. Damage assessment and restoration work has been slowed by downed vegetation blocking roadways and icy road conditions. Once it is safe to do so, crews begin evaluating damage to power plants, transmission lines, substations and local distribution equipment.

Cold load pickup is the phenomenon that takes place when a distribution circuit is re-energized following an extended outage of that circuit.

It is referred to as cold load pickup because the power supply has been unavailable for a period of time, so the load has reached a “cold” state before being re-energized.

Customer safety and community resources

Customers should continue to prioritize safety while outages persist.

Warming centers: Customers in need of shelter and warmth should consider local warming centers or shelters if it is safe to travel.

In an article written on this occasion, the Party chief recalled President Ho Chi Minh’s call to action, “Forward! Total victory will be ours!” and emphasized that today the late President’s appeal still surges with momentum, “spurring us to strengthen our resolve, overcome poverty and backwardness, and build a prosperous and happy country.”

The Investor introduces a translation of the article by Vietnam News Agency as follows.

FORWARD! TOTAL VICTORY WILL SURELY BE OURS!

The 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam has just concluded with great success, marking a particularly momentous political event that opens a new era of development for the country. The Congress represented a powerful convergence of the will, aspirations, and determination of the entire Party, the entire people, and the entire army, crystallizing the nation’s intellect and desire to rise.

The Congress’s guiding principle - “Solidarity-Democracy-Discipline-Breakthrough-Development” - is not merely a slogan, it is truly a call to action and a mandate of responsibility before history, affirming an unshakable belief in the path chosen by the Party, President Ho Chi Minh, and our People.

With thorough, rigorous, and scientific preparation and broad-based input from across the Party and the people, the documents adopted at the 14th Congress reflect strategic vision and the highest level of political resolve. Notably, for the first time in the history of Party congresses, the 14th Congress issued an Action Program accompanying the Resolution - a breakthrough aimed at ensuring that the Resolution is put into practice immediately.

From guidelines to planning and implementation, responsibilities are clearly defined: who does what, when it is done, what resources are required, and what the ultimate objectives are. As a result, the Resolution of the 14th Congress has truly become an action handbook for the Party and the entire political system, a “guiding torch” lighting the way forward on the country’s new development path.

The Resolution of the 14th Congress sets out exceptionally clear, bold yet feasible overarching goals for the 2026-2030 period, with a vision through 2045: maintaining a peaceful and stable environment; advancing rapid and sustainable national development; comprehensively improving the People’s living standards; and strengthening self-reliance and resilience to move confidently into the nation’s new era.

More importantly, the 14th Congress’s documents translate this spirit of decisive action into concrete terms. The Action Program accompanying the Resolution places particular emphasis on the requirement to “make the right choices - implement quickly - follow through to the end - measure performance by results” across all tasks.

Every major policy decision of the Congress has been developed into a practical implementation plan, with clearly defined objectives, solutions, and evaluation criteria. The principle of “the People as the roots” runs throughout: the People are placed at the center and as the subject of development, with all policies aimed at improving their material and spiritual well-being; while upholding respect for, listening to, and fully harnessing the People’s role as masters of the nation.

As a result, the Resolution of the 14th Congress goes beyond vision and orientation, carrying the pulse of real life, inspiring a renewed aspiration for development and a powerful momentum for action, ready to be translated into practice immediately after the Congress.

From resolution to action

With the Resolution in place and the Program clearly defined, what remains is action. The Congress requires Party Committees at all levels to swiftly disseminate, study, and translate the Resolution into programs and plans tailored to their respective localities and units, promptly putting both the Resolution and the Action Program into practice.

The overarching imperative is a decisive shift from “talk” to “action,” from awareness to implementation. The Congress documents make clear the need to resolutely and thoroughly address the problems of “talking much but doing little,” “saying well but doing poorly,” and “saying one thing and doing another,” and to put an end to bureaucratic, formalistic working styles. Every Party Committee, every Party Organisation, and every cadre and Party member, especially those in leadership positions, must heighten their sense of responsibility and lead by example in turning decisions into reality.

From now on, “words must be matched by deeds” must become a guiding principle of action; every policy and task must clearly define objectives and solutions, link responsibility to results, align breakthroughs with sustainability, and ensure that discipline in implementation is measured by the People’s satisfaction.

Entering a new phase, every sound guideline, once adopted, must be carried out with 10-fold determination and a hundredfold effort in practice; political resolve must be at its highest, effort at its strongest, and action at its most decisive - an imperative arising from the nation’s will and aspiration for development. From the central to grassroots levels, from Party and State agencies to the Vietnam Fatherland Front and socio-political organisations, all must move forward in unison with a renewed sense of momentum; in this process, every cadre and Party member - above all, each member of the Party Central Committee - must lead by example, daring to think, to speak, to act, to take responsibility, and to innovate for the common good, with service to the People as the highest measure of work effectiveness

The next 5-10 years

The coming 5-10 years will be a pivotal period of decisive significance for the country’s two centenary strategic goals. Within this relatively short timeframe, we must both complete the objectives of the 2026-2030 period and lay a solid foundation for reaching higher development milestones by 2045. The goal for 2030 is to transform Vietnam into a country with modern industry and upper-middle income status.

This requires the economy to sustain average annual growth of 10% or higher over many consecutive years - an unprecedented breakthrough pace, yet an entirely feasible target if all resources are fully mobilized and effectively utilized. By 2045, we must resolutely achieve the goal of building a developed, high-income Vietnam on par with leading countries worldwide.

With limited time and heavy, decisive tasks, the 14th Congress set out revolutionary and breakthrough orientations and solutions to seize every opportunity and overcome all challenges. Over the next five years, we must accelerate comprehensively across all key areas: the economy must make strong breakthroughs to achieve sustained high growth; science, technology and innovation must be vigorously promoted as a driving force for development; and institutional reform, together with improvements to the investment and business environment, must be pursued resolutely and transparently to unleash all social resources.

At the same time, social sectors such as education, health care and culture must receive attention and investment commensurate with economic growth, ensuring harmonious and sustainable development. The building and rectification of the Party and the political system continues to face very high requirements, particularly in the building of a contingent of officials equal to their tasks - those who are “truly exemplary in moral qualities, intellect and mettle, and fully capable of leading the successful fulfillment of the major missions entrusted by the Party, the State and the People.”

The 14th National Party Congress term is an exceptionally important period for the entire Party and the entire people to achieve the highest accomplishments in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Party’s founding (2030). From now on, the mindset of “five-year action with a 20-year vision” must be thoroughly embedded in leadership and governance. This means that successfully fulfilling the immediate five-year objectives will at the same time lay a solid foundation for goals in the years ahead. The sound and breakthrough decisions taken today will not only deliver immediate results for the 2026-2030 period, but will also generate momentum for a leap in development in the decades to come.

If we seize opportunities and overcome the challenges of this pivotal 5-10-year period, the country will undoubtedly take off strongly, turning into reality the aspiration of building a powerful Vietnam by the mid-21st century. Conversely, if opportunities are missed or delays and mistakes occur during this critical juncture, the cost will be extremely high - potentially squandering the opportunity of an entire nation and causing the country to fall further behind in a rapidly changing world. Fully aware of this, the entire Party and people are determined to act with speed and resolve from the very start of the term, allowing “not a single day to be wasted, not a single week to be delayed.”

Rising above challenges

Looking ahead, we have no option other than success. The 14th Congress has ignited the flame of invincible confidence, placing upon the entire Party and the entire people a historic responsibility that is extraordinarily heavy yet profoundly honorable. Ahead lie many difficulties and challenges, but the Party allows no room for hesitation or failure on the chosen path. Standing alongside the Party are the trust, affection and expectations of more than 100 million compatriots, and before us lies the fate of the entire nation in the 21st century.

The goal of “a prosperous people, a strong country, democracy, equity and civilisation” set by the Party is not merely an aspiration, but a solemn pledge of honor to the People. Therefore, every official and Party member, especially those who “bear the main responsibilities” must constantly remind themselves to rise higher and overcome their own limitations.

We cannot afford to delay reform, we cannot afford to hesitate in action, and we certainly cannot allow complacency or rest on past laurels. Lessons from previous terms show that wherever there is strong political resolve and focused, unified and hands-on leadership, work progresses positively; conversely, where there is laxity, complacency or a lack of determination, even the soundest policies are difficult to translate into success.

History has proven this: our Vietnamese nation has never bowed to any enemy or hardship. From the earliest days of nation-building and nation-defence, our forebears forged a tradition of resilience and indomitability: the greater the hardship and trial, the greater the unity and shared resolve to achieve victory. In the 20th century, under the Party's leadership flag, our nation achieved victories that were “resounding across the five continents and shaking the globe”. In the new era, on the front of socio-economic development, we must all the more bring into full play the spirit of “never retreating, never faltering, only moving forward, advancing ceaselessly”.

Our Party and our People are determined to secure victory in the cause of building and defending the socialist Fatherland, for every delayed step and every unfulfilled objective affect the future of the entire nation. “Success, certain success!” – that is the mindset, the political resolve that we engrave deeply in our hearts as we embark upon the implementation of the Resolution of the 14th Congress.

In a world context marked by constant turbulence, never before have opportunities and challenges been so intricately intertwined as they are today. The destiny of the country depends on our ability to seize opportunities and overcome challenges. Intensive and extensive international integration means that Vietnam faces mounting competitive pressures, yet it also opens doors to the acquisition of knowledge, advanced technology, and development resources from abroad. Economic globalization provides large markets for Vietnamese goods and services, but it also requires us to continuously enhance our endogenous capacities in order to ascend to higher rungs of the global value chain.

Geopolitical fluctuations worldwide may affect the environment of peace and stability – the prerequisite for development – and therefore the task of firmly safeguarding independence, sovereignty, and a peaceful environment becomes ever more vital. The new context demands new thinking and new vision: we must be strategically proactive, constantly vigilant and perceptive in analysing developments, flexible and creative in our responses, steadfast in principles yet not dogmatic or rigid.

With the mettle and intellect of the Vietnamese nation, and with the trust, unity, and consensus of the People, we can affirm that favorable conditions will outweigh challenges. The position and strength of the country, after more than half a century of reunification, have grown stronger than ever before, creating the foundation for us to rise with confidence. The steadily increasing reputation and standing of Vietnam on the international stage constitute favourable conditions for mobilizing the support and cooperation of international friends. What is essential is that we maximize internal strength while harnessing external resources, transforming this combined power into a driving force for national development. Proactive adaptation and vigorous promotion of innovation are precisely the keys that will enable Vietnam to weather storms and advance steadily in an era full of volatility.

Certain victory

At this special moment, more than ever, the words of beloved President Ho Chi Minh continue to resound: “Forward! Total victory will surely be ours!” That call to action from Uncle Ho in those earlier days became an invincible belief, inspiring our entire nation to rise up and win independence and freedom. Today, in the cause of building and defending the Fatherland, that call still surges with momentum, spurring us to strengthen our resolve, overcome poverty and backwardness, and build a prosperous and happy country, standing shoulder to shoulder with friends across the five continents.

Nearly six million Party members and more than 100 million compatriots carry within their hearts a flame of aspiration for a strong and powerful Vietnam. The 14th Congress has entrusted us with the banner of decisive victory. Now is the time for the entire Party, the entire people, and the entire army to tighten ranks, unite in common purpose, and vigorously emulate one another in labor, study, work, and combat, in order to successfully implement the Resolution of the Congress.

Now is the time to turn every guideline and resolution into action and concrete results. The future and destiny of the country urge us to act – to act with even greater determination. The entire Party, the entire people, and the entire army act together in the spirit of “each person working twice as hard”, armed with new knowledge, supported by science and technology, under the guiding light of the Party; we act with indomitable will, advancing on all economic, cultural, and social fronts like “soldiers in peacetime”, and as a result, the effectiveness generated will be tenfold, a hundredfold. From our unwavering faith in the leadership of the Party and in the strength of the People, we together proclaim in unison: “Under the glorious flag of the Party, for the bright future of the nation, advance forward, victory is certain”.",https://t.ex-cdn.com/theinvestor.vn/560w/files/honghanh.nguyen/2026/01/25/1930-party-general-secretary-to-lam-2-191919.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 22:58:42.079092

Global warming is a humanitarian crisis as much as it is a scientific one, and far more than it is an economic one.","When Donald Trump entered the Oval Office in January 2025, he signed an executive order called “Unleashing American Energy. ” This order labeled environmental rules and regulations as “burdensome” to the American people and aimed to reverse them in order to restore cheaper transportation, utilities and manufacturing.

Trump's signature on the bottom of this document was a major stepping stone on his path toward turning climate change into an economic argument, one that fails to account for the endangerment of human health and life.

A harrowing number of people have already been affected by climate change. Thousands more will be harmed in the future. You don’t have to look hard to see the effects of global warming. We’ve seen clips of ravenous fires and cataclysmic hurricanes barrage social media. Other, less public moments, include people with lung cancer due to exposure to harmful air pollutants, heatstroke due to increased temperatures or even mental health problems due to traumatic experiences with a natural disaster.

Climate change is deeply and inherently intertwined with health and human life. To attempt to forget and ignore the past, as well as current and future victims of climate change in the name of money, is a disconcerting decision. However, it is a step that Trump and the Environmental Protection Agency are not only willing — but excited — to take.

In June, the EPA proposed the repeal of rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, aiming to trim billions of dollars in costs for the industry.

Greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of global warming. And with global warming comes countless attacks on human well-being. Higher global surface temperatures expand the possibility of droughts and increasingly intense storms.

Our very own state has felt the harsh assault of a storm worsened by climate change. When Hurricane Helene hit western North Carolina, rainfall was 10 percent heavier, and the total rainfall was made 70 percent more likely because of climate change. If the world continues to burn fossil fuels at similar rates, reaching two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, catastrophic rainfall events like Helene would become 15 to 25 percent more likely.

For decades, the EPA has assigned monetary value to human well-being, calculating the money saved in health care costs because of the air pollution limits it sets. Recently, the EPA announced that they would no longer be computing this figure, focusing only on the cost for industry and not the worth of human life. This is yet another ruling that values money and efficiency over people like the 91,000 in the U.S. who die each year due to air pollution.

In line with the movement to excavate human life from climate change action, the EPA also proposed to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which declared that greenhouse gases “threaten the public health and welfare. ” Overturning this finding would repeal emission regulations for motor vehicles and engines for the sake of cheaper cars and deliveries.

The proposal alone, of withdrawing the assertion that human beings are endangered by climate change, is a direct attack on human existence.

Climate change isn’t just a rising bar on a graph. Parents have lost children. Houses have been washed away. Global warming is a humanitarian crisis as much as it is a scientific one, and far more than it is an economic one.

One day, climate change will reach your doorstep. You will be the one uploading a video of disastrous flooding in your neighborhood or undergoing chemotherapy in a hospital bed.

Energy secretary Ed Miliband (pictured) said the agreement marks a historic clean energy security pact with countries including Germany, Norway, France and Denmark to strengthen energy resilience amid global instability.

He added that the deal will, for the first time, commit North Sea nations to delivering part of their 300GW 2050 offshore wind pledge through joint clean-energy projects.

Three years ago these countries set the 300GW target in response to geopolitical shocks, and the Hamburg Declaration will now outline how 100GW will be built through “offshore wind hybrid assets”, which are wind farms directly connected to more than one country using interconnectors.

The Energy Secretary will meet leaders from Germany, France, Belgium, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark and Norway as they pursue plans to transform the North Sea into a major clean energy reservoir.

“We are standing up for our national interest by driving for clean energy, which can get the UK off the fossil fuel rollercoaster and give us energy sovereignty and abundance,” said Miliband.

“After our record renewables auction, we today go further by signing a clean energy security pact with European allies to ensure we maximise the clean energy potential for the North Sea.”

Industry is expected to unveil plans for new projects in response to the pledge, with interconnectors highlighted as crucial to sending clean power where it is needed and ending reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets controlled by petrostates and dictators.

The UK earlier this month secured 8.4GW of offshore wind in its latest auction, which the government described as the biggest in European history.

Further summit outcomes include a statement of intent between the UK and Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands to unlock cross-border offshore electricity projects through joint planning, cost-sharing and market arrangements.

The UK will also agree a framework to deepen collaboration with Germany on offshore hybrid assets, which combine offshore wind connections with interconnectors and could open export opportunities for UK firms.

Talks are beginning between the EU and UK on the UK's participation in the EU internal electricity market to drive investment in North Sea clean energy projects and reduce exposure to fossil fuel price volatility.

The summit will additionally feature agreements between NATO and European countries on cyber security cooperation focused on North Sea infrastructure, with leaders warning of increasing threats.

""Today is a step towards a more integrated energy system in the North Seas,” said Ben Wilson, president of National Grid Ventures.

""LionLink and projects like those being announced today are important for maximising the efficient use of resources, reducing costs, and minimising the impact on coastal communities.”

Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, added that the sector is “fully behind the landmark efforts” to build a regional clean power hub and deliver 100GW of offshore cooperation projects by 2050.

“This deeper cooperation on supply chains, standardisation, and shared infrastructure is not just a strategic necessity, it is the most effective way to bring down energy costs for households and businesses while fuelling sustainable economic growth and high-value jobs for years to come,” stated Vyas.

Jane Cooper, deputy chief executive of RenewableUK, said the announcement will “increase the energy security of the UK and the whole of the North Sea region significantly”.

“We are strengthening our security collaboration to ensure the North Sea’s critical energy infrastructure is protected from harm, so that we can continue to generate the huge quantities of clean power needed by the UK and our neighbours reliably at all times,” added Cooper.

Gus Jaspert, managing director, marine at The Crown Estate, said the UK offshore wind sector “is a national success story” that attracts investment, supports jobs and boosts energy security.",https://renews.biz/media/35295/miliband-credit-zara-farrar-and-desnz.jpg?width=640,N,,2026-01-25 19:57:59.176931

Hawaii families spend thousands of dollars each year on imported fossil fuels for electricity and transportation.","Hawaii’s high cost of living isn’t driven only by housing and groceries. Energy costs — especially gasoline and electricity — play a major but often overlooked role. Our dependence on imported fossil fuels keeps prices far above the national average, placing a heavy burden on families across the state.

Hawaii has more than 1 million registered gas-powered passenger vehicles, or about 4 for every 5 residents. Gasoline prices here are typically 40% to 50% higher than the U.S. average and frequently the highest in the nation. With more than 400 million gallons of gasoline consumed each year, the costs add up quickly.

At today’s average retail price of about $4.40 per gallon, residents spend roughly $1.75 billion annually on gasoline alone. That is more than $1,700 per gas-powered vehicle every year, much of which is money that leaves Hawaii to pay for imported fuel rather than circulating within the local economy.

Electricity costs are just as punishing. Hawaii has the highest electricity rates in the country, averaging more than 40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The reason is straightforward. More than 60% of our electricity is generated from oil. The average household pays about $212 per month for electricity, or over $2,500 per year.

Rates vary by island, but the underlying problem is the same statewide — heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels. Kauai Island Utility Cooperative shows what’s possible. By moving aggressively toward renewable energy, KIUC transformed its rates from the highest in the state to the lowest.

Renewable energy, particularly solar, is a cost-effective, local alternative to fossil fuel. The AES Maui solar farm, which includes battery storage, generates electricity at roughly 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, far less than oil-fired generation.

Hawaiian Electric reports that about half of a typical electricity bill comes from fuel costs. Based on the utility’s own filings, generating electricity from oil costs roughly 21 cents per kilowatt-hour. If electricity were obtained at 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, estimated retail rates would drop to about 30 cents per kilowatt-hour, which would be a meaningful savings for families.

Lower electricity prices could also reduce transportation costs. An electric vehicle traveling three miles per kilowatt-hour, powered by electricity at 30 cents per kilowatt-hour, costs about 10 cents per mile to drive. A gasoline vehicle getting 30 miles per gallon costs roughly 15 cents per mile at today’s fuel prices. Over time, that difference would translate into real savings.

Hawaii already gets about a quarter of its electricity from the sun, and the potential for growth is enormous. The State Climate Commission’s Hawaii Climate Action Pathways 2025 envisions nearly quadrupling solar generation by 2045 through rooftop systems and utility-scale projects.

However, the transition to clean energy has been slowed by decades of fossil fuel subsidies that built an entrenched and increasingly expensive system. The costs of extraction, shipping, processing and storage make imported fuels less competitive than locally produced renewable energy.

Programs like carbon cashback offer a practical and equitable way forward. By placing a fee on fossil fuel pollution and distributing the revenue directly to residents in equal shares, the program discourages fossil fuel use while helping households pay for essentials.

Proposals to use liquefied natural gas as a “bridge fuel” miss the point. LNG is another polluting fossil fuel and remains, in the long run, more expensive and less sustainable than renewables.

The math is clear. Hawaii families spend thousands of dollars each year on imported fossil fuels for electricity and transportation. Faster adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles would lower those costs, reduce pollution, and strengthen local energy independence. Carbon cashback would do exactly that.

Clean energy is not only better for the environment but also essential for a more affordable future.",https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/web1_USATSI_14307327_168410500_lowres.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 21:58:38.858472

Nearly nine years after the energy transition policy shift began, the structural change to Taiwan’s power generation is clear.
But the stark reality is that Taiwan is falling behind in its renewable energy goals.","Rupert Hammond-Chambers On Taiwan: Taiwan’s Renewable Energy Goals Fall Victim to Domestic Political Fratricide

When former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) first took office in 2016, she set ambitious goals for remaking the energy mix in Taiwan. At the core of this effort was a significant expansion of the percentage of renewable energy generated to keep pace with growing domestic and global demands to reduce emissions. This effort met with broad bipartisan support as all three major parties placed expanding renewable energy at the center of their energy platforms. However, over the past several years partisanship has become a major headwind in realizing a set of energy goals that all three parties profess to want.

Tsai made good on a key campaign promise to phase out nuclear energy by 2025 through pushing for an energy transition that featured a rapid expansion of Taiwan’s renewable energy capacity. Power generation targets for 2025, set by the Executive Yuan in December 2017, were to increase renewable energy’s share of gross power generation from 5 percent to 20 percent; drop nuclear power to zero from 12 percent; reduce the share of coal-generated power to 30 percent from 45 percent; and increase LNG’s share to 50 percent from 32 percent.

The nuclear strategy conforms to the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) long-held position against nuclear power, originating in the efforts of the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s and its role in the formation of the DPP, over safety and environmental concerns while seeking to reduce reliance on imported energy sources and shift to cleaner ones. Her successor, President William Lai Ching-te (賴清德), vowed to continue the same energy policy direction with a “second energy transition” seeking to catalyze what was achieved from 2016 to 2024.

Nearly nine years after the energy transition policy shift began, the structural change to Taiwan’s power generation is clear. Based on the latest data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, power generation shares by energy sources toward the end of 2025 are remarkably close to the policy targets set in 2017, with one glaring exception — renewable energy.

Renewable energy, including hydro, solar, wind, waste-to-energy, and biomass, produced just over 12 percent of Taiwan’s electricity through November 2025, well off the 20 percent mark. Upon closer examination, one can see that solar installed capacity growth has slowed significantly in 2025, while installed capacity of waste-to-energy, which contributes about 1.2 percent of power generation, has been stagnant since 2023. In 2025 this prompted the Ministry of Economic Affairs to quietly reset the timeline for the 20 percent target to November 2026, a date which may see further outward revisions.

The Executive Yuan’s own Annual Report on National Sustainable Development pointed out some of the reasons for the slower-than-expected adoption of renewable energy: solar power was affected by local governments’ interpretation of regulations and residents’ concerns about the environmental impact on solar farm sites. And biomass and waste-to-energy facilities are stalled by stock feeds collection issues and system operation.

What’s more worrisome is that renewable energy companies appear to have become prime targets for partisan rancor, creating significant uncertainties and unforeseen risks for investors in this sector. That is going to have a negative longer-term impact on public-private efforts to expand and modernize Taiwan’s power generation and grid.

Taiwan’s economy is partly driven by the partnership between domestic manufacturers and global technology giants such as AWS, Microsoft and Google. These global companies place significant demands on their Taiwanese suppliers to produce their sourced products with renewable energy. There are hard deadlines in future years where suppliers must reach 100 percent of production utilizing renewable, zero-emission sources. There is a finite amount of this energy in Taiwan and an absence of supply will inhibit growth in these partnerships while adding costs as supply tightens and demand expands. The only viable solution is to speed up the supply of renewables to reduce the cost and ensure supply meets the demands of global partners.

There are several examples illustrating the growing headwinds to expanding renewable energy.

Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) lawmakers last year alleged Kaohsiung’s lack of supervision resulted in solar vendors causing damage to hillside areas. The reaction to this situation and other solar-related ecosystem impact complaints caused a recent, November 2025, set of amendments to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act (環境影響評估法), the Act for the Development of Tourism (發展觀光條例) and the Geology Act (地質法), jointly supported by both the opposition KMT and the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP). They passed the Legislative Yuan resulting in significant increases in the environmental impact review burden for companies installing solar panels. These actions expanded the bureaucracy, adding time and cost.

Three previously approved waste-to-energy, or solid recovered fuel (SRF), companies in Taoyuan, including US-invested Taiwan Cube, were forced to cease construction or simply withdraw in 2024, after local lawmakers and residents made pollution claims into an election issue. Such a flipflop of a major multi-governmental administrative decision (local and national) affecting large, long-term investments removed renewable energy capacity that could help to not only reduce burgeoning waste, but also produce much-needed renewable electricity. The case also sets a negative precedent for Taiwan as an attractive location for foreign investment.

This latter point is important. The just completed tariff negotiations with the United States seek to place Taiwan as the strategic partner for the US in the development of artificial intelligence technologies, a huge opportunity that could continue to turbo-charge Taiwan’s economy in the coming years; however, it will require power and an investment environment that is transparent and reliable. The situation in Taoyuan undermines future renewable energy production, the removal of waste, and the attractiveness of Taiwan as a market for global capital.

The closing of Taiwan’s nuclear power stations too is a lamentable development. Nuclear power produces zero emissions, is clean and reliable, and should be playing an important role in Taiwan’s ongoing energy transition. The recent loss of three plants has hurt both efforts to reduce emissions as well as Taiwan’s national security, given the absence of energy supply chains in comparison to those needed to power coal, oil and LNG plants. Nuclear power is a plus when we consider Chinese blockade and quarantine scenarios that disrupt incoming energy supplies. It is a modest but welcome development that one of the power plants may yet be restored through efforts by the KMT and that Lai continues to leave open the possibility of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) to power the island in the future. SMRs are attractive but some years away from a mature technology ready for island-wide utility. Politics has undermined an important power source that produces zero emissions.

Environmental protection is fundamentally important to the health and welfare of all countries and should be taken into consideration when assessing renewable energy projects. But the stark reality is that Taiwan is falling behind in its renewable energy goals. While the excesses of more radical environmental demands in Europe have dissipated due to concerns over high prices and the reliability of grids that are overly reliant on renewables, the need for a healthy mix of power sources, including renewables, remains a must.

Pursuing an ambitious renewable energy goal will require bipartisan vision, political will and reliability, and a set of policies that can attract global capital. That was a goal all three parties agreed was important for national advancement as recently as 2016.

It’s time for all parties to stop using renewable energy projects for short-term political gain, otherwise the 20 percent renewable energy target could well remain elusive, endangering important national commitments to the Taiwanese and to the global community.",https://img.taipeitimes.com/images/2026/01/26/p08-260126_RupertHammond-Chambers.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 21:58:44.709422

The order can also be invoked if the Texas power grid falls to emergency level three.
ERCOT is required to tell the Department of Energy within one day of directing facilities to use backup generation.
What we don't know: It is unclear if the use of backup generators will be needed during the current arctic blast.","The U.S. Department of Energy on Sunday issued an emergency order for the deployment of backup energy resources to mitigate blackouts in Texas.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright called on the Energy Reliability Council of Texas to require major facilities like data centers to operate their backup generators to help reduce the risk of blackouts amid increased energy demands during the winter storm.

What they're saying:

""The Trump administration is committed to unleashing all available power generation needed to keep Americans safe during Winter Storm Fern,"" Wright said. ""The Trump administration will continue taking action to ensure that the 35 GW of untapped backup generation that exists across the country can be deployed as needed during Winter Storm Fern and in the future.""

What does the emergency order do?

What we know:

The order directs ERCOT to require large energy consumers to use backup generators after using all of ERCOT's resources. The order can also be invoked if the Texas power grid falls to emergency level three.

Under section 202c of the Federal Power Act, the Department of Energy has the authority to make temporary changes to the U.S. electric system and ""require by order such temporary connections of facilities and such generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy as in its judgment will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest.""

While the Federal Power Act allows for a waiver of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, an emergency order must ""'to the maximum extent practicable' ensure the order is consistent with environmental laws or regulations and ‘minimizes any adverse environmental impacts.’""

The order would not require defense, homeland security, first responder, air traffic control, hospital facilities, 911 call centers, water treatment or wastewater facilities, natural gas pipeline facilities, natural gas gathering facilities, or other similar facilities to use their backup generators.

ERCOT is required to tell the Department of Energy within one day of directing facilities to use backup generation.

What we don't know:

It is unclear if the use of backup generators will be needed during the current arctic blast.

According to the agency's dashboard, ERCOT's grid is operating under normal conditions with sufficient operating reserves for its current demand.

Power outages in Texas

As of Sunday afternoon, findenergy.com is showing more than 83,000 Texans are without power. A majority of those impacted are in east Texas.

According to ERCOT, current power outages are likely local outages and not an issue with the grid.

What's next:

The DOE's order is in effect until Tuesday.

But our bill has still ballooned — with the cooling and heating seasons delivering truly astounding bills.

One analysis found that bills from Indiana’s five investor-owned electric utilities shows went up 17.5% in one year, or $28 a month on average statewide.

So, I was excited to hear that House Republicans would be tackling utility affordability.

But the bill won’t help all Hoosiers.

The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission oversees eight electric utilities and 17 natural gas utilities in the state, according to the commission. However, more than 100 municipal and Rural Electric Membership Cooperatives have withdrawn from the commission’s rate jurisdiction. That includes my provider.

Kerwin Olson, executive director of the consumer-focused Citizens Action Coalition, estimates up to 20% of Hoosiers aren’t protected by regulators — about one in five Hoosiers.

“The rationale is largely that those customers are taxpayers and constituents or voting members and can take complaints directly to the utility. Their only recourse really is common courts if they are not satisfied,” he said.

Olson thinks it’s fair in the context of investor-owned utilities needing more oversight. He does wish some of the state rules on deposits, late fees, reconnect charges and efficiency programs applied to all utilities.

But that’s a fight for another day.

Legislative efforts

The rest of you should be watching House Bill 1002.

Most of the bill doesn’t do anything to reduce or control your gas and electric bills. It instead provides ways to cope with them. But that doesn’t mean those provisions aren’t important.

The bill would do the following:

Require an electricity supplier that is under the jurisdiction of the IURC to offer a low-income customer assistance program that provides financial assistance to low-income residential customers for the payment of monthly bills for utility service.

Block service shut-offs to those customers during dangerously hot months. This protection already exists for cold-weather months — another time when bills jump but disconnection could harm Hoosiers.

Put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans. These plans level out your monthly bills so that your costs are more consistent. But they don’t control or lower them. And ratepayers could opt out of the program if they want.

The one section that could have a positive future impact is performance-based ratemaking.

It’s a newer concept, under consideration in other states, that would tie future rate increase requests to specific metrics. The Indiana bill would pair the new multi-year rate plans with performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.

Lawmakers may also look at peak load demand or environmental sustainability.

It’s unclear if the incentives would be enough to truly impact future rate increases, and customers wouldn’t see change for several years. But it’s a worthy discussion to have as Hoosiers struggle with higher costs.

Gov. Mike Braun is hoping to move the needle by revamping IURC’s membership and targeting rate hikes that pad company profits at the expense of ratepayers.

“Affordability is why I support Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to hold investor-owned utility companies accountable to provide affordable energy before they can increase their profit margin,” he said during his State of the State speech.

“And it’s why I appointed three ratepayer-conscious members, now constituting a majority, to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission — to make decisions in the public interest to ensure utilities provide service at just and reasonable rates.”

Between the executive and legislative efforts, it’s my hope that Hoosiers will start to see the cost curve bend to a more reasonable level after years of increases.",,N,,2026-01-25 16:59:08.968658

We should know that over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from burning fossil fuels for energy and every $1 invested in renewable energy creates 3 times more jobs than in the fossil fuel industry. Polluting fuels for cooking causes 3.2 million premature deaths annually while clean cooking can prevent many of these.

Globally the energy sector, dominated by fossil fuels, accounts for 34 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a total of 20 Gigatons (Gt) of GHG globally (IPCC, 2023). Global CO2 emissions should be halved by 2030 to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

We need energy and more importantly clean energy. Energy lies at the core of a double challenge: leaving no one behind and protecting the Planet. Our challenge is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels to source our electricity, supply our heating and cooling needs, and power our industry and transportation, by accelerating the transition to sustainable and affordable energy for all.

At a time when we are all getting more questions than answers due to climate change, clean energy plays a vital role in reducing emissions, and can also benefit communities lacking access to reliable power sources. But the global data says that 666 million people live in the dark – more than 85 percent of them in Sub-Saharan Africa.

We are aware that a large chunk of the greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the Sun’s heat are generated through energy production, by burning fossil fuels (oil, coal, and gas) to generate electricity and heat.

Our agenda must be clear and it must focus on limiting climate change. To do this , we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable. Renewable energy sources – which are available in abundance all around us, provided by the sun, wind, water, waste, and heat from the Earth – are replenished by nature and emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.

The International Day of Clean Energy on 26 January was declared by the United Nations General Assembly (resolution A/77/327) as a call to raise awareness and mobilize action for a just and inclusive transition to clean energy for the benefit of people and the planet. 26th January is also the founding date of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), a global intergovernmental agency established in 2009 to support countries in their energy transitions, serve as a platform for international cooperation, and provide data and analyses on clean energy technology, innovation, policy, finance and investment. In 2023, the power sector was the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions. We have to take more and more action to reach net-zero by 2050. It’s time to move to alternate and the positive side is that renewable energy sources — such as sunlight, wind, water, organic waste, and heat from the Earth — are abundant, replenished by nature, and emit little to no greenhouse gases or air pollutants. About 80 per cent of the global population lives in countries that are net-importers of fossil fuels – that’s about 6 billion people who are dependent on fossil fuels from other countries, which makes them vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and crises. In contrast, renewable energy sources are available in all countries, and their potential is yet to be fully harnessed.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 99 percent of people in the world breathe air that exceeds air quality limits and threatens their health. Air pollution is associated with 7 million premature deaths every year. The unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide originate mainly from the burning of fossil fuels.

Prices for renewable energy technologies are dropping rapidly. Over 90 per cent of new renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuels alternatives. On the positive note, clean energy sector jobs already outnumber fossil fuel jobs – employing almost 35 million people worldwide. In 2023, 16.2 million people were employed in the renewable energy sector, up from 13.7 million in 2022. The transition towards net-zero emissions will lead to an overall increase in energy sector jobs, while about 5 million jobs in fossil fuel production could be lost by 2030, an estimated 14 million new jobs would be created in clean energy, resulting in a net gain of 9 million jobs.

Our energy consumption must be sustainable and to ensure a sustainable future, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable. With new innovation and technologies things are possible and we must shift to clean energy for the benefit of each and every living being on the planet. We must not forget that we do not have any other planet to live.

The science tells us we are heading for a temporary overshoot above 1.5 degrees Celsius. Our responsibility is to make that breach as small, as short, and as safe as possible – through a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.

Renewables are the engine that can drive this transition. They are the cheapest source of new power in most places. And last year, for the first time, wind, solar, and other renewables generated more electricity worldwide than coal.

Renewable energy connects communities still left in the dark, provides clean cooking, and opens the door to better health, education, and opportunities. Renewables anchor new industries, create decent jobs and lower energy costs, while shielding countries from geopolitical shocks and market volatility.

Even so, the renewables revolution is not moving fast enough or far enough. Grid infrastructure is lagging well behind the expansion of clean energy capacity, and high costs continue to shut many countries out of the transition entirely.

The roadmap is clear: we must triple global renewable capacity by 2030, by lifting barriers, cutting costs, and connecting clean power to people and industry – with scale, speed, and solidarity.

Regulators must adopt policies that reward clean power and streamline permitting while protecting people and nature. Utilities must upgrade, expand, and digitize grids and interconnections, to carry clean power where it is needed, and scale storage so power systems stay steady as renewables grow. Industry must diversify supply chains so more countries can manufacture, install, and maintain clean energy systems. This includes the critical minerals essential to the transition, which must benefit producing countries and communities – not just global markets.

Finance must bring down the cost of capital, especially for developing countries with vast renewable potential. And multilateral development banks must reduce risk and unlock far greater private investment.

Most importantly, we must ensure this transition is just – protecting workers and communities, supporting education, industrial development, and opportunity for all as energy systems evolve.

While improvements in vehicle battery technology have led to increased battery range, consumers are still left wondering how long they can expect their vehicle battery to last. After all, the battery pack is the most expensive part of an electric car, with a new battery costing upwards of $20,000.

So what can you expect for an electric vehicle’s battery lifespan? We have the important answers.

What are EV Batteries?

Internal combustion engined cars are powered by gasoline, while EVs are powered by a battery pack driving one or more electric motors. The batteries that power electric cars are rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which is the same type of battery found in cell phones and other consumer electronics. Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density than lead-acid or nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, which means they don’t take up as much space while providing an equivalent level of power. A vehicle’s battery capacity is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh), so a vehicle with a higher kWh rating means it has more range.

How Long Do EV Batteries Last?

The lifespan of an EV battery depends on a number of factors. While battery life can vary, EV manufacturers are generally required to issue a warranty for at least 8 years or 100,000 miles. However, some manufacturers offer longer warranties. Kia offers a battery pack warranty for 10 years or 100,000 miles, and Hyundai provides warranty coverage on EV batteries for the vehicle’s entire lifetime. Battery warranties vary not only by time but also by the nature of the coverage. Some automakers will only replace the battery if it completely fails, while others, like BMW, Tesla, and Volkswagen, will cover a battery if its capacity falls below a certain percentage.

Recent studies show that EV batteries may retain around 90% capacity after 100,000 kilometers and about 87% after 300,000 kilometers, with an annual degradation rate of approximately 1.8%. For example, a Tesla Model S only loses an estimated five percent of battery capacity over its first 50,000 miles. As battery technology continues to evolve, companies are creating larger batteries with increased range and reduced degradation. The first-generation Nissan LEAF had a maximum range of 84 miles, while the newest LEAF has a maximum range of 212 miles.

Modern electric car batteries are increasingly designed to last the entire life of the vehicle, reducing the likelihood of needing a battery replacement. With advancements in battery management systems and engineering, an EV battery is expected to last 10-20 years, depending on maintenance and care.

How to Prolong the Life of Your Electric Vehicle Battery

Just like there are preventative maintenance measures to extend the life of your gasoline vehicle, there are EV charging measures you can take to prolong your EV’s battery life. Here are the top tips to protect your EV battery’s health:

1. Avoid parking in extreme temperatures

Lithium batteries have thermal management systems that will heat or cool themselves, which in turn uses energy and drains EV battery packs. Try to park in the shade if possible on hot days and inside in extreme cold temperatures to assist battery longevity.

2. Don’t Charge Your Car Too Much or Too Little

Modern electric cars are equipped with management systems that avoid charging and discharging at the maximum and minimum charging levels. You should avoid charging your vehicle above 80 percent or below 20 percent to extend EV battery life.

3. Minimize Use of Fast Charging Stations

DC fast charging stations can bring your battery level up to 80 percent in as little as 30 minutes. With this convenience comes a strain on your EV battery. For optimal battery life, you should limit how often you plug in to these fast charging stations for occasional scenarios, like road trips.

4. Maintain Optimal State of Charge While Vehicle is Stored

If you are planning on storing your vehicle for a long time, make sure that your battery does not have an empty or full charge. With a timed charger, you can set it to maintain the charging level between 25 and 75 percent.

Second Life of EV Batteries

When an automotive EV battery’s performance dips below 70 percent, it can have a second life when it is no longer useful to power a vehicle. There are many applications to repurpose EV batteries for renewable energy sources including home battery storage systems and powering manufacturing plants. In Japan, Toyota has installed EV batteries to store power generated from solar panels.

Bottom Line

While an electric car’s battery life can vary, advancements in technology have helped ensure that it typically lasts for the lifespan of a vehicle. The main factor for prolonging a battery’s life expectancy is to limit the number of charging cycles each battery cell goes through. Battery cells die when a battery reaches its empty or full state of charge for too long, so make sure you charge your vehicle according to the manufacturer’s instructions to minimize battery degradation.

Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density than lead-acid or nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, which means they don’t take up as much space while providing an equivalent level of power. A vehicle’s battery capacity is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh), so a vehicle with a higher kWh rating means it has more range.

How Long Do EV Batteries Last?

The lifespan of an EV battery depends on a number of factors. While battery life can vary, EV manufacturers are generally required to issue a warranty for at least 8 years or 100,000 miles. However, some manufacturers offer longer warranties. Kia offers a battery pack warranty for 10 years or 100,000 miles, and Hyundai provides warranty coverage on EV batteries for the vehicle’s entire lifetime. Battery warranties vary not only by time but also by the nature of the coverage. Some automakers will only replace the battery if it completely fails, while others, like BMW, Tesla, and Volkswagen, will cover a battery if its capacity falls below a certain percentage.

Recent studies show that EV batteries may retain around 90% capacity after 100,000 kilometers and about 87% after 300,000 kilometers, with an annual degradation rate of approximately 1.8%. For example, a Tesla Model S only loses an estimated five percent of battery capacity over its first 50,000 miles. As battery technology continues to evolve, companies are creating larger batteries with increased range and reduced degradation. The first-generation Nissan LEAF had a maximum range of 84 miles, while the newest LEAF has a maximum range of 212 miles.

Modern electric car batteries are increasingly designed to last the entire life of the vehicle, reducing the likelihood of needing a battery replacement. With advancements in battery management systems and engineering, an EV battery is expected to last 10-20 years, depending on maintenance and care.

How to Prolong the Life of Your Electric Vehicle Battery

Just like there are preventative maintenance measures to extend the life of your gasoline vehicle, there are EV charging measures you can take to prolong your EV’s battery life. Here are the top tips to protect your EV battery’s health:

1. Avoid parking in extreme temperatures

Lithium batteries have thermal management systems that will heat or cool themselves, which in turn uses energy and drains EV battery packs. Try to park in the shade if possible on hot days and inside in extreme cold temperatures to assist battery longevity.

2. Don’t Charge Your Car Too Much or Too Little

Modern electric cars are equipped with management systems that avoid charging and discharging at the maximum and minimum charging levels. You should avoid charging your vehicle above 80 percent or below 20 percent to extend EV battery life.

3. Minimize Use of Fast Charging Stations

DC fast charging stations can bring your battery level up to 80 percent in as little as 30 minutes. With this convenience comes a strain on your EV battery. For optimal battery life, you should limit how often you plug in to these fast charging stations for occasional scenarios, like road trips.

4. Maintain Optimal State of Charge While Vehicle is Stored

If you are planning on storing your vehicle for a long time, make sure that your battery does not have an empty or full charge. With a timed charger, you can set it to maintain the charging level between 25 and 75 percent.

Second Life of EV Batteries

When an automotive EV battery’s performance dips below 70 percent, it can have a second life when it is no longer useful to power a vehicle. There are many applications to repurpose EV batteries for renewable energy sources including home battery storage systems and powering manufacturing plants. In Japan, Toyota has installed EV batteries to store power generated from solar panels.

The money automakers saved by selling fewer EVs went straight into gas and hybrid discounts. Non-EV incentives hit $3,004 per vehicle—up $403 from last year—while traditional hybrids are eating up 14.7% of sales, a 1.4-percentage-point gain. Internal combustion engines claimed 77.7% of sales, up 2.7 percentage points from last year. Total new-vehicle sales for January are projected at 1.12 million units, down 2.7% year-over-year. Consumers will spend $39.7 billion on new vehicles this month, but 27.3% of trade-ins now carry negative equity—up 2.4 percentage points—and 11.7% of buyers are stretching into 84-month loans just to make the math work.

My Verdict

If you're shopping for an EV right now, wait until March or April. Dealers are sitting on inventory they need to clear, and manufacturers are still figuring out how to price these things without federal help. Gas cars and hybrids are getting the best deals in years—if you don't need electric range, buy there instead and pocket the savings. If you're committed to electric, charging infrastructure is finally improving, but the price premium without tax credits is real. Run the total cost of ownership over five years—including insurance, maintenance, and electricity costs—before you sign. Don't let dealer incentives distract you from what you'll actually pay.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/men_s_journal_718/6157c47e9ada3c5a2790798deefa5197,N,,2026-01-25 13:58:47.515634

The chief threat to the electric grid comes from ice and freezing rain that can topple trees and strain power lines.
Power loss is the main threat to life over the coming days — and pressure on the power grid is mounting.
Such a failure of natural gas infrastructure occurred during Winter Storm Uri in 2021 that killed 246 people in Texas.
Wright has said that has left customers in jeopardy of power outages during searing heatwaves or deep winter freezes.","The winter storm that stretched across half the country knocked out electricity to more than a million customers on Sunday, sending utilities scrambling to restore power ahead of the sub-freezing temperatures set to descend on tens of millions of people this week.

The outages, which were concentrated in Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana, came after warnings from weather forecasters that Winter Storm Fern could threaten the power grid and test utilities’ ability to meet the surge in demand.

The Trump administration took swift action to shore up some power supplies, with the Energy Department granting PJM Interconnection, the country’s largest electric grid operator, blanket permission to run all its power sources at full tilt — regardless of pollution rules in its region that reaches from the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic.

The concern about energy supplies will grow in the coming days as Fern plunges millions into a cold spell that will put a significant draw on heating and electricity resources. The polar vortex conditions that plunged Arctic air all the way to the Gulf Coast are expected to drive temperatures even lower through the end of the week, running the risk of exhausting power supplies or debilitating the electricity grid.

The chief threat to the electric grid comes from ice and freezing rain that can topple trees and strain power lines. Given the storm’s expansive geographic range, utilities may have fewer personnel to dispatch to help neighboring regions deal with outages as they face disruptions in their own territories.

“The ice is the big concern this week and that’s scary,” said Allison Clements, a former commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “When these types of things happen, you can’t control the ice. You can’t control the tree branch break.”

As of 4:15 p.m. EST Sunday, Tennessee experienced the most outages in the country, at more than 308,000, according to PowerOutage.us. Mississippi had more than 149,000 customers without power, trailed by 138,000 in Louisiana, 103,000 in Georgia, 80,000 in Texas, 67,000 in Kentucky, 33,000 in West Virginia and 28,000 in South Carolina.

Georgia Power said it restored power to 70,000 customers as of 4 p.m. EST, though another 70,000 concentrated in north Georgia and Atlanta are still without electricity.

“The bulk of these outages are caused [by] trees laden with ice falling on power lines. We currently have more than 10,000 crews working diligently to repair these outages,” the utility said in a statement. “We are confident that we can meet demand [in] the next week.”

All told, 200 million people face some mix of sleet, snow, ice and frigid temperatures sweeping the nation which makes for a “deadly combination,” AccuWeather meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said in a Sunday note.

Power loss is the main threat to life over the coming days — and pressure on the power grid is mounting. The storm has added stress to the utilities and operators that were already struggling to meet rising demand fueled by the influx of data centers, artificial intelligence and other large customers. That all has shrunk the power generating slack in the system, bringing electric reliability concerns to the forefront.

PJM said Sunday that peak demand for its 13-state footprint is expected to surpass 130,000 megawatts for seven consecutive days for the first time ever, noting extreme cold conditions may persist through Feb. 1. It said the region could set an all-time winter peak load record on Tuesday and activated pre-emergency measures for utilities BGE, Pepco and Dominion to curtail electricity usage to preserve supplies.

“This is a formidable arctic cold front coming our way, and it will impact our neighboring systems as much as it affects PJM,” Mike Bryson Sr., vice president of operations at PJM, said in a statement. “We will be relying on our generation fleet to perform as well as they did during last year’s record winter peak.”

DOE also tapped data centers and other large customers within Texas’ grid to bring their backup onsite power onto the public grid, a move that allowed those generators to skirt pollution rules.

“As Winter Storm Fern brings extreme cold and dangerous conditions to the Mid-Atlantic, maintaining affordable, reliable, and secure power in the PJM region is non-negotiable,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

Benchmark natural gas prices surged more than 80 percent in the three days before the storm, a jump that consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said was the largest increase in history. Supplies could get trapped if gas infrastructure in the Gulf Coast, which is unaccustomed to single-digit temperatures, succumbs to strain. Such a failure of natural gas infrastructure occurred during Winter Storm Uri in 2021 that killed 246 people in Texas.

Real-time electricity costs across the eastern half of the country soared on the storm demand, and operators overseeing New England and New York’s grid said consumption was outpacing forecasts by more than 3 percent as of 10:30 a.m. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which handles the grid from the Dakotas to Michigan south to Louisiana, said demand was below its forecasted peak, although it operated under alert for a few hours on Saturday due to “unplanned generator outages.”

Though the power disruptions so far appeared to be due to the storm, the frigid conditions to come this week could make the grid vulnerable to what the North American Electric Reliability Corp. warned in its latest winter reliability assessment: that several parts of the U.S. do not have sufficient energy supplies to meet demand during an extreme winter.

In its application to DOE requesting the emergency order, PJM said it has already experienced outages “trending up to 20,000 MW,” adding that “there are many other unknowns that could exacerbate already tightening system conditions.”

PJM has been the subject of scrutiny for rising prices as demand has squeezed power supply. The Trump administration has blamed the Biden administration and state policies that it contends incentivized solar and wind with artificially low prices that pushed gas, nuclear and coal power plants off the grid. Wright has said that has left customers in jeopardy of power outages during searing heatwaves or deep winter freezes.

On Sunday, those gas, coal and nuclear resources supplied an overwhelming majority of electricity to the nation’s largest customer base. Gas met more than 39 percent of PJM’s load, while nuclear supplied 26 percent and coal nearly 23 percent, while wind fed just shy of 5 percent.

“The claim that [Virginia] or any PJM state can run a modern grid without dispatchable gen is reckless. Facts are stubborn things,” former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chair Mark Christie posted on X.

Utilities spent the last week shoring up infrastructure by reinforcing wires and cutting tree branches to prevent major disruptions.

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned utilities, said companies marshaled 63,000 workers from 43 states and the District of Columbia to sites in the storm’s path. EEI spokesperson Brian Reil said that was comparable to the personnel deployed to the theater of Hurricane Helene, the 2024 storm that inflicted $78.7 billion worth of damage across North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia.

Ice is Fern’s key threat. Even a quarter-inch of ice layers tree branches with exponentially more weight, raising the chances of limbs breaking and damaging wires. Half an inch can snap electrical wires. Beyond that, treacherous ice can prevent or delay response teams from accessing compromised infrastructuring and prolong recovery time.

“We’re expecting a very serious situation if the worst comes with this storm,” Duke Energy spokesperson Riley Cook said, noting the utility had dispatched 18,000 employees to 22 critical sites. “We could be seeing power lines come down or tree limbs fall on our power lines, and we have to get those up.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/02/8a/18383c894775896d4c5519271e3a/winter-weather-chicago-33622.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 18:00:41.171399

Of course, we who follow electric vehicles know China is the world’s largest EV manufacturer. It’s also clear there are many affordable Chinese EVs — much more affordable than in some other countries. There might be less clarity about how much China is also leading in the number of EV chargers, which makes sense for a country that has the largest number of fully electric vehicles.

To get straight to it, here are some points recently published by China’s National Energy Administration: “By the end of December 2025, the number of electric vehicle charging facilities in my country reached 20.092 million, exceeding the 20 million mark. Among them, there were 4.717 million public charging facilities (guns) and 15.375 million private charging facilities (guns). Currently, my country has built the world’s largest electric vehicle charging network, supporting the charging needs of over 40 million new energy vehicles.”

Another claim in the article is that going from 10 million chargers to 20 million only took about 18 months. Many of China’s chargers are fast ones as well. Quite a few chargers have been installed in highway service areas, with almost full coverage of those areas now provided for long-distance driving.

For the sake of comparison, Europe has a little over one million public EV chargers. The US may have only about 237,000 non-home chargers.

China has great motivation for switching to full EVs, far too much toxic air pollution. Air pollution from fossil fuels harms many people in China every year and contributes to far too many premature deaths.

“Every year, more than four million people around the world die prematurely from breathing dirty air. In China alone, the number of deaths attributable to air pollution exceeds one million annually. That figure may not come as a surprise; after all, we are routinely treated to images in the media of thick, sooty smog enveloping Beijing, Shanghai, and other Chinese cities.”

There are some people who try to criticize electric vehicles by claiming they all run on electricity generated by coal, which is not true. Much electricity is now generated from clean, renewable sources: hydropower, solar power, wind power, etc. China is a world leader in solar power and in battery manufacturing, so it is poised to decrease its reliance on fossil fuels and become more energy independent while reducing toxic air pollution.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ChatGPT-Image-Jan-25-2026-10_36_46-AM-800x533.png,N,,2026-01-25 14:58:30.950944

In a press release, CATL stated that the whitepaper identifies five interdependent actions that are needed in order to strengthen system resilience:

Design batteries for circularity, not disposal

Rethink battery service within optimized energy–mobility systems

Scale circular business models that treat batteries as long-term assets

Build and co-invest in regional circular infrastructure

Enable a circular operating system through data, standards, and policy

Speaking at The Foundation’s Leadership Briefing, Jiang Li, Vice-Chairman and Board Secretary of CATL highlighted: “This report marks a major milestone in the global journey towards a circular battery economy. Circular battery systems must now be scaled across regions, industries, and applications — from EVs to energy storage — and adapted to diverse market contexts.”

In the bustling showrooms of Chevrolet dealerships across the United States, models like the Bolt EV and Equinox EV have been turning heads with their surprisingly low price tags. Priced under $30,000 after incentives, these vehicles represent a beacon of hope for mass-market electrification, promising to democratize access to zero-emission driving. But beneath this veneer of affordability lies a brewing storm of economic pressures that could soon inflate costs, making these budget-friendly options a relic of the past. Industry analysts and automakers are sounding alarms about supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly those tied to international trade dynamics.

The core issue revolves around the batteries that power these electric vehicles (EVs). Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, has relied on cost-effective components sourced from global suppliers, including those in China, to keep prices competitive. However, recent policy shifts in Washington are poised to disrupt this delicate balance. Proposed tariffs on imported batteries and related materials could add thousands of dollars to the production costs of vehicles like the Bolt, potentially forcing GM to pass those expenses onto consumers.

This isn’t mere speculation; it’s grounded in the realities of global trade tensions. As the U.S. seeks to bolster domestic manufacturing, measures aimed at curbing reliance on foreign tech are gaining traction. For Chevrolet’s EV lineup, which has been praised for undercutting rivals like Tesla’s Model 3 in price, these changes could erode their market edge. Dealerships from California to Michigan are already whispering about inventory adjustments in anticipation of higher sticker prices.

Rising Tariffs and the Battery Supply Chain Squeeze

The Biden administration’s push for tariffs on Chinese goods, including EV batteries, stems from a broader strategy to protect American jobs and reduce dependence on overseas production. According to a report from Digital Trends, these tariffs could increase the cost of key components by up to 25%, directly impacting models like the Chevrolet Bolt. This isn’t isolated; similar concerns echo across the industry, with experts predicting a ripple effect on all affordable EVs.

Beyond tariffs, the supply chain for lithium-ion batteries is fraught with volatility. Raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel have seen price fluctuations driven by geopolitical events and mining constraints. For instance, disruptions in African cobalt mines and Australian lithium exports have already pushed costs upward. General Motors has invested heavily in North American battery plants, like the Ultium Cells facility in Ohio, but scaling these operations to meet demand remains a challenge, potentially leading to short-term reliance on pricier domestic alternatives.

Automotive insiders point out that Chevrolet’s strategy of offering sub-$30,000 EVs hinges on economies of scale from global sourcing. If tariffs force a pivot to U.S.-based suppliers, the transition could involve not just higher material costs but also investments in new infrastructure. A recent analysis from BloombergNEF highlights how such shifts might add $2,000 to $5,000 per vehicle, a burden that budget-conscious buyers may not absorb easily.

Geopolitical Tensions Fueling Price Volatility

Trade wars aren’t new, but their intensification under recent administrations has amplified risks for the EV sector. The U.S. Commerce Department’s investigations into Chinese subsidies for battery manufacturers have led to calls for steeper duties, as detailed in a Wall Street Journal piece exploring the broader implications for American consumers. This comes at a time when EV adoption is accelerating, with sales projected to reach 10 million units globally this year.

Chevrolet’s parent company, GM, has been vocal about these challenges. In earnings calls, executives have warned that without policy relief or accelerated domestic production, affordable models could see price hikes of 10% or more. This sentiment is echoed on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where industry watchers such as @EVExpert and @AutoInsiderNews have shared threads on how tariffs might stifle competition, linking to real-time data from trade monitoring sites.

Moreover, the European Union’s parallel moves to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs add another layer of complexity. As reported by Reuters, this global clampdown could reroute supply chains, increasing costs for U.S. importers. For Chevrolet, which assembles many EVs in Mexico and Canada under NAFTA provisions, these international pressures might necessitate redesigns or sourcing overhauls, further inflating expenses.

Domestic Manufacturing Push: Opportunities and Hurdles

The silver lining in this scenario is the U.S. government’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers tax credits for domestically produced EVs and batteries. Chevrolet’s Bolt EV qualifies for up to $7,500 in federal incentives, helping offset potential price increases. However, as a New York Times investigation notes, the IRA’s strict domestic content requirements could exclude vehicles with foreign batteries, pressuring GM to accelerate localization efforts.

GM’s Ultium battery platform is central to this shift. Joint ventures with LG Energy Solution are ramping up production in states like Tennessee and Michigan, aiming to produce millions of cells annually. Yet, scaling these facilities involves billions in capital, and any delays—such as those caused by labor shortages or regulatory approvals—could prolong dependence on imported parts, exacerbating cost pressures.

Industry veterans argue that while domestic manufacturing builds resilience, it comes at a premium. A study from the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that U.S. battery costs could remain 20% higher than Chinese counterparts until 2030, even with subsidies. This disparity underscores why Chevrolet’s affordable EVs might soon carry a heftier price tag, challenging the narrative of EVs as accessible to the average American.

Consumer Impacts and Market Shifts

For everyday buyers, the prospect of rising EV prices is daunting. Take Sarah Jenkins, a teacher from Denver who recently purchased a Chevrolet Equinox EV for its $27,000 post-incentive price. “It was the only way I could afford to go electric,” she told reporters. But if tariffs push that figure to $32,000 or more, as speculated in forums on X, it could deter similar purchases, slowing the green transition.

Dealers are preparing for this by diversifying inventories, stocking more hybrid options that aren’t as tariff-sensitive. A Automotive News article details how GM is lobbying for exemptions, arguing that abrupt changes could harm sales momentum. Indeed, Chevrolet’s EV sales surged 60% last quarter, but analysts from Cox Automotive warn that price sensitivity remains high among middle-income households.

Competitors aren’t immune. Ford and Hyundai, which also offer budget EVs, face similar headwinds. Yet, Chevrolet’s heavy bet on affordability makes it particularly vulnerable. Social media buzz on X, including posts from @GreenCarReports linking to tariff updates, suggests consumers might turn to used EVs or delay purchases, potentially creating a market glut of older models.

Innovation as a Counterbalance to Cost Pressures

Amid these challenges, technological advancements offer hope. Solid-state batteries, which promise higher energy density and lower costs, are on the horizon for GM’s lineup. Partnerships with startups like Solid Power aim to commercialize this tech by 2027, potentially reducing reliance on volatile lithium supplies.

Recycling initiatives are also gaining steam. Companies like Redwood Materials are building U.S.-based facilities to reclaim battery materials, as covered in a Bloomberg report on circular economies in EVs. For Chevrolet, integrating recycled components could shave costs, making affordable models viable even under tariff regimes.

Furthermore, software updates and over-the-air improvements are extending vehicle lifespans, adding value without hardware changes. GM’s Super Cruise system, now standard on many EVs, enhances appeal, helping justify modest price bumps.

Strategic Responses from Automakers

General Motors isn’t standing idle. CEO Mary Barra has outlined a $35 billion investment in EVs through 2025, focusing on vertical integration. This includes mining deals in the U.S. and Canada to secure raw materials, mitigating tariff impacts.

Collaborations with tech giants like Google for infotainment could differentiate Chevrolet’s offerings, attracting buyers willing to pay a premium for features. As per insights from Electrek, such strategies are crucial for maintaining market share in a tariff-heavy environment.

Rivals like Tesla are doubling down on U.S. production, but Chevrolet’s mass-market focus requires broader accessibility. Industry forums on X highlight how GM might bundle financing or leases to soften price shocks, preserving the allure of models like the Bolt.

Long-Term Implications for EV Adoption

The trajectory of affordable EVs like Chevrolet’s hinges on policy evolution. If tariffs are moderated or domestic incentives expanded, prices could stabilize. However, persistent trade frictions might accelerate a bifurcation, with premium EVs thriving while entry-level options languish.

Environmental advocates worry this could hinder emissions reductions. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that widespread EV adoption requires prices below $30,000, a threshold now at risk.

Ultimately, Chevrolet’s challenge reflects broader industry dynamics, where affordability battles against protectionism. As one executive quipped on X, “Cheap EVs were never truly cheap—they were subsidized by global trade.” Moving forward, innovation and policy alignment will determine if models like the Bolt remain gateways to electrification or become cautionary tales of economic turbulence.

Navigating Uncertainty in Electric Mobility

Stakeholders from suppliers to regulators are monitoring these developments closely. A recent webinar hosted by the Society of Automotive Engineers discussed hedging strategies against tariff volatility, emphasizing diversified sourcing.

For consumers, staying informed via sources like X’s real-time updates or publications such as Car and Driver is key. Chevrolet’s website now features tariff impact FAQs, signaling transparency amid uncertainty.

Just because the federal government has turned its back on climate action doesn’t mean the United States is out of the fight.
Based on polling and local action, it seems that the American people understand the importance of climate action, even if the American president does not.
In a poll last year, 65 percent of US registered voters recognized a link between climate change and their cost of living.
A 2024 poll found that in 47 of the 50 states, a majority of voters were worried about climate change.","On January 7, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from 66 international organizations, conventions, and treaties, including 31 affiliated with the United Nations. Though many are environmentally focused, the list also includes groups with missions involving human rights, peace, trade, and women’s rights. One particularly striking item on that long list was the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the most important climate treaty in the world and the foundation for every global climate action of the last 30 years.

Former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy called the departure announcement “short-sighted, embarrassing, and foolish.” Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland, called it “unbelievably stupid.” The Sierra Club’s executive director, Loren Blackford, said, “Donald Trump may talk tough, but time and again he proves incapable of leading.”

Where does that leave the future of climate policy and greenhouse gas reduction?

The Trump administration has made moves to distance the United States from international climate agreements before, pulling out of the Paris Agreement once in 2017 and again in 2025, after President Biden rejoined the agreement during his term. But the UNFCCC is more than an agreement—it’s a full treaty, ratified unanimously by the Senate and signed into law by Republican President George H.W. Bush. Even without the US, it has 197 member states, more than the UN itself. The United States would be the first country ever to leave the treaty.

Many question whether Trump even has the authority to make this change. Article 2 of the US Constitution grants the president the power to make treaties, with Senate approval. However, the framers did not include a similar process for how to leave them. That leaves constitutional scholars divided over the legality of Trump’s decision. Some say that if the Senate has to ratify a treaty, it should also have to ratify a departure. This is the view of several environmental organizations, which may sue the administration to block the departure.

""Because the US entered the UNFCCC with advice and consent of the Senate in 1992, it’s our legal view that it also must be exited using the same process in reciprocation,"" Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, told Reuters.

But others claim the executive branch’s generally wide-ranging powers over foreign affairs give the president the ability to leave treaties unilaterally, or at least, that they are not explicitly barred from doing so by anything in the Constitution.

The Supreme Court had a chance to weigh in on the issue in 1979. Senator Barry Goldwater sued then-President Jimmy Carter over his decision to leave a treaty with Taiwan. The Court refused to decide one way or the other. Nearly 50 years later, it may come down to another Supreme Court, this one largely appointed by the same sitting president who will be the defendant in the case.

Some contend that if a US president can leave a treaty, another president may be able to simply rejoin it, since the Senate ratification would still apply. The head of the UNFCCC, Simon Steill, made it clear that the treaty organization itself would allow it. “The doors remain open for the US to reenter in the future, as it has in the past with the Paris Agreement,” he said in a statement. Executive authority, once granted by the Court or ceded by inaction, doesn’t go away when the office changes hands.

Each of the 66 organizations listed in the executive order have their own rules about how countries can leave them. The UNFCCC, for example, requires a year from formal declaration of departure, so it would not take effect until at least next January. Some of them require as much as three years, meaning that the US would remain for the rest of the second Trump term. A few have no rules at all for governing departures, which will leave even more unanswered legal questions.

The announcements came as a surprise to many at the UN, including top diplomats who told the Associated Press that they learned of the action through social media, with no notice or official communications.

Many experts and opponents of the departures say that there is one clear winner in all this chaos. If the United States makes its abdication of climate responsibility official, it hands the reins of climate policy, green energy, and all the economic and political power tied up in both to another global superpower: China.

“Withdrawing from the UNFCCC is an abandonment of America’s opportunity to drive the global economy into the future, ceding jobs and economic growth to China and other countries,” Blackford said in a press statement.

In another statement to CNN, former Secretary of State John Kerry called the departure “a gift to China and a get-out-of-jail-free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.” World Resources Institute director David Widawsky said it was “a strategic blunder that gives away American advantage for nothing in return.”

The United States is already far behind China on production of new green energy. In the first half of 2025, China installed more new solar power than the rest of the world combined. This week, only a few days after a new high-seas treaty came into effect, the Chinese government proposed hosting the secretariat of the treaty in Xiamen. As the United States hands over the soft power of international climate and environmental leadership, China appears more than happy to pick it up.

Some question how much American membership matters. The Trump administration has already stopped participating in international climate action. The administration has stopped paying its dues, amounting to over 20 percent of the treaty’s total funding. The United States is also the world’s biggest oil and gas producer, and also the largest exporter of fracked gas. We produce more crude oil than any country, ever.

Consequently, some experts have wondered whether removing such a massive petrostate from a leadership position on climate could have a bright side. Cornell climate scientist Daniele Visoni told Inside Climate News, “the only thing that this government is doing is depriving themselves of the opportunity to influence these reports in any way,” and suggests that the pullout could keep the US from being a cheerleader for fossil fuel interests.

COP30, held last year in Brazil, provided a test case for this theory. The United States sent no official delegation to the conference, which some believed might produce a less compromised agenda. But that’s not how it turned out. COP30 was widely seen as ineffective, resulting in some voluntary pledges but little measurable progress.

Just because the federal government has turned its back on climate action doesn’t mean the United States is out of the fight. Over both Trump terms, the role of states, cities, and other jurisdictions has grown to fill the gap. When the administration chose not to send a delegation to COP30 last year, California did. While the Trump administration may deny the scientific truth of climate change, 33 states, including Republican-led coastal states like South Carolina and Mississippi, have some sort of climate resilience and adaptation plan in effect, according to a report from the Brookings Institution.

Based on polling and local action, it seems that the American people understand the importance of climate action, even if the American president does not. In a poll last year, 65 percent of US registered voters recognized a link between climate change and their cost of living. A 2024 poll found that in 47 of the 50 states, a majority of voters were worried about climate change. In the absence of federal leadership, people power can move smaller-scale local elections and issues forward.

The future of global climate policy is more uncertain now than it has ever been. What is known is this: The United States has stepped back from its responsibilities on climate and handed that leadership role to China. But no president, no matter how reckless, can undo these basic truths of physics and economics: Climate change is real, and green energy is cheaper than fossil fuels. President Trump may be giving up our place at the table, but the rest of the world, and American cities and states, can still take meaningful action.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-25 12:59:21.650816

The mission: Have one 212 hp Leapmotor C10 range extender EV.
We also reference Audi's Dakar Rally-winning range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron.
This range, claims Leapmotor, is possible because of the unique range extender EV drivetrain.
And it did so using a range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron.","The theory seems absolutely brilliant. A practical SUV, propelled by an efficient, 212-hp electric motor. With a 1.5-liter, four-cylinder gas-powered engine under the hood, serving only as a generator, charging the SUV as you drive it. So, in theory, even though you can plug in your SUV and charge it like a Tesla or Ford Mustang Mach-E, you don't actually don't need to charge your EV with a range extender system in place.

To test this rather ambitious theory, we embarked on a 2,000-mile cross-country journey in a Leapmotor C10 range extender EV. Leapmotor, you ask? Stellantis owns a 20% equity stake in Chinese start-up Leapmotor, and the technology deployed in the C10 will soon find its way into Stellantis products, too. Here's how it all went down.

The mission: Have one 212 hp Leapmotor C10 range extender EV. Embark on a 2,000-mile cross-country trip, and see how far you get before you are left Volt-less next to the road. We also reference Audi's Dakar Rally-winning range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron.

How To Get Stranded Next To The Road... Or Not?

Auto companies have a habit of not calling a spade a spade, but rather calling a spade a Caterpillar front-end loader. In other words, marketing materials are known to embellish some details. Often, numbers that are claimed appear to be theoretical, achieved only in laboratory-perfect conditions. Numbers that the average driver will probably never achieve in the daily commute.

So, when Chinese start-up brand Leapmotor claims the C10's internal combustion engine, operating on the Atkinson cycle, can achieve 42.7 MPG, it seems rather... well... optimistic. It doesn't end there. You also get a 28.4 kWh battery pack in the game, which adds another 90 miles of pure EV range (when fully charged). Cue drum roll... with a 13.2-gallon fuel tank, the combined range of this contraption is claimed to be just over 603 miles. Optimistic, much?

This range, claims Leapmotor, is possible because of the unique range extender EV drivetrain. Instead of providing drive to any part of the car in any which way, the gasoline engine's sole purpose is to charge the battery. The C10 is driven only by Volts, with the internal combustion engine only generating Volts for the battery pack to power the 212-hp electric motor, driving the rear axle.

The theory is simple: a drivetrain that provides all the advantages of an EV-driven vehicle, including instant torque, smooth and efficient operation, and low maintenance. And with the gasoline generator in the game, range anxiety is no longer an issue at all. In fact, you don't have to charge the battery in the traditional EV way at all. Just add gas, and drive. Sounds too good to be true, right?

To test Leapmotor's claims, we embarked on an extensive 2,000-mile range, traveling to places where folks have never even heard of electric vehicle propulsion, Elon Musk or Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries.

What is it like to drive? Like a run-of-the-mill electric vehicle, that's what. So you have the instant torque, combined with 212 hp, providing more than adequate performance for a large SUV. The drivetrain is efficient and smooth, the progress seamless and refined. There is only the occasional, very faint drone from the gasoline engine, as it kicks in to charge the battery. It really is surprisingly quiet in its operation.

Is the C10 perfect? Nope. Driver assist systems like the lane-keep assist set-up are certainly not as polished as offerings from some other brands, and the system's interventions can be disruptive. But you can switch these systems off by using the massive 14.6-inch touchscreen. Wireless software updates should sort this out soon enough.

On that note. The Leapmotor's minimalist interior takes the button-free concept to the next level. The only buttons or actions available in the cabin are the basic buttons on the steering wheel, controlling functions like the sound system, side mirror adjustment, cruise control and the voice control (with a lady living in the dashboard that takes some convincing before performing the requested task). The gearlever is a stalk behind the steering wheel, and the left stalk operates the wiper and high beam function. Other than the buttons to roll the windows up and down, that's it. Everything else requires adjustment via that big central screen.

Meanwhile, cruising along at a merry 75 mph, we were waiting for the Leapmotor to grind to a halt next to the road, without a Volt in sight. After a stint of about 400 miles, and with the range indicator claiming we still had around 150 miles in the tank, with some Volts as change, we stopped for gas. Just in case. And then we worked out the numbers, using the actual fuel added. It had done 36.7 MPG, with plenty of lead-footed driving included, as we explored the C10's dynamic prowess.

With more finesse and care, we realized that more than 40 MPG may be possible... and that is without any additional Volts from a charging station. Say what? Is Leapmotor's ambitious range claim actually achievable? Well, apparently, it is!

Going The Whole Nine Yards

After we achieved 37.6 MPG on the first stint of our trip without really trying, we made a more concerted effort to extend the range, driving in a more economical fashion, sticking to 70 mph. It became a challenge. But unlike the challenge of a normal EV, where drivers have to keep an anxious eye on that range and continuously plan their journey around charging stations, we had no such qualms. Any filling station would do.

The high-end sound system, once you've figured out how to work it, is pretty fine. Climate control gets the job done in the most efficient manner. And the interior is a comfortable place in which to spend your hours. In no time, we had racked up another 500 miles, and topped up the fuel, and crunched some numbers... 42.9 MPG! That means, with a full charge of the battery (after you give it an AC or DC charge), the C10 can reach more than 600 miles without refueling or recharging!

The Leapmotor continued to impress on the rest of the 2,000-mile trip. Smooth. Efficient. Comfortable. Luxurious. Running on gas fumes. And, importantly, no range anxiety, whatsoever. Is this the way of the future? Combining all the advantages of an EV with an efficient, low-emission gasoline engine?

It certainly seems to tick a lot of ""Yes"" boxes.

For the record, Leapmotor is obviously a big deal in China, and is also sold in various European markets, as well as in Southern Africa. In theory, it will eventually be sold in every country with a Stellantis outlet. The trip recorded here was conducted in Southern Africa, driving from Johannesburg to the desert-like Karoo area, and the surrounding areas.

Range Extender EVs are heading to the US. As is the Leapmotor's distant cousin, the RAM 1500 REV, which is expected to go on sale soon. As you'd expect, the RAM is bigger and better in every department compared to the C10. A 3.6-liter V6 is deployed as the generator, it has a much larger 92.8 kWh battery pack, and two electric motors power the truck. The result is 647 hp of pure electric power, and a drivetrain that can blast the truck to 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds. Yet it can also reach a claimed 690 miles before requiring a recharge or refuel.

With fellow Stellantis brand Jeep also set to introduce the Grand Wagoneer REV soon, and Nissan adding its own range of REEVs too, the way of the car in the USA may be about to change, forever.

Audi's Cool Party Trick That Changed The EV Game

In 2024, Audi won the Dakar Rally, the most grueling motorsport event on Earth. And it did so using a range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron. The RS Q is propelled by two powerful electric motors, hailing from Audi's Formula E racing program. With one motor per axle, the all-wheel-drive Audi produces 384 hp, and around 600 lb-ft of torque.

The generator part is taken care of by a two-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder, DTM racing engine. In racing conditions, the engine runs constantly between 4,500 and 6,000 rpm, providing the relatively small 52 kWh battery pack with all the Volts it needs. Yes, it may have sounded weird, the gas engine running at constant revs with a high-pitched, ungainly wail. But it was effective. So effective that it managed to beat a horde of competitors, racing in purpose-built internal combustion racing vehicles.

In doing so, Audi's pioneering race winner steered EVs in a new direction. Welcome to the age of REEV.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_4174.JPG?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-25 12:59:17.423928

For three centuries, southern right whales were known as “the right whales” to hunt. Their docility, slow speed, and floating carcasses made them easy prey for whalers. By the 1920s, the species’ estimated global population of more than 70,000 had been all but eliminated, with around 300 remaining. The hunt was banned in 1935.

Since then, various initiatives have sought to reverse the trend, such as the International Whaling Commission. This intergovernmental organization is charged with regulating whaling and conserving all species of these animals. The commission celebrates its 80th anniversary this year. These days, southern right whale populations off the coast of Argentine Patagonia are showing signs of recovery. Here, the “Blue Gulf” of San Matías has emerged as a key site for their reproduction and breeding. But a new threat is looming.

The San Matías Gulf, alongside Argentina’s central Río Negro province, has become a key site in national plans to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). As extraction operations ramp up inland at the Vaca Muerta oil and gas field (one of the world’s biggest shale oil and gas deposits), exportation is being galvanized under the pro-extraction presidency of Javier Milei. He has described Argentine LNG as “the largest investment in the history of Argentina.”

Argentina is eyeing LNG markets, including Europe, India, China, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil. There are still no firm agreements with any of these countries, although there are signs of interest from some.

However, the San Matías Gulf is an area of enormous ecological value, home to five national and provincial marine reserves. It has been internationally recognized for around 20 years as one of the richest ecosystems in Argentina. The gulf concentrates phytoplankton and captures large amounts of CO₂. It is also one of the few places in the world where southern right whales can be observed from land.

Biologists and oceanographers have told Dialogue Earth that the installation of oil and gas projects in the area poses a critical risk to these whales, as well as the rest of the ecosystem.

Until a little over three years ago, such activity was prohibited by law. In 2022, the government of Alberto Fernández reformed Río Negro province’s law number 3308, which had prohibited hydrocarbon activities in the area. The reform has paved the way for a new port to enable LNG exports and other strategic projects.

The San Matías Gulf was chosen because it is one of the few points on Argentina’s Atlantic coast with sufficient depth and a direct connection to Vaca Muerta.

Four key projects — a pipeline, a port, and two floating LNG plants — are currently at different stages of development, with plans for four more. These are opposed by several environmentalists and scientists who are raising concerns about their cumulative impact.

Ship collisions and oil spills

Critics claim this development will heighten the risk of oil spills, and could change ocean dynamics. It will also lead to a wider increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

There are multiple risks for whales and other animals living in the San Matías Gulf, warns the ecologist Belén Braga, a member of the multinational, non-profit Whale Conservation Institute (ICB). One of the most significant is ship collisions, which Braga says will increase. This is in addition to the entanglement risks they face from the fishing industry. And greater numbers of gas liquefaction vessels could cause more seaweed to grow, bringing a heightened risk of disease, she adds.

“We are talking about collisions, noise pollution, spills, and chronic micro-spills. All these warnings are on the table,” says Braga. The impacts would not only compromise wildlife, she adds, but also the regional economy, which is based on fishing and tourism.

In its environmental impact assessment, the national energy company YPF acknowledges that the necessary pipeline and two huge, floating platforms used for loading tankers (known as “monobuoys”) all represent spill risks. The operators have designed a “safe operation management” plan in the event of a spill.

However, a 2025 study concluded that, in several scenarios, the oil could spread further across 30 hours than YPF has calculated for. The study was coordinated by the Forum for the Conservation of the Patagonian Sea (FMP), a network of civil society organizations that includes the ICB.

Several sources consulted by Dialogue Earth have pointed out that environmental assessments of fossil fuel projects in the San Matías Gulf are fragmented. As a result, they say, there has not yet been a comprehensive analysis of the cumulative impacts of these developments in this area.

Cristian Fernández, legal coordinator for the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (Farn), an Argentine NGO, raises issues with the potential for increased emissions: “The environmental impact study omits a serious analysis of emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, and volatile organic compounds such as benzene.”

Fernández claims the San Matías Gulf is being treated as a “sacrifice zone” in the name of economic development.

Argentina’s LNG vision

Four projects linked to the LNG export plan have been approved by the national government so far. The most significant is a nearly 500-kilometer-long oil pipeline called Vaca Muerta Oil Sur. YPF’s president and CEO, Horacio Marín, has described it as “the largest infrastructure project in the country.” The shareholder companies are YPF, Vista Energy, Pampa Energía, all Latin American, and Pan American Energy, headquartered in Canada.

The pipeline begins in Loma Campana, Neuquén, in the heart of Vaca Muerta. It runs to Punta Colorada, a town located between two protected areas in the San Matías Gulf. The pipeline will carry LNG to the port and its two monobuoys.

In addition, two floating vessels from the Norwegian company Golar LNG, named the Hilli Epiceyo and the MK II, are expected to be deployed off the coast of Argentina to liquefy the gas. An alternative to permanent, onshore facilities, the vessels are ship-based units, 300-400 meters long and 112 meters high. This project is being handled by the consortium Southern Energy, comprising Pan American Energy, YPF, Pampa Energía, Golar LNG, and Harbour Energy, headquartered in London.

According to Southern Energy, the first ship would begin operating in 2027, the second in 2028. They will eventually process around 17% of Argentina’s current gas production.

A separate gas pipeline is currently out for tender with the Italian-Argentine manufacturer Techint. The firm is facing competition from a number of unidentified Chinese companies.

The MK II is currently being repurposed by a Chinese company. Philip Andrews-Speed, a researcher at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in the United Kingdom, explains that China’s status as one of the world’s largest shipbuilders gives it a key role in the LNG market.

Despite strong support from the government, however, Argentine LNG has yet to gain commercial traction. In April 2025, YPF signed a memorandum of understanding with Eni, an Italian oil major. The following November, YPF signed another similar agreement with Abu Dhabi’s state oil company, ADNOC.

But in early December, the London-based oil giant Shell withdrew from the project before it began; Shell itself had been a replacement for another company that also withdrew, Malaysia’s PETRONAS. Meanwhile, China — the country with the highest LNG import figures globally — has been reducing its purchases of foreign gas due to “excess demand” and higher than expected prices.

Despite these troubles, the government of Río Negro has continued to support the projects’ progress.

The reform that made it possible

Critics say the September 2022 reform of Río Negro’s law 3308 was hurried through and failed to fulfill consultation requirements.

Pablo Barreno, a regional legislator, tells Dialogue Earth the bill arrived without prior notice – and with strong support from the then-governor, Arabela Carreras. “We found out about it through a WhatsApp group.” Barreno adds that the meeting took place just one day later. He was the only legislator who voted against it, citing insufficient information.

The session was targeted by protestors, including Fabrizio di Giacomo, a member of Multisectoral Gulf of San Matías (MGSM). This collective brings together local residents, coastal communities, and other organizations. Di Giacomo claims the government sought to prevent any form of social participation by holding the session behind closed doors and reinforcing police control.

Several campaigners and scientific institutions argue the reform was unconstitutional and violates the Escazú Agreement. The treaty, which entered into force in 2021, guarantees civic participation in decision-making. An appeal against the reform was rejected by Río Negro’s superior court of justice in 2023. Another appeal has been lodged at the Supreme Court.

The Ministry is implementing a clear plan for technology transfer and is open to diverse partnership models, particularly those prioritizing the use of locally manufactured components to build a robust domestic renewable energy market, said Esmat.

The drive for localization is supported by Egypt’s massive natural resource capacity. Hassan El-Khatib, Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade, noted during the World Economic Forum (WEF) that Egypt possesses the potential to generate 700 to 900 gigawatts (GW) from the Western Desert alone.

To unlock this potential, Egypt is expanding cooperation in power generation while simultaneously developing energy storage systems to ensure grid stability.

Ice accumulation, freezing temperatures, impassable roads and hazardous road conditions make restoration efforts challenging by slowing access to damaged equipment and creating unsafe working conditions.

Our crews are working as quickly and safely as possible to restore service, and 2,750 restoration resources are staged and ready to respond as conditions allow, with additional resources in route.

Restoring power during winter storms is different from other weather events and requires a careful, step-by-step approach to protect both customers, workers and the electric grid.

Before power can be restored, damage to infrastructure must be assessed. Damage assessment and restoration work has been slowed by downed vegetation blocking roadways and icy road conditions. Once it is safe to do so, crews begin evaluating damage to power plants, transmission lines, substations and local distribution equipment. In some areas, icy roads and unsafe conditions may delay access.

During extreme cold, power cannot be restored all at once. Many customers leave heating systems and appliances running during an outage, which can create a sudden surge in electricity demand when power is restored. To prevent additional outages or equipment damage, crews restore service one section at a time using a controlled process known as cold load pickup.

We restore customers in a planned and deliberate order. We start with essential services, move on to large neighborhoods and then to individual homes.

Power is first restored to critical community infrastructure and essential services such as hospitals, water treatment plants, police and fire stations, and communication systems.

Next, we restore lines serving large areas of customers, and then we restore neighborhoods. This returns power to the largest number of customers in the shortest amount of time.

Some homes and businesses take longer, as individual customer homes or businesses with damage are often the most time-consuming repairs.

While many customers may be restored relatively quickly, some outages may last longer depending on damage severity, ice conditions and accessibility.

Customer safety and community resources

Customers should continue to prioritize safety while outages persist.

Warming centers: Customers in need of shelter and warmth should consider local warming centers or shelters if it is safe to travel. To find a listing of available warming centers, visit GOHSEP’s Louisiana Warming Centers: https://gohsep.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/9d47b24a528f43cf84633a2c04270706

Road conditions: Please be aware that roads may be hazardous or closed during restoration efforts. Road conditions and closure information can be found here from Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development: https://www.511la.org/

Generator safety: Never use generators indoors or in and never connect a generator directly to home wiring without proper transfer equipment.

Heating safety: Never use ovens, grills or outdoor heating devices to heat your home.

Downed power lines: Always assume downed lines are energized and dangerous — stay away and report them immediately by calling 1-800-9OUTAGE (1-800-968-8243) or your local police/fire department.

While the old structures lacked modern amenities, Knopp made the most of teaching at a historic site. “When studying U.S. history, particularly relations with Mexico and 20th-century wars,” he says, “I was able to connect students to what was here at Fort Brown.”

Today, a former 48-bed hospital houses the college president’s offices on the campus in Brownsville, in the Rio Grande Valley. Fort Brown’s hospital annex (built in 1868), commissary (1904), guardhouse and morgue (1870) support various college departments.

Fort Brown and four other U.S. Army forts, established along the Rio Grande in the years after Texas became a state in 1845, endured for decades as military installations.

Unlike Texas frontier forts of the 1800s, such as Fort Concho in San Angelo and Fort McKavett in Menard County, which were rapidly abandoned as the frontier moved west, the border forts in Brownsville, Rio Grande City, Laredo and Eagle Pass remained defensive posts, off and on, for nearly 100 years. Fort Bliss in El Paso is still in use.

Today—178 years after the Mexican-American War—repurposed buildings from these border forts contribute to the vitality and identity of those Texas towns. Retaining their 1800s ambiance, the former Army headquarters, barracks and hospitals serve as schools, colleges, museums and parks.

The border forts had much in common, each named for veterans of the Mexican-American War, fought immediately following Texas statehood. At Rio Grande crossings, most about 100 miles apart, each fort shifted locations several times before being rebuilt as permanent posts after the Civil War.

Troops at the forts alternately dealt with Mexican bandits and rustlers and rowdy revolutionaries from both sides of the border, protected travelers and settlers from raids by Comanche and Lipan Apache tribes, and trained troops for both world wars. The garrisons shaped the cities that grew around them, as Army suppliers set up shops that also catered to local residents.

Fort Brown

Count riverboat pilot Mifflin Kenedy among the early merchants who cashed in on Army contracts. He ferried troops and equipment from Fort Brown, near the Gulf Coast, up the Rio Grande during the Mexican-American War.

He later started a steamboat company, married a wealthy widow and acquired hundreds of thousands of acres. He is the namesake of the Kenedy Ranch, the town of Kenedy and Kenedy County.

Fort Brown evolved from a star-shaped earthen fort to a commanding presence after the Civil War, when 70 buildings were erected of locally made border brick. With wide arches fronting shaded breezeways, Fort Brown’s 1869 hospital (said to be the most beautiful hospital in the Army) was of crucial importance during epidemics of yellow fever and cholera as the only hospital in Cameron County until 1909.

Quartermasters negotiated contracts with local businesses for goods and services such as beans, flour, coffee pots and hay for horses. Although a brick wall separated the town from Fort Brown and its palm-lined parade grounds, traffic flowed between them.

“Interactions resulted in marriages,” Knopp says. “Married soldiers either stayed in the area or returned.”

Fort Brown provided several forms of entertainment for the town: parades, concerts and sporting activities. Sunday afternoon polo matches, a cavalry favorite, drew locals as did concerts at the post bandstand, held twice a week.

A tree-shaded “lovers’ lane” curled between the fort and the river. Troops marched in local parades and Charro Days celebrations. Off-duty troops ate at local restaurants. The officers’ club hosted dances while enlisted men attended dances on the patio of El Jardin Hotel. Soldiers’ sisters and daughters met and married local men, too.

Deactivated in 1944 when the last U.S.-based mounted soldiers left, Fort Brown almost immediately started a new life as part of what is now Texas Southmost College. New campus construction echoes the border brick architecture of bygone days.

Fort Brown tours, arranged by the Brownsville Historical Association, link the past to its visible remnants.

Fort Ringgold

Upriver at Rio Grande City, Fort Ringgold followed Fort Brown’s trajectory. Veterans of the Mexican-American War went into business, not always successfully.

Capt. Forbes Britton and partners failed at making their Rio Grande City riverboat landing a major stop for Kenedy’s steamboats. But construction booms after the Civil War and continuing through World War I boosted the local economy.

At Fort Ringgold, barracks, a jail, an arched brick hospital and officers’ quarters surrounded a parade ground, which was larger than a football field.

“The parade ground gives a real picture of what Fort Ringgold looked like 150 years ago, about 1870,” says Aminta Reyna Alaniz, a Rio Grande City historian and tour guide. The post bugler played reveille and taps in front of a megaphone longer than 5 feet on the parade ground, signaling the troops as well as townsfolk.

Alaniz identifies 17 fort buildings—from the guardhouse and bakery to warehouses and six barracks—that are today used by the Rio Grande City Grulla Independent School District.

The school district purchased the fort’s 325 acres and buildings in 1947 with plans for an education complex and park. Along F Troop and 12th Cavalry streets, tan- and white-painted brick buildings house registration, curriculum and instruction units.

Near a two-story enlisted cavalry barracks that once housed about 100 soldiers (and later was used as an elementary school), girls played softball on a recent Sunday afternoon. The expansive parade ground hosts marching band practice and school Christmas displays.

Until recently, Alaniz says, an electronic sound system broadcast a digital bugle call morning and night. But even those echoes have ended.

Fort McIntosh

Fort McIntosh was built at a long-established Rio Grande crossing in 1849, opposite a former Spanish presidio. Laredo grew along with the fort, which held as many as 400 soldiers on over 400 acres with a requisite hospital, jail, barracks and cemetery.

In 1946, the International Boundary and Water Commission and the city of Laredo divided up the former fort. The city created what is now the Fort McIntosh campus of Laredo College in 1947.

Inside the Fort McIntosh Historic District, streets are named for post commanders and soldiers. The brick hospital has become Laredo College’s purchasing department. The former officers’ quarters houses the campus student ministry, and the old commandant’s house became a museum furnished with Victorian-era pieces.

The bakery is occupied by a customs brokers association. Other refurbished McIntosh campus buildings are used for classrooms. The cemetery is empty, the remains relocated.

Fort Bliss

In 1848, more than 400 miles up the Rio Grande, a fifth border fort was established at El Paso. It too moved locations multiple times as El Paso flourished around it.

Hoping to remain prosperous, the residents in 1890 purchased and donated land for a permanent Army post, which remains active today.

Unlike the other forts in this list, Fort Bliss grew after World War II. It now covers 1.1 million acres of Texas and New Mexico and is among America’s largest Army posts, home to about 20,000 troops.

Replicas of Fort Bliss’ early adobe buildings were constructed for the fort’s centennial in 1948 and house a museum, which is open to the public.

But at the other four border forts, troops and time marched on. Swords were beaten into street signs. Some of those streets are named for the soldiers who shaped those towns’ histories.",https://texascooppower.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fea-border-forts-illustration-og.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 12:00:26.692980

""This surging transformer demand has created a significant supply deficit, with domestic manufacturing capacity unable to keep pace,"" Wood Mackenzie Senior Analyst Ben Boucher.
In 2025, imports will account for an estimated 80% of US power transformer supply and 50% of the distribution transformer supply.
This market imbalance is escalating costs and lead times and is delaying our ability to bring generating plants online in pace with the surging energy demand.""","The global clean energy transition has passed a tipping point as renewable energies have simply become too cheap to fail. Worldwide, nations both rich and poor are rushing to install more and more wind and solar capacity to keep up with rising energy demand rates driven by global economic development and the age of AI. But while countries have been investing heavily into increased production capacity, investments in critical grid infrastructure have not kept pace, leading to a major energy transition bottleneck and a potential threat to energy security for an increasing number of countries.

The United States and Europe are both facing critical transformer shortages and aging and inadequate grid infrastructure, and the threat that this shortage poses to energy security is already being felt through historic blackouts such as last year's cascading grid failure in Spain and Portugal. While these setbacks have raised the profile of infrastructure investing in European policy spheres, ""ambition is not yet being matched by action from governments, policy-makers, investors and businesses,"" according to a recent report from the World Economic Forum.

In the United States, specialists foresee a yearslong transformer crunch, with little to no relief forthcoming. While companies have rushed to ramp up production of power transformers and distribution transformers, keeping up with skyrocketing demand is an impossibly tall order. Wood Mackenzie estimates that, since 2019, U.S. demand for power transformers has jumped by 116 percent, while demand for distribution transformers has shot up 41 percent.

""This surging transformer demand has created a significant supply deficit, with domestic manufacturing capacity unable to keep pace,"" Wood Mackenzie Senior Analyst Ben Boucher. ""Utilities are routinely turning to the import market to meet project timelines. In 2025, imports will account for an estimated 80% of US power transformer supply and 50% of the distribution transformer supply. This market imbalance is escalating costs and lead times and is delaying our ability to bring generating plants online in pace with the surging energy demand.""

However, some experts disagree with this takeaway, arguing that the transformer ""shortage"" is overblown if not fabricated, and the issue lies in self-inflicted procurement problems. There's room for debate because the issue is a complex one stretching over many different economic sectors and supply chains. Whether the problem is one of supply or one of procurement, however, the impact is the same - major bottlenecks for new electricity with potential pitfalls for national energy security.

""Over the past few years, what started as a squeeze has gradually morphed into a crisis,"" Power Magazine recently reported. The Power article contends that this growing crisis has been ""furnished by years of underinvestment in domestic manufacturing, a sudden surge in post-pandemic construction and electrification, and volatility in grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES) and copper markets, which steadily pushed lead times for large power and generator step-up (GSU) transformers beyond historical norms.""

And those driving factors are showing little signs of changing, indicating that delay times for transformer delivery are going to continue to stretch on. Even though demand for these products is now growing exponentially, this spike is coming in the wake of years of lackluster demand, and would-be investors are still warming up to the idea that they'll get a return on their investment in the sector.

Hitachi, one major producer of such transformers, for example, has strategically only invested in transformer development when the purchase of those components is already guaranteed and buyer-backed. ""Nobody wants to overinvest"" in new production facilities, according to Hitachi Energy CEO Andreas Schierenbeck.

Through these kinds of up-front deals, Hitachi has planned $1 billion in new manufacturing capacity across the United States. However, Schierenbeck told news outlet Semafor this week that these deals are ""probably not enough to close the gap between supply and demandâ€¦ There are still customers who are just in the old world with transactional behavior, and they'll have to be lucky to get a slot.""

Legally, the tax credit is subject to verification during tax filing.","Lately, the effective price of a new electric vehicle (EV) in the U.S. has dropped significantly—for qualifying buyers—due to the $7,500 federal tax credit. If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: if you owe federal income taxes and plan to keep the car long-term, aim for a model that qualifies for the full credit. How to choose an EV under these conditions? Focus on vehicles under $55,000 MSRP for sedans or $80,000 for SUVs/trucks, verify final eligibility with your dealer, and avoid overpaying for features you won’t use. The key is timing—over the past year, uncertainty around policy changes has made early action more valuable than waiting.

This piece isn’t for keyword collectors. It’s for people who will actually use the product.

About EV Tax Credits and Final Cost

The federal tax credit reduces the effective purchase price of eligible new electric vehicles by up to $7,500. This isn’t a rebate—it’s applied when you file taxes, though many dealers now offer point-of-sale transfers, effectively lowering your upfront cost 1. Used EVs qualify for up to $4,000 or 30% of the sale price, whichever is less, with a cap at $25,000.

If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: the credit only matters if you have sufficient tax liability. No tax bill? No credit benefit. And eligibility depends on battery sourcing, final assembly location, and income caps for buyers—details that shift faster than automakers can update brochures.

Why This Matters Now

Over the past year, political and legislative shifts have put the future of the $7,500 credit in doubt. As of late 2025, multiple sources indicate the credit is set to expire or be modified as early as September 30, 2025 2. That creates a narrowing window for buyers to lock in savings.

The change signal is clear: automakers are adjusting pricing, leasing terms, and marketing focus. Some brands are pulling back on entry-level models, while others are emphasizing lease deals to absorb the tax complexity. If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: if you were considering an EV within the next 12 months, now is the time to evaluate whether acting before policy shifts makes financial sense.

Types and Variants

Not all electric vehicles qualify for the same incentives. Here’s a breakdown:

New Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)

Pros: Full $7,500 credit possible, zero tailpipe emissions, simpler maintenance

Cons: Higher base prices, eligibility tied to strict supply chain rules, may require home charging setup

New Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)

Pros: Qualify for partial or full credit depending on battery size and electric range, flexibility with gas backup

Cons: Often priced near the $80,000 SUV cap, complex powertrain, lower electric-only utility than BEVs

Used EVs

Pros: Up to $4,000 credit available, lower upfront cost, avoids first-year depreciation

Cons: Limited selection of qualifying models, must be sold by certified dealer, price capped at $25,000

If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: unless you drive less than 20 miles daily or lack charging access, a used EV rarely offers better value than a new one with the credit. The math usually favors new purchases when incentives apply.

Key Features and Specifications to Evaluate

When assessing which EV gives you the best post-credit value, focus on these factors:

Battery Sourcing: At least 50% of battery components must come from North America to qualify for full credit. This disqualifies many imported models.

Final Assembly Location: Must occur in North America. Vehicles built in Asia or Europe—even by American brands—may not qualify.

MSRP Caps: Sedans/liftbacks under $55,000; SUVs, trucks, vans under $80,000. Exceeding by $1? No credit.

Buyer Income Limits: Single filers above $150,000 AGI, heads of household above $225,000, joint filers above $300,000 are ineligible.

When it’s worth caring about: if you're comparing two similar EVs but one qualifies and the other doesn’t, the difference could be $7,500. When you don’t need to overthink it: if you're already over budget for your target vehicle, the credit won’t make it affordable—focus on cheaper models instead.

Pros and Cons

If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: the pros outweigh the cons only if you meet all eligibility requirements and plan to keep the car for years. Otherwise, it’s just noise in the decision process.

How to Choose an EV with Tax Credits in Mind

This guide walks you through making a practical decision—not chasing incentives, but using them wisely.

Step-by-Step Checklist

Determine your tax liability: Do you expect to owe at least $7,500 in federal taxes? If not, the credit provides no benefit.

Set a realistic budget: Include insurance, charging equipment, and potential upgrades.

Narrow to qualifying models: Use the DOE or IRS lookup tools to filter by credit eligibility.

Verify MSRP: Ensure the trim you want stays under $55k (sedans) or $80k (larger vehicles).

Confirm battery origin: Ask the dealer for documentation on component sourcing.

Compare total cost of ownership: Factor in fuel, maintenance, and resale.

Lock in purchase before deadline: If policy changes loom, act early.

Decision Flow

You want an EV → Check if you owe federal taxes → Yes → Look only at eligible models → Stay under MSRP cap → Confirm assembly location → Buy before expiration

You want an EV → No tax liability → Ignore credit → Focus on lowest sticker price or lease deal

Recommendations by Scenario

First-time EV buyer: Choose a new compact BEV like a Chevrolet Bolt EUV or Nissan Leaf—if eligible. Avoid PHEVs unless you lack charging access.

Family needing space: Target eligible SUVs under $80,000 (e.g., Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5). Skip luxury trims that exceed the cap.

Low-income or used-car shopper: Consider certified pre-owned EVs under $25,000—some qualify for $4,000 credit.

Tax-exempt household: The credit is irrelevant. Prioritize lowest upfront cost and reliability.

Red Flags / What to Avoid

Dealers claiming ‘instant credit’ without verifying eligibility

Models just above MSRP cap—even $1 over voids the credit

Leasing deals that don’t pass the credit to lessee

Old inventory marketed as ‘last chance’ without price adjustment

Ignoring your actual driving needs to chase the credit

This piece isn’t for keyword collectors. It’s for people who will actually use the product.

Price & Market Insights

Over the past year, the average transaction price for a new EV was approximately $55,614 3. That’s higher than the average gas-powered car. But after the $7,500 credit, many mainstream models fall into the $40,000–$50,000 range—competitive with comparably equipped ICE vehicles.

Prices may vary by region/model/seller. Incentives differ at state and local levels. Always verify current dealer pricing and financing options. If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: national averages are useful, but your local quote is what counts. Get written confirmation of eligibility from the dealership before signing.

Top-Seller & Competitive Analysis

The following models represent common choices among recent buyers who qualified for the full $7,500 credit. Availability and eligibility may change weekly.

If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: stick to models clearly under the cap and confirmed as eligible. Don’t assume brand reputation guarantees credit access.

Customer Feedback Synthesis

Analysis of recent buyer reviews and forums shows recurring themes:

Positive: “Saved $7,500 instantly at purchase,” “Dealer handled paperwork seamlessly,” “Monthly payment dropped below my old car’s.”

Negative: “Salesperson misled me about eligibility,” “My tax preparer said I didn’t qualify due to income,” “Chose wrong trim—was $500 over cap.”

When it’s worth caring about: if multiple buyers report confusion at a specific dealership, seek a second opinion. When you don’t need to overthink it: isolated complaints about delivery delays or minor defects aren’t credit-related and shouldn’t sway your decision.

Maintenance, Safety & Legal Considerations

Evs generally require less maintenance than gasoline cars—no oil changes, fewer moving parts. However, tire wear and battery health monitoring remain important.

Safety ratings vary by model. Use IIHS or NHTSA data to compare crash test performance. Never assume electrification equals higher safety.

Legally, the tax credit is subject to verification during tax filing. Keep all purchase documents, including manufacturer certification of eligibility. If audited, you’ll need proof the vehicle met requirements at time of sale. Verify retailer return policy in case eligibility is later denied.

If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: the legal burden is low if you buy from a reputable dealer and keep records. Just don’t discard paperwork.

Conclusion

If you need a new car, owe federal taxes, and drive enough to justify an EV, choose a model under the MSRP cap and confirmed eligible for the $7,500 credit. Timing matters—policy shifts mean waiting could cost you thousands. If you don’t owe taxes or are buying used primarily for low cost, the federal credit won’t move the needle. Focus instead on reliability, range, and total ownership cost.",https://s.alicdn.com/@sc02/kf/Hedb7b2f51b9b4b25aeaeafd8ba68fc45m.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 22:58:34.463484

""Defendants’ conspiracy [...] denied the State and Michigan consumers meaningful choices, raised switching costs, and eliminated competitive price pressure.""","Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a federal antitrust lawsuit accusing major oil companies and an industry group of colluding to ""suppress"" renewable energy and electric vehicle competition.

The suit names BP, Chevron, Exxon, Shell, and the American Petroleum Institute, alleging they acted like a cartel to restrain trade and block clean energy alternatives.

Michigan claims this alleged conspiracy has kept energy prices high and limited affordable EV options for consumers.

The American auto industry is in the middle of a pivot back to gasoline-powered cars after more than a decade of chasing a mostly electric future. Some observers say it's short-lived, driven by new tariffs and shifting regulations under the Trump administration. Others blame market forces and the fact that many electric-vehicle choices haven't been on par with consumers' needs.

But the State of Michigan is attempting to hold another group responsible for the downturn of EVs and renewable power in general: the oil industry.

Michigan's attorney general Dana Nessel on Friday filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell Oil and the American Petroleum Institute, alleging that the petroleum giants and their trade association ""have unlawfully colluded to reduce innovation and output (and thereby increase prices) in the Michigan transportation energy market and the Michigan primary energy market.""

The 126-page lawsuit alleges that the oil companies committed a ""conspiracy"" that has kept energy prices artificially high in the state and dependent on fossil fuels, while also working to undermine the American EV market.

The state is seeking a jury trial and unspecified financial damages tied to what Michigan consumers and the state government have allegedly overpaid for energy. It's also seeking a repayment of fossil-fuel industry profits.

""For decades, defendants have conspired with each other to forestall meaningful competition from renewable energy and maintain their dominance in the energy market,"" the lawsuit said. ""They have done so as a cartel, agreeing to reduce the production and distribution of electricity from renewable sources and to restrain the emergence of EV and renewable primary energy technologies in the United States.""

""These baseless lawsuits are a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America’s economy, and is actively reducing emissions,"" an attorney for the American Petroleum Institute told the Detroit Free Press. ""We continue to believe that energy policy belongs in Congress, not a patchwork of courtrooms.”

While Michigan's lawsuit is wide-ranging in its claims around energy sources and prices, it specifically blames an oil industry ""conspiracy"" for decades of slower growth around EVs, charging infrastructure and cheaper electricity.

Alpitronic EV Chargers

Photo by: Alpitronic

Among other things, the state accuses the oil companies of slow-walking charger growth at their fueling stations; deliberately delaying their own hybrid and battery technology development that they once helped pioneer; driving ""misinformation"" campaigns with “thinktanks, blogs, and ideologically sympathetic media outlets” that have undermined EV adoption and spread false narratives about renewable technology.

""But for the conspiracy, EVs would have reached scale years earlier and Michigan and its consumers would have avoided billions of dollars in overcharges on transportation energy,"" the lawsuit alleged.

Michigan has some of the highest electricity costs in the U.S. It remains home to much of the American automotive industry, which is now delaying, repurposing or outright cancelling many of the EV investments that have been underway for years. Ford, General Motors and Stellantis have all announced a slower EV rollout than they projected at the outset of the decade, and have more recently touted ""consumer choice"" as the reason for renewed investments back to fossil-fuel powertrains.

That shift comes amid a second Trump administration that has been overtly friendly to oil and gas interests. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump vowed to ""unleash American energy"" and eliminate what's been called an ""EV mandate"" instituted by his predecessor, President Joe Biden.

Trump has since rolled back strict fuel economy rules, sought to cancel federal EV charger funding and eliminated EV tax credits. Trump's own cabinet is also extensively staffed with officials who have strong ties to the fossil-fuel industry.

But Michigan’s lawsuit goes further, including claims of technology and climate data suppression that stretch back decades—and have since left people in that state without viable energy alternatives.

""Drivers in Michigan continue to rely on gasoline not because it is superior or cheaper, but because cleaner alternatives have been restrained,"" the lawsuit said. ""Defendants’ conspiracy [...] denied the State and Michigan consumers meaningful choices, raised switching costs, and eliminated competitive price pressure.""

While Nessel has said that this lawsuit is the first of its kind to target oil companies with antitrust laws, other states have sued the industry on climate-related grounds in recent years as well. Maine, Connecticut, New Jersey and other states have all filed litigation in recent years against various oil companies, typically alleging that the energy giants have misled and deceived consumers about the climate damage caused by fossil-fuel power.

One of their own is fighting back.,"Amelia Davidson, Kelsey Brugger",,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/democrats-climate-affordability-trump-00745597,"Now Democrats are increasingly showing they have decided it’s a losing message to tout the ways in which they’d curb fossil fuel production to thwart the most dire effects of climate change.

Talking about affordability need not negate the focus on the impact of climate change, she said.
“Democrats and environmental groups’ climate messaging for years has been crap, and so if you go back to that crap messaging, obviously it’s not going to succeed,” Whitehouse said.","In a later interview about his posts, Whitehouse warned these “climate hushers” have also made their way into strategy conversations on Capitol Hill. He noted he’s been present for some of them, which he described as “polling presentations made to the Senate Democratic Caucus in a so-called strategy retreat that didn’t ask about climate change … There’s this massive blind spot.”

In recent years, Democrats have been handwringing over the best messaging on environmental issues to reach an electorate that cares about “kitchen table” matters – and doesn’t uniformly consider the rapidly warming planet to be one of them. Environmentalists made a strong argument during the 2024 presidential campaign that the climate crisis should be a motivator in electing Kamala Harris — but the contest went to Donald Trump.

Now Democrats are increasingly showing they have decided it’s a losing message to tout the ways in which they’d curb fossil fuel production to thwart the most dire effects of climate change. Instead, they’re choosing to focus on policies that would lower energy costs and lean hard into affordability talking points embraced by Trump and congressional Republicans.

Whitehouse understands the importance of talking about affordability — for years he’s spoken about the climate crisis as a threat to the global economy.

His social media thread notes that people are feeling the economic burdens of climate change throughout the country, from home insurance hikes to drops in property values.

That’s the message Democrats should lean into, he said, rather than shy away from.

“When leaders don’t talk about something, enthusiasm falls among voters,” Whitehouse wrote in his post. “In politics, you can often make your own wind, or you can make your own doldrums.”

This is something Democrats are grappling with on Capitol Hill. Interviews with a half dozen House and Senate Democrats revealed how many are still struggling with how to discuss climate change, a problem they consider existential but that doesn’t register among voters’ top immediate concerns.

Some are talking nearly exclusively about competitive prices for clean energy — largely in hopes of beating Republicans at their own messaging game.

“My theory of the case is that the argument that I’ve been making for 30 years is finally breaking through,” said Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.), a former clean energy professional.

“The urgency of climate change means that we have to focus on it especially when it’s not as salient with the American people, if we are to be the leaders we claim to be,” he added. “But I think that’s largely a separable conversation from what is the best way to talk about it in any given moment, that has the most ability to move public opinion.”

Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who is on track to be the next Senate Democratic whip, has a similar perspective.

Last year, he removed “climate hawk,” along with other self-descriptions, from his bio on X. And during an event this fall affiliated with New York Climate Week, he said that “those of us in the climate community who are used to making a more broad argument about where we are in the sweep of history have to get comfortable making a more immediate argument that says the reason prices are going up is a deliberate policy choice of the Republican Party.”

Schatz said in a statement last week that he and Whitehouse were united in their ideas around “climate action,” but he also doubled down on the importance of affordability messaging at this time.

“There are think tanks and advocacy organizations that are dedicated to the proposition that climate action is incompatible with affordable energy, but those factional rivalries have been overtaken by events,” Schatz said. “Cheap is clean, and clean is cheap.”

Recent actions from the Democrats’ Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, or SEEC — of which Casten is vice-chair — have also focused squarely on energy costs and the ability of clean energy to lower Americans’ bills.

At a SEEC press conference earlier this month meant to respond to the last year of energy and environment policy under President Donald Trump, a roster of climate-focused Democrats spoke nearly exclusively about energy prices. “Trump lied; Energy costs are up,” read the main sign at the presser.

Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in an interview that Democrats need to focus on energy prices because Trump has used that as a justification for executive actions that bolster oil and gas.

“People, when they see the ways in which the energy policies that are serving big oil are hurting their pocketbooks, it makes it more tangible for why folks should care, in addition to the welfare of the planet,” Stansbury said.

Meanwhile, Republicans have picked up on the Democrats’ shift in talking points and have used it to their advantage.

“You actually see on the left, this debate going on right now, where a lot of people within the Democratic Party, they are talking about how they’ve lost the narrative, or the culture war, on climate,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on Fox Business this month.

Left-leaning thinkers and independent analysts have also argued that Democrats may have gone too far in following the lead of environmental groups they say were out of touch with most Americans.

Columnist Matt Yglesias argued in a New York Times op-ed that Democrats should not be hostile to oil and gas. Longtime energy expert Daniel Yergin wrote in Foreign Affairs about the “troubled energy transition” and the need for a “pragmatic path” forward. And Veteran Democratic operative Adam Jentleson started the think tank the Searchlight Institute to curb the influence of the “groups” on party positions, including climate.

Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce’s Energy Subcommittee, downplayed the notion that congressional Democrats were at odds over how to message on climate change. Talking about affordability need not negate the focus on the impact of climate change, she said.

“I think they are one in the same,” Castor said. “Take my community in Florida. We’re still recovering from Hurricane Helen and Milton and people understand that those storms were supercharged because the Gulf was very, very hot, very warm. And the rain was unlike anything we’ve ever seen. So they are trying to afford rebuilding their homes and paying their property insurance and also suffering higher rate increases.”

Whitehouse in an interview acknowledged some shortcomings to Democrats’ past depictions of climate change “as sort of a moral imperative, as an intangible thing floating out there, something that will affect polar bears,” but said the solution wasn’t to be silent in calling out the harmful impacts of fossil fuel emissions and the influence of oil and gas companies on Trump administration policy.

Ultimately, there’s only so much he can do to press his case. In recent months he has organized forums on climate change as the senior Democrat on the Environment and Public Works panel, toured red states to talk about rising insurance rates related to natural disasters spurred by global warming and said he has commissioned his own polling on the issue.

Those activities, plus delivering speeches and crafting social media posts, are among the limits of what he can achieve with his party in the minority and his colleagues making their own messaging choices.

He isn’t giving up.

“Democrats and environmental groups’ climate messaging for years has been crap, and so if you go back to that crap messaging, obviously it’s not going to succeed,” Whitehouse said. “But that doesn’t mean that the alternative is to throw in the towel.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F23%2F8e%2F20cab1e04de9922f36d8f44fe764%2Fu-s-congress-10611.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:00:36.261017

A tax credit is different from a tax deduction, which lowers the amount of an individual’s taxable income. Tax credits are often more valuable compared to deductions because they directly reduce your tax bill, dollar-for-dollar.

Tax credits can be nonrefundable, refundable or partially refundable. Here’s what to know when filing your taxes this year:

What is a tax credit?

A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar amount an individual can directly subtract from their tax return to reduce the tax they owe. This can lower the total tax payment or increase the refund amount.

Tax credits are more favorable than tax deductions because they reduce the tax due, not just the amount of taxable income, according to Investopedia.

Tax credits are available for a variety of expenses, including purchasing health insurance through the marketplace, paying for higher education and covering child care costs.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases and energy‑efficient home upgrades are no longer available for 2026, after their eligibility deadlines passed in late 2025, according to NerdWallet.

How do refundable tax credits work?

Refundable credits are paid out in full, and a taxpayer also gets a refund for any remaining credit that’s still available. Some taxpayers who aren’t required to file may still want to do so to claim refundable tax credits.

There are several types of refundable tax credits, such as the Premium Tax Credit, which helps individuals and families cover the cost of health insurance premiums purchased through the health insurance marketplace.

The Earned Income Tax Credit is for low‑ to moderate‑income workers who meet eligibility rules based on income and family size.

For 2026, the IRS increased maximum earned income tax credit amounts to:

Up to $664 for workers without children.

Up to $4,427 for those with one qualifying child.

Up to $7,316 for those with two qualifying children.

Up to $8,231 for those with three or more qualifying children.

How do nonrefundable tax credits work?

For nonrefundable tax credits, once a taxpayer’s amount owed reaches zero, they won’t see any leftover amount as a refund.

Some nonrefundable tax credits must be used in the year they are claimed and expire if unused, according to Investopedia. Others, such as the Adoption Credit, may be carried forward to future years.

Nonrefundable tax credits can negatively impact low-income taxpayers because they cannot use the entire amount of the credit.

How do partially refundable credits work?

Some types of credits are partially refundable. One example is the American Opportunity Tax Credit for postsecondary education students.

Under this credit, if a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to zero before using the entire $2,500 credit, the remaining portion may be taken as a refundable credit up to the lesser of 40% of the remaining credit or $1,000, according to Investopedia.

TL;DR EraNova Metals offers asymmetric risk-reward through its undervalued Ruby Creek molybdenum project in British Columbia, trading at $10 million market capitalisation against $30 million in existing infrastructure and a 433 million pound molybdenum resource.","EraNova Metals, a new name & new President & CEO Meredith Eades, has repositioned the company to pursue dual value creation paths through both development of its 433 million pound molybdenum deposit at Ruby Creek and exploration of high-grade copper-gold-silver targets across its 30,000-hectare British Columbia property.

The Ruby Creek molybdenum project, which reached full feasibility and environmental assessment certificate stage in 2008, represents significant embedded value with $30 million in existing infrastructure against a current market capitalisation of just $10 million.

The company completed a 1,585-pound bulk sample from the Silver Surprise zone that yielded a 14.3-ounce silver bar through simple crushing and gravity separation, with grades of 4,200 g/t silver and 95% recoveries, demonstrating potential for near-term direct shipping ore (DSO) revenue generation.

EraNova is working with Tetra Tech to advance the molybdenum project toward a preliminary economic assessment (PEA), updating previous economics to reflect current market conditions as molybdenum prices show steady improvement, with minimal additional drilling required due to comprehensive historical work.

Management is exploring various development options including strategic partnerships, joint ventures, and offtake agreements for the molybdenum asset, whilst maintaining capital discipline and minimising dilution, with a lean operational team heavily invested in the company working to advance both development and exploration objectives.

The global transition to clean energy and advanced manufacturing is creating unprecedented demand for critical minerals, with molybdenum emerging as an essential strategic metal for high-strength steel alloys, oil refining catalysts, and emerging green technologies. In this backdrop, EraNova Metals presents a compelling investment opportunity through its advanced-stage Ruby Creek molybdenum project in British Columbia, combined with emerging high-grade precious metals discovery potential that provides multiple pathways to value creation.

Under the leadership of newly appointed President and CEO Meredith Eades, EraNova has undergone a strategic repositioning that recognises both the embedded value in its molybdenum asset and the significant exploration upside across its expansive land package. This dual-path approach addresses a fundamental challenge facing many junior mining companies: balancing the capital-intensive requirements of resource development with the need to generate shareholder value through exploration success.

The Molybdenum Market Opportunity

Molybdenum, whilst less widely understood than precious metals or base metals like copper, serves critical functions across multiple industrial applications. The metal is essential for producing high-strength, corrosion-resistant steel alloys used in infrastructure, oil and gas pipelines, automotive manufacturing, and construction. As economies globally emphasise infrastructure renewal and industrial upgrading, molybdenum demand continues to grow steadily.

The current market environment appears increasingly favourable for molybdenum projects.

Eades noted, ""We've been seeing this slow steady uptick in the molybdenum price, and like any project, at one minute it's amazing and the economics make a lot of sense, and then the market completely changes.""

This acknowledgement of commodity price cyclicality is important—molybdenum projects that struggled economically during price troughs can rapidly become attractive as fundamentals improve.

EraNova's positioning within the molybdenum sector carries several distinct advantages. As Eades emphasised,

""We're a molybdenum-only project, which is quite rare in general. The metallurgy is quite simple. It's not complex.""

This simplicity translates directly into lower processing costs and reduced technical risk during development and operation. Unlike complex polymetallic deposits that require sophisticated metallurgical flowsheets and multiple product streams, Ruby Creek's straightforward molybdenum mineralisation offers a clearer path to production.

Ruby Creek: Embedded Value & Development Pathway

The Ruby Creek molybdenum deposit represents a substantially de-risked asset that has already undergone extensive technical work. The project reached full feasibility study and environmental assessment certificate approval in 2008, with previous owners positioning it for mine construction before commodity price weakness led to shelving the project. This historical work created significant embedded value that the current market capitalisation fails to recognise.

The project's infrastructure represents tangible value independent of the resource itself. With $30 million invested in roads, access, and site infrastructure against a current market capitalisation of approximately $10 million, investors are essentially acquiring proven infrastructure at a substantial discount. The 433 million pound molybdenum resource provides the foundation for economic assessment, with EraNova now working with engineering firm Tetra Tech to advance toward a preliminary economic assessment that will update previous economics to current market conditions.

Critically, the technical work required to reach PEA stage does not demand extensive additional drilling programmes. The deposit has been well-defined through historical exploration, allowing management to focus capital on economic studies and engineering work rather than costly drill campaigns. This capital efficiency aligns with management's stated focus on ""execution and being disciplined around dilution,"" addressing a key concern for investors in junior mining companies where shareholder value can be eroded through continuous equity raises.

Valuation Metrics

EraNova's current valuation metrics present a compelling opportunity for value-oriented investors. The company sits at a significant discount to comparable molybdenum developers trading at approximately 2.5 cents per pound of molybdenum in-ground,

As Eades noted, ""Compared to our peers, we trade at about 2.5 cents per pound of molybdenum in the ground, while some of our peers are five to 35 cents.""

This fourteen-fold differential in valuation multiples suggests substantial re-rating potential as the company advances its PEA and demonstrates the economic viability of Ruby Creek under current market conditions. This valuation gap can be attributed from the company's previous focus and market perception as primarily a molybdenum developer may not have resonated during periods of weak molybdenum prices. The recent management transition and strategic repositioning have not yet been fully recognised by the market. Additionally, the broader junior mining sector has experienced sustained undervaluation, with many quality assets trading below intrinsic value due to limited risk capital and investor attention.

The jurisdiction also provides meaningful value. British Columbia offers established mining regulations, reliable infrastructure, skilled labour availability, and political stability—factors that reduce development risk and support project financing. The Ruby Creek property's road accessibility further enhances its attractiveness, reducing both construction capital requirements and operating costs compared to remote projects requiring extensive infrastructure development.

Development Pathways

Management's approach to advancing Ruby Creek demonstrates pragmatic flexibility in considering multiple development pathways. Eades outlined several potential structures, the openness to various transaction structures positions EraNova to capitalise on market opportunities as they emerge, whether through traditional equity partnerships, production-linked financing, or strategic acquisitions by larger producers seeking to expand molybdenum exposure.

The preliminary economic assessment represents a critical de-risking milestone that will significantly enhance the company's ability to attract strategic partners or secure development capital. By updating the project economics to reflect current costs, commodity prices, and technical parameters, EraNova can present potential partners with a clear, credible basis for evaluation and negotiation. This positions the company to potentially secure development partnerships that provide funding whilst preserving shareholder value through carried interests or production royalties.

Interview with Meredith Eades, President & CEO of EraNova Metals

Capital Structure & Financing Strategy

EraNova completed a financing round in autumn that strengthened its treasury position to fund advancement of the PEA and initial exploration activities. The financing came together efficiently despite the loss of a significant intended investor, demonstrating market receptivity to the company's strategic vision. The participation of both existing long-term shareholders and new investors suggests confidence in management's ability to execute its dual-path strategy.

The company's capital structure benefits from insider alignment, with key team members holding significant equity positions. Looking forward, management's stated focus on capital discipline and anti-dilutive strategies addresses a critical concern for investors in junior mining companies. The exploration of alternative financing mechanisms, including the potential for direct shipping ore from high-grade silver zones to generate internal cash flow, demonstrates creative thinking about funding exploration and development activities without resorting to continuous equity dilution.

Eades confirmed active interest from potential partners, noting people that have been reaching out to get more involved. Whilst remaining appropriately circumspect about specific discussions, this acknowledgement signals that the investment community and potential strategic partners recognise Ruby Creek's value proposition. For investors, this suggests that value recognition may not require years of additional technical work, but rather the completion of the PEA and effective communication of the project's economics.

The Exploration Upside: Silver & Precious Metals Potential

Whilst molybdenum provides the foundation for EraNova's value proposition, the exploration potential across the 30,000-hectare Ruby Creek property offers significant additional upside that remains largely unrecognised by the market. This discovery potential effectively provides investors with a free option on exploration success, given that the current valuation appears entirely focused on the molybdenum asset.

The Silver Surprise zone represents the most advanced exploration target, with results from a bulk sampling programme demonstrating both high grades and simple metallurgy. The 1,585-pound sample yielded a 14.3-ounce silver bar through straightforward crushing and gravity concentration, with direct smelting achieving 95% recoveries. The grades of 4,200 grams per tonne silver, with even tailings material running 3,500 g/t, indicate robust mineralisation with potential for near-term economic extraction.

The three parallel veins identified at Silver Surprise extend up to 180 metres in length and occur at surface, enabling hand sampling of the bulk sample material. This surface expression and high-grade character raise the possibility of direct shipping ore scenarios, particularly as silver prices have strengthened substantially. Management is actively evaluating this potential, with Eades noting the changing economics:

""A month ago when the price of silver was $50, we discussed could we do that. Yhe conversation at $75 it makes way more sense, and now it's in the $90s. So it seems like something that would be a miss to not think about more seriously.""

Considerations

As with any junior mining investment, EraNova carries execution risks that investors must carefully consider. The company requires successful completion of the PEA to validate the economic viability of Ruby Creek under current market conditions. Whilst historical work de-risks the technical aspects, changing cost structures, environmental requirements, and permitting standards may impact project economics relative to the 2008 feasibility study.

Molybdenum prices, whilst showing recent improvement, remain cyclical and sensitive to global industrial activity and steel production trends. A sustained downturn in industrial demand could undermine project economics and limit financing options. Similarly, whilst silver price strength enhances the exploration upside, precious metals markets can be volatile.

The company's lean management structure, whilst capital-efficient, places significant execution burden on a small team. Successful advancement of both the molybdenum development pathway and the exploration programme will require effective capital allocation, technical execution, and strategic decision-making. Investors should monitor management's ability to attract additional experienced personnel as the company scales its activities.

Permitting and regulatory processes in British Columbia, whilst generally supportive of responsible mining development, can be lengthy and complex. Although Ruby Creek received an environmental assessment certificate in 2008, permitting requirements and community expectations have evolved, potentially requiring additional engagement and approvals before construction could commence.

The Investment Thesis for Era Nova Metals

‍Significant Valuation Discount to Asset Value: Current market capitalisation of $10 million represents 33% of the $30 million in existing infrastructure value at Ruby Creek, before accounting for the 433 million pound molybdenum resource. Trading at 2.5 cents per pound molybdenum in-ground versus peer range of 5-35 cents suggests 2-14x re-rating potential based on sector-standard valuation multiples.‍

De-Risked Development Asset: Ruby Creek's 433 million pound molybdenum resource benefits from historical feasibility study and environmental approval, with simple metallurgy requiring straightforward processing. Minimal additional drilling needed before PEA completion enables capital-efficient advancement, whilst road-accessible location in established British Columbia mining district reduces infrastructure capital and operating costs.‍

Multiple Near-Term Value Catalysts: Preliminary economic assessment with Tetra Tech expected to demonstrate improved project economics under current molybdenum pricing, whilst potential strategic partnership or joint venture discussions are actively underway. 2026 exploration programme targeting high-grade silver zones offers additional catalysts through bulk sampling or direct shipping ore scenarios.‍

Exploration Optionality: Silver Surprise zone bulk sample demonstrated 4,200 g/t silver grades with 95% recoveries through simple gravity concentration, with three parallel surface veins up to 180 metres strike length. Seven distinct mineralised zones across 30,000-hectare property with copper-gold-silver-tungsten potential remain largely unexplored, providing free exploration upside.‍

Strong Management Alignment: Key technical team members including operations manager and chief geologist work without cash compensation as significant shareholders, ensuring alignment with investor interests. Explicit focus on minimising dilution through exploration of alternative funding mechanisms including DSO revenue demonstrates commitment to shareholder value preservation.‍

Strategic Flexibility, Multiple Development Pathways: Management's openness to strategic partnerships, joint ventures, and offtake agreements for molybdenum development provides optionality to capitalise on market opportunities whilst preserving shareholder value. Active interest from potential partners signals market recognition of Ruby Creek's value proposition.‍

Favourable Macro Backdrop: Molybdenum demand supported by infrastructure spending, industrial upgrading, and high-strength steel requirements, whilst silver benefits from monetary uncertainty and supply constraints. Government focus on domestic critical minerals production enhances strategic value of Canadian molybdenum supply in stable jurisdiction.

TL;DR

EraNova Metals offers asymmetric risk-reward through its undervalued Ruby Creek molybdenum project in British Columbia, trading at $10 million market capitalisation against $30 million in existing infrastructure and a 433 million pound molybdenum resource. Under new CEO Meredith Eades, the company is advancing toward preliminary economic assessment with Tetra Tech whilst exploring high-grade silver targets that yielded 4,200 g/t from bulk sampling. Trading at 2.5 cents per pound molybdenum in-ground versus peers at 5-35 cents, EraNova presents 2-14x re-rating potential as it demonstrates project economics and explores strategic partnerships. The exploration upside across 30,000 hectares provides additional optionality, with potential direct shipping ore from surface silver mineralisation offering near-term revenue generation. Management's capital-disciplined approach and heavily invested technical team working without cash compensation ensures strong alignment with shareholders, whilst multiple development pathways including joint ventures and offtakes preserve strategic flexibility.

This past week, leaders came together at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and focused on three big things: the current state of American politics, the promise and peril of artificial intelligence, and the urgent demand for more power generation to fuel it all.

All of these things matter. But the environment, our natural resources and biodiversity were mostly absent from the discussions — except at Cox Enterprises.

It’s important to understand that not all of the bad news for the coal industry is coming by way of the EPA. While the CO2 limits for new coal and gas plants complicates domestic power generation, the global market for U.S. coal is softening. Up until several months ago, many people (myself included) were expecting U.S. coal exports to increase based on strong international demand. I wrote last year that even though domestic coal production was declining, significant amounts of U.S. coal (and carbon) were being consumed by European and Asian markets.

However, instead of expecting a record year of coal exports, U.S. exports are expected to decline by 5 percent this year.

Perhaps the biggest indicator is China’s announcement that they will ban construction of coal-fired power plants in three key industrial regions around Beijing, Shanhai, and Guanghzou in an effort improve air quality. The action plan from the State Council, China's Cabinet, also aims to cut coal's share of the country's total primary energy use to below 65% in 2017 and increase the share of nuclear power, natural gas and renewable energy.

In the most recent news, the country took a major forward leap after a previously delayed state subsidy agreement has now officially been secured. Ultimately, this means that the UK has received the go ahead or approval to move forward into the construction phase of its hydrogen project and advance its portfolio of projects that are looking to achieve decarbonization.

Understanding the impacts of ownership shifting in the green hydrogen project

Tax paying residents are not usually concerned with the complex issues that arise during the execution of an energy project. Instead, their main concern is reaping the benefits of the electricity or power supply once a project has finally reached completion. In the UK, agreements under the government’s Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR1) are expected to guarantee extensive revenue support that will permit the first phase of turning meticulous planning into a full reality. This is monumental for the European country considering that it is embracing something which it has not previously done in the past.

Much has been made about the UK receiving public support during its energy related aspirations, but what is an even bigger deal is how the agreement is set to initiate shifts in project ownership which investors are paying careful attention to. 2026 might be the year that the UK moves past the previous delays that have haunted its hydrogen production potential.

The United Kingdom’s green hydrogen project: Analyzing the role of the government

In most cases, the government is the only branch responsible for halting an energy project because private corporations require approval from it. Thus, when a government finally decides to play ball and take part in a project, countries along with their residents stand to gain massively. The UK government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) created a lot of anticipation and excitement after breaking the news that an astounding 10 green hydrogen projects have officially signed Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreements with the state-owned entity Low Carbon Contracts allowing them to receive long term subsidies. The agreed contracts are expected to foster a compromise between green hydrogen and fossil fuels.

Now investors may fully commit to strategically planning for the construction phase with more confidence that it will come to fruition.

Assessing the ownership shift in the UK’s green hydrogen project

The agreed upon contract means that the UK state will be able to support hydrogen production in a timescale spanning over 15 years. According to reports, the UK is sure that the current structure will foster private capital and significantly assist the UK in becoming one of the leading countries in clean energy.

New investors’ involvement is imminent in the green hydrogen project

Following the renewed government backing, it is almost a certainty that many companies will be seeking to benefit from it by becoming investors just as is usually the case in energy projects. For instance, consumer goods manufacturer Kimberly-Clark is set to become one of the first industrial end users to utilize green energy hydrogen at a high scale. The company has reached collaborative deals with other corporations such as HYRO, Carlton Power, and Schroders Greencoat, with the intent of securing investment agreements that will amalgamate hydrogen production with its manufacturing resources in Barrow-in Furness and Northfleet.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/21-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:21.484527

WA lawmakers want them to pay - The Olympian,Simone Carter,,,,,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/article314431886.html,"Washington state has sought to grow as a hub for data centers, but now state lawmakers are considering setting new requirements for them.
Data centers are physical facilities that hold various IT infrastructure to process, store and deliver data for various purposes including artificial intelligence, streaming services and online banking.
There are more than 100 data centers in Washington state, which ranks among the top 10 nationally, according to the website Data Center Map.
Yet 2024 reporting by The Seattle Times and ProPublica showed that the state’s courting of data centers has conflicted with its ambitious clean-energy goals.
Bob Ferguson launched a workgroup last year examining how data centers affect the state’s economy and environment.","Washington state has sought to grow as a hub for data centers, but now state lawmakers are considering setting new requirements for them.

Data centers are physical facilities that hold various IT infrastructure to process, store and deliver data for various purposes including artificial intelligence, streaming services and online banking.

Such centers can generate sizable revenue and job growth for the communities that call them home — but concerns have begun to bubble up about their implications for local electricity rates and the surrounding environment.

State Rep. Beth Doglio, an Olympia Democrat, is the primary sponsor of House Bill 2515. During a Jan. 22 hearing on the bill, she said that lawmakers are confronting the possibility of significant demands on the state’s water, communities and power grid.

”These policies seek to protect ratepayers by ensuring new data centers are picking up the whole tab for new growth, protect against stranded assets, ensure grid reliability,” Doglio told the House Environment & Energy Committee, which she chairs.

There are more than 100 data centers in Washington state, which ranks among the top 10 nationally, according to the website Data Center Map.

Washington has worked to attract more data centers to the state by providing tax incentives. Yet 2024 reporting by The Seattle Times and ProPublica showed that the state’s courting of data centers has conflicted with its ambitious clean-energy goals.

Gov. Bob Ferguson launched a workgroup last year examining how data centers affect the state’s economy and environment.

The group’s preliminary findings, released last month, suggest that the state has work to do when it comes to meeting burgeoning power demands. They also highlighted “potential impacts” regarding water resources, and recommended shielding ratepayers by ensuring that data centers foot the bill for full energy-system expenses.

Doglio’s proposal would, in part, set new requirements for data centers. They would need to report on their energy and water use, with new or expanded facilities meeting certain thresholds for using electricity from nonemitting electric generation or renewable resources. Data centers would also pay the Department of Revenue an annual fee to deposit into a new account, with proceeds split between energy- and higher education-related purposes.

A preliminary fiscal note projects that in the fiscal 2027-29 biennium, $46.4 million would be generated from the annual fee, legislative staff said at the hearing. That number is estimated to come in at $67.7 million in the following biennium.

Data centers in Eastern Washington communities in particular, including Quincy and East Wenatchee, have led to rising local property values, job creation, funding for public infrastructure and declining levy rates, the governor’s workgroup found.

The Tri-City Herald reported in November that the Tri-Cities has received three data center proposals in the past year, any of which would mark the first facility in or near that area.

Republican state Rep. Alex Ybarra said during the hearing that data center-related water issues aren’t a concern in Quincy, which he represents. Despite 85% of its residents living in poverty, the city is home to the third-cheapest electricity in the U.S., he added.

Logan Bahr with Tacoma Power/Tacoma Public Utilities testified in support of HB 2515, which he said would help protect consumers. He also said the bill would set clear guidelines for new large-energy users.

“These same principles guided Tacoma as we implemented our large-load rate in 2024 that ensures new high-demand customers are accountable for the impacts they have on the system,” Bahr said.

The measure also saw support from climate and environmental advocates who argued that the bill would help safeguard clean air, water and salmon. Others want to see data centers report on energy use to better understand the toll on the power grid.

By 2030, the Northwest’s power supply gap is forecasted to hit close to 9 gigawatts, sparking concern about potential energy shortfalls, McClatchy previously reported

Some in the business community voiced their opposition at Thursday’s hearing.

Peter Godlewski with the Association of Washington Business noted that Grant County saw a 131% spike in tax revenue between 2005 and 2024 thanks to the data-center sector.

Tom Pierson, interim president and CEO of the Tacoma-Pierce County Chamber, said past legislation authorizing data center tax preference for Pierce, King and Snohomish counties. Before then, a data center in Puyallup had sat vacant for 13 years, he said, but today it counts some $200 million in investments — with tax dollars returning to the local economy.

“Data centers are not theoretical investments,” Pierson said. “They’re proven infrastructure.”",https://www.theolympian.com/public/latest-news/t6dcx3/picture314433937/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Beth_Doglio.png,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:26.409035

It also supplies its own autonomous driving solutions for use in conjunction with its battery electric trucks.
In its 2024 Sustainability Report released in 2025, Zijin Mining stated that the Xinjiang Zijin Zinc mine had 250 all electric mining trucks undertaking 80% of the transportation tasks in the mining area.
In addition, the safety and operating efficiency of electric mining trucks have notable advantages over diesel trucks.
But ultimately, Zijin Mining is looking to have its own in-house captive electric mining trucks.","Zijin Mining has announced a major sustainability milestone – its total installed clean energy capacity has officially surpassed 1,000 MW. This achievement reflects successful grid connections across its global operations, including a 70 MW wind power project at Bayannur Zijin in China; a 23.87 MW solar project in the Democratic Republic of Congo; and a a 25 MW solar facility at Rosebel Gold Mine in Suriname. It states: “Together, these projects mark meaningful progress in our green and low-carbon development journey.”

Alongside expanding renewable energy generation, Zijin says it continues to implement comprehensive energy-saving initiatives, including waste heat recovery systems. As a result, by the end of 2024, carbon emissions per RMB10,000 of industrial added value decreased by 35% compared to 2020, while renewable energy now accounts for more than 50% of its total electricity consumption.

But the company’s net zero transition also extends to green fleets in mining. Since 2020, the Zijin electric vehicle fleet has grown from 13 to 1,183 vehicles, and Xinjiang Zijin Zinc in China it says has become the single mine with the world’s largest fleet of pure electric mining trucks. These trucks have included models supplied by Breton Technology, which is headquartered in Shanghai and listed on the HKSE in May 2025. Breton has introduced three main BEV mining truck models to the market. In August 2022, it launched a 105-t model, the BRT105E, which enabled heavy-load uphill operations. In the second half of 2024, it launched a 120 t model, the BRT120E, with a greater payload and the 135 t range-extended model BRT135E. It also supplies its own autonomous driving solutions for use in conjunction with its battery electric trucks.

In its 2024 Sustainability Report released in 2025, Zijin Mining stated that the Xinjiang Zijin Zinc mine had 250 all electric mining trucks undertaking 80% of the transportation tasks in the mining area. It added: “The energy cost per tonne kilometre for electric mining trucks is only about RMB0.177, compared to as high as RMB0.68 when using fossil energy. In addition, the safety and operating efficiency of electric mining trucks have notable advantages over diesel trucks. With fewer complex transmission components such as engines and transmissions, these trucks have a much lower failure rate than that of fossil fuel vehicles. Moreover, the simpler operation of electric vehicles reduces the risk of accidents due to operational errors.”

At this operation and at other mines, Zijin is also working with other major battery mining truck OEMs like Tonly, LGMG, SANY, XCMG and others. For example at the Zhibula copper mine, part of the Julong Copper Mine complex, Zijin is deploying 60 SANY battery mining trucks fitted with EACON’s autonomous driving system. On January 23, 2026, Phase 2 of the Zijin’s Julong Copper Mine project was officially completed and put into production. Based on the existing mining and processing scale of 150,000 t/d, an additional production scale of 200,000 t/d will be newly added to Julong Copper Mine, resulting in an overall production scale of 350,000 t/d.

At another major Zijin operation, its namesake Zijinshan gold mine in Shanghang County, Longyan, Fujian Province, the electric fleet has also been growing. By September 2024, electric vehicles accounted for 45% of Zijinshan’s fleet, all of which support both static charging and battery swapping. The battery swap station, built by Zijin Mining and State Grid Corporation of China and launched in September 2023, can service a truck in just 8 minutes and has an annual battery charging capacity of 12 million kWh. The fleet includes the new XCMG EX80 truck, on which EACON has also deployed its autonomous driving system.

But ultimately, Zijin Mining is looking to have its own in-house captive electric mining trucks. For the problem of slow recharging speed of electric vehicles, Fujian Longking, a company in which Zijin is the controlling shareholder (its stake recently increased from 25% to 33.76%) tailored a battery box and side battery swap system plan for the Xinjiang Zijin Zinc mine.

The capacity of each battery box is as high as 770 kWh, representing Zijin says the largest capacity of side swapping battery technology globally, with a swap time of only four minutes. Leveraging these advantages, Xinjiang Zijin Zinc restructured the roles of electric and diesel trucks to optimise their use within the remaining lifespan of diesel trucks, assigning the electric mining trucks to steeper sections at the bottom of the mine and diesel trucks to gentler slopes in the upper areas. “This adjustment gives full play to the best performance of different power vehicles, reducing diesel consumption at the mining site from 42,000 t in the previous reporting period to 34,000 t.”

This relationship with Fujian Longking has recently deepened, with Zijin working closely with the company for the development of next generation battery trucks for its own use, not just in China but globally. Xie Xionghui, a Vice President of Zijin Mining is also the Chairman of Longking.

In December 2025 the first all electric mining truck developed by Zijin and Longking rolled off the Longking production line in Longyan – the 140 t class LK220E. This was it says after only nine months of development.

Longking states: “The mines of Zijin Mining are mostly located in remote areas at high altitudes, and adverse conditions such as large day and night temperature difference, high cold temperature, and high temperature have brought severe tests to the stable operation of mine equipment. The pain points of difficult operation, large load demand, and high energy consumption have become key bottlenecks limiting the efficient and green development of the mining industry.”

It adds that its R&D team has gone through several rounds of research and technical arguments, with ‘stable power, improved energy efficiency, and strong safety’ as the main goals. “By customising a pure electric special drive bridge with high carrying capacity and large tonnage, it greatly improves energy recovery efficiency, achieves the precise adaptation of power output and high endurance capacity under large heavy duty work conditions, and improves the transportation efficiency of mines.” Longking has developed a two-bridge independent central distributed drive system, enabling flexible torque distribution and adaptation to mine conditions.

The core parts of the entire vehicle are made of cold, abrasion and vibration resistant high strength materials, which translate to good shock resistance in low temperature environments. The steering and braking system combine with dual safety redundancy to significantly reduce the risk of failure; The battery pack protection level reaches IP68, which can effectively guarantee the safe and stable operation of the vehicle through dozens of rigorous tests such as soaking in water, fire, simulated collision, extrusion, and thermal diffusion.

Its adds that the LK220E can achieve seamless docking with Zijin’s intelligent mine ecosystem, “marking a new stage in the R&D and industrialisation process of Longking in the field of new energy mining equipment.” At present, Longking on key technologies such as high-capacity power battery system integration, high-power drive control, and cloud platform computing power. “By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as big data analysis, AI-driven decision-making, and simulation design, we can optimise core strategies like vehicle scheduling, energy consumption management, and intelligent maintenance, accelerate the development and mass production of next-generation fully electric mining dump trucks, and build a differentiated, high-end, and intelligent product matrix.”

The statement pointed out that as a world-leading multinational mining giant, Zijin Mining has more than 30 large-scale mines at home and abroad and in order to accelerate the construction of green and smart mines, and at the same time solve the problem of the long-term monopoly of imported brands in the high-end mining truck market, Zijin Mining has clearly put forward the goal of building “a new energy independent equipment system.” This will see it use its more than 30 mining scenarios around the world as innovation test fields so that products can continue to be tempered and iteratively matured in real and complex working conditions.

Longking: “Relying on the rich scene support provided by Zijin and the equipment R&D and manufacturing experience accumulated by Longking for decades, the company’s R&D and industrialisation of pure electric mining trucks has obtained unique fertile ground and development advantages.”

Most significantly, Zijin’s Julong Copper Mine and Longking have recently signed a number of electric mining truck procurement contracts. Longking states: “The Julong mining area is located in a high-altitude and alpine area, with a working altitude of 5,300 metres, which will fully and comprehensively verify the product performance. With an average annual operation of 50,000 kilometres, compared with traditional fuel mining trucks, each model can reduce carbon emissions by more than 120 t per year, and the cost per tonne-kilometre can be reduced by more than 30%, bringing significant environmental benefits and economic returns to mines, and filling the gap in Julong large-tonnage pure electric mining dump truck products.”",https://im-mining.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9982.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:29.447225

A tax credit is different from a tax deduction, which lowers the amount of an individual’s taxable income. Tax credits are often more valuable compared to deductions because they directly reduce your tax bill, dollar-for-dollar.

Tax credits can be nonrefundable, refundable or partially refundable. Here’s what to know when filing your taxes this year:

What is a tax credit?

A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar amount an individual can directly subtract from their tax return to reduce the tax they owe. This can lower the total tax payment or increase the refund amount.

Tax credits are more favorable than tax deductions because they reduce the tax due, not just the amount of taxable income, according to Investopedia.

Tax credits are available for a variety of expenses, including purchasing health insurance through the marketplace, paying for higher education and covering child care costs.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases and energy‑efficient home upgrades are no longer available for 2026, after their eligibility deadlines passed in late 2025, according to NerdWallet.

How do refundable tax credits work?

Refundable credits are paid out in full, and a taxpayer also gets a refund for any remaining credit that’s still available. Some taxpayers who aren’t required to file may still want to do so to claim refundable tax credits.

There are several types of refundable tax credits, such as the Premium Tax Credit, which helps individuals and families cover the cost of health insurance premiums purchased through the health insurance marketplace.

The Earned Income Tax Credit is for low‑ to moderate‑income workers who meet eligibility rules based on income and family size.

For 2026, the IRS increased maximum earned income tax credit amounts to:

Up to $664 for workers without children.

Up to $4,427 for those with one qualifying child.

Up to $7,316 for those with two qualifying children.

Up to $8,231 for those with three or more qualifying children.

How do nonrefundable tax credits work?

For nonrefundable tax credits, once a taxpayer’s amount owed reaches zero, they won’t see any leftover amount as a refund.

Some nonrefundable tax credits must be used in the year they are claimed and expire if unused, according to Investopedia. Others, such as the Adoption Credit, may be carried forward to future years.

Nonrefundable tax credits can negatively impact low-income taxpayers because they cannot use the entire amount of the credit.

How do partially refundable credits work?

Some types of credits are partially refundable. One example is the American Opportunity Tax Credit for postsecondary education students.

Under this credit, if a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to zero before using the entire $2,500 credit, the remaining portion may be taken as a refundable credit up to the lesser of 40% of the remaining credit or $1,000, according to Investopedia.

Clean energy is reshaping countries, economies and lives faster than anyone expected.

Bangladesh has set a global record, electrifying millions of homes powered by off-grid solar, bringing electricity to rural families who waited generations for it. Denmark has shown how wind power can move from experiment to energy infrastructure backbone. The massive purchase by Pakistan of solar panels and batteries has helped the country walk away from natural gas as a strategic fuel. And the ban by Ethiopia on fossil-fuel car imports has sparked a rapid shift to electric vehicles.

These projects are proof that clean energy works at scale.

This is because clean energy now makes economic sense. Today, more than 90 per cent of new renewable power is cheaper than building new fossil fuel plants. Investors see it. Governments see it. Communities feel it. Clean energy is faster to deploy, cheaper to run and more resilient in an increasingly volatile world.

It is also creating millions of jobs. About 16.6 million people already work in clean energy worldwide, from manufacturing to installation to innovation. In 2025 alone, global investment in renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency and electrification hit $2.2 trillion, twice the amount that flowed into oil, gas and coal. For developing economies, this shift offers a powerful opportunity to grow without locking into costly fuel imports or outdated systems.

Energy is the engine behind nearly every development goal we care about. Without reliable, affordable energy, progress on poverty, health, education, gender equality, clean water, industry and cities stalls. In fact, an analysis across the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) framework shows that energy underpins roughly two thirds of all SDG targets, with 125 of the 169 SDGs linked to energy, either directly or indirectly. This is why access to clean energy sits at the heart of the 2030 Agenda, and why getting it right accelerates progress across the board.

Nowhere is this clearer than with climate change. Energy use produces about three quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions. If we do not transform how we power our homes, factories, transport and cities, there is no credible path to a safe climate. Clean energy is quite simply the solution. Without a rapid and sustained transformation of energy systems, no credible pathway exists to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century or to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.

There has been real progress. Nearly 92 per cent of people worldwide now have access to electricity. Clean cooking access has also grown, and currently stands at 74 per cent globally, improving health, saving lives and easing the burden on women and girls. These gains show what is possible when ambition meets action.

But the gaps remain stark and unacceptable. 666 million people still live without electricity and 2.1 billion rely on dirty fuels to cook, breathing smoke that harms their health every day. At the same time, clean energy investment remains slow and uneven. For example, Africa, which holds some of the world’s best solar resources, receives just 2 per cent of global clean energy finance. Many countries with the greatest need are still left waiting, perpetuating poverty, inequality and health risks while constraining climate action.

This carries significant economic risk. To meet global climate goals and deliver energy for all, clean energy investment must more than triple by 2030, and much of it must go to emerging and developing economies.

The good news is that momentum is building. Governments are renewing commitments. Global plans are being updated. Clean energy is firmly on the climate agenda. And 2026 will be a defining year, with a major global review of progress on energy access and sustainability.

Clean energy is one of the rare solutions that brings people together rather than pulling them apart. It cuts emissions while creating jobs. It strengthens economies while improving health and opportunity. It gives countries more control over their futures, and communities more power over their lives.

The International Day of Clean Energy, observed each year on 26 January, is a moment to recognize just how far we have come and how much further we can go. This day is our call to accelerate action, share solutions and build momentum behind a transition that is already underway.

The building blocks are in place. The technologies work. The costs are falling. And the evidence, from villages to entire nations, shows that clean energy delivers. What is needed now is the confidence to move faster and the commitment to ensure that no one is left behind.

The international community has a decisive role to play in accelerating the build-out of clean energy infrastructure, especially across the developing world, where energy demand is rising fastest and the stakes are highest.

By mobilizing concessional finance, de-risking private investment, and transferring technology and technical expertise, developing countries can undertake grid modernization, energy storage and robust renewable projects that will, in turn, expand clean energy access and strengthen economic resilience.

If we choose ambition over hesitation, partnership over fragmentation and action over delay, clean energy can become the defining success story of this decade. It can turn global promises into real progress, lighting homes, powering schools, fuelling businesses and protecting the planet we share.

A clean energy future is not only possible. It is within reach. The choices we make today, starting now, will determine whether it becomes a reality for everyone.",https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/field/image/2026/01/un71079981_dsc2395_.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:34.784157

QADIRABAD, Pakistan—Only a few weeks to wrap up a lifetime. The thought crossed Muhammad Imran’s mind and lingered as he prepared in November to depart the country with his family, perhaps for good.

Disheartened by Pakistan’s chronic political and economic troubles, Imran decided to look for a better future elsewhere. But the other, more immediate worry was less than a mile from his family’s neighborhood in the agricultural heartland of the nation’s largest province: a giant coal-fired power plant.

“We never felt comfortable here. This environment … it’s not just about us. Everyone here breathes the same air,” Imran, 33, said somberly as his wife, Asma Rafique, comforted the younger of their two children.

The couple stepped into the courtyard of their government housing colony, awash in afternoon light that glared against a wall of broken bricks and scattered weeds. The Sahiwal power plant towered over the neighborhood, a thick white plume rising from one of its massive smokestacks.

In 2015, as countries increasingly retired coal power plants because of their health- and climate-damaging pollution, Pakistan struck a deal with China for eight new ones—starting with Sahiwal. The logic was simple: Generate more electricity fast to end destabilizing blackouts in Pakistan, while producing a return for China as part of its massive infrastructure push across the Global South.

A decade later, seven of those power plants are running and Pakistan faces new problems. Ballooning debt from the energy complexes has jacked up electricity costs, fueling a surge in rooftop solar that in turn means less money to address the debt. Communities near the plants bear the brunt of the new pollution. And many regions still experience rolling blackouts, now triggered not by lack of electrical generation capacity but because the country doesn’t have the cash to fully run the plants.

China describes its Belt and Road investment campaign as a major win for lower-income countries long exploited by the West. But a number of the projects have harmed surrounding communities, an investigative series by Inside Climate News found. And in Pakistan’s case, the power-plant deal built on the playbook developed by Western companies operating in the country years earlier.

Imran and Rafique moved to Qadirabad several years after the power plant began operating in 2017. They and their children started experiencing lingering respiratory and skin symptoms and could get no explanation for the cause. For a while, before deciding they had to leave, they tried to spare their children’s health by spending weekends with relatives, some 50 miles away in a city called Chichawatni.

“We leave every Friday and come back on Monday. That way our kids get to breathe fresh air back in our family home,” Rafique said. The air in Qadirabad is so polluted, Imran said, that his mother, who has chronic asthma, cannot visit for even a few hours.

A pharmacist at the local clinic described similar experiences. “Half the patients who come now complain of cough or eye redness,” said the man, who asked not to be named because staff is not supposed to speak with the media. “It wasn’t like this before the plant.”

How a Coal Plant Landed in the Middle of Farmland

Pakistan’s electricity shortages have persisted for decades. But the hours-long rolling blackouts that started in 2011 and continued into 2015 were among the worst in recent memory, plunging communities into darkness, shuttering factories and stalling economic growth. Under pressure, the conservative Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party then in power scrambled for fixes to calm public anger and reboot the economy.

China offered one.

Its talks with the PML-N government for the multibillion-dollar Pakistan component of the Belt and Road, the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, included the slate of coal-fired plants.

Built for $1.9 billion by a subsidiary of the state-owned China Huaneng Group, the plant was one of many Belt and Road projects constructed by Chinese firms across the Global South.

Afia Malik, an Islamabad-based energy economist with the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, a government research organization, said the decision to rely on imported coal that Chinese investors found more viable than Pakistan’s domestic resource locked it into foreign fuel dependence and price volatility.

The terms of the contracts have caused even more problems for Pakistan.

The government agreed to pay the plant operators for 85 percent of the electricity each facility is capable of generating, whether that amount was generated or not, she said.

Pakistan already had experience with that “take-or-pay” structure. Pushed by the World Bank and other multilateral lenders to address electricity shortages in the 1990s with privatization, the country agreed to contracts with Western independent power producers that also guaranteed minimum payment based on capacity. But that threshold was 65 percent, not 85, Malik said. And even so, Pakistan is paying billions each year for 1990s-era plants operating at low levels.​

Both the older and newer contracts require payments in dollars, a further problem for Pakistan as its currency value sinks. All of that adds to the country’s “circular” energy debt, which refers to overdue payments from electricity users including households and businesses as well as transmission and distribution-related losses piled across the power system, impacting the government’s ability to pay power producers on time. That cycle has metastasized overtime and cannot subside without systemwide upgrades and reforms, experts say.

The International Monetary Fund said in a January 2024 report that the country’s circular debt stood at 2.6 trillion Pakistani rupees, about $9 billion in U.S. dollars, equivalent to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product.

Pakistan’s planning failures are to blame for the financial impacts of the CPEC plants, in Malik’s view. “[The] Chinese government didn’t ask us to take it. We asked them to come and invest here.”

Ayesha Ali, an associate professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences who studies electricity access and structural failures in low- and middle-income energy systems, said Pakistan missed a chance in the mid-2010s to build a more balanced energy mix.

“A slower path, but perhaps more sustainable … would have integrated more renewables,” she said from her Lahore office. She pointed to hydropower, utility-scale solar and distributed mini-grids as options overlooked in the rush to end blackouts.

In a written statement, officials at Pakistan’s power ministry said CPEC coal plants “largely resolved” the country’s blackouts related to insufficient capacity. But the government doesn’t have enough money to fully run those plants because the cost of fuel, its transport and related services are so high. That, along with problems such as climate-driven breakdowns, is driving current-day outages, the ministry said.

Pakistan’s rapid, citizen-led shift to rooftop solar—with inexpensive panels from China—is both a symptom and a catalyst of this dysfunction. As more households and businesses go solar, the country’s electric utilities have fewer paying customers, further worsening their financial troubles.

The Clinic in the Shadow of the Smokestacks

When the Sahiwal power plant project in Punjab province received approval, the region’s Environment Protection Department laid out compliance requirements, including routine monitoring to ensure air quality standards would not be exceeded. The operator was also instructed to promptly address complaints from neighboring residents.

But when some local community organizations raised concerns about the plant’s impact on public health and the environment, they said the operator didn’t respond directly but rather through Chinese media platforms, little-known forums and paid content, insisting that emissions remained well within limits and complied with local laws. The groups weren’t able to confirm that: Officials at the Punjab Environmental Protection Department in the provincial capital referred them to annual compliance reports that are not independently verified or even publicly available, the local advocates said.

The Punjab Environmental Protection Department and the office of the provincial minister, Marriyum Aurangzeb, did not respond when asked by Inside Climate News whether any emissions monitoring, groundwater sampling or similar periodic testing has been done as required. They also did not say whether they would make any results public or comment on whether the government has a plan to address public grievances and health concerns.

In the absence of public monitoring and compliance data, the best way to grasp the coal plant’s impacts is to visit the modest rural health center in village 55/5L, a short drive from the government colony where Imran and Rafique lived with their two young children.

Dr. Samir Baig, a young medical doctor posted here last February, said the facility has no reliable system for tracking illnesses over time, but patterns in the steady stream of cases jump out to him.

“I’ve seen a clear burden of skin issues, and a close second is flu and sore throat. I’m seeing this from the very beginning,” he said. Upper airway irritation is also common.

The clinic’s dispenser, who joined the staff several years before the plant began operating in 2017, offered a clearer sense of how illness patterns have evolved over the years, describing common ailments like skin irritation, congestion and asthma. “In my experience, the frequency of these burdens has increased, not lessened, since the power plant started working here,” he said, asking not to be named because he was not supposed to talk with the media.

The problems both men described, even susceptibility to influenza, are what decades of health research has shown a community can expect when exposed to the toxic particles and sulfur pollution from burning coal. Coughing, throat irritation, recurrent chest infections and asthma‑like episodes are noted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the World Health Organization and toxicological assessments of sulfur dioxide and particulate pollution.

At the village 55/5L clinic, handwritten pages in English and Urdu note the illnesses reported by patients and medicines they were sent home with.

In 2018 and 2019, the first full years after the plant began commercial operation, respiratory illness was the most common complaint noted in the daily outpatient registers, documents reviewed by Inside Climate News show. Many pages are densely filled with the names of villagers from the plant’s immediate vicinity.

Children under 5 came in frequently with acute respiratory infections and fever, while older adults showed up with wheezing, shortness of breath and other chronic chest complaints.

On several days in July and September 2018, more than half the entries involve breathing complaints. None of the handwritten entries discuss causes, pollution or otherwise.

Inside Climate News was also able to review the 2022 records. In July, August and September of that year, the forms record several hundred cases of “acute (upper) respiratory infections” each month, alongside smaller but persistent numbers of pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and suspected tuberculosis cases.

Only gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea and peptic ulcer disease rivaled respiratory illness in scale, and skin conditions like scabies trail behind them. Taken together, these reflect the infectious‑disease burden typical of rural Punjab, said a local health department expert who asked not to be named. What stood out was that respiratory diagnoses remained near the top of the list.

These clinic numbers are one of the few datasets reflecting health conditions near the Sahiwal plant. In communities exposed to coal combustion, public‑health experts typically watch for three early markers: persistently high rates of acute respiratory infections, more frequent flare‑ups of asthma and obstructive pulmonary disease and a noticeable burden of eye and upper‑airway irritation. All appear in the clinic’s registers.

None of that information can establish causation. What it shows are troubling patterns.

And independent research suggests that residents are being exposed to pollution that can harm their health. Findings published in the PLOS One journal in 2024 showed elevated levels of coal-related heavy metals in soil and crops across villages closest to the plant.

Plant operator Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy and its parent company, China Huaneng Group, did not respond to repeated requests for comment by Inside Climate News. The Chinese embassies in Islamabad and Washington, D.C., also did not respond.

Asked about conditions near the Sahiwal plant, Shezra Mansab, Pakistan’s minister of state for climate change, said Pakistan is “committed to environmental justice.” Provincial environmental agencies are responsible for enforcement but concerns will “take some time” to address, she said.

Locked in a Vicious Circle

Weak oversight isn’t limited to the coal plants’ pollution. A 2020 government-commissioned inquiry found that numerous power producers under CPEC “were earning profits far in excess of what was allowed,” with inflated project costs and contracts that “transferred most of the risk to the Government of Pakistan” and worsened the circular debt. The report urged officials to renegotiate the deals in the public interest.

As policymakers in Islamabad weigh contract revisions and early coal retirements, public officials and experts are asking why Pakistan didn’t learn from its expensive 1990s private power deals before locking the country into another exorbitantly expensive 30-year fossil fuel generation cycle.

Pakistan’s former climate change minister, Malik Amin Aslam, who was not part of the administration that negotiated CPEC power deals, sees those coal plants as a “big liability” and called the Sahiwal coal power plant “a project … done with criminal neglect.”

In a phone interview with Inside Climate News, Aslam said the plant “was clearly sited in the wrong place” and is “having disastrous effects on the people who are living around it and the agriculturists.” He said underground water sources and crop yields have both declined since the plant opened.

“It is the heartland of Pakistan and it has had disastrous results,” he said bluntly. Now the country is trapped in what he called a “very bad situation,” paying for power it no longer needs from multiple new coal plants as consumers rapidly migrate to rooftop solar.

Pakistan is negotiating to repurpose or retire some of the coal plants early, particularly Sahiwal, Aslam said. Both Pakistani business interests and outside experts say a deal to fix the country’s coal-energy conundrum would accelerate the country’s shift to renewables. But Aslam warned the talks will be difficult, given the “very luxurious” 30-year contracts to Chinese investors. “Why would they walk away from future profits?” he said.

Mansab, the minister of state for climate change, defended the country’s heavy dependence on imported coal while acknowledging planning flipflops underpinning CPEC’s power projects.

“Pakistan was in dire need of stable energy,” she said in a phone interview. The coal plants, she maintained, were built at a time when “there wasn’t so much policy … for renewables” and therefore were necessary. She did not dispute that the same projects are now at the core of Pakistan’s fiscal troubles.

Mansab also conceded that the planning assumptions underpinning CPEC deals did not materialize. The expected industrial growth “did not happen,” she said, leaving the country with more power plant capacity than it needed.

Mansab resisted calling the episode a failure of governance, saying the contacts reflected “global financing norms at that time.” But she acknowledged that Pakistan is now “relooking” at these deals both domestically and in discussions with foreign partners, including China. Without offering any specifics on timelines or possible terms of renegotiation, she said, “We cannot afford any more loans.”

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s power ministry is trying to address some of the structural problems that began with the 1990s-era power plants. Officials said in a statement that they have terminated five “redundant” independent power producers that predate CPEC, saving an estimated $210 to $215 million annually, and renegotiated terms with 14 others to save even more per year.

Davide Zoppolato, a researcher affiliated with Mapping Global China, which looks at Beijing’s overseas engagement, sees that 1990s privatization as the prelude to Pakistan’s current woes. China stepped into the policy space already shaped by Western lenders, he noted. In his view, China made a clear choice to profit from a vulnerable system.

“China was there to make money,” he said, adding that it’s not taking responsibility for the fallout.

Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged in 2021 to stop financing new coal abroad, but so far that has not helped Pakistan extract itself from CPEC coal plants.

Zoppolato said China is shifting toward a “small and beautiful” development model after years of frustration with corruption and instability in countries like Pakistan. But whatever the next phase of CPEC looks like, China now dominates both ends of Pakistan’s energy transition. It owns a major slice of the fossil generation fleet and is “almost the sole seller of solar panels” flooding Pakistan’s rooftops, he said.

That combination of long-term fossil contracts and reliance on Chinese solar imports leaves Pakistan more dependent on Beijing than before. “There’s no easy way out,” Zoppolato said.

What strikes Muhammad Tayyab Safdar at the University of Virginia about the CPEC coal plants is how the contracts maximized returns no matter how ill-thought-out any of the projects were. He said it amounts to 17 to 20 percent guaranteed profit rates, which “you wouldn’t get anywhere else in the world.” That means the investors have already recovered most of their investments, he said, even as Pakistan struggles to run the plants.

The Sahiwal coal plant, in his view, is a clear example of bad planning. The decision to build it in the middle of Punjab’s farmland “doesn’t make sense,” he said, but Pakistani officials wanted it near population centers to cut transmission losses.

He doubts Beijing will budge on restructuring or retiring Pakistan’s coal plants. “Why would they?” he asked.

What Was and What Comes Next

In 2022, Asma Rafique was posted in Qadirabad as a veterinarian at a government-run facility. The modest housing came with the job. What she didn’t realize was how difficult it would be to live next to the massive coal-burning power plant that shared a boundary wall with her residential colony.

Imran, her husband and a fellow veterinarian, had just found a job in Oman. Over the next three years, as he tried to find a good place to raise his family, he moved to Ireland and then to Australia, coming home every few months for brief visits.

Sitting in the courtyard of their Qadirabad home as the sun set on one of his final days in the country, Imran felt the weight of his family’s imminent move to Australia. They would escape the plant’s pollution, he said, but what about their neighbors?

“All the people living here, we are a family here. So I think about them as well,” he said. “It’s our collective issue, our national issue, so that should be addressed.”

It was beyond him why government officials approved such costly and dirty operations or why the plants are still running today. “I would tell them that solar and wind will be the cheapest and environment-friendly options. This will be my message for them.”

He wished he didn’t have to leave his parents. “Any expat would love to come back,” he said, adding: “I will come back.”

A few hundred yards away, the coal plant kept running, its steady hum bleeding into the evening and a trace of exhaust suspended over one of its cooling towers.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CPEC-Coal-Plant_11.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:00:44.260654

That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio, on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added, “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular and are doing better and better and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?///

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?///

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion-dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe,” Wakefield said. “They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada.”

American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and … like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV makers’ expansion? ///

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles,” Fiorani said. “And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile. The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers … and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable,” Fiorani added. “It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have.”",https://nsjonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26016745120320.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 08:58:07.304958
