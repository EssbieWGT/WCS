“Across the country, regional governments are demonstrating that bold climate action doesn’t have to wait for Washington,” says One Earth, a global network of climate researchers. “They are implementing policies that expand renewable energy, protect natural ecosystems, and promote regenerative agriculture.”

America Is All In, a coalition of climate-concerned states and cities, planned to send “more than 100 U.S. subnational leaders – including governors, senior state officials, nearly 40 mayors and dozens of city officials – to the climate talks known as Cop30 (November 10-21, 2025) and the UN Local Leaders Forum planned for the days before,” said Gina McCarthy, co-chair of the group and former EPA leader, according to The Guardian.

Another group, the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC), representing more than 180 U.S. House of Representatives members, “aims to deploy them in their ‘soft power’ role to promote climate action,” Earth.Org explains. “Although the 17 members of Congress who prepared to go to COP30 were forced to remain home to vote on the US government shutdown, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island did attend – the only U.S. federal representative in Belém,” Brazil.

“Whether the federal administration is in or out or lukewarm, the U.S. states have always been coming to the COP. And this year is no exception in 2025,” said Amy Holm, executive director of the Climate Registry, according to Earth.Org. “The U.S. states are here to tell their story of climate action, that they’re still implementing in their jurisdictions, whether it be clean energy, transportation, affordability, land use, all those things are going on in jurisdictions all across the United States.”

Some examples of states and cities leading the way include:

California

Chicago

Detroit

Massachusetts

New Mexico

New York

Vermont

Wyoming

California

California continues to lead climate change efforts. “[In] 2024, the state consistently generated more than 100% of its electricity demand from renewable sources,” One Earth notes.

The Golden State was also one of the first U.S. states to commit to the global 30×30 movement, which ensures data-driven, transparent conservation efforts. As One Earth explains, “California has allocated billions of dollars through conservation bonds and budget appropriations to support habitat restoration, wildlife corridors and Indigenous-led conservation projects.”

Chicago

The city has converted all 400+ of its municipal buildings to use renewable energy.

Chicago has also “established long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that guarantee stable electricity rates while supporting renewable energy infrastructure,” continues One Earth. “Moreover, workforce development programs funded through this transition provide training for local residents, ensuring equitable access to green jobs as part of the city’s energy transformation.”

Detroit

Detroit has achieved notice for its approximately 1,400 urban community gardens and farms. “These initiatives have been supported by progressive zoning policies that allow urban farming on vacant land, city-backed land banks that provide affordable access to property and local ordinances promoting community-led agriculture.”

Massachusetts

Massachusetts’ efforts have focused on reducing food waste.

“Since its initial implementation in 2014 and expansion in 2022, the state has increased its annual diversion of food waste from 100,000 tons to 380,000 tons, reducing emissions from food waste by 25%. By 2030, the goal is to divert 780,000 tons per year,” One Earth says. “The state’s success is attributed to clear regulatory requirements, accessible composting infrastructure, and strong enforcement mechanisms, including fines for non-compliance. The integration of food waste reduction into climate policy highlights how waste management reforms can be a key strategy for emissions reduction.”

New Mexico

New Mexico has “committed to an energy transition where we are a net zero carbon emitter by 2045, with a 50% reduction by 2035,” says Andrea Desiree Romero, a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives. “We’re doing a lot on the energy investment side, and we have a huge startup community in the advanced energy space. We have $1 billion in venture capital for new company investments in spaces that help us solve these problems.”

New York

New York has implemented a new law that decrees schools must be built far removed from high-pollution roadways and expanded “the state’s 10-year-old fracking ban to outlaw the process of injecting liquified carbon dioxide to pull gas from the ground,” according to a January 30, 2025, article in The Guardian. “Days after Trump’s election, [New York Governor Kathy] Hochul also abruptly resurrected a plan to enact a toll for driving in congested zones, and … pledged to allocate [$1 billion] to greening the economy.”

Vermont

Vermont passed legislation in 2024 that requires Green Mountain Power, the state’s largest utility, to provide 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2035 and places a 2035 deadline upon smaller utilities to achieve the same sourcing.

“This builds upon Vermont’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which mandates legally binding emission reductions to help the state achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,” One Earth explains. “To meet these targets, Vermont has prioritized investments in local renewable energy projects, including small-scale community solar and wind initiatives that keep energy dollars circulating within the state. Additionally, policies such as Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and tax incentives for residential solar installations have facilitated Vermont’s clean energy transition while ensuring affordability for consumers.”

Anaphite has developed technology that has the potential to make electric vehicle battery manufacturing cheaper and less energy intenstive.

The company was founded in 2018 by chemist Sam Burrow and physicist Alexander Hewitt after the duo met at the University of Bristol.

By 2021 the pair had applied their technology to lithium-ion battery cell electrodes and proven the application of their composites in dry coating feasibility trials with the University of Warwick.

The business has raised millions of pounds since it was established.

The latest cash injection is a combination of £700,000 in grant funding from Innovate UK Investor Partnerships: Clean Energy and Climate Technologies competition, alongside £700,000 of investment from climate-focused venture capital funds Elbow Beach and World Fund.

It is understood Anaphite will use the funding to expand its technology platform and further its commercial capabilities.

Anaphite’s chief executive Joe Stevenson said: “We're thrilled to have secured this grant support from Innovate UK and the matching investment from Elbow Beach, World Fund and other Anaphite investors.

""This enables us to attack one of the toughest technical challenges in dry coating – successfully manufacturing LFP electrodes. Once achieved at scale, it will be enormously valuable to the industry.""

Anaphite's existing DCP technology platform uses proprietary chemical compositing techniques to disperse difficult-to-mix materials such as binders and conductive carbons, attaching them to active material particles.

The company says the approach ""overcomes the limitations"" of other mixing techniques.

Craig Douglas, partner at World Fund, said: “Anaphite’s technology is broadly applicable across next-generation and established battery technologies alike.

""This investment will enable the company to significantly expand its commercial capabilities, accelerating the scale-up of its manufacturing processes and driving down manufacturing costs for the global battery industry.”

Jonathan Pollock, chief executive of Elbow Beach, added: “The future of driving is electric, so scaling up affordable, low-carbon battery manufacturing is essential.

""Anaphite’s technology has the potential to significantly cut both costs and carbon footprint for battery makers and EV manufacturers, and we’re excited to support them as they lead the way in this critical sector.”",https://i2-prod.business-live.co.uk/incoming/article30019175.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRIHB_270924-anaphite.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 06:00:14.702484

""You can’t think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.""
Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms.
Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.
“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.","The world needs a new approach to environmental crises threatening the health of people and the planet by adopting policies to jointly tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation and pollution, according to a U.N. report released Tuesday.

Those issues are inextricably linked and require solutions that include increased spending and financial incentives to transition away from fossil fuels, encourage sustainable agricultural practices, curb pollution and limit waste, the authors of the U.N. Environment Programme's quadrennial Global Environment Outlook said.

“You can’t think of climate change without thinking of biodiversity, land degradation and pollution,” said Bob Watson, one of the lead authors and a former top NASA and British climate scientist. ""You can’t think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.""

They’re “all undermining our economy,"" worsening health and poverty and threatening food and water security and even national security, Watson said.

Almost 300 scientists from 83 countries contributed to this year's report — called the most comprehensive global environment assessment ever undertaken — which was released during the U.N. Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya.

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms. But efforts to address those problems largely have been pursued through individual agreements that haven't made nearly enough progress, they said.

Instead, they advocate an approach that involves every area of government, the financial sector, industry and citizens and a circular economy that recognizes that natural resources are limited.

“What we’re saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,” Watson said. “It has to be done rapidly now because we’re running out of time.”

Global tipping point

The report lays out a dire future if the world continues on its current path.

Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases — primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil — reached a new high in 2024, despite decades of negotiations between countries to curb emissions.

Ten years ago, almost 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement with the goal of limiting future warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times to avoid or lessen the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.

Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.

What's more, climate change is a threat multiplier, meaning that it makes things like land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, who wasn't involved in the report.

“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.

Among other challenges: Up to 40% of land area globally is degraded; more than 1 million plant and animal species face extinction; and pollution contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths a year.

Adopting a comprehensive approach would be expensive, scientists acknowledge, but cost far less than the harms that otherwise could result.

The report says that to achieve a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and restore biodiversity, about $8 trillion in global investment is needed every year. But starting in 2050, economic benefits will surpass spending, growing to $20 trillion a year by 2070 and $100 trillion a year thereafter.

Nations also must look beyond gross domestic product as a barometer for economic health, because it doesn't measure whether growth is sustainable or recognize its potential harms, Watson said.

Environmental issues aren't the only things interlinked, Watson said. He also said governments, nonprofits, industry and the financial sector also must ensure that there are incentives and funding for renewable energy and sustainable agricultural practices, for example.

University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn't involved in the report, welcomed its emphasis on tackling issues across governments and society.

“We must do what is right, rather than what seems politically expedient,” Mann said. “The stakes are simply too great.""

International cooperation falters

Despite the report's urgent call for action, international cooperation is anything but guaranteed, scientists say — especially as U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to participate in many of the discussions.

Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax. He's promoted fossil fuel use, canceled permits for renewable energy and is abandoning automobile fuel-efficiency standards.

“International action and agreements are becoming harder and harder,” Watson said, noting that this year's U.N. climate conference in Brazil failed to “move in the direction we needed it to move” with stronger commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.

Talks this summer on a treaty to address plastic pollution in Geneva ended without an agreement, though a U.N. conference earlier in the year garnered commitments for funding to protect global biodiversity.

Watson said that the U.S. didn't attend the intergovernmental meeting in Nairobi, but joined discussions on the last day and ""said they didn’t agree with anything in the report.”

“Some countries might say if the U.S. is not willing to act, why should we act?” Watson said.

Still, he believes that some countries will move forward, while others, including the U.S., could fall behind.

Hayhoe, the Texas Tech scientist, said that she's confident changes will happen, because the stakes are becoming too great.

“It is not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we’re gone,” Hayhoe said. “The question is, will there be a healthy, thriving human society on that planet? And the answer to that question is very much up for grabs at this point.”

America’s energy future The environmental groups’ moratorium demand represents a pivotal moment that could determine whether AI accelerates climate progress or becomes a massive environmental burden.","Environmental activists just delivered Congress the most aggressive ultimatum yet against America’s AI revolution.

More than 350 pro-environment organizations from all 50 states coordinated a massive campaign demanding lawmakers immediately halt new AI data center construction or face the wrath of voters everywhere. Coordinated by major groups including Physicians for Social Responsibility, Greenpeace, and Friends of the Earth, this represents the most organized environmental assault on Big Tech’s expansion plans in decades.

The coalition’s letter warns that data center expansion represents “one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation.”

With electricity bills already spiking 21% since 2021—largely driven by data center growth, Food & Water Watch reported—environmental groups demand “a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities.”

Their math is intriguing: if current construction plans proceed, these facilities could consume as much electricity as 30 million households and water equivalent to 18.5 million homes by 2030.

The numbers

Recent analysis reveals AI’s environmental impact has reached crisis levels that lawmakers can no longer ignore. By 2030, AI data centers could annually produce 24 to 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide—equivalent to adding five to 10 million cars to American roadways, Cornell researchers discovered last month. Water consumption would drain up to 1,125 million cubic meters annually, matching the household usage of six to 10 million Americans.

Power requirements for North American data centers nearly doubled from 2,688 megawatts to 5,341 megawatts between late 2022 and 2023, MIT confirmed in January. By 2030, electricity consumption at data centers is projected to surge 133% to 426 terawatt-hours, Pew Research documented two months ago. Some residents near data centers have seen their electricity bills jump 267% compared to five years earlier.

Local communities fight back

The environmental backlash is already reshaping American politics in unexpected ways. A remarkable $64 billion worth of data center projects faced delays or cancellations between May 2024 and March this year due to fierce local opposition. In Virginia, a Democrat successfully flipped a traditionally Republican legislative seat by campaigning specifically against the burden of data centers on local communities.

The opposition crosses unexpected political boundaries. In Michigan, OpenAI’s ambitious $7 billion Stargate project is encountering significant resistance from local communities concerned about farmland conversion.

Minnesota recently passed comprehensive legislation introducing strict oversight over data center energy and water consumption, while grid operators warn that most planned data center construction will occur in regions already at “elevated risk” for reliability issues, energy analysts confirmed three weeks ago.

America’s energy future

The environmental groups’ moratorium demand represents a pivotal moment that could determine whether AI accelerates climate progress or becomes a massive environmental burden. Current projections show most additional electricity for AI data centers will come from natural gas, requiring a 10% to 20% increase in overall U.S. gas production by 2030, energy researchers warned three weeks ago. The pressure on local grids could trigger winter blackouts similar to Texas’s 2021 disaster that killed an estimated 246 people.

The stakes extend far beyond environmental concerns. Virginia’s primary utility company warned that average ratepayers could see power bills increase 50% over 15 years, primarily due to new data centers, Atlantic Council analysis uncovered five months ago.

As Congress faces this unprecedented environmental ultimatum, the decisions made in coming weeks could reshape both America’s energy infrastructure and the global AI race for decades to come.",https://assets.eweek.com/uploads/2025/12/photo-1732027912131-3a10677b8449.jpeg.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 06:01:09.356077

The project, developed under Basin Electric's Large Load Commercial Program, would serve as the foundation for a multi-gigawatt data center campus.

In October, the companies submitted an application to the Southwest Power Pool Expedited Resource Adequacy Study process to evaluate interconnection and transmission requirements, a key milestone in advancing the project.

North Dakota continues to attract businesses and industries seeking reliable, cost-effective electricity and robust energy infrastructure. With a planned capacity of approximately 1,450 megawatts, the proposed facility would help meet demand from large-scale technology infrastructure such as data centers. If successful, the project is expected to create significant job opportunities and generate substantial tax revenue for local communities, all while working to minimize electricity rate impacts across the region.

""Basin Electric and NextEra Energy Resources' collaboration reflects the Trump Administration's forward-thinking approach needed to responsibly support technology growth,"" said U.S. Department of Interior Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Leslie Beyer. ""Under Secretary Burgum's leadership, we are enabling data centers and other large-scale technology users to fund their own generation. This model supports innovation, strengthens America's energy security and helps keep electricity affordable for consumers – all while positioning the U.S. to lead in the global AI race.""

""This is a win-win for North Dakota,"" said North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong. ""We've always been a leader in responsible growth. By working with industry leaders like NextEra Energy Resources and Basin Electric, we're ensuring North Dakota remains at the forefront of innovation and powering America's growth – creating jobs, attracting technology investment and strengthening our communities for generations to come.""

""North Dakota is seeing strong interest from technology and industrial companies, and our Large Load Commercial Program ensures we can meet that demand responsibly,"" said Basin Electric CEO and General Manager Todd Brickhouse. ""This project, developed through the Large Load Commercial Program, creates the framework needed to serve new, high-demand energy users, like data centers, while insulating existing cooperative members from significant cost increases.""

""NextEra Energy Resources is excited to collaborate with Basin Electric and its cooperative members to deliver a cost-effective American energy solution that supports innovation and economic growth,"" said NextEra Energy Resources President and CEO Brian Bolster. ""This structure where data centers essentially fund their own generation, which we are using nationwide, and most recently in Iowa at our Duane Arnold facility, enables North Dakota to attract technology infrastructure, creating thousands of jobs and billions in economic impact.""

Basin Electric's Large Load Commercial Program is designed to reliably serve new, high-demand energy users while ensuring developmental and operational costs are covered by the large load that requires them. This structured approach allows Basin Electric to responsibly support regional economic growth and emerging energy opportunities while creating long-term value for its cooperative membership.

For NextEra Energy Resources, the potential project underscores its long-standing commitment to North Dakota. Since 2003, the company has invested more than $3.7 billion in energy infrastructure across the state.

My Green Lab’s newly released 2025 Carbon Impact of Biotech and Pharma Report details a significant step forward: a series of multi-buyer renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs)—long-term contracts that allow organizations to purchase electricity directly from new solar and wind projects.

These agreements represent one of the clearest examples of coordinated climate action across the life sciences. For lab managers, they signal an important shift—one that could influence the carbon intensity of lab consumables, reshape the lab supply chain, and strengthen long-term sustainability expectations for vendors.

New PPAs deliver substantial renewable capacity

Two major renewable energy PPAs are detailed in the report. The first agreement provides 563.7 GWh of renewable electricity each year and is estimated to avoid 393,795 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. The second PPA supplies an additional 245 GWh of renewable electricity per year and extends clean energy access across North America, Europe, and Asia.

In the life sciences, PPAs serve as a mechanism for companies to lock in long-term renewable power at predictable rates—an approach that helps decarbonize upstream manufacturing for common lab products. Together, these renewable energy PPAs deliver more than 808 GWh of clean electricity, supporting high-impact suppliers responsible for manufacturing lab consumables, equipment, and materials.

Supplier engagement strengthens emissions reductions

Renewable-energy procurement can be challenging for smaller manufacturers that lack the scale to negotiate competitive long-term clean-energy contracts. Multi-buyer PPAs help bridge this gap by pooling demand from several pharmaceutical companies and enabling suppliers to access affordable renewable electricity.

According to the report, more than 750 suppliers have participated in renewable-energy or emissions-reduction initiatives across Energize, Activate, and Sustainable Markets Initiative programs. These collaborations support supplier emissions reductions by offering:

Lower barriers to entering renewable-energy markets

Improved emissions performance

More consistent carbon data

Stronger operational resilience

Implications for labs and procurement teams

As suppliers adopt renewable-energy commitments, lab managers may begin to see:

Lower-carbon product portfolios

More detailed sustainability documentation from vendors

Greater availability of Product Carbon Footprints

Updated supplier scorecards emphasizing emissions metrics

These changes can support more accurate Scope 3 reporting at the lab and institutional levels and improve visibility across the lab supply chain.

Why renewable energy PPAs matter for lab managers

The expansion of renewable energy PPAs across pharma supply chains offers tangible benefits for laboratory operations:

Reduced embedded emissions in equipment and consumables

Clearer sustainability data for purchasing decisions

Better alignment with organizational decarbonization goals

Reduced supply risk as clean-energy incentives evolve

As the sector accelerates its decarbonization efforts, renewable energy PPAs demonstrate a scalable model for supplier emissions reductions—one that additional scientific sectors may soon follow.

EVXL’s Take

This calculator is Tesla’s latest move in a cost-transparency playbook it started years ago. Back in 2022, the company added a Charge Stats feature to its mobile app, showing existing owners their charging costs versus gas savings. That tool targeted current Tesla drivers. The new Charging Calculator flips the script, bringing the same pitch to shoppers before they buy.

The timing is no accident. With the $7,500 federal tax credit gone since September 30, Tesla needs fresh ammunition to close sales. Real-world data has consistently shown EVs beating gas vehicles on running costs, but many buyers still don’t trust the math. This tool puts hard numbers in front of skeptics. Whether it moves the needle in a post-subsidy market remains the real test.

Electric grids worldwide are being transformed by lithium-ion batteries. These large batteries store excess power from solar and wind sources. They then release energy during peak demand, reducing reliance on traditional power plants. This technology has seen rapid growth due to falling costs and increasing renewable energy adoption.

ANTOFAGASTA, CHILE: Lithium-ion batteries, which power everything from cellphones to cars, are increasingly saving electric grids around the world.

Batteries as large as shipping containers are being connected to power lines and installed beside solar panels and wind turbines. They soak up power when it's plentiful and cheap and release it when electricity use soars, helping reduce the need for expensive power plants and lines.

American researchers invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s and later showed that the devices could help the electric grid. But for a long time, batteries made little headway because grid managers and utility executives dismissed them as expensive and risky.

One of the first breakthroughs came about 15 years ago when engineers at a U.S. energy company installed one of the first lithium-ion batteries tied to a grid in a desert nearly 9,000 feet above sea level in Chile. Challenging conventional notions of how the electricity system should be run, that team helped prove that batteries could help make electric grids more stable and reliable.

The concept of storing energy was not new. Thomas Edison developed alkaline nickel-iron batteries largely for industry and early electric vehicles. Various companies tried other technologies like sodium sulfur, which have not gained much traction. And some utilities have long pumped water uphill so that later it could be sent back down to generate electricity.

Live Events

But those systems were relatively limited. The kinds of lithium batteries installed in the Atacama Desert in 2009, by comparison, are now being used around the world.

The rapid growth of wind and solar power and the rising demand for electricity from data centers are making batteries a necessity. They store surplus renewable energy for when it's not windy or sunny and maintain a balance between energy supply and demand.

Consider California. In recent years, state officials have often asked residents to use less electricity on hot summer days to prevent power outages. But there have been no such alerts since 2022, largely because batteries have allowed California to use its abundant solar power well into the evening. Over the last seven years, the state added 30 times as much battery storage capacity as it had in 2018.

The rest of the world has also seen impressive growth, according to the International Energy Agency, a multilateral organization in Paris. The boom was made possible by a stunning 90% drop in the cost of batteries over the last 15 years as new factories have come online. China is by far the world's largest battery manufacturer, but Europe, India and the United States have recently been increasing production, too.

""Batteries are changing the game before our eyes,"" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said recently.

A bumpy start

The use of batteries on the grid did not come easy.

A Virginia company called AES began testing grid batteries in Indiana, Pennsylvania and California as early as 2008, but U.S. energy suppliers did not use them commercially until two years later. The pace was plodding for a while.

""There wasn't the experience with battery storage,"" said Carla Peterman, a former member of the California Energy Commission and now an executive vice president at Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility. ""It was a bit of a chicken or the egg, where there wasn't enough on there to really say that this could be a big part of the energy system.""

But some Americans clearly saw the benefits of batteries. One of them was Christopher Shelton, an executive at AES, which owns utilities and power plants across the world.

He began to look into lithium-ion batteries when his bosses asked employees to pitch proposals for a ""billion-dollar idea."" Shelton said he thought batteries could reduce the need for power plants that utilities used only when electricity demand climbed to peak levels.

""Why would you build an asset that you weren't going to use more than 5% of the time?"" Shelton said. ""We were saying batteries should be an alternative to peaker plants.""

He first installed battery cells at a nondescript electricity substation outside Indianapolis, a city known for its 500-mile car race. His company later connected one in Norristown, Pennsylvania, at an operations center of the nation's largest grid manager, PJM Interconnection. The Los Angeles area was connected next, followed by a larger battery for the Indianapolis grid.

While his tests were successful, they did not sufficiently impress many American utility executives. The reaction was typical of an industry that prides itself for sticking with what it knows best: large coal, gas and nuclear power plants. Anything else has generally been treated as a threat that may cause blackouts.

""Utilities have long been skeptical of new technologies,"" said Leah Stokes, an associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies energy politics and policy. ""They know how to make a widget, which is a giant fossil fuel power plant, so they keep doing that.""

Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade organization, disagrees with that assessment. ""The U.S. energy grid is the world's most important machine, and America's electric companies are quick to pilot and deploy new technologies once they become commercially viable and affordable for customers,"" he said.

But even now, U.S. utilities in many states are reluctant to add batteries. A lot fewer large batteries are being added in the Southeast, for example, than in California and Texas.

Utility executives are not the only ones who are skeptical. So are policymakers and many ordinary Americans.

Some local governments have banned big batteries because of safety concerns. In May and June, a large battery complex in Monterey County, California, was destroyed in a fire that spewed smoke and harmful chemicals.

Despite that disaster, energy experts say many risks have been addressed. The California fire happened in a type of battery that most companies no longer use. And those batteries were installed in a power plant building where the fire easily spread from device to device. Most batteries are installed outdoors to reduce the chances that fires spread.

Testing it on the moon

Not much beside the odd desert fox lives on the desolate plateau in Chile where AES set up its battery project. The site is several hours from the two closest airports, in Calama and Antofagasta.

After landing, visitors have to drive at least four hours to the salt flats of the Atacama Desert, where workers collect lithium -- a key battery ingredient.

The AES camp is another hour away. It sits on a rocky, unpaved path, lined with busted tires. Although temperatures during a late spring and early summer day can reach the 80s, the nights can be near freezing.

""It was like taking the battery and testing it on the moon,"" said Joaquín Meléndez, an engineer who led the AES project there under Shelton.

In the early 2000s, Chile had an energy crisis because Argentina, its main supplier of natural gas, couldn't provide enough of it. That left Chile, which has no domestic fuel sources, with too little energy for its people and its copper, iodine and lithium mines.

Chile was forced to rely on power plants that burned expensive imported coal. But those plants could not be easily turned up or down, and the needs of Chile's mining companies fluctuated a lot.

That was where the batteries came in. While it can take a coal plant about 12 minutes to get going, batteries can discharge power almost instantly. By pairing the two, engineers realized that batteries could deliver the electricity that mines needed while coal plants fired up.

Meléndez worked 16-hour days for six months to connect the first commercialized lithium battery to an electric grid. That device still stands, though most of its tasks have been taken over by newer, more efficient and affordable units.

The project was immediately successful, helping keep the electricity system stable when mining operations caused surges that had previously led to grid failures and outages.

AES executives back in the United States kept close track of what was happening in Chile. And in 2010, the company installed commercial battery systems in New York and Texas. Two years later, AES began adding more batteries in Chile, including next to big solar farms.

Over the last decade, batteries have helped Chile use less coal. Last December, the country got more than 40% of its electricity from solar panels and wind turbines, up from 19% five years earlier, according to Ember Energy Research, a nonprofit. Australia, Britain, China, India and other countries have also been adding lots of renewable energy and batteries.

Shelton said that even he had been surprised by the recent rapid growth of batteries. ""We underpredicted how far the prices would fall.""

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.
They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.
Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Monday struck down President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,” James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump’s order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States’ largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,” she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,” Kennedy said.

The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,” she said, adding that the Trump administration “should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.”

But as Josh Siegel writes, Republican leaders will be grappling with a new hurdle on top of those that thumped permitting talks of the past: President Donald Trump’s assault on renewables.

House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), one of the party’s key permitting negotiators, has advanced a bill that would overhaul the decades-old National Environmental Policy Act without favoring either renewables or fossil fuels.

The SPEED Act is bipartisan, with seven Democrats joining seven Republicans as co-sponsors. But some Democrats want the bill to go further to unravel Trump’s recent attacks on green energy projects, while hard-line Republicans insist on an anti-renewables bent.

The measure is a test of House Speaker Mike Johnson’s ability to navigate the administration’s priorities and manage his slim majority on major legislation with the midterm elections looming.

To win over Democrats, Westerman included an amendment to hamper presidents from canceling energy project permits. That’s a nod to Trump’s efforts to shackle wind and solar projects — and to Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a move Westerman opposed in 2021.

But that could be a problem for the House Freedom Caucus.

Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) has said he wants the bill to be “amended to protect our communities from the harmful expansion of offshore wind.” And Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who once urged Trump to immediately end clean energy tax credits, has raised concerns about the SPEED Act, saying he doesn’t want to “fast-track any of the wind and solar.”

Some Democrats are also unpersuaded by Westerman’s proposal. They want language that would not just prevent the president from hobbling wind and solar projects in the future but also reverse Trump’s recent decisions attacking renewables.

Westerman told Josh he had consulted the White House about his compromise. But so far, the president has been mum on the SPEED Act publicly.

Former Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican from Louisiana who was involved in previous permitting negotiations, said Westerman had done as well as he could to keep the bill bipartisan.

“You can take a bill and you can write it in a way that only represents the views of the Freedom Caucus,” Graves said. “But we all know exactly what happens when it gets over to the Senate. They will end up shoving something down the House’s throat.”

More permitting fights loom, including a demand from Republicans for soften Clean Water Act rules to ease pipeline approvals.

Democrats will also be looking to boost electricity transmission, because a shift away from fossil fuels would need massive upgrades to the grid.

“I don’t understand how you can call something permitting reform and not deal with the main problem,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told Josh. “If we want electrons of all kinds to be flowing and we want prices to go down, we have to deal with the main bottle[neck], which is that we have a transmission and distribution system that is from the Dark Ages.”

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Benjamin Storrow breaks down the increasing volatility of power markets in the U.S.

Power Centers

More power to the president?

A majority of Supreme Court justices appear ready to limit the independence of agencies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, writes Niina H. Farah.

At oral arguments today in Trump v. Slaughter, the justices weighed whether the president has the authority to fire heads of independent agencies. The case centers on Trump’s decision earlier this year to remove Rebecca Slaughter from her position on the Federal Trade Commission.

The 1935 ruling Humphrey’s Executor v. United States only allows “for cause” removals for heads of such agencies. But the Trump administration is arguing that the president should have authority to remove agency heads who are exercising executive power.

Those arguments seemed to find purchase with the court’s conservative majority. But the court’s liberal wing warned against the risks of increasing presidential power.

Coal continues in ‘reliability pickle’

An older unit at a coal-fired power plant in Colorado is staying open past its planned retirement this year while a newer unit gets repairs, Benjamin Storrow writes.

The move has implications for Colorado’s goal of cutting 50 percent of climate pollution at 2005 levels by 2030. The Comanche Generating Station is one of the state’s biggest climate contributors. State regulators planned to gradually phase out the plant’s three turbines, and the first one closed in 2022.

When regulators approved the request to extend the unit’s life last week, they had harsh words for Xcel Energy, the unit’s largest owner, for failing to outline costs associated with fixing the broken unit.

“We are in the dark about what any of this costs. We are just in a real reliability pickle because once again Unit Three has broken in a catastrophic way,” said Commissioner Megan Gilman.

The mystery of data center water use

States facing drought are starting to worry about data center water use, writes Miranda Willson.

Lawmakers from at least eight states have introduced legislation this year to require data centers to report their water use. The push for transparency has scrambled traditional partisan alliances.

Democratic Govs. Phil Murphy of New Jersey and Gavin Newsom of California vetoed bills requiring data center water use reporting, while Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill that would have authorized local governments to evaluate data center noise, water and land-use impacts.

Data centers gobble up massive amounts of electricity, but their water use is generally less clear and depends on the design of the facility. Federal laws like the Clean Water Act do not regulate water quantity, resulting in a patchwork of state policies for large water users.

The delegation argues that Indiana’s manufacturing power, military infrastructure, and academic research capabilities make it an ideal location for the expansion of the federal UAS Test Site Program.

Indiana Delegation Unites Behind FAA Test Site Bid

The support letter, signed by every member of Indiana’s congressional delegation including Congresswoman Erin Houchin, emphasizes that Indiana is positioned to help the FAA integrate drones into the national airspace system while advancing American-built drone technology.

Lawmakers highlighted Indiana’s central location, diverse testing environments, and strong state and federal backing as key advantages. They said the state could deliver the “best outcomes for American leadership in drone manufacturing and deployment.”

Their push builds on the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which authorized two additional UAS test sites beyond the seven that already exist across Alaska, North Dakota, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Texas, and Virginia.

Why Indiana Thinks It Can Lead America’s Drone Future

Indiana’s pitch is built on a mix of industrial capability, academic expertise, and military infrastructure.

The state already hosts the Technology Readiness and Experimentation initiative at Camp Atterbury, a major hub where the military tests advanced UAS and counter-UAS technology. In 2025, the site demonstrated a system capable of neutralizing a swarm of forty-nine drones with a single electromagnetic pulse, a milestone in U.S. counter-drone defense.

Muscatatuck Urban Training Center offers additional restricted airspace for complex testing scenarios, while NSWC Crane continues to expand its role in counter-UAS development.

Purdue University brings deep academic strength to the proposal with the nation’s first university-owned airport, the world’s largest indoor motion-capture facility, and research programs dedicated to drone safety and airspace integration.

The Applied Research Institute, one of the state’s major consortium managers, supports projects that link industry, defense, and academia. Its involvement is expected to help coordinate large-scale drone R&D and manufacturing across Indiana.

At the state level, Governor Mike Braun’s recent executive order created the Indiana Initiative for Drone Dominance Task Force.

The task force is developing a statewide strategy to strengthen drone manufacturing, improve public-safety drone operations, establish new aerial test corridors, and expand counter-UAS capabilities. Senator Young collaborated closely on the initiative and says it positions Indiana to match federal priorities.

What an FAA Test Site Would Mean for Hoosiers and the U.S.

If Indiana is selected, the state would become a central hub for drone research, testing, and manufacturing at a time when the U.S. is seeking to reduce its dependence on foreign-made drones.

Lawmakers argue that Indiana could help restore American drone dominance by supporting everything from defense applications to agriculture, infrastructure inspection, and public-safety operations.

The FAA would gain a new partner capable of testing detect-and-avoid systems, command-and-control links, beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations, airworthiness standards, and urban air-mobility technologies. Indiana universities and manufacturers would gain access to federal research grants, experimental airworthiness approvals, and expanded testing infrastructure.

The state also plans to create an aerial test corridor connecting Camp Atterbury, Muscatatuck, and NSWC Crane. New training pipelines would prepare Hoosiers for drone engineering, manufacturing, maintenance, and public-safety operations, supporting a share of the North American drone market, which could reach fifty-nine billion dollars by 2030.

Supporters say the effort aligns with President Trump’s executive orders on restoring American drone leadership and strengthening domestic airspace security. They argue that Indiana’s manufacturing workforce, military assets, and universities position the state to scale drone production and deliver new technology across the country.

DroneXL’s Take

Indiana is setting itself up as a serious contender for one of the two new FAA test sites. The combination of manufacturing strength, military testing ranges, and academic capability gives the state a compelling case.

If approved, the site could accelerate America’s move away from foreign-built drones and position the Midwest as a new center for U.S. drone innovation.

Judge Patti B. Saris of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts wrote that Trump’s executive order banning leasing of federal lands and waters for new wind farms is “arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.”

Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, DC, filed a lawsuit in May against the memorandum halting federal approvals of wind energy development, which was supported by industry and public interest groups.

The Attorneys general claimed that the halt “harms the States’ efforts to secure reliable, diversified, and affordable sources of energy to meet the ever-increasing demand for electricity; their billions of dollars in investments in supply chains, workforce development, and wind-industry-related infrastructure, including transmission upgrades; and their statutory- and policy-based efforts to protect public health and welfare from harmful air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, as well as greenhouse-gas emissions.”

Because of Trump’s ban, at least seven offshore wind farms in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic have been paused, as well as several others at earlier stages of development. Offshore wind has been a crucial part of the Northeastern states’ plans to transition to renewables, due to their geography and the plentiful wind in the winter. The region also heavily relies on natural gas, which is subject to price fluctuations.

Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel, US Clean Energy at Environmental Defense Fund, said, “We should not be kneecapping America’s largest source of renewable power, especially when we need more cheap, homegrown electricity. Striking down this unlawful ban gives relief to the communities and workers who need affordable power, local investment and jobs from wind projects that have been stuck in limbo.”

As a result of the Trump administration’s “arbitrary” policies, BloombergNEF reduced its forecast of new offshore wind power coming online by 2035 by 56%. And while the ruling is good news for the wind industry, it doesn’t mean the federal government is required to approve projects. And let’s face it: Foreign renewable companies aren’t exactly going to come running back to the US to do business.

National research effort to build Australia’s sovereign clean energy future

The University of Wollongong (UOW) will lead a new Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Renewable Fuels, a landmark national collaboration that will position Australia as a global leader in the clean energy transition.

The Centre will bring together world-class researchers from seven Australian universities with 16 industry and international partners to develop next-generation renewable fuel technologies and build Australia’s clean energy production capability.

Led by ARC Industry Laureate Distinguished Professor Gerry Swiegers (pictured above), the Centre will accelerate the shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy powered by renewables including green hydrogen, green ammonia and green methanol.

“Our vision is to make Australia a world leader in renewable fuels, driving our transition from a major exporter of fossil fuels to the world’s leading exporter of renewable energy. This Centre will deliver the technologies needed to achieve that while training a new generation of researchers and engineers,” Professor Swiegers said.

The $72 million initiative will unite expertise in chemical and materials engineering, electrochemistry and energy systems to design and scale technologies for producing and processing renewable fuels. Economists, social scientists and community and policy experts will develop a roadmap for integrating the technology into industry and the Australian economy.

Its three research themes – Make It, Process It and Integrate It – will tackle the challenge from every angle, from large-scale production and processing to economic competitiveness, safety and community engagement to policy and regulation.

“Our research will underpin new industries and jobs, strengthen national energy independence and decarbonise sectors that cannot easily be electrified, such as steelmaking, shipping and aviation. It will enable Australia to export renewable fuels and green products, ensuring prosperity while reducing emissions,” Professor Swiegers said.

Many wind developers could also be reluctant to submit additional projects for federal permits under Mr. Trump, the analysts wrote.

In September, the White House took the extraordinary step of instructing a half-dozen agencies to draft plans to thwart the country’s offshore wind industry as it intensified its attack on wind energy.","A federal judge on Monday struck down President Trump’s halt on approvals of all wind power projects on federal lands and waters, dealing a significant legal setback to the administration’s campaign against wind farms.

Judge Patti B. Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts wrote that the president’s sweeping executive order, which halted all leasing of public lands and waters for new wind projects, was “arbitrary and capricious,” violating federal law.

Judge Saris, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, said the Interior Department had not provided a “reasoned explanation” of its decision to stop approving wind projects, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. Instead, she said, the “agency defendants candidly concede that the sole factor they considered in deciding to stop issuing permits was the president’s direction to do so.”

Mr. Trump, a longtime critic of wind power, issued the executive order on his first day back in office in January. At the time, states like Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York had been planning to build more than a dozen large wind farms in the Atlantic Ocean to meet their renewable energy goals.

The order effectively put a stop to many of those efforts. At the moment, one offshore wind farm has been completed and five more are under construction in U.S. coastal waters. But developers have been unable to receive permits for additional wind farms, and some planned projects have been canceled altogether.

The directive also stymied wind farms on federal land. In particular, it prohibited the development of the Lava Ridge Wind Project, a large wind farm in Idaho that the Biden administration had approved.

Led by New York, a coalition of 17 states and the District of Columbia challenged the executive order in court in May. They were joined by the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Albany, N.Y.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, said in a statement that the decision was “a major victory for our state and the entire region” that would protect “thousands of good-paying jobs” supporting the offshore wind sector.

Asked about the ruling, Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email that the Biden administration had given offshore wind projects “unfair, preferential treatment while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.” She said that Mr. Trump’s executive order, had it remained in effect, would have spurred federal agencies to study whether offshore wind projects were raising energy costs for American families.

Matthew Nies, a spokesman for the Justice Department, declined to comment on whether the agency would appeal the ruling.

But even if the decision withstands a challenge, it could have a limited impact, according to a research note by analysts at ClearView Energy Partners, a consulting firm. That’s because the courts typically cannot compel federal agencies to approve new projects. Many wind developers could also be reluctant to submit additional projects for federal permits under Mr. Trump, the analysts wrote.

In addition to the freeze on new permits for wind farms, the Trump administration has sought to revoke permits that were issued by the Biden administration for wind farms off Maryland and Massachusetts. It has also attempted to halt construction of two wind farms that were already partly built, including Empire Wind off Long Island and Revolution Wind off Rhode Island.

Those efforts have also faced pushback from the courts: In September, a federal judge issued a preliminary ruling that construction could restart at Revolution Wind, saying that the administration’s stop-work order threatened “irreparable harm” to its developer. (The Trump administration has also allowed work at Empire Wind to restart after negotiations with Ms. Hochul.)

Mr. Trump has disparaged wind power ever since he failed 14 years ago to stop an offshore wind farm visible from one of his golf courses in Scotland. He has called wind turbines ugly, expensive and inefficient. He railed against renewable energy during his presidential campaign last year, when he also promised oil and gas executives that he would make policy changes that would help their industry, such as rolling back environmental rules.

In September, the White House took the extraordinary step of instructing a half-dozen agencies to draft plans to thwart the country’s offshore wind industry as it intensified its attack on wind energy.

U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston sided with a group of 17 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia in finding that agencies had failed to sufficiently explain why they had indefinitely paused all federal approvals of wind-energy projects.

Saris, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, said an indefinite halt on issuing or denying all authorizations related to wind projects violates a statutory requirement that agencies proceed to conclude matters presented to them ""within a reasonable time.""

The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, had been implementing a directive Trump made on his first day back in office to halt offshore wind lease sales and stop issuing permits, leases and loans for both onshore and offshore wind projects.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose state led the legal challenge, called the ruling ""a big victory in our fight to keep tackling the climate crisis"" in a social media post.

Interior Department and White House officials were not immediately available for comment.

An offshore wind energy trade group welcomed the ruling.

""Overturning the unlawful blanket halt to offshore wind permitting activities is needed to achieve our nation's energy and economic priorities of bringing more power online quickly, improving grid reliability, and driving billions of new American steel manufacturing and shipbuilding investments,"" Oceantic Network CEO Liz Burdock said in a statement.

Trump has sought to boost government support for fossil fuels and maximize output in the United States, the world's top oil and gas producer, after campaigning for the presidency on the refrain of ""drill, baby, drill.""

The states, led by New York, sued in May, after the Interior Department ordered Norway's Equinor to halt construction on its Empire Wind offshore wind project off the coast of New York. While the administration allowed work on Empire Wind to resume, the states say the broader pause on permitting and leasing continues to have harmful economic effects.

The states said the agencies implementing Trump's order never explained why they abruptly changed a longstanding policy supporting wind energy development. The agencies also departed from the government's findings that wind projects can proceed with minimal adverse environmental impacts, the states said.

Saris agreed, saying the policy ""constitutes a change of course from decades of agencies' issuing (or denying) permits related to wind energy projects."" She said the agencies never provided a reasoned explanation for adopting the change.

Zoox, the robotaxi startup owned by Amazon, has expanded a bit recently, and it is ready to scale up enough that it has secured an EV battery supplier for more EV production.

Starting in early 2026, Zoox will be receiving batteries from Panasonic Energy. It will be using 2170 cylindrical batteries from the Japanese battery producer that was once Tesla’s exclusive battery supplier (and still supplies some of Tesla’s batteries).

The cells will initially come from Japan, but the plan is to eventually produce them in Kansas. Note that while the Trump administration has killed all of the EV subsidies for consumers, it has not (yet) touched the battery production tax credits Democrats and President Joe Biden passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Those include tax credits for producing battery cells as well as battery packs (and also battery mineral mining and processing if a company engages in those activities in the USA).

Note that Zoox recently started operating robotaxis in San Francisco, joining Waymo as the second robotaxi operator in The Golden City (unless you also count Cruise, which used to operate robotaxis there but no longer does).

The company was also “issued an exemption for Zoox driverless vehicles under its newly expanded Automated Vehicle Exemption Program” a few months ago by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “This is the first-ever exemption for American-built vehicles under the program.”

The executive order had brought the nearly completed Revolution Wind project—one of the largest offshore wind initiatives in the country—to a standstill, threatening jobs, billions in investment and regional energy targets.

Trump has assailed wind farms and renewable energy sources in recent comments, while promoting reopening mines and other energy sources in the U.S.

The court vacated the wind order on the basis that it was unlawful.

Why It Matters

The federal ruling marks a pivotal moment for the U.S. renewable energy landscape. With electricity demand climbing and state governments racing to meet climate goals, the court’s decision not only preserves critical momentum for renewable energy but also signals potential limits on executive power to disrupt industry progress based on uncertain or unsubstantiated grounds.

What To Know

U.S. District Judge Patti B. Saris on Monday ruled that the executive order issued by Trump in August was unconstitutional, opening the door for Revolution Wind and other offshore energy projects to move forward.

The decision came after U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth issued a preliminary injunction in September against the Trump administration's stop-work order for the nearly $6 billion Revolution Wind project—a joint effort by Danish energy company Orsted and partners BlackRock and Skyborn Renewables.

The project had been halted since August by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), which cited national security concerns without specifying details, PBS reported.

Lamberth found that the administration's action caused ""irreparable harm"" to the plaintiffs, with each day of delay costing $2.3 million and threatening the whole project's viability due to inflexible construction deadlines and limited vessel availability.

He described the government's justification for the halt as ""the height of arbitrary and capricious"" and noted that the shutdown could endanger over 1,000 union jobs, Engineering News-Record reported in September.

The Revolution Wind project, set to power up to 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut, is intended to deliver approximately 2.5 percent of regional energy needs, splitting electricity between the two states. At the time of the halt, about 70 percent of turbines had been installed, and developers had invested or committed about $5 billion.

Trump has long voiced opposition to wind power, describing wind turbines as unsightly, noisy and environmentally harmful in public statements and on the campaign trail.

He has repeatedly criticized offshore wind developments, claiming they drove up energy costs, killed wildlife and caused other environmental issues—a stance at odds with the Biden administration’s earlier emphasis on renewables.

Trump used his position to pause construction on multiple wind projects and attempted to revoke or freeze federal funding and permits for the sector, positioning fossil fuels as the preferred energy source for the U.S.

What People Are Saying

Saris, in the court decision Monday: ""Given that the Wind Order constitutes a change of course from decades of agencies’ issuing (or denying) permits related to wind energy projects, the Agency Defendants were required, at minimum, to “provide a reasoned explanation for the change” and to “display awareness that [they were] changing position.”

Trump, on Truth Social in August: ""Any State that has built and relied on WINDMILLS and SOLAR for power are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS.""

Trump, at a July meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland: ""Wind is the most expensive form of energy. And it destroys the beauty of your fields and your plains and your waterways. And look, look out there—there's no windmills. But if you look in another direction, you see windmills. If, when we go to Aberdeen, you'll see some of the ugliest windmills you've ever seen. They're the height of a 50-story building. And you can take a thousand times more energy out of a hole in the ground ... It's called oil and gas.""

What Happens Next

Revolution Wind partners aim to resume construction immediately to meet their timeline and avoid additional costs. The U.S. Interior Department and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management may still appeal Saris' ruling, which would move the dispute to the federal appellate court.

Despite possible new legal challenges, the court decision represents a major, if temporary, victory for wind developers, labor unions and states pursuing renewable energy jobs and targets.

,Texas Environment,2025-12-09 01:29:47+00:00,TPR,Data centers complicate Virginia's climate goals | TPR - Texas Public Radio,"Chris Bentley, Peter O'Dowd",,,,,https://www.tpr.org/2025-12-08/data-centers-complicate-virginias-climate-goals,"In the next year or so, data center electricity use in Virginia will pass all use of electricity in homes around the state.
Back in the 60s, electricity demand grew 7%, 8%, 10% a year, almost through the whole decade.
What solutions do they have to not only maintain their climate goals, but also to meet this demand for power?
“We have had periods when electricity generation grew pretty fast.
So by the time we get out to the point where we have really binding constraints on our ability to meet new energy demand, we’re going to have new options available.","Five years ago, Virginia passed a law that requires 100% renewable energy on the grid by 2050.

But Virginia is also home to more data centers than anywhere else in the country, and those new buildings require a whole lot of power.

“All through the 2000s, electricity demand in the state hardly grew at all,” said William Shobe, professor of public policy at the University of Virginia. “And then it really took off.”

5 questions with William Shobe

Are you able to quantify just how much the electricity demand has increased in the five years since the Virginia Clean Economy Act passed?

“We’re tracking it pretty closely. For the last couple of years, data center demand by itself has been growing 25% to 30% a year, and data center electricity use in the state is now bigger than all of our industrial demand, and it’s closing in on residential demand. In the next year or so, data center electricity use in Virginia will pass all use of electricity in homes around the state. So it’s growing pretty fast. It’s not unprecedented. We had growth like this back in the [1960s]. Back in the 60s, electricity demand grew 7%, 8%, 10% a year, almost through the whole decade. But it hasn’t been like that for a long time.”

Some people are calling Virginia the data center capital of the world. Is it really that much? What’s driving all this interest in this new infrastructure in Virginia?

“It really is that much. Part of it has to do with the history of how the internet started. It was a very good place for data centers to connect up to the internet. And I don’t think anybody really expects that to slow down anytime soon.”

With the cost of power going up, this is an issue that’s evolving politically. The incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger campaigned on energy affordability. Now, Democrats control the state government. What solutions do they have to not only maintain their climate goals, but also to meet this demand for power?

“We have had periods when electricity generation grew pretty fast. So that’s not unprecedented by itself, trying to do it without causing a lot of damage to the environment and a lot of health effects because of the generation. The emissions from the generation is the new challenge because we’d like to have the added generation to support the data centers, but without all the health effects and environmental effects of those data centers.

“The modeling we’ve done indicates we can get there. It’s possible to do, but we just have to give the right incentives for generating clean energy and expanding the supply without the emissions that used to go along with the expanded supply.”

Do you think there’s any way to meet that demand without more natural gas?

“It depends on whether you’re talking about the short run or the long run, because sales of electricity have been going up so fast. It may be that we need to expand the use of natural gas in the short run, but Virginia generates almost 10% of its electricity from solar energy now, and that percentage is growing.

“From year to year, we’re adding quite a lot of generation. Next year, we have a big new wind farm that’s going to be coming online, and we have a pretty strong offshore wind resource that we can tap. Plus, there are plans to add new types of nuclear generation to the mix. The answer to your question is that, in the longer run, it does seem to be possible. We just have to have the right incentives in place.”

When you look at this broadly across the country, what do you think it means for efforts to slow down climate change now that the cost of energy is becoming such a major political issue?

“In Virginia, non-emitting energy resources like solar, for example, that’s our cheapest new source of energy. So if we were just picking new sources of energy along that cost continuum, we want to build plenty more of that solar.

“Now we need a mix of different types of generation. We need the intermittent renewables; we need some base load power. But the development of new technologies, especially new nuclear, and people are talking about developing directional drilling technology that gives us the ability to tap geothermal power. In the short run, we have good technologies we can use in the longer run. There are new sources coming along that can substitute for what we’ve been using.

“We have the development of a fusion energy power plant in central Virginia, a proposed one. So by the time we get out to the point where we have really binding constraints on our ability to meet new energy demand, we’re going to have new options available. So I think it’s really partly a matter of making sure that we’re open to those new technologies as they become available, and we’re ready to incorporate them in our energy mix.”

Why it matters: The January memo is among the most direct of the Trump administration's directives or policies hindering renewable power — but it's not the only one.

Trump officials have been especially aggressive in targeting offshore wind projects, including ones already approved or even under construction.

Driving the news: Judge Patti Saris, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, ruled Monday that Trump's Jan. 20 order is ""arbitrary and capricious"" under administrative law.

The ruling came in a case brought by New York and other states, and the nonprofit Alliance For Clean Energy New York.

Saris, a Clinton-era appointee, found that federal agencies did not provide a ""reasoned explanation"" for their actions under the order.

While projects planned for federal lands and waters are most directly affected, onshore projects on private lands also rely on various forms of federal approvals.

Yes, but: The effects of the judge's ruling are unclear as federal officials rely on several overlapping orders and agency policies to justify restrictions on renewables.

ClearView Energy Partners said in a note last month that if Saris ruled against the administration, it ""could reject any pending permits and/or pursue a de facto pause of project reviews and lease sales since the courts cannot 'force' agencies to issue permits.""

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

“This critical victory also preserves well-paying green jobs and access to reliable, affordable energy that will help Massachusetts meet our clean energy and climate goals,″ she added.

The coalition that opposed Trump's order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States' largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association. The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C.

The Interior Department and the White House didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment, but the White House previously accused the Democratic attorneys general of using lawfare to stop the president’s energy agenda.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation's electric grid.

Rob Moore is the principal from Scioto Analysis – a group that studied the impact of the way the state is handing out energy permits.

“You have economic growth where we’re trying to make sure that we have enough energy to be able to support the needs that are happening in Ohio,” Moore said. “We recommended that the chamber and business leaders be talking to the legislature and making sure that there are restrictions on how long the process can be.”

The study found the faster the process – the better, because the longer they take, the more likely those projects will fall through.

The study is making several recommendations, including expediting public hearings and standardizing the timeline for their entire process.

Steve Stivers, the CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce – the group that requested the study – said some neighboring states have already been affected.

“Our goal is to make sure that Ohio can quickly and efficiently approve safe projects that will make sure that we can get energy online faster so that we can live the American dream and have an economic miracle here in Ohio,” Stivers said. “Indiana and the MISO region actually had some rolling blackouts about a year ago as a result of too much demand for electricity and not enough supply.”

Congressman Bob Latta (R – Ohio 5th district) said getting energy from one point to the other is a global issue.

This is why Latta said Congress is considering more than a dozen bills related to energy.

“Because our competitors, as I said, the communist Chinese, they’re moving forward and they’re putting the power on,” Latta said. “And again, if you don’t have the power and the grid security and the modernization of the grid out there, you’re falling way behind.”

This study comes as AEP is requesting to increase its rate. A request that company officials said is needed because of the high demand for energy.

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is holding hearings regarding that request this week.

As for the impact on Ohioans, Moore said there’s always a tradeoff, but their research is aiming to find balance.

“Moving the pendulum a little bit more towards efficiency is probably going to be able to protect environmental concerns and community concerns,” Moore said. “While at the same time get more projects through so that energy prices don’t keep on rising and rising.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/WEB_PHOTO_ENERGY_PERMIT_crop,N,,2025-12-09 00:00:05.065473

EPA “confesses error,” urges court to vacate Soot Rule. In a motion filed on November 24 in Commonwealth of Kentucky et al. v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency et al., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ended its defense of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5, commonly called the Soot Rule, and urged the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit to vacate it. In essence, the agency is siding with the plaintiffs in the case, a coalition of business associations and the Attorneys General from 25 Republican-led states who argue that the rule would raise costs for manufacturers, utilities, and consumers and could hamper the construction of new factories. The rule was finalized in February 2024 and put in place tougher limits on emissions of fine particulates. The agency’s November 24, 2025 motion stated that the rule was finalized “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and that the “EPA now confesses error and urges this Court to vacate the Rule.” Eliminating the rule would revert the fine-particulate standard to levels set in 2012.

One-year tariff exclusions extended to additional products. On November 26, certain industrial and medical products manufactured in China received a one-year extension of tariff exclusions as part of the November 1 US-China trade agreement between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. The renewed exclusions affect 14 categories of solar manufacturing equipment, as well as 164 diverse categories, such as automotive air compressors, printed circuit boards, pump components, and electric motors. Tariffs on those products had been extended several times this year and would have expired on November 29.

FDA withdraws proposed rule requiring cosmetics makers to test talc for asbestos. On November 26, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew a proposed rule that would have required manufacturers of talc-containing cosmetic products to test their products – or the talc components of those products – for asbestos, and to maintain records showing their compliance with the rule. An FDA spokesperson told The New York Times that the agency intends to submit a new, more comprehensive proposed rule, but did not provide further details. Talc is widely used in many industrials processes – for instance, to reduce friction and improve ink adhesion in paper manufacturing – but, with the FDA’s move, attention is turning to its use in products intended for human ingestion, such as pharmaceuticals, candies, dried beans and fruits, and dietary supplements. Starting in 2027, the European Union will ban all uses of talc in cosmetics under the Cosmetics Regulation. The United Kingdom is exploring the possibility of a similar ban.

CBP forced labor enforcement continues. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has issued its fifth Withhold Release Order (WRO) for 2025, directing the detention of garments, apparel, and textiles manufactured in Mauritius by Firemount Group Ltd., based on information that reasonably indicates the use of forced labor in violation of 19 U.S.C. § 1307. WROs are a powerful tool that can immediately disrupt shipments and merchandising plans, with downstream impacts on inventory, retail operations, and brand commitments. Currently, CBP is overseeing 54 WROs and nine Findings under § 1307.

Eleview settlement highlights US enforcement of export control rules on Russia. A freight forwarding business based in Virginia, as well as its owner, chief executive officer, and an employee, have pled guilty to conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act over schemes to transship more than USD6 million worth of sensitive United States technology to Russia through third countries and to provide false information on export control documentation submitted to the US government. The outcome underscores the US government’s intent to investigate conduct that threatens US national security and economic interests while also serving as a case study in cargo risk detection and control.

Another legal challenge for NESE pipeline. In mid-November, a coalition of environmental groups asked the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's November 7 decision that granted a crucial water quality certificate for the Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) pipeline project. The 37-mile NESE pipeline would route gas from Pennsylvania through New Jersey and New York, passing in part beneath the ocean floor near Staten Island to deliver natural gas to 2.3 million New York City households. The controversial project has faced years of permit rejections from both New Jersey and New York, and was cancelled by its developer, the Williams Companies, before New York Governor Kathy Hochul supported it earlier this year. In a statement on November 7, Governor Hochul stated that the pipeline is one aspect of New York's ""all-of-the-above approach"" and pointed to the “continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability.” The new lawsuit follows earlier legal challenges brought by the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC): one charging that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission improperly reissued a certificate for the pipeline in September and a second disputing both New York and New Jersey’s permit approvals in federal court. Last month, New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill expressed skepticism about the value of the NESE project, stating that it “does nothing to lower electric bills for New Jersey residents.” Separately, the Williams Companies have withdrawn the water permit application for the Constitution Pipeline, a USD1 billion underwater project intended to move natural gas from Pennsylvania to Albany, New York for routing via extant pipelines to New England.

Germany calls on EU to soften the 2035 internal-combustion engine phaseout. In a November 28 letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz asked that the European Union (EU) ease its 2035 deadline for registering new internal-combustion vehicles, arguing for “a reconciliation of competitiveness and climate action” and warning of risks to Germany’s auto industry. The letter is the latest step in a broader push by the European auto industry and its supporters for greater flexibility in ICE reductions and deadlines. Earlier this year, European automakers urged the EU to make allowance for internal combustion engines running on CO2 neutral fuels; in September the EU fast tracked a review of the policy, with details due December 10. On November 26, EU Executive Vice President Stephane Sejourne said the coming update will bring greater “flexibility” to European automakers, adding that “Europe is ready to activate all levers to make the European automotive industry successful.”

Russia turned away from UN shipping council. On November 28, for the third straight year, Russia did not receive enough votes to rejoin the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Council. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent pollution from ships. One hundred thirteen votes are needed to join the Council; Russia received 47. The IMO election results, Reuters Maritime observed, reflect the “continued global stance against Russian maritime practices.” Norway, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine, opponents of Russia’s candidacy, all pointed to concerns about Russia’s so-called shadow fleet – oil tankers often sailing under flags of convenience to circumvent economic sanctions.

The study, Budgeting for Net Zero: Powering India’s Reliable Clean Energy Future by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, finds that firm and dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE)—hybrid projects combining solar, wind, and battery storage—can match or undercut the cost of new thermal power plants when developers are able to monetize both a portion of surplus electricity generated by oversized renewable sources and additional storage capacity.

FDRE projects install slightly more renewable and storage capacity than required for their contracted supply; selling this surplus power plays a critical role in lowering overall costs. FDRE—one of several types of tenders for firm clean energy—is already much cheaper than new coal when the full social costs of thermal power plants are considered.

Without accounting for social costs, the study identifies three cost-parity timelines, depending on how much surplus power developers can sell into the market:

2025 when 100% of surplus power is monetized,

2030 when 50% of surplus power is monetized, and

2047 when only 30% of surplus power is monetized.

“Firm and dispatchable renewables are not just a clean alternative—they are an increasingly competitive source of reliable power. With thoughtful tender design and market reforms, India can tap into FDRE to meet rising electricity demand, cut long-term costs, and build a power system that is both resilient and future-ready,” said Sunil Mani, policy advisor at IISD.

The study examines when and under what conditions FDRE can compete with new thermal, whether government support is needed to accelerate deployment, and the macroeconomic impacts of scaling FDRE. It also evaluates how tender design, developer strategies, and electricity market reforms influence FDRE’s affordability.

FDRE marks an important shift in India’s clean energy procurement. Instead of simply adding variable renewable energy to the grid, FDRE tenders require developers to supply clean electricity at specific, often peak hours aligned with distribution companies’ (discoms’) demand patterns. This is becoming increasingly relevant as India’s power needs rise and discoms face higher costs from managing variability through short-term markets and limited access to flexible supply. FDRE offers one pathway to scale renewables while maintaining reliability and cost predictability for both discoms and consumers.

Although early FDRE tenders have faced challenges—such as uncertainty around the optimal renewable–storage mix and the monetization of surplus power—9.7 GW of FDRE capacity is already under construction, and bid prices closely match the cost projections in the study.

The report stresses that FDRE is not meant to replace all other clean energy solutions. Because FDRE guarantees firm delivery, it is naturally more expensive than standalone solar, wind, or storage when round-the-clock supply is not required. The authors of the report highlight that a balanced approach—deploying FDRE where demand profiles justify it and expanding lower-cost clean energy and storage elsewhere—will deliver the most efficient outcomes for India’s evolving power system.

“FDRE can play an important role alongside standalone renewables, storage, and smarter grid management to support India’s clean energy transition,” says Dr Anasuya Gangopadhyay, senior associate in the Climate Change Mitigation team at CSTEP.

Beyond Energy Costs: Health, climate, and jobs

The report also highlights that comparing FDRE and coal solely on energy costs ignores coal’s full societal costs. When air pollution and climate damages are included, the effective cost of new pithead coal rises from INR 4.65/kWh to INR 13.19/kWh, making FDRE immediately cheaper in all scenarios.

In addition, FDRE provides energy security advantages: it reduces exposure to fossil fuel price volatility and can be deployed in 2–2.5 years, compared to 5–7 years for new coal plants.

Beyond costs, scaling FDRE would raise India’s GDP by 1.8% by 2050, create 64,000 net new jobs, and reduce public health costs linked to air pollution while strengthening energy security by lowering dependence on fuel imports.

The study identifies several policy options to strengthen FDRE tender design and create market conditions that support deployment, including more flexible demand-fulfilment ratios, capacity payments for storage, improved penalty structures, expanded revenue opportunities, and enhanced resource adequacy planning at the state level.

Along the way, the company has become expert in numerous fields, including aerospace and automotive, biopharmaceutical, chemical manufacturing, commercial buildings, data centers, education, mining, refineries, health care and renewable energy.

It’s been a solid strategy, with Harder reporting that its revenue topped $744 million last year.

When asked how the Portland, Ore.-based company has survived and thrived so long in a highly competitive and challenging sector, Dustin Harder, president, says the secret lies in Harder’s adaptability, safety culture and willingness to take work on the road when local markets slow.

“Teams have gone wherever the work is, from Oregon to Washington, Alaska, California, Utah, Nevada, Idaho and Arizona, keeping the company moving and providing opportunities for employees across regions,” he says.

Harder’s record of success has earned the firm ENR West’s Northwest Specialty Contractor of the Year honors.

Steady as She Goes

Harder says business is currently steady and rebuilding after a challenging year, with strong momentum heading into 2026 and 2027. He says the firm has worked hard to pivot from the impact of a few major projects being put on hold due to economic uncertainty.

“However, the company has successfully secured new projects that will carry us through the next couple years, ensuring stability and growth,” he says.

Right now, Harder’s three hottest market sectors are advanced technology; renewable energy and natural resources; and data centers, all of which are driving the next generation of industry across the West.

“We’re rapidly expanding in this space with major projects underway in the Northwest,” says Harder. “The semiconductor market is especially exciting for us because it brings long-term stability, technical sophistication and opportunities to showcase our integrated fabrication and installation capabilities. Our work with these companies contributes to building the infrastructure behind America’s growing tech manufacturing ecosystem.”

The company is also playing a role in the nation’s clean energy transition.

Harder Mechanical is leading critical projects in battery recycling and lithium mining. “These efforts not only support sustainability goals but also strengthen the domestic supply of key materials for electric vehicles, making this both a profitable and nationally strategic market for us,” says Harder.

The company is also growing its presence in the data center sector. “These projects require speed, precision and innovation, areas where Harder Mechanical’s off-site manufacturing (OSM) capabilities give us a major advantage,” says Harder.

“These markets are hot because they sit at the intersection of technology, energy and sustainability, the three most transformative forces shaping modern industry,” he says. “Harder’s combination of scale, technical depth and advanced [offsite manufacturing] fabrication allows us to meet the high demands of these projects safely, efficiently and with industry-leading quality.”

A key driver of efficiency and success for the firm has been moving more fabrication and modular work to its offsite manufacturing shop. This strategy has improved safety, productivity and cost control while allowing field crews to focus on higher-value tasks.

“Harder Mechanical’s focus on continuous improvement—from upgrading safety policies, adopting Revit companywide and achieving ISO 9000 certification across all fab shops—shows a company committed to evolving and excelling,” says Harder.

Harder was part of the team on the Portland Airport’s Terminal Core project that redeveloped the main terminal.

Flying High

Harder has been a key part of the Portland International Airport’s $2.15 billion, 860,000-sq-ft Terminal Core Redevelopment (TCORE) project, which is currently under construction and slated to complete in 2026. As a key trade partner on this transformative effort, Harder is working on security screening areas, baggage handling systems, office spaces and presecurity concessions, all while keeping airport operations running smoothly.

To meet the project’s ambitious schedule and minimize disruptions, Harder implemented an innovative modular construction strategy, designing and building 41 modular pipe racks off site—21 dedicated to utility systems and 20 to hydronic systems. This approach maximized prefabrication opportunities, enhancing both efficiency and worker safety in one of the most complex active airport construction environments in the Pacific Northwest.

“Harder Mechanical’s collaboration during the pre-construction phase of the Portland Airport expansion project was instrumental in shaping a cost-effective and constructible design,” says Bob McGinnis, senior preconstruction director at Skanska USA Building. “Their proactive approach to budgeting, value engineering and system coordination ensured seamless integration of complex mechanical solutions for this landmark project.”

Buffon Decker, senior project manager for Hoffman Skanska JV, says Harder was integral to the success of the project.

“They worked closely with the JV and the other trade partners in the initial planning and were responsive and quick with solutions when we hit the inevitable challenges on such a complex project,” Decker says. “They helped us to make sure that the airport provided the passenger experience and comfort that PDX is known for.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/12/08/Harder-001.jpg?height=635&t=1765229732&width=1200,N,,2025-12-08 21:58:04.969879

People across the country, from New York to Alabama, have opposed data center developments in their neighborhoods—with varying degrees of success.
In Southern states, despite a largely supportive regulatory environment, some communities have mounted strong opposition to proposed data centers.
In Bessemer, Alabama, the city council voted to rezone agricultural land to allow the construction of a new data center.
Data centers’ high power usage also pushes up the forecasts for peak demand—the highest demand possible for a region’s grid.","More than 200 environmental organizations signed a letter to Congress supporting a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers. The letter, sent Monday, highlights these centers’ impacts on water resources, electricity rates and greenhouse gas emissions.

Data centers often suck up large amounts of water to cool their computers. They require a lot of electricity to run their servers, often leading to higher regional utility rates and upgrades to the electricity grid to accommodate them. Some utilities are planning to build natural gas plants to serve the new load, while some data-center companies are even building their own plants, increasing local greenhouse gas emissions.

It is near-impossible to paint a complete picture of the energy and water use of data centers, and the corresponding climate impacts, given the limited data that companies provide. A November study in the journal Nature Sustainability predicted that, depending on the speed of expansion, the artificial intelligence industry could emit as much carbon dioxide each year as 10 million cars, Inside Climate News reported.

People across the country, from New York to Alabama, have opposed data center developments in their neighborhoods—with varying degrees of success. The letter states that environmental groups want to stop these developments until “adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities.”

In a prepared statement, Eric Weltman, senior New York organizer at Food & Water Watch, said: “It’s prudent that we press the pause button on Big Data’s voracious and expanding appetite for energy and water before it’s too late to prevent massive harm.”

Data-center boosters have touted the economic benefits of new construction, including tax revenue increases for local governments and new jobs for residents.

In October, Dan Diorio, the vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, told NPR that companies are trying to reduce their water consumption, and to ensure they pay “the full cost of service for electricity.”

In New York, state leadership has taken a mainly supportive stance on data center development—Gov. Kathy Hochul recently told Bloomberg News that she wants to “let the tech industry know this is the place you want to be.”

But some communities in upstate New York have opposed data center development, particularly cryptocurrency mines that consume large amounts of energy to create bitcoin for profit. More recently, a potential AI data center in Lansing, a town near the state’s Finger Lakes region, has residents concerned about rising electricity costs and environmental problems.

“These slick corporations come into unsuspecting communities with the promise of job creation and tax revenues,” said Yvonne Taylor, the vice president of Seneca Lake Guardian, an organization that fights data centers near the Finger Lakes, and president of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining, which opposes them across the country.

Both organizations signed the letter. “The fact of the matter is that all of these machines … they’re all fully automated, and it doesn’t require a lot of people, so there aren’t a lot of jobs that are created, but the community is left with the consequences, including increased energy bills,” she said.

In Southern states, despite a largely supportive regulatory environment, some communities have mounted strong opposition to proposed data centers. In Bessemer, Alabama, the city council voted to rezone agricultural land to allow the construction of a new data center. This decision has divided the community, which is concerned about electricity rates, water use and potential air pollution from the on-site backup diesel generators.

Data centers use up so much power in certain states, like Virginia, that the regional electric grid operator will need to upgrade the transmission system that is essentially the backbone of the grid, according to Eric Gimon, an independent consultant who works as a technical expert and policy adviser with Energy Innovation, an energy and climate policy think tank.

Consumers usually subsidize those changes. A 2024 report from Virginia’s legislative watchdog agency found that households there could see their bills increase by an estimated $14 to $37 monthly by 2040 as a result.

Data centers’ high power usage also pushes up the forecasts for peak demand—the highest demand possible for a region’s grid. This can also affect household electricity rates.

“For all these things, there are solutions,” said Gimon. “It’s just a question of demanding the solutions get implemented.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2214908695-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 19:01:50.085082

READ MORE: Proposal Could Weaken Mileage Rules That Limit Air Pollution

The Trump administration said the rules, known formally as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, are why new vehicles are too expensive, and that cutting them will drive down costs and make driving safer for Americans.

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg (55.5 kpg) in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg (81.1 kpg) that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies ""forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.""

THE FACTS: It's true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers' growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden's policies were ""a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.""

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: ""We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.""

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile (1.6 kilometers) of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren't evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers ""safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.""

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle's cost.

""If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,"" Edmunds' Caldwell said. ""However, it's unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.""

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

""This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,"" said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All campaign. ""This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.""",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/cars.jCorcCnsSf.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.55&fp-y=0.44&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-12-08 19:02:30.209147

An additional virtual hearing will be held at 6 p.m. on Dec. 18 on a permit application for the Saline data center’s proposed wetland, stream, and floodplain impacts, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy announced Friday.

When asked about the passing of DTE’s deadline, DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said the company “will continue to follow the regulatory process and wait for the MPSC’s decision on these contracts.”

Wilmot did not say whether the status of the project is affected by the missed deadline, and deferred questions on the matter to developer Related Digital and Oracle.

The utility’s contracts with the data center customer allow it to terminate the agreement within 30 days if the deal is not approved by Dec. 5, or if the customer does not agree to extend this date to Dec. 19, according to a DTE regulatory filing. The MPSC’s next regular meeting is Dec. 18.

Related Digital spokesperson Natalie Ravitz said the Saline Township data center is an exceptional opportunity for job creation and building digital infrastructure.

“The project is structured to ensure a responsible development plan that protects ratepayers, preserves Michigan’s natural resources and water, and delivers a positive impact on the local economy,” Ravitz said in an email.

Oracle did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

Data centers are statewide issue that demands oversight, residents tell regulators

During the public comment portion of the MPSC’s Friday meeting, around 20 Michiganders spoke against the data center or in support of a contested case.

Ayat Al-Tamimi, a public health researcher and member of the grassroots group Michiganders Against Data Centers, held up a copy of the heavily redacted contracts DTE submitted to the MPSC as evidence of what she said is DTE’s failure to be a good partner to the people of Michigan.

“They’re able to circumvent clean energy commitments, if their power demand exceeds their ability to meet their clean energy commitments,” Al-Tamimi said, referring to an off ramp provision in Michigan’s 2023 clean energy law that allows fossil fuels to stay online if there is insufficient capacity to meet demand.

Saline Township resident Tim Bruneau said he has difficulties with outages and long restoration times and is concerned the data center could increase electric costs, referencing a September Bloomberg report that showed dramatic increases in ratepayers bills. The story said data centers increased electricity costs by as much as 267% over five years in some areas.

“The people of Michigan deserve a say in what happens to our power grid, to our land, and to our water,” said Christian Alvarado, a Plymouth resident and organizer with the nonprofit Detroit Action. The data center has the potential to impact ratepayers statewide, and the project “must be carefully and transparently vetted,” he said.

Nessel, lawmakers call for data center oversight

DTE Energy, which applied for ex parte approval of the data center electricity contracts without official hearings, has said a contested case is unnecessary because the project will not increase the cost of service for other customers.

Residents and some lawmakers say a contested case with Michigan regulators is needed to ensure the data center doesn’t increase utility bills, decrease energy reliability, undermine Michigan’s climate law, or leave ratepayers to pay for stranded costs if the facility uses less power than anticipated or ceases operation.

A contested case would enable parties representing businesses, environmental interests, ratepayers, and other groups to submit testimony on the electric contracts for the Saline Township data center.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and some union representatives and lawmakers support the project, and say it will create thousands of temporary construction jobs, hundreds of permanent jobs, and bring tax dollars to local communities.

Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel faced off on opposite sides of the data center issue this week.

DTE failed to show how it will supply power for the facility and protect residents from covering project costs, Nessel said in a Thursday statement.

Among the deficiencies Nessel said she found in DTE’s request for approval of the contracts are “unjustified redactions and rushed deadlines.”

“DTE continues to push for a rubber-stamp approval of a secret deal, but time and again, my office has contested their filings – and time after time, the utility has shown it is not a trustworthy partner, routinely filling cases with unjustified costs,” Nessel said, adding that a case involving hundreds of millions of dollars in energy infrastructure costs should be contested.

When asked about Nessel’s statement, DTE’s Wilmot said the company has an obligation to serve any business or residential customer. The energy contracts submitted for the data center will not increase rates for existing customers, she said. Whitmer released a letter in support of DTE’s data center plan just minutes before Wednesday’s hearing. The project will create jobs, she said, adding that her office reviewed the project’s environmental and ratepayer protections to ensure residents are not negatively impacted.

“Can Michigan benefit from these jobs and build data centers in a smarter way while upholding our strong environmental laws to protect our precious natural resources? We have an opportunity to do both,” Whitmer wrote.

Twenty-eight Republican and Democratic lawmakers signed a Dec. 2 letter that urges the MPSC to hold a contested case.

The lawmakers said the project could be a major economic opportunity, but that it also represents the “largest energy consumption increase in Michigan history,” and the MPSC will be unable to make an informed and fair decision on the matter without a contested proceeding.

Robust public input and feedback is needed to ensure existing customers don’t pay more for energy if “the energy usage overtaxes infrastructure, impedes Michigan’s clean energy goals, or because the companies proposing the data centers go bankrupt or otherwise do not fulfill their promises,” the letter said.

During Friday’s meeting, Augusta Township resident Wendy Albers said residents of Michigan townships are often left in the dark while data center deals are negotiated, with developers pushing a rushed timeline for approval once the proposals are made public.

“Please end the secrecy and protect the people of Michigan,” Albers told the commission in her request for a contested case.

“This is your chance to provide some equality between big tech, government, and the people.”

Antares, an advanced nuclear energy startup, announced the close of its $96 million Series B funding round.

The round was led by Shine Capital, with participation from Alt Capital, Caffeinated, FiftyThree Stations, Industrious, and other investors.

The round consists of $71M in new equity capital and $25M in debt for equipment, factory build-out, and uranium procurement.

Antares CEO Jordan Bramble said the new capital will fuel the company’s mission to deliver safe, reliable, and scalable nuclear power solutions.

“This funding marks a major milestone for Antares,” Bramble said. “We’re months away from our first reactor demonstration, which will validate our control systems and neutronics models, develop our testing facility, and fabricate our fuel ahead of our upcoming full scale electricity producing prototype in 2027.""

Bramble added, ""We’ve raised the capital we need to mobilize to provide resilient energy for our partners at the Department of War (DoW) and NASA.”

Founded just over two years ago, Antares has made rapid progress in technology maturation.

The company has raised over $130M in funding to date and put those resources to work building out a 145,000-square-foot facility in Torrance, California, capable of producing 10 units per year.

Antares has also secured contracts with the United States Air Force, Space Force, Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), and NASA to advance its technology.

With operations in Torrance, California; Idaho Falls, Idaho; and Aiken, South Carolina, and a team of 60, Antares is working to demonstrate a low-power test reactor before July 4, 2026, and to test its first-of-a-kind electricity-producing demonstration unit in 2027.

Production units will be deployed as early as 2028.

Over the summer, Antares conducted an electrically heated demonstration of its reactor in partnership with NASA at their Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

In April, Antares was selected by DIU under the Advanced Nuclear Power for Installations (ANPI) program to provide nuclear power to DoW installations.

In August, the company received an allocation of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel feedstock from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and was selected for DOE’s new reactor pilot program, which creates a fast-track pathway for reactor demonstration and licensing.

In October, the U.S. Army announced the establishment of a program of record for advanced nuclear energy, called JANUS, targeting reactors from kilowatt class up to 20MWe.

With this new funding, Antares plans to compete to provide the Pentagon with resilient energy for critical assets and infrastructure.

Antares’ will also propose on NASA’s Fission Surface Power program, which aims to deliver 100 kWe of nuclear power on the lunar surface by 2030.

Middleburg, a leading developer and operator of rental housing throughout core Southern markets, has closed a $39.1 million refinance of Vesta Creeks Run, a workforce and affordable housing community located at 4640 Forest Hills Drive in North Charleston, South Carolina.

Newmark arranged the Freddie Mac financing on behalf of Middleburg.

Throughout the course of its ownership since acquiring the asset in 2021, Middleburg implemented several operational and capital. The property is 97 percent occupied.

“Our partnership with Capital Solutions and Affordable Communities of America, a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving affordable housing throughout the country, enabled us to come up with creative strategies to help us continue to provide and maintain high-quality attainable housing stock in markets like Charleston,” said Michael Bediones, vice president of Asset Management at Middleburg.

Vesta Creeks Run is part of Middleburg's Vesta brand, the firm's workforce and affordable housing platform serving residents across the Southeast.

Officials said the property features attainable rents and area median income (AMI)-restricted units, addressing growing workforce housing needs in the Charleston region.

Under the leadership of Founder and CEO Chris Finlay, Middleburg continues to expand its attainable housing platform across three brands: Mosby, its marquee Class A multifamily product; Vesta, its workforce and affordable housing brand; and Hamlet, its purpose-built single-family rental product.

With over two decades of multifamily sponsorship, Middleburg has acquired, developed, and financed more than 32,000 multifamily units, exceeding over $4.5 billion in transactions since 2004.",http://locable-assets-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/resource/file/1261312/antares_20logo.jpg?timestamp=1765245556,N,,2025-12-08 20:59:19.028008

The National Grocers Association petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last Thursday to revise its hydrofluorocarbon management rule, citing unrealistic timelines, excessive compliance costs and regulatory requirements that exceed what Congress mandated.

NGA argued that the HFC Management Rule imposes impractical and overly burdensome requirements on food retailers. These include a drastic expansion of the number of covered refrigeration appliances and a leak-rate limit that does not reflect real-world system performance. The association also said the rule’s repair, testing and retrofit deadlines are unrealistically short, especially given national shortages of technicians and parts. It is requesting additional time to comply with automatic leak-detection system mandates.

“Independent grocers are committed to environmental sustainability and responsible refrigerant management,” said Max Wengroff, NGA senior manager of government relations. “But the EPA’s rule places unrealistic obligations on retailers that simply cannot be met under the imposed timelines and thresholds. These unnecessary obligations will raise costs for businesses and families.”

In the petition, NGA stated that it supports reducing HFC emissions by limiting production and use. However, it argued that compliance with the rule would increase operating expenses, forcing grocers to pass those costs on to consumers.

According to NGA, the EPA’s new leak-rate threshold for repair is unworkable. The agency set the threshold at 20%, despite industry data indicating that the typical food-retail refrigeration system leaks about 25% of its refrigerant each year. The association is requesting that the threshold be raised to 30% or that the agency adopt a phased schedule that starts with a higher rate and becomes more stringent over time.

The independent grocery sector represents nearly one-third of all U.S. grocery sales—more than $250 billion annually—and supports over 1 million jobs.

Under direct pressure from Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency was pushed to go beyond rolling back climate protections and weaken long-standing public health safeguards as well. Documents reveal that the Office of Management and Budget leaned on EPA this summer to not only repeal a foundational climate policy underpinning most federal emissions rules for cars and trucks, but also to loosen limits on deadly non-climate pollutants like soot and smog-forming chemicals.

While EPA officials resisted parts of this pressure, the exchange—made public after the proposed rollback was released in July—lays bare the Trump administration’s aggressive campaign to dismantle environmental regulation across the board, not just climate rules. Current vehicle standards, finalized in 2024 under the Biden administration, target both greenhouse gases and so-called “criteria pollutants” that cause asthma, heart disease, and premature death. But as Trump’s EPA moves to gut those protections, the White House budget office has simultaneously pushed to weaken rules on toxic air pollution itself—showing that this rollback is not only about climate denial, but also about abandoning basic public health protections.

The climate crisis is here and now. The fossil fuel industry knew, lied, denied, and sabotaged action on catastrophic climate change for decades, all while raking in billions in profit every year.

The paper argues that a U.S. Strategic Lithium Reserve (SLR)—modeled on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve—could provide the price stability needed for private capital to finance new lithium mining and conversion projects across the Western Hemisphere.

A Market-Based Alternative to Subsidies and Price Floors

Lithium prices have swung 10–15× in recent cycles—far beyond what most long-term capital can withstand. Much of this volatility stems from China’s dominance of lithium chemical conversion, where oversupply and subsidized lepidolite production exert sustained downward pressure on global prices. The result: U.S., Canadian, and allied projects struggle to reach Final Investment Decision (FID) even when resource quality and management execution are strong.

“A Strategic Lithium Reserve is the simplest, fairest, and fastest policy tool available,” said Howard Klein, Founder of RK Equity.

“It doesn’t pick technologies or subsidize risky projects. It neutralizes volatility so private capital can back the best projects.”

How the SLR Works

The SLR would operate as a rules-based reserve of lithium carbonate, purchasing material when prices fall below incentive levels—typically around $20,000–25,000 per tonne—and releasing it during extreme price spikes, supply disruptions, or export restrictions.

Establishing a 170,000-tonne reserve today would cost approximately $3.4–4.25 billion. A fully built-out 300,000-tonnereserve by 2030 would cost $6.0–7.5 billion. These sums are modest compared to existing U.S. industrial policy initiatives such as:

DOE Loan Programs Office: >$100B

Inflation Reduction Act clean energy incentives: >$400B

CHIPS Act: ~$50B

Immediate Strategic Impact

The white paper highlights that the Americas—particularly Chile and Argentina—are already the largest non-China producers of lithium carbonate. Redirecting a portion of these flows away from China and toward a U.S. reserve would provide immediate strategic supply security.

“Unlike permitting a new mine or building a U.S. refinery, which takes years, the SLR can begin stabilizing the market within months,” Klein added.

“It is the lithium-age analogue to the SPR.”

Complementary Industrial Strategy

In addition to the SLR, the paper recommends:

Continued use of the 45X Production Tax Credit, a broad-based, non-distortive incentive

Targeted LPO, EXIM Bank, or Department of the Navy’s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) support for nationally significant, long-lived strategic projects

Limited, performance-linked incentives for companies with demonstrated ability to build and operate large-scale conversion capacity

The white paper also presents a three-phase implementation roadmap, beginning with authorization and early purchases, followed by hemispheric project alignment, and culminating in a fully operational SLR capable of dampening market extremes across cycles.

Welch’s parents both worked as park rangers at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and as she grew older, her mom took on seasonal work at other parks during the summer months.

“From living in Yellowstone to New River Gorge National Park, I was always outside and knew I wanted to have a similar career to my parents,” Welch said.

Welch volunteered at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in high school and later served as a rafting guide, experiences that reinforced her aspirations to work outdoors.

As she was preparing for college, Welch focused on finding academic programs that would align with her goal of working in conservation.

That’s when she discovered the College of Natural Resources at NC State, where she enrolled as a fisheries, wildlife and conservation biology major with a minor in applied ecology.

Inspired by a dendrology course taught by Steph Jefferies in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources, Welch decided to double major in plant biology.

“Dr. Jefferies made the class so engaging, and I use what I learned almost daily, or whenever I see a tree,” Welch said.

Welch also enrolled in the University Certificate in Field Botany program, which provides students with the opportunity to develop skills in vascular plant identification.

This interdisciplinary path has provided Welch, who is graduating this fall, with a unique perspective on conservation, allowing her to fully realize the interconnectedness of plants and wildlife.

“In an ecosystem, plants and wildlife are so connected, and learning about the parts of a system helps us understand the entire ecosystem,” Welch said.

Reconnecting with Her Indigenous Roots

While at NC State, Welch’s studies also deepened her connection to her ancestral roots, as she is an enrolled member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (ECBI).

“Growing up, I didn’t know that much about Cherokee culture. It wasn’t really taught in schools, and I didn’t search it out,” Welch said.

Welch didn’t expect to miss her cultural background when left home for college, as it hadn’t been a significant part of her identity at that time.

But the longer she was away, Welch’s desire to reconnect with her culture grew, leading her to participate more in events focused on Cherokee traditions and heritage back home.

In August 2024, Welch joined the James Buzzard Leadership Development Program, through which she learned about the Indigenous Conservation Corps (ICC).

The ICC is a partnership between Conservation Corps North Carolina, the U.S. National Forest Service and the ECBI to promote environmental stewardship and cultural preservation through collaborative conservation efforts.

Last summer, Welch served as an assistant crew lead for the ICC alongside her sister Rebecca, learning about Cherokee ecological knowledge and EBCI Natural Resources Department’s efforts to restore their relationship with the land.

“I’m so thankful that I participated in this program with my sister,” Welch said. “It helped me realize that I want to combine what I’ve learned at NC State with honoring Cherokee land stewardship and deepening my understanding of the culture.”

Exploring, Learning and Gaining Experience

Reflecting on her journey, Welch emphasized that her experience with the ICC was made possible in large part by the College of Natural Resources’ emphasis on hands-on learning.

As part of the fisheries, wildlife and conservation biology curriculum, all students are required to complete an experiential learning opportunity, such as an internship or field practicum, to graduate.

“The college sets students up for success by providing internship opportunities, supporting clubs and offering events,” Welch said. “One of its greatest strengths is enabling students to learn beyond the traditional classroom.”

Welch specifically highlighted the 6-week field practicum, known as Summer Camp, as being crucial to preparing her for fieldwork. The practicum allows students to gain practical experience in wildlife management and conservation practices.

“This experience was my first real introduction to wildlife management, and I’ve used so much of what we learned in just two internships,” Welch said.

In addition to her experience with the ICC, Welch also completed an internship with Discover Life in America at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 2024.

Through these internships, Welch gained invaluable firsthand research skills, immersing herself in the complexities of fieldwork and learning to navigate logistical, environmental and organizational challenges.

Looking ahead, Welch plans to work seasonally before pursuing a master’s degree. Eventually, she hopes to return to her home in western North Carolina to pursue a career in conservation or a related field.

Welch expressed gratitude for the support and guidance she received throughout her time at NC State, specifically thanking her advisor, Lara Pacifici, and Kaly Wall, an academic services specialist.

When asked for advice to current students, Welch encouraged them to embrace every opportunity, stressing that hands-on experience is key to career success and building professional connections.

Additionally, Welch highlighted the importance of flexibility in fieldwork, noting, “Things won’t always go as planned, but a positive attitude makes all the difference.”",https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/12/julianna-welch-wolf-plaza-katherine-griffey-1146x600-1.png,N,,2025-12-08 17:02:32.940620

Congress Preps Hegseth’s Trillion-Dollar War Chest

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Lawmakers on Sunday released the compromise defense policy bill for FY 26, which would authorize a more than $900 billion Pentagon budget. If passed, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) would bring total U.S. military spending to well over a trillion dollars annually, thanks to the GOP-led Big Ugly Law passed in July, which included $150 billion in additional Pentagon funds. Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, released the following statement:

“The last person who should be entrusted with an even bigger budget is the dangerous and lawless Pete Hegseth.

“As Hegseth illegally targets civilian boats near Venezuela with expensive Hellfire missiles, wastefully and recklessly deploys the National Guard in cities around the country, and teases an unconstitutional and costly war, Congress should refuse to add a penny to his budget.

“The $8 billion bump proposed for the Pentagon budget is, thankfully, less than the $32 billion proposed by the Senate. But it’s still an unconscionable increase to a budget already overflowing with dangerous, ultra-wasteful line items like the President’s ‘Golden Dome’ grift and unchecked killer robot programs.

“It’s time for Congress to get its priorities straight and stop piling more money on the trillion-dollar Pentagon budget beset with fraud and waste, at the expense of priority human needs. The $8 billion in additional funds for the Pentagon are nearly enough to pay for SNAP benefits for the four million people who will lose them under the tax and budget reconciliation bill.

“Congress should unequivocally reject the bill and use this moment to voice its strong opposition to Hegseth’s reckless overseas killings, protracted domestic deployments of the National Guard, and countless other security and human rights breaches.”",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:02:00.802431

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy approved permits for the operation over the protests of environmental groups.","Group1 is developing a potassium-ion battery as an alternative to other battery sources, such as lithium-ion, which requires expensive rare earth metals.

“Lithium occurs in small quantities,” Ted Pagano, CEO of MPSC, told Crain’s. “Those supply chains are complicated and depend on critical metals and refining capacity. Whereas the unique use of an industrial mineral that we already produce in mass can be used. We’re not just making pallets of material, but sending out giant bulk trucks. The difference is substantive and uses a stable U.S. supply chain.”

Group1’s project isn’t commercialized yet, so the project remains mostly theoretical at this point. Much like the potash mine itself.

MPSC’s development of a potash mine outside of Evart has been more than 15 years in the making.

MPSC was scheduled to break ground in mid-2022 to supply more than 650,000 tons of potash and 1 million tons of food-grade salt by this year. Potash is one of three critical macronutrients required to sustain plant life found in fertilizers.

But raising $1.3 billion in capital toward the project proved difficult, as well as concerns over the mine’s environmental impact.

“The fact is, an average lifecycle to get a facility up and running in this industry, from discovery to when production starts, is 28 years,” Pagano said. “We are in the position we are in today because we have a supply chain that’s ultimately threatened. But because of the type of capital we need in this space, those providing the capital tend to be less patient in the U.S. than in competing nations.”

Pagano is referencing that financiers usually want their return on investment much sooner than in 30-plus years, making investing in infrastructure projects like this difficult.

Potash is a limited natural resource. It's only mined in 13 countries and is extracted from deep within the Earth's mantle. Potash mining in New Mexico and Utah is running low on the mineral salt high in potassium, as both deposits have been mined since around World War I.

Then in 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey announced it had discovered the purest known potash deposit on earth — roughly 7,800 feet below the surface in Evart. The potassium-rich rocks are a relic from the drying up of the Devonian Sea, a salt-rich sea like the Middle East's Dead Sea that covered much of Central Canada and the Northern U.S. 350 million years ago.

The deposit spans more than 15,000 acres in Osceola and Mecosta counties and has a projected value of $65 billion, according to the federal geology agency.

The rock core samples from Evart were given to the USGS by Canadian potash mine company Kalium and were retrieved from the earth in the 1980s.

Pagano created MPSC and worked alongside the USGS to test the old rock core samples in 2012 and has worked to start a mining operation in Evart ever since.

MPSC owns the 500 acres over the deposit. but has mineral leases on 5,000 acres from 450 different land owners.

The mine project gained traction in 2022 after the price of potash shot up more than 166% in the wake of sanctions against Belarus for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More than 40% of global production of potash comes from those two nations, and more than 96% of all potash used in the U.S. is imported.

The price of potash has since come down — $353.75 per metric ton last month.

But the project became a matter of national security under former President Joe Biden, whose U.S. Department of Energy authorized a conditional loan guarantee of up to $1.26 billion for the project late last year, solving its funding conundrum.

The mine project already had a $225 million bond from the state to lure investors, as well as inking a deal to sell its entire annual production to Chicago-based Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.

ADM is one of the largest food processors and commodities traders in the world. In 2024, the public company (NYSE: ADM) generated more than $85 billion in revenue.

The operation's slow start is also due to the potential environmental impact of the mining process. The company plans to drill holes to the deposit nearly 1.5 miles down and pump a brine solution to dissolve the potash, pump it back up to the surface, and then allow it to dry and re-enter a solid state.

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy approved permits for the operation over the protests of environmental groups. But some permitting requirements do remain, Pagano said.

Pagano said he cannot provide a date for when construction of the mine will begin, other than to say “as soon as possible,” but when it does, it’ll take three years to complete.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/potash%20mine-main_i_1.png,N,,2025-12-08 16:03:31.720359

Every great river carries great stories in its flow.

Stories of exploration and commerce, yes, but also of connection and belonging, collective action and empowerment.

And so every great river also needs its story keepers.

For the past five years, the University of Michigan’s Detroit River Story Lab has been supporting local efforts to lift up river stories and amplify the voices of their tellers. David Porter, an English professor and founder of the story lab, says he became interested in this collaborative work when he recognized how often community leaders brought up the importance of place-based storytelling in the context of their relationships with the river.

What followed was the development of multiple story-centered projects combining humanities scholarship and community engagement. The lab emerged as a collaboration between an interdisciplinary group of U-M faculty and a variety of local partners. From the outset, Porter said, “the mission was about catalyzing ongoing narrative infrastructure work in river-facing communities. The lab’s initial grant focused explicitly on supporting community-based storytelling projects.”

Since it received that first internal funding in the fall of 2020, the lab has focused on developing three overlapping narrative channels along the Detroit River corridor: place-based education, community heritage, and local journalism.

Today the lab works with dozens of public schools, youth organizations, museums, government agencies, news organizations, and nonprofits to help research and share out a variety of river stories and to support residents’ engagement with the region’s defining waterway through educational programs, interpretive installations, and long-form media stories.

A great example is the Detroit River Skiff and Schooner Program, which was launched in 2021 and provides high school and college students with opportunities such as boat-building workshops and tall ship outings featuring conversations with community experts on the river’s cultural and environmental heritage.

The lab also works with Detroit partners to resurface submerged stories along the river, and to collaborate on site-specific projects at locations including Historic Fort Wayne and the new Gordie Howe Bridge. Oral histories, exhibits and public events all promote environmental stewardship and a greater sense of community. Some of the dozens of projects featured on the lab’s website include an Underground Railroad Research Guide, a Digital Mapping Project featuring historical maps of the Detroit River corridor, and a StoryMap called Lives of Leisure and Labor on the Detroit River.

Some of Porter’s favorite river stories include those about the local histories of Black journalism and Black boating along the river, historical figures like Sarah E. Ray and Thornton and Lucie Blackburn, and present-day community leaders like Hadassah Greensky, Tepfirah Rushdan, Bruce Ross, Jason McGuire, Taylor Mitchell, and Shakara Tyler.

The lab sponsors student internships with the nonprofit news organizations of BridgeDetroit and Planet Detroit to assist them in reporting community stories.

And through the Detroit River Stories Podcast, U-M students interview Detroit residents about their relationship with the river, offering insights on everything from the city’s buried creeks to climate and commerce along the river to the essential role the U.S. Coast Guard plays in the flow of the river.

Another student-led project features a collection of interview-based stories focused on Belle Isle – the swimmers, the walkers, the fishers and the boaters. Porter says: “It’s another important contribution, since for so many Detroiters, the isle is a sanctuary from the city sprawl, a place of peace and reflection and resilience and grounding.”

Units from across U-M have engaged with the lab’s work over the past five years, contributing research expertise, grant funding and program development support. That includes faculty from the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the School of Environment and Sustainability, the Marsal Family School of Education, and Taubman College.

Additional U-M partners have included Rackham Graduate School, the Vice Provost for Engaged Learning, the Museum of Anthropological Archeology, the Graham Sustainability Institute, Poverty Solutions, Wolverine Pathways, and the Great Lakes Writers Corps.",https://detroit.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cropped-UofMLogo-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-08 16:03:37.986086

Apple’s lead environmental strategist, Lisa Jackson, is retiring in late January 2026 after 13 years on the job.

A direct replacement was not named. Instead, Jackson’s responsibilities as vice president for environment, policy and social initiatives will be split between two senior-level Apple executives after her departure.

Jennifer Newstead, who will join Apple as general counsel in March after serving in a similar capacity at Meta, will take over Jackson’s policy work. Apple’s environmental and social initiatives will now report to the company’s new chief operating officer, Sabih Khan, a mechanical engineer who has been closely involved with many of Apple’s green manufacturing and circular design initiatives.

Both executives report to CEO Tim Cook, as does Jackson.

Respected legacy

Jackson, a chemical engineer by training, joined Apple in 2013 after four years as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama.

Under her leadership, Apple has managed to reduce its emissions by more than 60 percent through deliberate investments in renewable energy in its supply chain and by transitioning to recycled and renewable options for 15 priority materials, such as aluminum, rare earths and lithium.

“She has also been a critical strategic partner in engaging governments around the world, advocating for the best interests of our users on a myriad of topics, as well as advancing our values, from education and accessibility to privacy and security,” said Cook in a prepared statement.

For example, Jackson spearheaded the company’s Racial and Equity Justice Initiative, launched in 2020 and focused on investing $100 million in diverse entrepreneurs and in programs aimed at reducing pollution in low-income communities.

“I have been lucky to work with leaders who understand that reducing our environmental impact is not just good for the environment, but good for business, and that we can do well by doing good,” Jackson said in a prepared statement. “I have every confidence that Apple will continue to have a profoundly positive impact on the planet and its people.”

Strategic continuity

Khan, Apple’s new COO, has been directly involved in delivering on many of Jackson’s strategies for the company’s supply chain, including the materials-replacements initiatives that helped the company avoid 6.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2024 alone.

Cook touted Khan’s work on advanced manufacturing technologies that have reduced emissions when he announced his promotion in July.

Washington – In a letter sent to Congress today, more than 230 national, state and local organizations from across the country called for a full national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers. The letter cites massive and unsustainable consumption by data centers of energy and water resources, and skyrocking utility costs for families and small businesses. The letter was facilitated by the national environmental group Food & Water Watch, and signed by organizations including Physicians for Social Responsibility, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Progressive Democrats of America, Our Revolution and Americans for Financial Reform.

The letter states, in part:

“The rapid expansion of data centers across the United States, driven by the generative artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto booms, presents one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation. This expansion is rapidly increasing demand for energy, driving more fossil fuel pollution, straining water resources and raising electricity prices across the country… We urge you to join our call for a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities, our families, our environment and our health from the runaway damage this industry is already inflicting.”

“At a time when millions of Americans are already struggling with soaring utility costs, the sudden explosion of the Big Data industry represents an existential threat for communities ill-equipped to handle the massive environmental and economic hardships these data centers inflict,” said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch. “The only prudent action is to halt the unfettered expansion of this dangerous industry in order to properly examine all manner of potential harm before it’s too late.”

Already, energy demand from data centers in the U.S. is expected to increase up to threefold between 2023 and 2028. And recent analysis from Food & Water Watch found that by 2028, AI-supporting data centers could consume:

720 billion gallons of water annually simply to cool the facilities — equal to more than 1 million Olympic-size swimming pools, or enough water to meet the indoor needs of 18.5 million American households.

300 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy annually — enough electricity to power over 28 million American households.

Meanwhile, this summer the Trump administration released an “AI Action Plan,” which outlines its priorities related to the advancement of so-called “artificial intelligence” and the industries supporting it – including massive energy- and water-intensive data centers. Among other things, Trump’s plan seeks to dismantle existing environmental and land use rules that it views as a hindrance to the unfettered growth of these industries.

Morgan Stanley on Tesla: The electric vehicle giant was named the top automotive stock by Jonas for 2025. The analyst had held an Outperform rating since 2023 and had been bullish on many aspects of the company, including the new pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Percoco has a different idea going forward, suggesting that the AI opportunity for the company is offset by automotive headwinds and a full valuation.

""With downside to consensus estimates driven by pressures in the auto business and catalysts for it non-auto business priced in at its current valuation, we assume coverage at Equal-weight with a $424 price target and wait for a better entry point,"" Percoco said.

The analyst said Tesla is a leader in electric vehicles, renewable energy, manufacturing, and real-world AI, which should give it a premium valuation.

""However, high expectations on the latter (AI) have brought the stock closer to fair valuation.""

The analyst sees challenging catalysts for Tesla going forward, which could provide downside to estimates.

""We believe it will be increasingly challenging to support meaningful upside to Tesla shares barring an improvement, or at least stabilization, within its auto business.""

Along with the base case price target of $425, Percoco has a bull case valuation of $860 and a bear case valuation of $145 on Tesla stock.

Morgan Stanley on General Motors: While Percoco sees Tesla stock less favorable than Jonas, the new automotive analyst for Morgan Stanley sees a brighter short-term future for General Motors.

""Over the course of the last year, GM made strides in realigning their capital allocation strategy with a more tempered EV and AV growth curve,"" Percoco said.

The analyst said General Motors could benefit from reduced policy uncertainty, the ending of EV tax credits, and reductions in emissions-related requirements.

""We expect GM to manage through with an appropriately re-aligned capital allocation strategy and refreshed product lineup highlighting strength in GM's core ICE trucks and SUVs.""

Percoco said investors could see a ""prolongation of ‘ICE is Nice' narrative"" for traditional automakers.

""As a result of easing compliance requirements, OEMs can leverage consumer preference for higher-value ICE and hybrid vehicles.""

A shift back to ICE vehicles by consumers in 2026 could be a tailwind for General Motors.

While neither company has completely abandoned its electric vehicle presence, changes to growth plans and focusing on ICE vehicles could pay off in the short term, according to Percoco.

Morgan Stanley on Auto Sector: The analyst expects electric vehicle volume to be down 20% year-over-year in the United States for 2026, painting a cautious outlook on the pure-play EV companies like Tesla, Rivian and Lucid.

The analyst forecasts ICE vehicle sales in the U.S. market to be up 1% year-over-year in 2026.

""Position your portfolio toward best in class operators that can navigate a slower industry outlook by allocating capital effectively with a strong execution track record (General Motors),"" Percoco said.

The analyst warned investors to ""be wary"" of companies facing industry headwinds, such as EV deceleration.

GM, TSLA Price Action: General Motors stock is down 0.5% to $75.69 on Monday versus a 52-week trading range of $41.60 to $77.00. General Motors shares are up 47.3% year-to-date in 2025.

Tesla stock is down 3.6% to $438.84 on Monday versus a 52-week trading range of $214.25 to $488.54. Tesla shares are up 15.6% year-to-date in 2025.

But to fully leverage natural gas, we need a permitting system that lets pipelines and storage facilities come online faster.
Permitting review should focus on supporting businesses looking to build critical energy infrastructure in the United States, rather than hindering them with petty litigation, lengthy review processes, and convoluted standards.
To do this, the NPC recommends a massive permitting system overhaul, focused on standardizing and expediting the review process.
Data proves that a strong majority of voters support updating the permitting process to speed up energy development.","Reducing litigation backlogs, expediting critical project timelines, and standardizing processes are critical steps to overhauling America’s broken permitting system, says a new report from the National Petroleum Council (NPC), issued at the request of Energy Secretary Chris Wright. The report comes amid rising energy costs as AI data centers and increased U.S. energy exports have skyrocketed demand. The NPC’s findings serve as a collaborative roadmap for government and industry to work together on streamlining permits.

NPC’s analysis points out that current permitting pitfalls don’t merely cause logistical issues, they also cause a structural vulnerability to the nation’s energy system, causing regional price volatility, supply insecurity, increased prices, and job loss. America is at a tipping point: we either overhaul the permitting process to build the infrastructure needed to keep up with energy demand, or face serious economic consequences.

Energy Secretary Wright, who ordered the NPC report in June, welcomed its findings as an important step toward reform:

“The National Petroleum Council’s findings confirm what President Trump has said from day one: America needs more energy infrastructure, less red tape, and serious permitting reform. These recommendations will help make energy more affordable for every American household.”

As Energy in Depth has examined in previous analysis, outdated permitting rules have slowed the development of projects critical for energy security and reliability. But momentum is building for change. In September, a diverse coalition of America’s energy and business leaders sent letters to congress, urging them to act quickly to modernize the permitting system: streamlining the system so that projects can better develop and everyday people can reap the benefit quickly of new infrastructure construction.

Getting It Done

The NPC report illustrates how demand is outpacing the capacity of our energy infrastructure, particularly for natural gas. Between 2013 and 2024, U.S. natural gas demand increased by 49 percent, while pipeline capacity grew only 26 percent and storage capacity rose an incremental two percent from 2013 to 2023.

Natural gas will continue to play a vital role in powering business and homes for the foreseeable future, thanks to its abundance and affordability. It is also the perfect partner for renewables, ready to fill in when wind and solar output dips. But to fully leverage natural gas, we need a permitting system that lets pipelines and storage facilities come online faster. Permitting reform is key to optimizing natural gas delivery and ensuring reliable, affordable energy when and where it’s needed.

The NPC report outlined several major pitfalls in the current permitting process that must be addressed:

Litigation Risk: Lengthy environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) leave projects incredibly vulnerable to lawsuits. On average, nearly one-third of projects which are mandated to perform an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) face a court challenge, with 90 percent of cases alleging a NEPA violation. Lawsuits delay projects by one to two years and can even take four years if appealed to circuit courts.

Convoluted Review: The current permitting framework is overly complex and project-specific, lacking standardization and the ability to expedite proposals. Developers must navigate a maze of agencies and reviews, often duplicating efforts. This process-heavy approach makes it difficult to advance even the most critical projects.

Slow (and Reversable) Approvals: The vast majority of EIS reviews take more than two years to complete, and that’s before accounting for multiagency permit sign-offs. This process can take four to five years not including litigation delays. Furthermore, even if a project is approved, its permit can be revoked on the basis of policy, meaning political changes can undo years of planning and investment.

Permitting review should focus on supporting businesses looking to build critical energy infrastructure in the United States, rather than hindering them with petty litigation, lengthy review processes, and convoluted standards.

To do this, the NPC recommends a massive permitting system overhaul, focused on standardizing and expediting the review process. In the near term, some pitfalls can be remedied by amending NEPA to focus on environmental impacts within its purview and reducing backlog in the judicial review process. In the long term, federal and state governments should shift from case-specific to standardized reviews that allow for expedited approval based on clearly articulated standards. Predictable permitting for routine oil and gas activities and expedited approval of electric power infrastructure development will be crucial to match increased energy demand.

As it stands, permitting review is needlessly convoluted and bogged down by political agenda. A standardized system would reorient development to focus on transparency and efficiency: giving America the tools it needs to maintain energy dominance and technological innovation.

The Way Forward

Fortunately, permitting reform has attracted many allies pushing hard for action in recent months. On top of the calls from business and industry groups this fall, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are actively pushing for permitting reform legislation— such as the SPEED Act— and Secretary Wrigth have welcomed the NPC’s recommendations, viewing them as a blueprint for constructive action. NPC Executive Director John Dabbar emphasized the collaborative nature of the report’s findings:

“These studies show what’s possible when industry, government and stakeholders work together to address complex energy challenges with facts and forward-looking solutions.”

The NPC report is an important step forward, shining a light on concrete actions that the federal government, lawmakers and individual agencies must take steps to address permitting inefficiencies.

Data proves that a strong majority of voters support updating the permitting process to speed up energy development. Not only does overhauling permitting have public support, but it is also the key to enhancing domestic infrastructure that can keep up with technological innovation and booming energy demand. A modernized permitting framework would enable critical projects such as pipelines, power plants, refineries, and LNG export terminals to be built in pace with demand, ensuring energy supply and maintaining U.S. global competitiveness.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EID-NPC-120825.png,N,,2025-12-08 16:04:20.609629

The addition of 4.7 GW established Q3 2025 as the strongest third-quarter on record for new storage capacity installations.
The 63% growth in clean power capacity added by Texas in Q3 compared to Q2 was largely due to the increase in storage capacity, which the GulfStar Storage project contributed to.
The total clean power project pipeline reached186 GW at the close of Q3 2025.","The third quarter of 2025 saw significant additions across the clean power sector. Of the 11.7 GW of total capacity added, utility-scale solar and battery storage accounted for 91% of the total, said a quarterly report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

Solar provided 6 GW, representing 51% of quarterly capacity additions. Energy storage capacity accounted for 4.7 GW resulting in 40% of additions for the quarter, said ACP.

Developers connected 5,932 MW of utility-scale solar capacity to the grid during the third quarter of 2025. Quarterly solar additions were 4% higher than the previous quarter. However, installations were about 5% lower than the third quarter of 2024, the report said.

The cumulative operational solar capacity in the U.S. reached 146,228 MW at the close of Q3 2025. This capacity delivers electricity to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The sector has maintained a high rate of construction, with developers connecting more than 71 GW of new capacity since the start of 2023.

The largest utility-scale solar project phase brought online in Q3 2025 was Excelsior Energy Capital’s Faraday B Solar. Located in Utah County, Utah, the project added 525 MW of generation capacity. The project features 1.2 million solar panels. Construction was completed in a period of under two years. This project alone contributed significantly to Utah joining the top ten states for clean power additions in the quarter.

Battery storage capacity surpassed 40 GW of operational capacity in Q3 2025. The quarter ended with a total operational capacity of 40,321 MW, corresponding to 112,002 MWh of energy storage.

Developers commissioned 50 new battery storage projects during the third quarter. These projects added 4,686 MW of new capacity to the grid. The addition of 4.7 GW established Q3 2025 as the strongest third-quarter on record for new storage capacity installations. It ranks as the second-largest quarter for new storage additions in U.S. history. Installations increased by 32% year-over-year compared to Q3 2024 installations.

The largest battery storage project to achieve commercial operation in Q3 was Enel Green Power North America’s 359 MW GulfStar Storage. The project is located in Wharton County, Texas. GulfStar Storage is co-located with a 450 MW solar phase, GulfStar Solar.

Texas remained the top state for clean power additions in Q3 2025. The state accounted for 39% of total added capacity in the U.S. during the quarter. The 63% growth in clean power capacity added by Texas in Q3 compared to Q2 was largely due to the increase in storage capacity, which the GulfStar Storage project contributed to.

The total clean power project pipeline reached186 GW at the close of Q3 2025. Battery storage and solar accounted for 90% of pipeline growth over the last year. Solar made up the largest share of the pipeline, accounting for 53% with nearly 100 GW of capacity under development.

The solar pipeline has grown at an average pace of 2% each quarter over the last two years. Battery storage represents the second largest share of the pipeline at 24% The storage pipeline contains over 45 GW of capacity.

This capacity has more than doubled since Q3 2023. The technology’s average quarterly growth over the past two years was 11%, making it the technology with the highest average growth rate. The storage pipeline did contract slightly over the past two quarters.

The group says it views the proposal as an environmentally responsible and fiscally practical solution to Binghamton’s solid waste management challenges.

“Implementing a system that diverts food scraps and other organic materials from the landfill will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane, and extend the operational life of the county landfill, as well as reduce tipping fees for Binghamton,” the Sierra Club says.

The group added that the proposed three-stream approach, separating recyclables, compostables, and residential waste, aligns with guidance from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and supports the intent of New York State’s Food Donation and Food Scraps Recycling Law.

According to the proposal filed with the Binghamton City council, the three-stream waste disposal system “provides the best solution to Binghamton’s blue bag concerns in an environmentally responsible way, addresses concerns raised by residents and financially benefitting both residents and the city.”

The proposed three-stream hybrid solid waste disposal solution would call for residents to use blue bags only for non-compostable waste in addition to the city addressing various issues of concern, recycling to remain as is and food scraps placed separately in a covered bin or a compostable bag.

In addition, garbage that does not fit in bags, like broken furniture, can be set out with or without stickers (as the council sees fit). The proposal notes that one of the reasons stickers were discontinued is because they were even less popular than the blue bags.

The news, of course, was not that Van Epps defeated Democrat Aftyn Behn, but that he only won by nine percentage points in a district that President Trump carried by 22 a year earlier.

You can read about the race here and here.

The Tennessee race, combined with last month’s elections in Virginia and New Jersey, have strengthened the Democrats’ belief they can take the House in 2026. (Democrats also did well in last month’s North Carolina municipal races.)

If Democrats can over-perform in Tennessee, can they flip a congressional seat in purpler North Carolina?

Let’s start with the state’s new congressional map, approved this year. The GOP further gerrymandered the map to bolster their chances of winning 11 of 14 seats instead of the 10 Republicans hold today.

The only changes were in the 1st and 3rd districts:

The Democrats now hold three safe seats: the 12th, 4th and 2nd. Don Davis also represents the 1st District in the northeast, but his district was redrawn this year and made more Republican. Despite the new map, he’s running for reelection.

Here are some of President Trump’s winning margins in 2024:

11th District (western NC/Asheville) Trump +9.5 (Republican Chuck Edwards)

1st District (northeastern NC/coast) Trump +11 (Democrat Don Davis in a redrawn district)

3rd District (Jacksonville) Trump +13 (Republican Greg Murphy)

7th District (Wilmington) Trump +14 (Republican David Rouzer)

14th District (west Mecklenburg/Gaston) Trump +15 (Republican Tim Moore)

Even before last week’s special election in Tennessee, national Democrats said they would invest in the 11th District, hoping to defeat Republican Chuck Edwards.

There are a few reasons for Democrats to have hope in the mountains.

The 2024 election represented a great year for Republicans. Almost every N.C. county shifted to the right compared to the 2020 election. But there were a few counties that bucked that trend, including three in the 11th: Henderson (suburban Asheville), Buncombe (Asheville) and Transylvania (Brevard).

Kamala Harris picked up about two percentage points more in each county compared to Joe Biden in 2020. Is that a sign of a real shift to the left?

Here is a New York Times map of the change in results from 2020 to 2024. Areas in blue didn’t necessarily vote for Harris, but they did become more Democratic:

The Democrats may have a good candidate in Jamie Ager. There are several people running in the March primary, but Ager is considered the leader.

His grandfather, Jamie Clarke, represented the district as a Democrat in Congress for three non-consecutive terms from 1983 to 1991. His father served in the state House, and his brother Eric Ager is currently a House member.

Moe Davis, who lost to Madison Cawthorn in 2020, left the race after a bitter dispute with party leaders about alleged favoritism toward Ager.

Finally, there is Hurricane Helene recovery. Are swing voters OK with the pace of reconstruction? Or do they punish Edwards and the GOP? President Trump named Republican U.S. Senate candidate Michael Whatley as the Helene “recovery czar” in January, and Democrats are going to hammer him for what they say is a lackluster recovery.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ca3e3d6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6016x3158+0+543/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwfae%2Ffiles%2F201904%2Fvoting_stock_photo.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 15:02:48.610811

That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.","CRAIG — The Cooper family knows how to work heavy machinery. The kids could run a hay baler by their early teens, and two of the three ran monster-sized drills at the coal mines along with their dad.

But learning to maneuver the shiny red drill they use to tap into underground heat feels different. It’s a critical part of the Colorado family’s new business, High Altitude Geothermal, which installs geothermal heat pumps that use the Earth’s constant temperature to heat and cool buildings. At stake is not just their livelihood but a century-long family legacy of producing energy in Moffat County.

Like many families in Craig, the Coopers have worked in coal for generations — and in oil before that. That’s ending for Matt Cooper and his son Matthew as one of three coal mines in the area closes in a statewide shift to cleaner energy.

“People have to start looking beyond coal,” said Matt Cooper. “And that can be a multitude of things. Our economy has been so focused on coal and coal-fired power plants. And we need the diversity.”

Many countries and about half of U.S. states are moving away from coal, citing environmental impacts and high costs. Burning coal emits carbon dioxide that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

President Donald Trump has boosted coal as part of his agenda to promote fossil fuels. He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

That’s created uncertainty in places like Craig. As some families like the Coopers plan for the next stage of their careers, others hold out hope that Trump will save their plants, mines and high-paying jobs.

Matt and Matthew Cooper work at the Colowyo Mine near Meeker, though active mining has ended and site cleanup begins in January.

The mine employs about 130 workers and supplies Craig Generating Station, a 1,400-megawatt coal-fired plant. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is planning to close Craig’s Unit 1 by year’s end for economic reasons and to meet legal requirements for reducing emissions. The other two units will close in 2028.

Xcel Energy owns coal-fired Hayden Station, about 30 minutes away. It said it doesn’t plan to change retirement dates for Hayden, though it’s extending another coal unit in Pueblo in part due to increased demand for electricity.

The Craig and Hayden plants together employ about 200 people.

Craig residents have always been entrepreneurial and that spirit will get them through this transition, said Kirstie McPherson, board president for the Craig Chamber of Commerce. Still, she said, just about everybody here is connected to coal.

“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said. “When that starts going away, beyond just the individuals that are having the identity crisis, you have an entire culture, an entire community that is also having that same crisis.”

Phasing out coal

Coal has been central to Colorado’s economy since before statehood, but it’s generally the most expensive energy on today’s grid, said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

“We are not going to let this administration drag us backwards into an overreliance on expensive fossil fuels,” Polis said in a statement.

Nationwide, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than it was in 2021, costing consumers $6.2 billion more, according to a June analysis from Energy Innovation. The nonpartisan think tank cited significant increases to run aging plants as well as inflation.

Colorado’s six remaining coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close or convert to natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal, by 2031. The state is rapidly adding solar and wind that’s cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants. Renewable energy provides more than 40% of Colorado’s power now and will pass 70% by the end of the decade, according to statewide utility plans.

Nationwide, wind and solar growth has remained strong, producing more electricity than coal in 2025, as of the latest data in October, according to energy think tank Ember.

But some states want to increase or at least maintain coal production. That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.

Planning for the future

The Coopers have gone all-in on geothermal.

“Maybe we’ll never go back to coal,” Matt Cooper said. “We haven’t (gone) back to oil and gas, so we might just be geothermal people for quite some time, maybe generations, and then eventually something else will come along.”

While the Coopers were learning to use their drill in October, Wade Gerber was in downtown Craig distilling grain neutral spirits — used to make gin and vodka — on a day off from the Craig Station power plant. Gerber stepped over his corgis, Ali and Boss, and onto a stepladder to peer into a massive stainless steel pot where he was heating wheat and barley.

Gerber’s spent three decades in coal. When closure plans were announced four years ago, he, his wife Tenniel and their friend McPherson brainstormed business ideas.

“With my background in plumbing and electrical from the plant, it’s like, oh yeah, I can handle that part of it,” Gerber said about distilling. “This is the easy part.”

He used Tri-State’s education subsidies for classes in distilling, while other co-workers learned to fix vehicles or repair guns to find new careers. While some plan to leave town, Gerber is opening Bad Alibi Distillery. McPherson and Tenniel Gerber are opening a cocktail bar next door.

Everyone in town hopes Trump will step in to extend the plant’s life, Gerber said. Meanwhile, they’re trying to define a new future for Craig in a nerve-wracking time.

“For me, my products can go elsewhere. I don’t necessarily have to sell it in Craig, there’s that avenue. For someone relying on Craig, it’s even scarier,” he said.

Questioning the coal rollback

Tammy Villard owns a gift shop, Moffat Mercantile, with her husband. After the coal closures were announced, they opened a commercial print shop too, seeing it as a practical choice for when so many high-paying jobs go away.

Villard, who spent a decade at Colowyo as administrative staff, said she doesn’t understand how the state can throw the switch to turn off coal and still have reliable electricity. She wants the state to slow down.

Villard describes herself as a moderate Republican. She said political swings at the federal level — from the green energy push in the last administration to doubling down on fossil fuels in this one — aren’t helpful.

“The pendulum has to come back to the middle,” she said, “and we are so far out to either side that I don’t know how we get back to that middle.”

Governments are setting net zero goals, industries are recalibrating around cleaner inputs, and investors are chasing technologies and regions best positioned to deliver. For companies that power, produce, and manufacture, the question is no longer if but how fast the transition will redefine their footprint—and where to invest next.

With global energy investment surpassing three trillion USD, two trillion of it in clean technologies and infrastructure, industrial developers and tenants are rethinking how facilities are planned and built to evolve as technologies mature. Sites must be flexible, resilient, low-carbon, and future-proof for new processes, products, and partnerships. From energy hubs to advanced manufacturing campuses, architecture and engineering help to define and critically enable industrial competitiveness.

Different Pathways, Shared Direction

In the UK, government policy and public and private investments are accelerating low-carbon transformation. Frameworks such as the Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy and Heat Network Transformation Programme are turning former industrial sites into low-carbon ecosystems. Our experience in consulting with one of Europe’s premier energy network and energy infrastructure leaders will result in two transformative, city-wide district heating systems, setting a new benchmark for sustainable urban energy. These energy centers are central to decarbonizing the large-scale heat networks and their ambitious net zero targets, translating policy ambition into built infrastructure—providing heating and cooling to a large portion of the city’s properties.

Canadian provinces are defining their own transition models. Alberta is leveraging its industrial base and infrastructure to pioneer clean hydrogen production, establish carbon-capture and storage hubs, and deploy modular clean-energy systems. Ontario is advancing electrification, grid modernization, and EV manufacturing, anchoring a corridor of innovation that connects utilities, manufacturers, and institutional users. Together, these efforts are reshaping Canada’s industrial landscape aligning investment, innovation, and infrastructure around a cleaner energy economy.

In the US, utilities and industrial operators are advancing clean-energy infrastructure through private investment. Companies in California have committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 and a climate-positive system by 2050, aligning corporate strategy with long-term resilience goals. Organizations are modernizing central utilities by uniting operational efficiency and resilience within an integrated, low-carbon design.

Different starting points, one shared direction: decarbonization and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions.

Urban-Integrated Energy Hubs: From Plant to Civic Asset

As compact, high-performance plants that distribute heat or power, urban energy centers are evolving from functional utilities into civic assets. They are now being designed as important landmarks integrated into the public realm. High-quality designs proudly demonstrating their positive, decarbonization values.

The UK embodies this shift. Borough councils are prioritizing new facilities that distribute low-carbon heat through rooftop air-source heat pumps, projected to cut emissions by more than 3,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually in a network’s first phase alone (equivalent to taking 2,000 cars off the road). Designed for tight urban sites, these energy centers balance technical precision with civic presence, integrating advanced systems within an architectural form that enhances its surroundings.

Design also activates impact at energy centers in retrofitted buildings. This approach preserves a building’s signature features while accommodating a new rooftop plant and acoustic screening. Air-source heat pumps are integrated into the existing facility, enabling measurable carbon savings while preserving the identity of an urban landmark.

Decarbonization, Efficiency, and Circular Energy Flows

Net zero requires more than cleaner fuels; it demands re-engineering how energy moves through systems. Circular energy models are creating closed loops where waste heat, renewables, and advanced controls work together to reduce demand and emissions.

The Bradford Energy Centre and regional data center show this integration in practice. The energy center generates hot water for the city’s district heating network. Adjacent to it, the data center captures waste heat from high-performance computing as heat energy to feed that network. It’s a symbiotic ecosystem linking digital and industrial infrastructure to decarbonize urban districts.

Beyond these new builds and energy or data centers, retrofit strategies are transforming other legacy assets. Modernized hospital systems are introducing low-carbon energy infrastructure even in remote island environments. In the Scotch whisky sector, distilleries integrating mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) technology now reuse process heat once lost to the atmosphere—an approach that is moving an energy-intensive industry toward lower-carbon production.

With integrated architectural and engineering design, efficiency is embedded from foundation to façade, reducing energy use, lowering emissions, and increasing resilience across the asset lifecycle.

Flexibility, Resilience, and Future-Proofing

Viability assessments, feasibility studies, and master plans are as critical to the energy transition as design. Technologies shift, markets adjust, and supply chains adapt, making flexibility a strategic advantage.

Our approach with energy centers incorporates water source heat pumps, electrolysis systems, and large-scale thermal storage in the design. Located at large power stations and manufacturing sites, the energy centers capture industrial waste heat from their cooling processes to provide heat, to support and further decarbonize the city-wide heat network.

The same principle is reshaping North America. For developers and operators, adaptable infrastructure hedges against both regulatory uncertainty and technological change, preserving asset value as markets evolve. Flexibility delivers continuity, resilience the return on investment.

Multi-Stakeholder and Community Value

Clean-energy infrastructure delivers more than carbon reduction. It creates shared civic and economic value. Collaboration across sectors is redefining how energy assets are financed, designed, and operated, reflecting the growing influence of ESG-driven investment priorities.

In the UK, operational energy plants merge with educational and exhibition spaces, connecting industrial innovation to workforce development and community engagement. Here, infrastructure inspires, informs, and strengthens regional economies—a growing priority for public funders and private investors.

Collaboration is also increasingly market driven. The path toward net zero and climate-positive goals includes partnerships with communities and suppliers to advance local resilience. In the US, modernization of central utilities integrates workforce training and operational research, linking infrastructure investment to knowledge creation.

Projects that deliver co-benefits (environmental, social, and economic) are not only more fundable, but they’re also more enduring. The infrastructure of transition succeeds when it serves both its operators and its communities.

Building the Infrastructure of Transition

Across regions, whether through retrofits that preserve identity or modular systems that scale with demand, design is both the expression and the engine of transition.

To make that transition real, our Industrial designers reflect occupancy behavior, schedules, and operating conditions to deliver systems that meet or exceed sustainability targets.",https://norr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IA-Clean-Energy-Infrastructure-Hero-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:02:42.892394

By Vallari Srivastava and Laila Kearney

Dec 8 (Reuters) - U.S. utility company NextEra Energy has expanded its partnership with Alphabet's Google Cloud to build new energy supplies for the company's operations across the U.S., the groups said on Monday.

NextEra and Google currently have ​3.5 gigawatts of electricity generation - enough to power about 2.5 million homes - in operation or contracted.

As part of the new deal, ‌the companies will develop multiple new large-scale data center campuses in the U.S. that will be built with new power plants. They did not specify how much extra capacity ‌would be added, or financial details of the agreement.

NextEra shares were down 1% by 1722 GMT, having risen in premarket trading.

The agreement comes as U.S. electricity demand reaches record highs from the proliferation of data centers needed to train and roll out artificial intelligence.

Without enough supplies readily available on the existing grid, giant technology companies are contracting to build new electricity sources to power their AI data center expansion.

""We are positioning our company around bring-your-own-generation, ⁠and we are uniquely positioned to win this,"" NextEra ‌CEO John Ketchum said at an investor conference.

NextEra and Google Cloud also plan to launch an AI-powered product by mid-2026 that will help manage work in the field, predicting energy equipment problems and other functions aimed at ‍increasing the reliability of the grid, the companies said.

NextEra said it expects to add 15 gigawatts, or possibly much more, of new power generation for data centers by 2035.

Also to serve that demand, NextEra will partner with ExxonMobil to develop natural-gas-fired power plants for data centers that use carbon capture technologies.

Plans with Exxon include ​an initial 1.2-gigawatt gas plant, which would be jointly marketed to data centers, that would be located near the oil major's carbon ‌dioxide-carrying pipeline in the Southeast U.S., NextEra said.

RENEWED INTEREST IN NUCLEAR POWER

In October, NextEra announced that it would restart its shut Duane Arnold nuclear power plant in Iowa to power Google data centers under a 25-year power purchase contract.

The technology industry's quest for massive amounts of electricity for AI processing has renewed interest in nuclear power supply, which includes restarting fully shut reactors, expanding the capacity of operating plants, and contracting for electricity from future small modular reactors.

That electricity demand has also propelled the development of natural-gas-fired power, which is quicker to build than nuclear, but ⁠produces global warming emissions.

NextEra said it expects to announce new natural-gas-fired power deals for ​data centers in 12–24 months.

NextEra said it had also signed 11 power purchase agreements ​and two energy storage agreements with Meta Platforms, totaling over 2.5 GW of energy contracts. The projects are scheduled to come online between 2026 and 2028.

The utility has also reached an agreement with WPPI Energy to continue supplying 168 ‍megawatts of the output from the ⁠Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Two Rivers into the 2050s.

NextEra forecast higher adjusted profit in 2026 as well as the current year as it continues to benefit from the power demand surge.

The company now expects adjusted earnings for 2025 of between $3.62 and $3.70 per ⁠share, compared with its prior view of between $3.45 and $3.70 per share.

For 2026, it expects adjusted profit between $3.92 and $4.02 per share, compared with its prior view of between $3.63 and $4.00 per ‌share.

The initiative will be carried out through the Center for Aquatic Technology Transfer, a Forest Service office in Blacksburg that focuses on aquatic ecosystem science and management in national forests.

Virginia Tech will lead the human resources component, hiring and training technicians and crew leaders to conduct fieldwork. With the ability to call on current graduate students as well as connections to alumni with experience conducting analysis in a forest environment, the university can rapidly contract 20 employees to form teams and begin critical data collection in early 2026.

The benefit to the university comes in the experience students receive in providing this vital field research.

“We facilitate the hiring process, and we also facilitate the science to allow all of our federal scientists to engage with the resources of the university, not only the people we work with at the Forest Service,” said Joel Snodgrass, head of the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation. “For the university, and especially for our students, we get this access to funding opportunities for experiential learning and opportunities for graduate student projects. It works a lot like most of the other embedded federal scientists that we have with us.”

Thousands of acres of national forest were damaged by Helene in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Most funding stems from damage in North Carolina, but the work spans the entire Southern Appalachian region.

The project aims to document, evaluate, and prioritize hurricane-related damage to aquatic and forest ecosystems. Field teams will assess entire watersheds, giving forest managers data to identify high-priority areas for remediation and plan interventions that restore ecological integrity, improve public safety, and support long-term forest health.

Colin Krause, a fisheries biologist at the Center for Aquatic Technology Transfer, said initial work will focus on North Carolina and Virginia.

“The teams are going to be focused initially on storm damage assessments, where the teams are able to walk the entire lengths of streams within watersheds, on Forest Service lands, trying to find out where these damaged feature locations are,” Krause said. “They're looking for damaged items. They're looking for sites that are damaged or under the threat of damage, such as things like ecological integrity and forest health, or things that might impact human life or health.”",https://news.vt.edu/content/news_vt_edu/en/articles/2025/12/cnre-heleneassessmentgrant/_jcr_content/image.transform/l-medium/image.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 14:02:35.087536

Major headaches.

The 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling inSackett v. EPA was supposed to make it easier for farmers and other landowners to navigate, no pun intended, Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) law. The 5-4 majority decision written by Justice Samuel A. Alito rejected the court’s tortured logic in Rapanos v. U.S. that left stakeholders without clarity in favor of something more straightforward:

“In sum, we hold that the [Clean Water Act] extends to only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are ‘waters of the United States’ in their own right,” so that they are ‘indistinguishable’ from those waters.”

There isn’t much wiggle room in Alito’s decision. Only wetlands that have a continuous and indistinguishable surface connection to a larger regulated body of water may be regulated by the CWA.

But that’s not how the Environmental Protection Agency sees it. Just ask Iowa landowner Dan Ward, who wanted to build a pond that would have torn up a farm ditch on his property. Under its amended WOTUS regulation in the wake of Sackett, EPA ruled Ward’s only-seasonally wet ditch qualified as a relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing body of water.

The goofy folk at EPA demanded Ward pay for an assessment. And an archaeology study. And a wildlife habitat study. And, oh yeah, submit a plan to restore or build a new stream of equal size to replace the farm ditch. That’s insane.

But now there’s a new proposal looking to conform Waters of the U.S. with the Sackett ruling; released last month, it provides fresh definitions for key terms including “relatively permanent”:

“In this proposal, the agencies define ‘relatively permanent’ to mean ‘standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year round or at least during the wet season.’ Consistent with the Sackett decision, ephemeral waters (i.e., those with surface water flowing or standing only in direct response to precipitation (e.g., rain or snow fall) ) are not jurisdictional because they are not relatively permanent.”

I imagine Ward is somewhere applauding a return to sanity.

But there’s more. The proposal also attempts to provide clarity to “continuous surface connection” language:

“In this proposal, however, the agencies would define ‘continuous surface connection’ for the first time to mean ‘having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.’ Thus, the agencies’ proposed definition of ‘continuous surface connection’ provides a two-prong test that requires both (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season.”

Certainly, agricultural interests must be heartened by EPA’s exclusions to “ditches dug in dry land regardless of flow,” prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems.

Environmental groups believe the WOTUS proposal is Armageddon. Just listen to Waterkeeper Alliance:

“By narrowing the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, this reinterpretation removes federal safeguards from many rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and other vital waterways. Without oversight, these waters face increased risks from pollution, threatening clean drinking water, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic life.”

I’m not sure it’s all that. Generally speaking, I’m in favor of laws and regulations that everyone can wrap their heads around. Farmers shouldn’t have to hire a world-class law team to determine the legalities of digging a pond.

But you know as well as I, that whatever the EPA finally lands on in a final ruling sometime next year won’t be final. Not even close. If Democrats take back the White House in 2028, there will be another shiny new WOTUS proposal. Not to mention in the interim any number of lawsuits filed after EPA publishes WOTUS changes in the Federal Register.

What recent history has shown is that WOTUS regulations are temporal, amounting to a hamster spinning on its exercise wheel. A functioning Congress could codify WOTUS definitions. But it’s dysfunctional. Congress can’t even produce a federally-mandated new Farm Bill — instead relying on year-to-year extensions and, most recently, some updates Republicans snuck into the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

None of this is lost on the nation’s farmers. Missouri Farm Bureau President Garrett Hawkins told EPA during a May listening session that “We’ve seen WOTUS definitions, guidance and legal arguments change with each administration” and that “farmers, land owners and small businesses are the ones who suffer the most when we don’t have clear rules.”

Unfortunately, EPA’s new WOTUS plan, no matter how well intended it might be, is at best a bandage for more systemic problems that can’t be solved with a rewrite. The feds have shown themselves incapable of reaching anything resembling a bipartisan solution. EPA says the new WOTUS plan inspires to give states a more significant role:

“This proposal recognizes that states and tribes know their local land and water resources best. The proposed definition of WOTUS protects water quality by affirming federal protections where appropriate and supporting the role of states and tribes as primary regulators managing their own land and water resources. Cooperative federalism has been a cornerstone of Clean Water Act implementation and the agency’s proposed WOTUS rule at last fulfills that commitment to real, shared federal and state responsibility.”

To that I say, we’ll see. It sounds noble, working together for the greater good. But it’s not outrageous to ask if EPA can actually deliver on that promise.

It makes me wonder if perhaps a better long-term solution is to turn over most of WOTUS regulation directly to state governments, and scale back the number of waterways and wetlands that fall under federal jurisdiction.

The Amarillo, Texas-based real estate investment trust focused on data centres has touted Matador as an integrated energy facility to service the needs of AI. The 11-megawatt project aims to combine nuclear, solar, gas and utility grid power with battery energy storage.

Fermi so far has agreed to buy nuclear complex equipment from South Korea in its mission to secure US ‘AI sovereignty’, and secured a tax rebate for the Texas panhandle zone where Matador is based. Last month the company, whose co-founder Rick Perry is an ex-governor of Texas and former US energy secretary, received preliminary approval from state regulators for six gigawatts of the site’s 11-gigawatt capacity target.

Chief Power Officer Larry Kellerman commented on Monday: ‘Securing reliable and cost-effective power from Xcel Energy today and working together with them to grow our relationship over time is a key component of Fermi’s plans.’

Adrian Rodriguez, president of Xcel Energy Texas-New Mexico added: ‘Xcel Energy is focused on meeting the growing energy needs of the Texas Panhandle and is pleased to work with Fermi America on this project.’

Fermi shares were flat at $16.30 on Monday morning in London, while Xcel Energy shares were down 1.2% in pre-market trading at $76.29 each on Monday morning in New York.

They also stressed that any adjustments during the 2026 review should avoid jeopardizing economic integration with Mexico and Canada.

In their letter to Ambassador Jamieson Greer, the signatories acknowledged that some compliance issues remain but emphasize that the pact is still essential to the US economy. They highlight that the three-country partnership supports over 13 million US jobs and that Mexico and Canada continue to be the nation’s main export destinations.

They also emphasized that US manufacturers ship more goods to Canada and Mexico than to the next twelve markets combined, and that the two partners absorb one-third of all US agricultural exports. “ USMCA ensures that US manufacturers, farmers and service providers can continue to access the Canadian and Mexican markets.”

The message was endorsed by a wide coalition of national associations and state chambers representing manufacturing, agriculture, clean energy, transportation, technology, textiles, services and infrastructure.

USMCA Negotiation

The 2026 USMCA review will serve as a test of the region’s ability to coordinate policy and maintain economic cohesion. Under Art. 34.7 of the agreement, the three countries must decide in July 2026 whether to extend the agreement to 2042, keep it subject to annual reviews, or allow it to expire in 2036.

Wendy Cutler, Senior Vice President, Asia Society Policy Institute, described the USMCA review as an unprecedented phase for modern trade agreements. She noted that with three days of public hearings already underway, the process is set to become more dramatic once formal negotiations begin next year. Cutler highlighted that the review clause is unusual, challenging the conventional idea that trade agreements should last indefinitely.

She added that testimony submitted to the USTR shows broad consensus among stakeholders, with most supporting a 16-year extension accompanied by targeted updates. However, she warned of concerning signals from the United States, noting that the administration has hinted at the possibility of renegotiating separately with each neighbor or even withdrawing from the pact. Cutler urged business leaders to remain fully engaged, emphasizing that active participation is crucial to keeping the agreement effective and relevant.

Adrián González, President, Global Alliance Solutions, anticipates that Washington may adopt a high-pressure approach similar to former President Trump’s strategy, presenting a full list of demands alongside the threat of walking away. He suggested that a formal withdrawal notice could be used strategically to increase leverage before ultimately negotiating a resolution. “At the end of the day, we are going to keep USMCA,” he said, adding that Mexico likely willing to make concessions on issues such as China, regional security, and supply-chain integration.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/lucas-george-wendt-tOVt13dbLLY-unsplash.jpg?h=aecb35f5&itok=GNjSrm_R,N,,2025-12-08 17:01:32.030583

The national and state groups, including Greenpeace USA, Oil Change International, and the Nebraska-based Save Rural America, pointed to a number of harms associated with the expansion of data centers in places including rural Michigan, Wisconsin, and northern Virginia.
""The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate, and water security,"" the groups told Congress.
""We urge you to join our call for a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities, our families, our environment, and our health from the runaway damage this industry is already inflicting.""
The groups noted that electricity costs have risen 21.3% since 2021, a rate that ""drastically"" outpaces inflation, driven by the ""rapid build-out of data centers.""","Environmental and economic justice advocates alike have been sounding the alarm for months regarding the Trump administration's push to built massive data centers to support artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency in communities across the United States—regardless of local opposition—and on Monday Congress heard from a coalition of more than 200 groups demanding action to stop what they called ""one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation.""

Led by Food and Water Watch (FWW), which originally demanded a moratorium on new AI data centers in October, more than 230 organizations have signed a letter warning that thus far, Congress has failed to take action to stop the rapid expansion despite the fact that ""the harms of data center growth are increasingly well-established, and they are massive.""

The national and state groups, including Greenpeace USA, Oil Change International, and the Nebraska-based Save Rural America, pointed to a number of harms associated with the expansion of data centers in places including rural Michigan, Wisconsin, and northern Virginia.

They warned that pushing the build-out onto communities—many of which have protested the approval of the centers to no avail—will lead to:

Enormous electricity consumption, with a tripling of data centers in the next five years projected to result in the facilities consuming as much electricity as about 30 million households;

Unsustainable water consumption, with those data centers requiring the amount of water normally used by 18.5 million households, just for cooling the computer servers;

The worsening of the climate emergency, with 56% of the energy used to power data centers sourced from planet-heating fossil fuels;

Surging electricity costs for people living in the vicinity of energy-sucking data centers; and

Skyrocketing job losses as half of all entry-level white-collar jobs are projected to become obsolete due to the growth of AI and companies' investments in the technology, even as corporations report they're not seeing a significant positive impact on their bottom lines.

""The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate, and water security,"" the groups told Congress. ""We urge you to join our call for a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities, our families, our environment, and our health from the runaway damage this industry is already inflicting.""

The groups noted that electricity costs have risen 21.3% since 2021, a rate that ""drastically"" outpaces inflation, driven by the ""rapid build-out of data centers.""

As CNBC reported last month, residential utility bills rose 6% in August compared with last summer, and though price increases can be due to a host of reasons, electricity prices rose ""much faster than the national average"" this year in states with high concentrations of data centers. Consumers in Virginia paid 13% more, while those in Illinois paid 16% more and people in Ohio saw their costs go up 12%.

Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at FWW, told the Guardian that rising utility costs are driving much of the grassroots action against data centers in places like Wisconsin—where a woman was violently dragged out of a community meeting by police last week after speaking out against plans for a new facility in her town—and Tucson, Arizona, where residents successfully pushed the City Council this year to block a data center project linked to Amazon.

“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” Wurth told the Guardian. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water... We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”

Data center projects worth a total of $64 billion have been blocked or delayed in states including Texas, Oregon, and Tennessee, and Reuters reported last week that a sizable portion of the opposition is coming from parts of the country that heavily supported President Donald Trump in last year's election.

Hundreds of people attended a recent meeting in Montour County, Pennsylvania, where Trump won by 20 points last year, raising alarm over plans to rezone 1,300 acres for Talen Energy to build a data center.

While raising prices for households that are already coping with high grocery and healthcare bills, the unregulated growth in AI data centers is also expected to add up to 44 million tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in just the next five years—the equivalent of putting 10 million new fossil fuel-powered cars on the road at a time when planetary heating has already been linked to recent US weather disasters like Hurricane Helene and deadly heatwaves.

The groups appealed to Congress as Trump said he plans to sign an executive order preempting state-level AI regulations, saying that states, ""many of them bad actors,"" should not be ""involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS.”

Republicans in Congress have also recently suggested they could try to ban state-level AI regulations in the National Defense Authorization Act.

The Trump administration and its allies in the industry have issued warnings to communities that oppose the construction of AI data centers, with the White House's AI Action Plan demanding the fast-tracking of permits for building the facilities and former Sen.

Purdue University engineers and the Indiana Department of Transportation demonstrated wireless charging of an electric heavy-duty truck driving at highway speeds. This is the first time such a successful test has been accomplished in the U.S.

Engineers experimented on a 1/4-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 52/U.S. Highway 231 in West Lafayette, Indiana, near the university. Purdue’s system delivered 190 kilowatts of power to an electric semitractor as the vehicle was moving at 65 mph. “To put that in perspective, 200 kilowatts are on the scale of about a hundred homes,” said Steve Pekarek, a Purdie Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Charging EVs While Driving

Before the engineers at Purdue conducted their tests, the world’s first EV charging roadway was tested in France.

The “Charge as you drive” project, spearheaded by a consortium comprising VINCI Autoroutes, Electreon, VINCI Construction, Gustave Eiffel University, and Hutchinson, is testing a system that allows electric vehicles, ranging from heavy-duty trucks to passenger cars, to recharge directly from the road while in motion. This project was announced a few months ago, in October.

EV Charging Highway System

According to the engineers, the system is powered by magnetic transfer coils embedded in the pavement, which sends power to a single receiver coil assembly attached to the truck. Additionally, prioritizing high-power needs allows the system to support the lower power requirements of electric cars.

Aaron Brovont, a research assistant professor, said, “This is a system designed to work for the heaviest class of trucks all the way down to passenger vehicles.”

Ultimately, engineers believe the electrified highways could offer a solution to EV owners who are worried about the cost and “range anxiety.” If the road could charge the vehicle while driving, it would require a cost-effective and smaller battery. “A lot of that cost in electric vehicles is driven by the size of the battery packs,” said Purdue professor John Haddock. “With this system, you’d be able to drive your vehicle down the road, and it would charge the battery.”",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/U.S.-EV-Charging-Highway.png,N,,2025-12-08 13:04:18.543661

Additionally, as Congress is negotiating an extension of the enhanced PTCs, we urge you to reject any further attempts to restrict abortion coverage.
Any claims that additional restrictions on abortion coverage are needed to ensure that no federal funds are spent on abortion coverage are false.","On behalf of the National Women’s Law Center and 128 state and national organizations, we write to strongly urge you to pass a clean extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits (PTCs). It is imperative that Congress act without further delay—as insurers have already set premium rates for the upcoming year assuming the enhanced PTCs are expiring. The longer Congress waits, the harder it will be to offer relief to millions of Americans with skyrocketing premiums, with women and low- and middle-income people hit the hardest.

The enhanced PTCs, originally expanded under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and extended through 2025 in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, have made health coverage through the Marketplace more affordable and accessible than ever before. In 2025 we saw record-breaking Marketplace enrollment, with nearly 12.7 million women enrolled, a 95% increase in women’s enrollment since 2021. Ninety-two percent of all 2025 Marketplace enrollees received PTCs, with an estimated nearly 11.7 million women receiving PTCs to help pay for their health insurance premiums. Resulting in premium payments being cut by an estimated 44% ($705 annually) for enrollees receiving PTCs.

If these enhanced PTCs expire, the health and economic consequences will be devastating to women and low- and middle-income people. It is expected that Marketplace out-of-pocket premiums will skyrocket by over 75% if the enhanced PTCs expire:

Average net premiums will be more than four times higher ($919 versus $169) for people with subsidized Marketplace coverage and incomes below 250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL);

Net premiums will more than double, from $1,171 to $2,455, for those with incomes between 250% and 400% of the FPL.

Adults aged 50 to 64 are projected to see even higher premium increases, with annual premium spikes between $599 and $4,574.

These premium increases will undoubtedly compound existing barriers to affordable health care coverage for women, particularly women of color, and low- and middle-income people. Millions of people will be priced out of coverage and be at increased risk for uninsurance, negating monumental gains made in reducing uninsurance since the enactment of enhanced PTCs in 2021. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that failing to extend the enhanced PTCs will result in 4.2 million more uninsured people by 2034. An estimated nearly 2.2 million of those 4.2 million would be women and over 3.1 million would be people of color. This is in addition to the 10 million people who stand to lose their health coverage due to H.R. 1 (OBBBA), according to CBO.

Women and low- and middle-income people already face significant challenges affording health insurance and health care-related expenses. Unaffordable health care costs force people with fewer financial resources to delay or forgo critical care, exacerbating existing health disparities. Uninsured women are less likely than those with coverage to have consistent access to care and to receive essential preventive services, such as cancer screenings. Gaps in such care are particularly harmful for women, particularly women of color who already experience high rates of chronic conditions.

Additionally, as Congress is negotiating an extension of the enhanced PTCs, we urge you to reject any further attempts to restrict abortion coverage. Any such attempts would ultimately amount to a thinly-veiled effort to derail negotiations over these essential tax credits. Cost is a major factor in whether people are able to access the abortion care they seek, and often insurance coverage is the difference between a person getting the care they need and being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. Any claims that additional restrictions on abortion coverage are needed to ensure that no federal funds are spent on abortion coverage are false. The ACA already treats abortion different from other health care services; it explicitly prohibits federal funds from being used to pay for abortion coverage in Marketplace plans, with limited exceptions for cases of life endangerment, rape, and incest. Any attempt to further restrict coverage for abortion care in ACA Marketplace plans will ultimately deny people the freedom to make the best decisions for their bodies, lives, and futures.

Congress must extend the enhanced PTCs before the end of the year, or millions of women and low- and middle-income people’s health and financial wellbeing will bear the brunt of drastically higher premiums that will follow. It is critical that Congress act swiftly to preserve enhanced PTCs and ensure the millions of women and low- and middle-income people who rely on these PTCs continue to have access to affordable and comprehensive health coverage.

Last week, a Congressional hearing titled “Making health care affordable again: Healing a broken system,” placed affordability at the center of the national health care debate. Lawmakers, industry leaders and patient advocates gathered to address the urgent challenges facing millions of Americans—chief among them, the looming expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits and the broader need for systemic reform.

The ACA fundamentally reshaped U.S. health coverage by making premiums more affordable for millions through advance premium tax credits (APTCs). Enhanced APTCs, introduced under the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress intervenes. This policy crossroads carries enormous implications for consumers, insurers and health care providers.

Renewing these credits could cost an estimated $350 billion over the next decade, but letting them lapse risks a surge in uninsured rates and premium spikes. Nearly 24 million people are enrolled in ACA marketplace plans in 2025, double the number in 2020, and 93% rely on APTCs to keep coverage affordable. If enhanced credits disappear, affordability could collapse for millions, especially those with lower incomes.

Enhanced APTCs work by sending government payments directly to insurance companies to lower monthly premiums for eligible households, but insurers themselves set the underlying premium rates. As the enhanced credits expire, costs for many will spike as families lose subsidy support. And, regardless of the credits, premiums are rising sharply: insurers project an 18% increase for 2025, driven by inflation, labor costs, expensive drugs, and a shifting risk pool as healthier enrollees exit the exchanges.

For providers, the ripple effects could be profound. Hospitals and health systems, especially those serving rural areas, could see higher uncompensated care, deteriorating payer mix and rising bad debt as more patients lose coverage. Operational pressures will intensify as patient volumes shift unpredictably, compounded by broader policy changes like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

What should providers do?

Health systems should strengthen enrollment assistance, advocate for state-level safety nets, monitor financial indicators and invest in community partnerships to address social determinants of health. Strategic planning and nimble adaptation are essential as the policy landscape evolves.

Last week’s hearings underscore the complexity of U.S. health care, where rising premiums, inflation and labor pressures collide with consumer expectations for access and affordability. For providers, maintaining operational resilience and community trust will require proactive engagement and cost discipline.",https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HC-trend-watch-template.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 13:03:52.025644

While South Bay waits for an answer, one thing is clear: People are living with a gas problem.
Gas levels peaked for minutes at a time at 4,500 parts per billion between Sept. 5 and Sept. 9 of last year.","The toxic gas turns its victims’ blood green by chemically altering proteins. Hundreds of millions of years ago, after volcanic eruptions destroyed oxygen in the world’s oceans, bacteria took over and transferred so much of this lethal gas into the air that almost everything on the planet died.

But it’s also something the human body produces. This gas relaxes blood vessels, which is partly why scientists think it could cure erectile dysfunction or aid in slowing down bodily functions to keep someone alive.

Two molecules of hydrogen bound to one of sulfur create hydrogen sulfide gas, a stinky vapor that wafts from sewer grates, swamps and oil refineries. Decomposing organic matter release its widely identifiable odor of rotten eggs — the scent of death.

People living next to the sewage-polluted Tijuana River knew it well, but not by name.

That changed last summer when scientists and local politicians called the news media to a press conference and revealed hydrogen sulfide gas was spewing from the river water at alarming amounts.

The “toxic soup,” emanating from pollution that spills over the U.S.-Mexico border via the river “impacts people for miles,” claimed atmospheric chemist Kim Prather from the University of California-San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography on X back in September of 2024.

She discovered a gas “hot spot,” where the riverine waters tumble from a few concrete pipes. Whatever’s in the water mixes with the atmosphere. Air samples taken by her team showed hydrogen sulfide would, at times, reach concentrations almost 100 times above what California’s air quality standards say is OK.

Prather called it a crisis, perhaps, worse than the infamous case of drinking water contamination in Flint, Michigan. The news inspired panic. San Diego County’s public health department sent their HAZMAT crews to investigate. Some South Bay schools cancelled outdoor activities.

County politicians and public health officials sowed confusion by attempting to debunk the scientists’ claims. And all the while, reporters struggled to understand the science of hydrogen sulfide in real time.

When should the presence of hydrogen sulfide trigger emergency actions like closing outdoor activities at schools? Was it even safe to breathe in South Bay?

Since then, the county installed hydrogen sulfide-sniffing monitors in Tijuana River-adjacent communities. They’ve quietly been recording gas levels for the past year. Occasionally, usually overnight when Mexico’s wastewater is flowing over the border, the gas concentrations climb high enough to trigger an odor warning from air quality regulators, the San Diego Air Pollution Control District.

“The problem here is this is not just an odor,” said Richard Gersberg, a now retired professor at San Diego State University who studied how chemicals and other pollutants pose risks to human health. “This is a health risk. And there’s health effects at levels perhaps well below where people can smell it.”

A Voice of San Diego analysis of the Air Pollution Control District’s data shows South Bay’s hydrogen sulfide have stayed far below what Prather and her team detected last September. Even those concentrations wouldn’t instantly kill anyone – which hydrogen sulfide is more famously known to do.

But the data shows that, on average, San Diegans from San Ysidro to Imperial Beach are breathing levels of the gas the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says would cause harm to a person’s health in the long run.

More science is needed to definitively link the presence of this gas to South Bay residents’ current health issues.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control rolled into South Bay a month after the hydrogen sulfide scare to take stock of residents’ health concerns. They talked to about 200 families, and 40 percent listed air quality as their greatest concern.

“Many describe unpleasant odors and perceive the air quality as poor because of the contamination,” the CDC wrote in its final report. “Residents also report increased health concerns (including GI and respiratory issues), although there is limited evidence from syndromic surveillance.”

The Air Pollution Control District continues to record gas levels but refers all of its data to state and federal agencies. They’ll make the call on what to do to protect public health, not us, the district spokesperson said.

While South Bay waits for an answer, one thing is clear: People are living with a gas problem.

Steady Stream of Gas in South Bay

Following the revelations of the scientists last summer, the San Diego Air Pollution Control District set up three hydrogen sulfide monitors in South Bay: one at Berry Elementary School in Nestor and nearest to Prather’s riverine “hot spot;” another on a fire station in San Ysidro and another on the Imperial Beach Civic Center.

Voice of San Diego calculated how much hydrogen sulfide gas those monitors picked up on average each month from all the readings taken since last summer.

The results paint a grim picture for San Diegans living nearby.

At Berry Elementary School, hydrogen sulfide stayed at an unsafe level, above what the EPA warns could cause long term health problems, for almost a full year — from October 2024 to September 2025.

At the other two locations – San Ysidro and Imperial Beach – hydrogen sulfide rarely fell to a safe concentration.

“That does indicate a risk existed chronically,” said Gersberg. “A risk which may have been both unappreciated and uncontrolled by both local and state regulators.”

Nora Hernandez lives with it every day at her home near Berry Elementary School which three of her children attend. Two of her children have asthma and all three have complained of body aches which no doctor, she says, can explain.

“It almost always smells bad,” Hernandez said. “But what are we supposed to do? It’s coming from another country but it’s affecting us here.”

Antonio Cuevas lives across the street from Berry Elementary with his partner and two daughters who go to school there. They also smell the river’s stink daily and have to close their windows and run fans during hot days with little wind, which causes the smell to intensify. When the smell becomes unbearable, they sometimes sit in their car or drive to a shopping mall, he said.

“We’re thinking of moving somewhere else, maybe Chula Vista,” Cuevas said. “We cannot stay here.”

The South Bay Union School District purchased and installed over 400 air purifiers in Berry Elementary classrooms and office spaces in response to last fall’s gas scare, confirmed Amy Cooper, executive assistant to the superintendent.

The district keeps tabs on gas levels recorded by the monitor attached to the school building. If concentrations are elevated, Cooper wrote, the school moves children to an indoor “rainy day” schedule and runs air purifiers in all indoor spaces to improve air quality.

“We are doing everything possible to protect students and staff from any potential elevation in those levels,” Cooper wrote.

San Diego Air Pollution Control District’s community hydrogen sulfide guidance recommends school activities remain indoors when concentrations reach 30 hydrogen sulfide particles in 1 billion particles of air. That’s only happened once or twice this past school year because most gas levels spike overnight, Cooper wrote. But there have been several close calls when levels dropped rapidly around 6 a.m. just before the school day began.

But there’s wide disagreement among air quality and public health regulators over what amount of hydrogen sulfide should be tolerated. To some, the local air regulators’ guidance is, well, misguided.

Hard to Say How Hydrogen Sulfide Impacts Health

If you ask Gersberg, nobody was – or is – assessing the risk of the Tijuana River’s airborne pollution properly.

“The only way to really ask, is this causing health effects, is to do a risk assessment,” Gersberg said.

That’s done by monitoring the exposed population over a long period of time through an epidemiological study, which can take years and millions of dollars to complete. (San Diego County Supervisor Paloma Aguirre, the former mayor of polluted Imperial Beach, is pursuing money to do just that.)

The next best thing is to look at the county’s gas data and compare it to what Gersberg referred to as “the bible”: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Integrated Risk Information System. The EPA says if out of one billion particles of air, 1.4 of them are hydrogen sulfide, then prolonged exposure to that air – many weeks to months – could make someone sick.

This guideline is based on scientists exposing rats to hydrogen sulfide for six hours a day for 10 weeks. Those rats developed lesions in their nostrils. Few scientific studies, beyond the rat tests, have shown what could happen to the human body under such low-level gas exposure conditions over months to a year.

The residents of Rotorua, New Zealand, living near geothermal pools along a volcanic fault zone are a rare case of a population living under the constant fog of hydrogen sulfide. Scientists discovered more Roturans live with cardiovascular diseases compared to other New Zealanders. But they couldn’t pin the cause on the gas. The data didn’t accurately account for the residents’ socioeconomic status or whether they also smoked.

How H2S Can Kill

When there’s a whole lot of hydrogen sulfide in an enclosed or confined space, the gas can kill a person pretty quickly. It’s called “knock down.” The gas paralyzes the nerve in the nose that allows us to smell its signature rotten egg scent, robbing its victims of the main warning sign that it’s there at all.

Knock down happens when the gas reaches 500,000 parts per billion or more. It’s what scientists call “acute” exposure.

People have died within minutes from a single, large and concentrated exposure to the gas — even just one breath. The respiratory system shuts down or seizes; skin turns a bruised color at the lips, ears or fingernails. Some people have involuntary muscle convulsions that look like seizures, the heart can stop and the gas can send people into a coma.

Workers have died instantly from the gas after falling through a manhole into the sewer. Farm workers almost died after walking into a tank filled with pig manure. These dramatic deaths from mostly job-related exposures to a lot of the gas all at once are what color its reputation. It’s what most scientists study or what people in public health or emergency response know more about.

Even so, it took a while for the U.S. government to take hydrogen sulfide seriously.

Congress removed hydrogen sulfide from the EPA’s list of hazardous air pollutants (toxins that can cause death or serious, irreversible illness from routine exposure) in the early 1990s under pressure from the oil and gas industry, one of the largest man-made sources of the gas. Regulators slowly began compiling evidence on its toxicity after the rat study. ExxonMobil did its own in 2015 which showed low levels of the gas were associated with breathing impairment, eye and neurological effects.

Still, hydrogen sulfide isn’t officially considered a pollutant the federal government requires industries to manage. Low levels of hydrogen sulfide from typical emitters – refineries, confined animal feeding operations or CAFOS, and landfills – mix with other contaminants in the air. So it’s hard for scientists to isolate whether hydrogen sulfide is the culprit for a specific health problem, researchers say.

Even NASA isn’t totally sure how much hydrogen sulfide is safe for astronaut exposure. For its upcoming missions to the moon, NASA worries hydrogen sulfide trapped in moon rock ice taken from the lunar surface might sublime – turn from a solid to a gas – and release inside the spaceship. Almost all of the agency’s Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations for 24-hour to 180-day crew exposure to the gas during the upcoming Artemis III mission to send humans to the unexplored South Pole are based on those same rat studies.

“Spaceflight presents a unique environment…continuous exposure for limited duration (seven days to six months), (in a) completely enclosed environment and lack of escape, emphasizing the need for Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations to be established for standard spaceflight duration exposures to hydrogen sulfide,” NASA’s 2024 report on the matter reads.

At the Tijuana River “hot spot” where Prather was testing, the levels of hydrogen sulfide never reached a concentration that could cause sudden death or “knock-down.” State officials poo-pooed her alarms last fall.

“Hydrogen sulfide levels would have to be much higher (5,000 parts per billion or more) to expect widespread health impacts,” Amy MacPherson, a CARB, spokesperson told Voice of San Diego, referring to the levels Prather found.

Prather persisted.

“It’s really important to listen to the community. So many eye, ear, nose, throat infections… skin infections… heart and lung issues, mental issues, the list goes on,” she told Voice in an email.

Prather published her hydrogen sulfide data from the fall of 2024 in the journal Science. Gas levels peaked for minutes at a time at 4,500 parts per billion between Sept. 5 and Sept. 9 of last year. At least once, the gas reached an average hourly peak of around 2,100 parts per billion. That’s 70 times higher than the California Ambient Air Quality Standards say is detectable by the human nose.

But those high levels of gas production by the Tijuana River pollution didn’t last. By Sept. 11, spills into the river and, therefore, its flows, dramatically halted.

Since the installation of the San Diego Air Pollution Control District’s monitors shortly thereafter, hydrogen sulfide concentrations haven’t risen beyond around 500 parts per billion.

Still, Gersberg agrees with Prather: That doesn’t mean people aren’t getting sick.

“If the data continues like it did last summer, I wouldn’t want to live there and I certainly wouldn’t want my kids going to school there,” Gersberg said.",https://voiceofsandiego.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/San-Ysidro_0028.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 13:03:23.745600

In more than two decades, Tepper and Weiss’ firm has invested in nearly 40 companies and has led or co-led funding totaling about $3 billion. Angeleno Group currently has 12 active investments across three funds within its portfolio.

For Tepper and Weiss, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

The green investment boom continues to soar, driven by global urgency and trillions of dollars targeting decarbonization. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that global investment in renewable energy reached a record $386 billion in the first half of this year, up 10% from the previous first half of 2024.

That demand comes amid growing political challenges to climate change policy – including the U.S.’ withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, which celebrated its 10th year since enactment in 2015. At the start of the year, President Donald Trump signed executive orders altering energy production regulations. Then, he followed up with a new tax law – under his One Big Beautiful Bill Act – that rolled back many clean energy tax credits and imposed new restrictions.

Even with the brewing political headwinds, Weiss and Tepper remain optimistic about the market for clean energy and climate solutions. Achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 alone will require significant investment to address the economic and social shifts. Citing 2022 estimates from McKinsey, global investment may reach $9.2 trillion over the upcoming decades.

“The climate clock is ticking loudly,” Tepper said. “Given the fires that we’ve had, the unexpected economic rise post (the Covid-19 pandemic), a little bit of retrenchment that’s been happening, we don’t have 15 years to get it right,” Tepper said.

He added that the outlook to reach net-zero emissions in the next 25 years is a great objective to have in place – “But really, the next five years are the most critical in the history of climate (and renewable energy) investing.”

‘The white space’

Tepper and Weiss know firsthand the importance of timing within an evolving market.

Two decades ago, Angeleno Group was an idea born in the shadows of one crisis after another: the dot-com bust, 9/11 and California’s electricity meltdown, which became so severe that it led to the recall of Gov. Gray Davis. Enron Corp. had collapsed. Oil was trading at an average of above $20 a barrel. And the phrase “clean energy” was barely in the investment lexicon.

Most would’ve walked the other way. Weiss and Tepper – whose careers were steeped in energy, policy and finance – chose to walk straight into the fray.

“Energy and technology,” Tepper said, “probably didn’t exist together much.”

Energy was still the realm of utilities, refineries and pipelines, while technology was dedicated to dot-com startups – no one connected combustion with computing.

And no one saw the opportunity in the disarray – well, no one except for Weiss and Tepper.

“We really ought to have our heads examined,” quipped Weiss, laughing lightly at the memory of those early days.

But he swiftly acknowledged the seriousness of the early 2000s. The energy crisis had exposed the fragility of the grid; climate science was mounting; decades of innovations in computing and sensors were suddenly colliding with a century-old energy system.

He explained that on one end of the investing spectrum, private equity players were buying up hard assets such as power plants, drilling rigs, pipelines and the like. On the other end, hedge funds were “investing in commodity price arbitrage, in oil and natural gas.”

That middle inflection point – the so-called “white space” of that barbell – was the key spot that sparked their interest.

It “(was) the future of the sector … innovation technology, what was then called alternative energy,” Weiss said. “Who was going to invest in the future of transforming this important part of our global economy?”

Weiss said that they saw an opportunity and believed that investing in “sustainability could be good business. … so we set out to found a firm to invest against that white space, to invest in the next generation of sustainable technology companies that touch and help foster climate solutions.”

L.A. by design

Choosing Los Angeles as home for their investment firm was just as intentional. Aside from the fact that both were native Angelenos, thus the firm’s name.

“We were starting an investment firm in a city that was not known for its (venture capital) ecosystem,” Weiss said.

However, the two added that L.A. had something that Silicon Valley didn’t have – a convergence of engineering talent, aerospace know-how, global trade infrastructure through its two ports, its manufacturing footprint, and a deep understanding of solar and wind systems.

“L.A. is kind of natural, frankly, to have an industrial clean-energy practice come out of it,” said Tepper.

In the beginning, as investors, they considered themselves “more stage-agnostic” – investing in everything from early-stage venture capital to buyout deals.

Over the two decades, they honed their focus on “growth equity” and on companies ready to scale. These are ventures with proven technologies and early revenue – a company, in short, that’s at a turning point, with commercial breakthroughs, national expansions, strategic acquisitions and global partnerships.

“We’re in the scaling business,” said Tepper.

Their early discipline – sticking to industrial, clear energy and climate solutions – became their edge as the market matured and soon accelerated. The economics of the industry soon became a turning point, catching up to their hypotheses.

Solar costs collapsed by more than 90%. Wind fell by over 70%. Batteries followed similar cost curves.

“The costs came down by orders of magnitude,” Tepper said. “Demand inflected up.”

Climate tech venture investment alone soared between 2010 and 2022 – dramatically rising from nearly $2 billion to a peak of more than $70 billion by the end of 2022, according to HolonIQ, a New York-based data marketing intelligence platform.

Three key business traits

Angeleno Group now has seven focus areas: “clean energy transitions,” “next generation energy storage,” “resource efficiency,” “critical infrastructure and resiliency,” “industrial energy efficiency and digital manufacturing,” “carbon mitigation and climate adaptation,” and “sustainable mobility and smart cities.”

Weiss said they’ve built and defined their firm via three key traits in those early years and even today – “intellectual curiosity, humility and collaboration.”

John Payne, chief executive at Phoenix, Arizona-based Kinematics Manufacturing Inc., echoed that sentiment.

“Words like partnership and collaboration get thrown about a lot in industries … but with Angeleno, it genuinely does feel like a partnership,” said Payne. “I feel like I am standing shoulder to shoulder with these guys and we are 100% aligned on what we’re trying to do.”

Angeleno has owned a stake in Kinematics since 2014. With that backing, the developer and manufacturer of intelligent motion control systems for mission-critical applications has been able to strategically expand its business, Payne said.

That includes executing its first acquisition last year, when it purchased P4Q, a Spanish company specializing in electronics manufacturing for solar tracking controllers. Kinematics closed the deal in February.

“It was a big step forward for all of us,” Payne said. “But I think it epitomizes the way Angeleno thinks – they’re prepared to take calculated risks to really grow, (and) they’re looking at building sustainable, long-term value.”

Heavyweight network

Since its inception, Angeleno Group estimates that its portfolio companies have increased in value by $10 billion under its ownership. And they’ve generated $22 billion in cumulative revenues.

The firm also estimates that its portfolio companies have displaced 3 billion metric tons of carbon and added about 17,500 green-collar jobs. It also notes that five of their companies have won the Nobel Prize and that their portfolio companies have received about 1,000 patents.

Angeleno Group is “exceedingly good at what they do,” said Sir Andrew Steer, a prominent climate expert and economist who was knighted for his contributions to sustainable development. “They’ve got a track record … and they invest in a way that combines sort of looking at the long term but also recognizing the near-term issues …they’re deeply analytical, but they’re bold in the best sense of the word.”

Steer, who most recently served as the founding president and chief executive of the Bezos Earth Fund, is the most recent addition to the firm’s cadre of policy experts and thinkers on Angeleno Group’s board of advisers.

He joined a star roster including former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen; former Secretary of Energy and M.I.T. physicist Ernest Moniz; Nobel laureate and Alphabet Inc. board member Frances Arnold; and Laura Tyson, economist and former dean at U.C. Berkeley’s Haas School of Business.

All of those on the board are looking to the future of renewable energy and finding attainable solutions. Steer, who currently serves as a distinguished professor at Georgetown University and the London School of Economics, sees this as an excellent opportunity for clean energy and climate tech investment, even amid political disruptions.

“It’s paradoxically a very good time to invest,” as valuations of companies decline, Steer said, especially “given the abolition of some of the subsidies that (former President Joe Biden) put in place.”

A long road

Tepper and Weiss couldn’t agree more: this is a pivotal moment for their firm and the industry as a whole. The advisory board and the “combined perspectives underscore the seriousness of the work and the scale of the moment,” Tepper said.

But as they’ve done for two decades, they will continue to focus on the future – especially given the ongoing growth of the renewable energy market globally, coupled with the advent of rapidly emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.

The economic case for renewable energy once again outweighs the geopolitical conflicts.

Weiss noted that to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, “a number of third-party analysts put the capital spend at around $250 trillion … we will need to mobilize a massive amount of climate finance to get anywhere close to that number.”

What’s more, over the last 10 years, the two noted that there’s “a garden of innovation” in clean energy and climate-related companies – many of which Tepper said “have gone into the growth stage” right now.

“Deal flow is up, valuations are down,” Weiss added. “That is an attractive recipe for investors, and we’re seeing that today on an unprecedented scale.”",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yaniv-tepper-and-daniel-weiss-angeleno-group-co-founders-and-managing-partners_54835074553_o.jpeg,N,,2025-12-08 15:02:04.250991

Trump saw we can work it out.
Oil is feeling the pressure as a trade deal would keep the risks of tariffs on Canadian oil.
This comes amid ongoing U.S.-Canada trade tensions in 2025, including earlier tariff disputes and suspended negotiations originally triggered by an Ontario ad criticizing tariffs.
Meanwhile, snow will replace rain by midday across southern Virginia and northern North Carolina.","We can work it out. Trump saw we can work it out. That’s right with Canada! Oil is feeling the pressure as a trade deal would keep the risks of tariffs on Canadian oil.

U.S. President Donald Trump was asked yesterday while speaking to reporters outside the Kennedy Center Honors gala in Washington, whether he would resume trade talks with Canada which he had halted earlier in the year. He responded non-committal at first with phrases like “we’ll see,” but then added optimistically: “We’ll work it out.” He described a recent meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney (and Mexico’s leader) as “very good, very productive,” and emphasized having a strong relationship with both Canada and Carney, despite calling Canadians “very tough traders” and noting that Canada produces many goods the U.S. already makes. Trump also made a light-hearted remark praising Canada’s ice hockey prowess.

This comes amid ongoing U.S.-Canada trade tensions in 2025, including earlier tariff disputes and suspended negotiations originally triggered by an Ontario ad criticizing tariffs. Trump’s comments suggest a willingness to resolve issues without immediate escalation, though no firm commitment to restart formal talks was made. Think of what you’re saying. You can get it wrong and still you think that it’s alright. We can work it out.

At the same time demand from China is improving. According to data released by the General Administration of Customs on Monday, China’s crude oil imports climbed by 4.88% year-over-year in November, with daily import volumes reaching their highest point since August 2023. Compared to October, imports increased by 5.24%, totaling 50.89 million metric tons, or about 12.38 million barrels per day (bpd). Kpler data indicates that imports from Saudi Arabia and Iran rose compared to October, while shipments from Russia declined.

Bloomberg reports that the Trump Administration will announce a $12 billion farm aid package to help farmers affected by tariffs and falling crop prices. The package includes up to $11 billion in one-time payments through the Department of Agriculture’s Farmer Bridge Assistance program, responding to farmer frustration over slow Chinese purchases following recent tariff disputes.

Oil prices weakened somewhat this morning, largely due to rising temperatures and ongoing uncertainty about the peace talks between the United States, Russia, and Ukraine. President Trump expressed mild disappointment with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but the market appears less worried about further supply disruptions, as reports indicate that no Russian oil infrastructure was damaged over the weekend.

Natural gas prices dipped due to an anticipated short-term temperature rise, but predictions for later in the month remain very cold.

Fox Weather reports that temperatures are starting to return to normal this weekend after millions of Americans felt the brunt of the extreme chill on Friday before another blast of arctic air rolls through the Northern Tier of the U.S. in the early part of next week. Temperatures from the Midwest to the Interstate 95 corridor on Thursday and Friday were some of the lowest seen so far this season, with nearly 80 record-low temperatures set between the two days. Another round of frigid air is on the way, especially for Americans in the Great Lakes and Northeast starting Monday and lasting through Wednesday.

Fox Weather also reports that another quick-hitting winter storm is brewing over the mid-Atlantic, just a few days after places in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia saw their first snow of the season, in what has been an active start to meteorological winter across the country. Snow and sleet are ongoing across southern Virginia and West Virginia and will spread over northern North Carolina through Monday, as a fast-moving storm system slides off the East Coast, taking advantage of arctic air in the region.

In addition, sleet along the rain-snow line made for a slick Monday morning commute, particularly for drivers traveling on Interstates 26, 65, 77 and 81. Some places, particularly in the western North Carolina mountains, were not cold enough for snow Monday morning, leading to cold rain and sleet, which can be more hazardous than snow for drivers. Meanwhile, snow will replace rain by midday across southern Virginia and northern North Carolina. People in Raleigh should expect at least a coating to an inch of snow, and those in Asheville will likely see some snow accumulation, with more snow farther north into the Blue Ridge Mountains.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 14:02:43.202075

Nebraska and Oklahoma Utilities Create Great Plains New Nuclear Consortium

Four utilities in Nebraska and Oklahoma have created a new consortium to examine the feasibility and potential for advanced nuclear energy in the region. While Nebraska has one nuclear plant and reactor, the state and utilities in the state have indicated interest in nuclear development and taken steps to examine potential sites for a new plant. While Oklahoma does not currently have a nuclear plant and largely uses natural gas and renewables for electricity. Initially, the agreement will explore deploying 1,000 to 2,000 megawatts of nuclear technology. According to the recent press release on the consortium, each utility will fund its own early-stage work but plans to leverage work across the group to reduce costs, share expertise, and meet demand across the two states.

The new Great Plains New Nuclear Consortium includes:

Nebraska Public Power District

Deep Fission Selects Kansas for Underground Reactor Pilot Project

Nuclear startup Deep Fission will debut their underground reactor technology at the Great Plains Industrial Park in Parsons, Kan., in the southeast corner of the state. According to Deep Fission, its reactor design uses oil and gas borehole drilling and geothermal technology to construct SMRs one mile underground with a 150 megawatts electric (MWe) capacity. The company is part of the DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program, which assists companies in deploying novel SMR technology. The selected site, the Great Plains Industrial Park, offers companies space for projects with land and warehouses. Key industries include utilities, manufacturing, aerospace and data centers. The park also has railway access, a beneficial characteristic for nuclear development. According to Deep Fission, the company hopes to construct and achieve criticality at the new site by summer 2026, though this timeline would require quick-moving regulatory proceedings.

This decision has significant implications for environmental preservation and energy development. The Arctic refuge, home to diverse wildlife and fragile ecosystems, has long been at the center of a tug-of-war between economic interests and environmental conservation. This recent legislative action, passed with a narrow Senate vote of 49-45, underscores the complexity and contentiousness of balancing economic growth with ecological responsibility.

The Legislative Shift: A Political Balancing Act

The recent congressional vote marks a significant shift in U.S. energy policy, effectively overturning a rule from the Department of the Interior that restricted leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The resolution needed a simple majority to pass, and it did so with a 49-45 vote. Notably, one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, sided with Democrats to oppose the resolution, highlighting the nuanced political landscape surrounding this issue. This decision aligns with former President Donald Trump’s agenda to expand domestic energy production, a stance that contrasts sharply with the Biden administration’s focus on environmental protection.

The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a 1.56-million-acre expanse on Alaska’s coastal plain, known for its pristine environment and rich biodiversity. Proponents of drilling argue that it could lead to job creation and increased revenue, particularly for local communities and tribal corporations. However, conservationists warn that such development could irreversibly damage delicate ecosystems and disrupt the habitat of numerous species. The legislative decision thus reflects broader ideological differences regarding the balance between economic development and environmental stewardship.

Economic Implications and Local Perspectives

The potential economic benefits of oil and gas development in the Arctic are substantial. Proponents argue that opening up the refuge for drilling could lead to significant job creation and boost the local economy. For many in Alaska, particularly tribal corporations and local businesses, the promise of increased revenue and employment opportunities is compelling. These economic incentives are crucial for a state that relies heavily on the oil and gas industry for its financial well-being.

However, this potential economic boon is not without its critics. Opponents, including numerous environmental groups, argue that the long-term ecological costs outweigh the short-term economic gains. They caution that drilling could lead to environmental degradation, affecting wildlife and the broader ecosystem. The debate is further complicated by the views of Indigenous communities, who are divided on the issue. While some see development as a path to economic empowerment, others fear it will compromise their traditional way of life and the land they consider sacred.

Environmental Concerns and Conservation Efforts

Environmentalists are deeply concerned about the potential impact of oil and gas development on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The region is home to a wide range of wildlife, including polar bears, caribou, and migratory birds. The introduction of industrial activities could disrupt these species’ habitats, leading to long-term ecological consequences. Conservationists argue that the Arctic refuge represents one of the last untouched wilderness areas in the United States, and they view its preservation as a moral and ecological imperative.

Efforts to protect the refuge have been ongoing for decades, with numerous legal and political battles fought over its future. The recent legislative decision to open it up for drilling is seen by many environmental groups as a setback. They argue that such actions undermine global conservation efforts and are inconsistent with the growing recognition of the need for sustainable and responsible environmental stewardship. This decision could also have broader implications for U.S. environmental policy, potentially setting a precedent for future decisions regarding protected lands.

The Future of U.S. Energy Policy

The repeal of the Biden-era limits on oil and gas development in the Arctic refuge raises critical questions about the future direction of U.S. energy policy. It highlights the ongoing tension between efforts to promote energy independence and the need to address climate change. As the country grapples with these competing priorities, the decision underscores the challenges of crafting a coherent energy strategy that balances economic, environmental, and social considerations.

This legislative shift may also influence future political debates and policy decisions. It reflects broader trends in U.S. politics, where energy policy remains a deeply divisive issue. As the nation moves forward, the challenge will be to find a path that accommodates economic growth while ensuring environmental sustainability. The decision to allow drilling in the Arctic refuge is a reminder of the complex and often contentious nature of these discussions.

The decision to repeal the limits on oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a pivotal moment in U.S. energy policy. It raises important questions about the balance between economic growth and environmental preservation. As the implications of this decision unfold, the nation faces a critical juncture: how can it reconcile these competing interests to create a sustainable and prosperous future?

Volkswagen saw what Ford did and thought it could get a piece of the action by creating new Scout products.
He said the company will not reduce the current suggested starting price for Scout vehicles to make up for the repeal of the federal EV tax credit.
“We are capable of making products for other brands, so the platform is capable and the factory is capable,” Keogh said.","Policies have consequences, and nothing illustrates that fact better than two EV stories in the news today. Kia has announced the EV5 — a midsize electric SUV that should be right in the sweet spot for many American families — will be sold in Canada, but not the US. In related news, Scout Motors, the new Volkswagen Group startup that originally planned to bring a rugged battery-powered pickup truck and SUV built in America to Americans, is now adjusting its production plans to prioritize a plug-in hybrid powertrains.

Kia To America: No EV5 For You!

Recently, we reported that Kia has decided not to bring its EV4 sedan — a car that is a contender for Car Of The Year honors in Europe — to America, largely because of new tariffs on cars manufactured in South Korea imposed by the current US administration. A spokesperson for the company told the press last month, “As market conditions for EVs have changed, the release of the upcoming EV4 electric sedan will be delayed until further notice.”

In a recent press release, Kia announced pricing and the “start of online reservations for the highly anticipated Kia EV5, giving Canadians their first opportunity to order the new all-electric SUV. Exclusive to Canada for the North American market, the EV5 enters the largest vehicle segment in Canada and is the first of three affordable EVs arriving in Canada in 2026.”

Elias El-Achhab, the chief operating officer for Kia Canada, said, “The Kia EV5 is available in nine different trims, providing Canadians with plenty of options that meet a variety of preferences. Competing in the largest SUV segment in Canada as a dedicated EV, the EV5 truly is the revolution of the family SUV perfect for empowering modern families with all the technology and convenience they require.”

According to Electrive, the EV5 will start at CAD$50,662 (US$36,700) for the Light with a single motor driving the front wheels and a 60 kWh battery pack. The top of the line all-wheel drive GT-Line Limited with an 81 kWh battery will list for CAD 62,162 (US$43,600) Do you know anyone in the US who might want a fully optioned AWD midsize SUV for $43,600? Yeah, we bet you do! The car will also come standard with the NACS charging port. Here is a link to the Kia configurator for Canada for those who want to know more about prices.

Production of the Canadian-market EV5 will take place at Kia Autoland Gwangju in South Korea and begin with Wind FWD and GT-Line Limited AWD trims. The entry level Light FWD model will become available in Canada in late 2026. Kia expects to publish official range estimates early next year. The company says the EV5 will be the first of three affordable models it will introduce in Canada in the next year.

Canada has also suggested it may end the current 100% tariff on Chinese-made cars soon and replace it with something similar to the tariff structure used by the EU. Between Kia and China, Canada may soon be a Mecca for compelling electric cars that Americans are prohibited from owning, thanks to MAGA.

Scout Motors To Build Mostly Plug-in Vehicles

Bloomberg reports that Scout Motors now says most of its vehicles — which were supposed to herald a transition by Volkswagen Group to battery-electric vehicles for US customers — will be mostly plug-in hybrid vehicles. The company says nearly 80% of its pre-orders are for the PHEV version of the cars.

“The market clearly has spoken, without a doubt, and they like the EREV technology full stop,” Scott Keogh, Scout’s chief executive officer, said in an interview, noting that the hybrid can travel 500 miles on a combination of electricity and a tank of gas. “This is EV without the drama.”

Specs regarding battery and engine size as well as range have not been made official as of yet, although there are hints the battery-only Scouts will have an EPA range of 350 miles while the PHEV is said to be capable of traveling 600 miles without stopping — which is a beautiful thing if your bladder has similar endurance.

Volkswagen Group acquired Scout Motors when it purchased Navistar in 2021. Navistar was the successor to International Harvester, which debuted the Scout brand in 1960. Scouts were tough, rugged vehicles that aspired to capture some of the allure of the original Jeeps. In 1966, Ford introduced its Bronco, another “drive it through the mud, then hose it out” off-roader in the days when drivers still had to get out and manually engage the front hubs.

Decades later, Ford reintroduced the Bronco in updated form and it has been a sales success. Volkswagen saw what Ford did and thought it could get a piece of the action by creating new Scout products. Like Rivian, the Scout line-up included both a pickup truck and an SUV. Volkswagen thinks Scout may be the way for it to expand its market share in the US, where its current models account for about 5% of sales.

Scott Keogh, who used to be the head of Volkswagen of America, is undaunted by the shift in political winds in the US. He said the company will not reduce the current suggested starting price for Scout vehicles to make up for the repeal of the federal EV tax credit. “I will not take $7,500 off the price of the car,” Keogh said. “And frankly, I don’t think we need to.”

Scout has received more than 130,000 non-binding reservations over the past year. Of those, about three-quarters have been for the SUV, while just one quarter have been for the pickup truck. In fact, with sales of electric pickup trucks mostly disappointing and other US manufacturers such as Ford, GM, and Stellantis scaling back or canceling their plans to bring battery-powered pickups to market, Keogh says he is not ruling out doing the same. “Certainly, that’s something we could look at, but we’re not making that decision now.”

He pointed out that the Scout vehicles will compete in market segments that account for about 40% of profits in US new vehicle sales. “[Volkswagen Group] can plant a brand right in the heart of the US profit pool,” Keogh said. “Regardless of party, I think Americans do want things made in America. These segments are strongly dominated by a ‘Buy American’ mentality.”

Audi Production Is A Possibility

There is a possibility that the new $2 billion assembly plant in South Carolina could also build one or more Audi models alongside the Scout vehicles. Audi’s CEO said recently the brand is considering an SUV tailored to American tastes based in part on the platform being created for Scout.

That would make Audi more competitive, since locally produced vehicles would avoid some of the tariffs cars imported from Germany have to pay. “We are capable of making products for other brands, so the platform is capable and the factory is capable,” Keogh said. “But I have actually nothing to confirm on Audi. Audi can give you that answer.”

A cynical person might suggest this whole Scout adventure might collapse in on itself much as Tesla’s Cybertruck business did, in which case that spiffy new factory in South Carolina just might become a manufacturing hub for Audi. And if that happens, maybe Porsche might want to get in on the fun, since US sales account for a large portion of its business and they have dropped dramatically because of the tariff wars initiated by the current administration. Fortunately, there are no such cynical people here at CleanTechnica global headquarters.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kia-EV5.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:04:53.653091

New Groundwater Exception: The Proposed Rule states that groundwater, which is by nature not navigable, does not qualify as jurisdictional waters.
Further, like other WOTUS rules, the Proposed Rule is almost certain to be subject to legal challenges when it is finalized.
Morgan Lewis partner Duke McCall provides additional insights on the Proposed Rule in the Law360 article Trump Admin May Be Overpromising WOTUS Clarity.","The recently proposed rule aims to align the definition of WOTUS with the US Supreme Court’s seminal decision in Sackett v. EPA in a manner that limits waters subject to federal regulation.

On November 20, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a Proposed Rule that once again revises the regulatory definition of “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA or Act). The Proposed Rule, which would revise the “Conforming Rule” the Biden administration adopted after the US Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, seeks to (1) define key phrases articulated by the Court in its seminal Sackett decision, (2) further define certain regulatory exemptions to the waters covered by the Act, and (3) implement additional conforming changes.

It does so to “fully implement the direction provided by [the Court in Sackett],” to provide clarity to the regulated community, and to shift further responsibility to states and tribes to manage local water resources. However, like every effort to define the scope of WOTUS, it leaves some questions unanswered and will undoubtedly be the subject of litigation.

BACKGROUND

The CWA covers all “navigable waters,” which it defines only as “the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.” This ambiguous definition of those waters covered by the CWA has long fueled an ever-shifting litigation and regulatory landscape as to the extent of the federal government’s reach in regulating the nation’s waters, resulting in four separate Supreme Court opinions and numerous sets of regulations from EPA and the Corps, grappling with the question of what non-traditional navigable waters constitute “waters of the United States.”

In 2023, the Supreme Court sought to resolve this question, holding that “waters of the United States” include only those relatively permanent, standing, or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographic[al] features that are described in ordinary parlance as “streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes” and “those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are ‘waters of the United States’ in their own right.” 598 U.S. ___, Slip Op. at 14, 27 (2023).

Following the Sackett decision, the Biden EPA promulgated a new Conforming Rule without notice-and-comment that it stated was intended to implement the Sackett decision. Many in the regulated community criticized the Conforming Rule as failing to fully implement the Sackett decision. The Proposed Rule seeks to do so and proposes additional revisions to clarify and limit those waters covered by the CWA.

KEY DEFINITIONAL CHANGES

The Proposed Rule defines two key phrases from the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett—“continuous surface connection” and “relatively permanent”—and further defines “tributaries” to clarify that the requirement of relatively permanent flow extends to tributaries as well as wetlands, which were the focus of the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett.

Relatively Permanent: Under the Proposed Rule, “relatively permanent” means “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.” This definition applies to tributaries, adjacent wetlands, as well as lakes and ponds. The “wet season” language, which imposes a temporal requirement to the jurisdictional test, is variably defined according to region and ecotype and proposes the use of existing agency tools and to define the wet season based on rates of precipitation versus evaporation in a water body. To be considered “relatively permanent,” water must flow or stand throughout the wet season. Intermittent flow during the wet season, even with consistent flow outside of the wet season, forecloses a water body from the “relatively permanent” definition.

Continuous surface connection: Under the Proposed Rule, a continuous surface connection exists if there is “surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.” This language calls for a two-pronged test: abutment of a jurisdictional water and presence of surface water during the wet season. According to the EPA, this limits the scope of jurisdictional wetlands to only those portions that have surface water that abuts or touches a jurisdictional water during the wet season.

Tributaries: The Proposed Rule also redefines tributaries as “bod[ies] of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and bank, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.” The tributary must be connected to a downstream jurisdictional water by a feature that conveys relatively permanent flow, but such connection can be non-jurisdictional, and may include man-made streams, ditches, canals, and other man-made or man-altered connections.

CHANGES TO EXEMPTIONS

Under current regulations, there are eight exemptions to the definition of WOTUS: (1) waste treatment systems, including those designed to meet CWA requirements, (2) prior converted cropland, (3) ditches excavated wholly in and draining only dry land with no relatively permanent flow, (4) artificially irrigated areas, (5) artificial lakes or ponds created by excavating or diking dry land to collect and retain water, (6) artificial reflecting pools or swimming pools or other small ornamental, (7) waterfilled depressions created in dry land incidental to construction activity, and (8) swales and erosional features with low volume or intermittent flow.

The Proposed Rule further defines three exemptions for waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and ditches, and provides an additional exclusion related to groundwater:

Waste water systems: Under the Proposed Rule, the definition of “waste treatment systems” is expanded to include “all components of a waste treatment system,” including “lagoons and treatment ponds (such as settling or cooling ponds), designed to either convey or retain, concentrate, settle, reduce, or remove pollutants, either actively or passively, from wastewater prior to discharge (or eliminating any such discharge).”

Prior Converted Cropland: The Proposed Rule specifies that the prior converted cropland exclusion does not apply to abandoned cropland or cropland that is not used for agricultural purposes at least once in the five years immediately preceding the determination. Agricultural uses can include various conservation uses, and federal field staff may consult private or public sources if the proposed list of agricultural uses is ambiguous. If the abandoned cropland is converted back to wetlands, it can only be considered jurisdictional if the resulting wetland satisfies the jurisdictional test.

Ditches: The Proposed Rule clarifies that non-navigable ditches constructed or excavated “entirely in dry land” and not carrying a relatively permanent flow are not jurisdictional waters. However, ditches that connect to or relocate jurisdictional tributaries maintain their status if the tributary also continues to meet the regulatory definition of a jurisdictional tributary.

New Groundwater Exception: The Proposed Rule states that groundwater, which is by nature not navigable, does not qualify as jurisdictional waters. However, subsurface groundwater that emerges and becomes baseflow in a relatively permanent stream continues to be subject to federal jurisdiction if it otherwise meets the requirements of a WOTUS.

OTHER REVISIONS

Interstate Waters

The Proposed Rule removes “interstate waters” from the list of jurisdictional waters to clarify that a water body that crosses state boundaries but otherwise does not qualify as a WOTUS is not covered by the CWA simply because it crosses a state line.

Mosaic and Permafrost Wetlands

Currently, broad wetlands possessing various hydrologically connected wetland segments constitute a single wetland. Under the Proposed Rule, mosaic wetlands are restricted to the individual segments. The EPA and the Army Corps are also mulling the adoption of a definition of a wetland that excludes certain permafrost wetlands.

IMPLICATIONS

The Proposed Rule is intended to provide further clarity and ease certain regulatory and compliance burdens for projects impacting jurisdictional waters, including projects requiring Section 404 permits and 401 water quality certifications under the Clean Water Act. At the same time, its impact is likely to be incremental when compared to the significant regulatory changes that were already necessitated by the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision.

And, as with all attempts to define Waters of the United States, areas of uncertainty remain due to the inherent difficulty of providing a single regulatory definition that is applicable to infinitely varied and ever-changing bodies of water across the country. As just one example, the proposed rule specifies that a continuous surface connection must be present “at least during the wet season,” and it in turn provides a definition of “wet season.” But precisely how one determines the beginning and ending of the “wet season” is a complex question in practice that will vary in different locations and could even change over time. Further, like other WOTUS rules, the Proposed Rule is almost certain to be subject to legal challenges when it is finalized. Interested stakeholders who are likely to challenge a final rule include environmental groups, other public interest non-governmental organizations, and state attorneys general.

The Proposed Rule is open to comments until January 5, 2026. Morgan Lewis partner Duke McCall provides additional insights on the Proposed Rule in the Law360 article Trump Admin May Be Overpromising WOTUS Clarity.

Regional Review is a year-end series from caa that looks at key developments in a focused industry throughout the year and sets the stage for what’s to come in the near term.

December 2025 — Pittsburgh’s energy sector closed 2025 during one of the most significant shifts in U.S. power demand in almost two decades. National electricity consumption rose an estimated 4% year-over-year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration — the fastest annual increase since 2006.

Join us at the Invest: Pittsburgh 3rd Edition Leadership Summit! This premier event brings together hundreds of Pittsburgh’s business and regional leaders to discuss the challenges and opportunities for businesses and investors. Buy your ticket now!

The acceleration was largely driven by AI and digital infrastructure needs. S&P Global Commodity Insights projected a 22% jump in data-center electricity demand in 2025 alone.

Western Pennsylvania’s energy mix — abundant natural gas, a dense network of legacy pipelines, and a nationally recognized engineering talent pool — allowed Pittsburgh to position itself as a resilient, flexible power hub in a period of rising strain on the national grid.

“The unique aspect of our region is that there is a tremendous amount of natural gas production in the same footprint that is served by Peoples,” said Michael Huwar, president of Peoples Natural Gas. “We pass those savings on to customers while investing in modernization that keeps service safe, reliable and more sustainable.”

Peoples Natural Gas advanced one of the largest infrastructure revitalization efforts in the Northeast this year. In 2025, the utility replaced over 250 miles of aging pipeline and added approximately 75 miles of new mainline to support growing residential and industrial demand. Its 18-county service footprint sits directly atop prolific Marcellus Shale output, allowing the region’s natural gas to trade at about $1 below the national benchmark. Peoples’ cost advantage is directly reinvested into system upgrades.

As Huwar emphasized, “This also allows Peoples to invest into modernization efforts that help keep service safe and reliable while increasing the sustainability of our footprint and our system with minimal impact to the customers that we serve.”

Modernization and resilience under pressure

The rise of AI-driven computing is reshaping electricity demand across the country. A recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global data center electricity consumption will more than double by 2030, driven by rapid growth in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and digital infrastructure. This global trend is already influencing regional planning.

In Pittsburgh, utilities and grid operators are preparing for a new generation of power-intensive facilities, prompting long-term capacity upgrades, substation reinforcement, and system hardening to support the digital economy’s expanding footprint.

Sargent Electric Company remained deeply embedded in these modernization efforts.

“In the medium to long term, the biggest drivers for our growth are data centers and the rise of artificial intelligence,” said Rob Smith, CEO of Sargent Electric Company. “When we talk about data centers, we are also highly focused on the new power plants and sources required to support them.”

For Mike Brady, vice president of power generation execution at Liberty Energy, AI marks a fundamental shift in what the grid must be prepared to deliver. “We aren’t just trying to solve today’s problem; we are trying to solve generational challenges,” Brady said, noting that natural gas will remain essential for fast, flexible and low-latency power.

The industry, Brady added, is still at the very beginning of the curve. “We’re only scratching the surface of new possibilities in AI. The energy needed for the computing power, without latency issues, is enormous,” said Brady.

The opportunity for Pittsburgh extends beyond meeting rising demand and into shaping the foundation of the emerging AI economy. “Our goal is to use natural gas to improve the lives of people, create jobs and provide cleaner solutions,” said Brady, adding that powering AI-driven data centers is “one of the most exciting things” they are involved in.

Reclaiming global position

One of the most consequential energy trends of 2025 was the renewed rise of nuclear power. As a recent Goldman Sachs analysis highlights, accelerating AI adoption and the rapid build-out of data centers are reshaping global electricity demand, and meeting this surge could require 85–90 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity worldwide, underscoring why reliable, 24/7 baseload generation is becoming central to national energy strategies.

“In my 40-plus years in the nuclear business, I have never before witnessed such a pronounced need for nuclear power,” said Jacques Besnainou, chief commercial officer of Westinghouse Electric Company to Invest:.

Pittsburgh, the historic birthplace of commercial nuclear power, is once again at the center. The AP1000 reactor — designed in Cranberry and operating successfully in Georgia and China — is now slated for expansion. Federal policymakers signaled support for 10 new AP1000 large modular reactors to begin U.S. construction before 2030.

Westinghouse estimates that this nuclear buildout, coupled with global projects in Poland, Bulgaria and eventually Ukraine, could generate 15,000 new jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania over the next several years.",https://capitalanalyticsassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pittburgh.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:03:14.193069

Lights, wipers, tires, that one mystery sound you hope no one hears.

Starting Dec. 1, 2025, drivers in North Carolina will have one less inspection hurdle to deal with: window tint is no longer checked during the state inspection process.

That does not mean it’s a free-for-all for blackout tint, though, because the legal limits still apply.

It also means traffic stops may feel a little different, since drivers with tinted windows now have to roll down the window when an officer approaches. If you live anywhere from New Bern to the mountains, the takeaway is the same: easier inspection day, but you still need to stay within the tint rules.

What changed in North Carolina’s window tint inspection rules on Dec. 1, 2025?

Starting Monday, Dec. 1, North Carolina drivers no longer have their window tint checked during state inspections under Senate Bill 43, according to the report from New Bern.

The owner of Craven Tire & Automotive Repair told WITN he supports the shift, saying tint checks were not really a roadworthiness issue for inspections.

The bill text itself describes the change as removing the safety inspection of tinted windows and adding a rule about lowering a tinted window when law enforcement approaches, with an effective date of Dec. 1, 2025.

Does this new law let you choose any window tint you want?

No. A vehicle’s tint percentage must be no darker than 32%. NCDMV’s guidance uses the same cutoff, stating tinted windows cannot measure darker than 32% light transmission using a North Carolina-approved window tint meter (basically, the device used to measure how much light gets through the glass).

The same NCDMV page also spells out a common gotcha on the front windshield: tint cannot extend more than 5 inches below the top of the windshield or below the AS1 line, whichever is longer (the AS1 line is the marking many windshields have near the top showing where factory tinting ends).

And while the page lists multiple exceptions for certain vehicle types and for windows behind the driver on some multipurpose vehicles like SUVs and pickups, the safest assumption for most drivers is still to keep your tint within the stated meter limit unless you know your vehicle qualifies for an exception.

What do drivers have to do during traffic stops if their windows are tinted?

The bill text says the driver of a vehicle with tinted windows must roll down the driver-side window when a law enforcement officer approaches, and if the officer approaches from the passenger side, the driver must roll down the passenger window. The report from New Bern also highlights the same rule as part of the new law.

The practical reason is simple: visibility. WITN reports that the New Bern Police Department’s traffic enforcement unit described the change as a safety measure for both the officer and the people inside the vehicle. And even though inspections won’t include tint checks anymore, law enforcement can still stop and test window tint, and if the tint is too dark, officers can still enforce its removal.

How can North Carolina drivers stay compliant?

Passing an inspection will no longer be sufficient to prove your tint is legal. So if your tint is borderline, you do not want your first measurement to happen on the shoulder of the road.

Here are practical steps drivers can take right now, based on what state guidance and the Dec. 1 changes require:

If you have after-factory tint, make sure it is not darker than 32% on a state-approved tint meter.

Keep your windshield tint within the allowed strip (no more than 5 inches below the top or below the AS1 line, whichever is longer).

If you have a medical exception, keep the permit with the vehicle and make sure the medical exception sticker is correctly displayed in the lower left corner of the rear window.

During any traffic stop, roll down the window on the side the officer approaches.

If you are unsure whether your vehicle type has different rules for windows behind the driver, check NCDMV’s exception categories before assuming you are covered.",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/the-law-changing-how-your-car-inspected-has-come-into-effect.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 12:03:11.670936

Where mitigation is installed, prepare an operation, maintenance and monitoring plan that ties system performance metrics to the site-specific AF.","Vapor intrusion occurs when volatile chemicals in soil gas migrate into buildings and affect indoor air. California’s multiagency supplemental guidance on the subject uses attenuation factors, or AFs, to translate subsurface concentrations into predicted indoor air concentrations.

An AF of 0.03 assumes 3% of the contaminant in subslab or nearsource soil gas reaches indoor air. If subslab soil gas is 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter, the default predicts 30 μg/m³ indoors, often above typical screening targets.

When applied to remedy selection, the default can outpace the actual risk shown by building-specific data.

This article has two aims. On policy, it argues for keeping 0.03 as a screening value while centering cleanup on risk-based, site-specific AFs. On practice, it outlines steps regulated businesses, developers and lenders can take while the workshop process unfolds.

At the California Environmental Protection Agency’s July 24 kickoff workshop, CalEPA staff announced a series of additional public workshops, from September of this year through February 2026, to gather feedback and explain how California will evaluate vapor intrusion beyond initial screening.

The series, a follow-on to the agency’s February 2023 supplemental guidance and staff training, gives agencies a window to assess whether 0.03 should remain a screening value, and how California-specific, risk-based AFs might inform cleanup and closure. The State Water Board is compiling GeoTracker submittals to support this work.

Timing and Resourcing

A California-specific AF database may be years away. Submissions vary by contaminant, building type, sampling method and quality, and agencies must standardize and analyze them before statewide statistics become defensible.

CalEPA may not yet have a dedicated team or budget to process all GeoTracker vapor data. Even given sufficient staffing, the process of filtering outliers, treating nondetects, pairing samples, and stratifying by foundation and pathway conditions will take years.

Given these constraints, it makes sense for 0.03 to remain the screening factor, with site-specific AFs guiding cleanup.

In the interim, projects can improve the dataset by using consistent sampling rounds, documenting building pressure conditions, and reporting detection limits and qualifiers, so that future statewide analyses can separate method artifacts from actual concentration patterns.

Evidence

The national dataset behind 0.03 reflects colder climates, more basements and building stock that isn’t typical of California.

In-state compilations — hundreds to thousands of paired indoor-air and subslab or soil-gas samples from commercial, light industrial and residential buildings — show attenuation in the 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁴ range, with 95th-percentile values below 0.03.

A California empirical study by Rafat Abbasi and colleagues, published in 2022 and based on about 600 paired measurements from 32 sites, reported a 95th-percentile subslab-to-indoor AF of 0.005. Together, these data indicate that 0.03 is conservative for many California buildings.

In practice, the difference is material. For the same 1,000 μg/m³ subslab concentration, a 0.03 AF predicts 30 μg/m³ indoors, while a site-specific AF of 0.005 predicts 5 μg/m³. That shift often marks the boundary between requiring active mitigation as a remedy and confirming mitigation as a protective design choice.

Regulatory Posture

CalEPA must align vapor intrusion reviews across the Department of Toxic Substances Control, the State Water Resources Control Board, regional water boards across the state, and local programs, and stay consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s framework.

The EPA still treats 0.03 as an appropriate screening factor. Moving ahead of that structure before California’s database is complete and peer reviewed could invite challenges to the administrative record.

Retaining a conservative screen at the front end also serves a technical purpose. Even with conservative inputs, Johnson and Ettinger modeling, introduced in 1991, doesn’t always capture preferential utility pathways, intermittent depressurization or older slabs. A single screening value keeps potential outliers in the evaluation set while data remain limited.

These institutional and technical considerations explain why 0.03 remains the default screen. They also suggest that the most durable near-term change is not a new statewide number, but better documentation of site-specific AFs in individual decision files.

Practice Drift

The issue lies in letting the screen define the remedy, not in the conservative screen itself.

Some reviewers and counterparties treat 0.03 as a cleanup endpoint, fixing conservative assumptions in land-use approvals, closure targets and transactional terms.

That practice can divert resources to address modeled risk that building data don’t substantiate, and can delay infill projects that otherwise could proceed with engineered controls and monitoring tied to actual indoor-air conditions.

A Measured Path: Policy and Practice

The near-term policy course is to state plainly in guidance and case files that 0.03 is a screening value. Where building data exist, agencies should identify and document the sitespecific AF that will govern remedy selection and closure, rather than allow the default screen to migrate into an endpoint.

For regulated parties, the practical path is to build the record needed to support a site-specific AF.

After direct indoor-air measurements, a defined exposure pathway, control of preferential pathways, and a mitigation design that meets California standards, sponsors should use paired data and transparent Johnson and Ettinger model runs to justify a lower AF that reflects building conditions.

In that setting, continued reliance on 0.03 as the endpoint doesn’t provide added health protection.

Sponsors should also address indoor background and source apportionment in their files, so the record distinguishes ambient or tenant-related contributors from vapor intrusion.

Where This Is Headed

For redevelopment, developers should design vapor intrusion mitigation systems into new buildings at affected sites.

After occupancy, verify performance with seasonal, colocated indoor-air and subslab sampling. Use those results to establish the building-specific AF that will set operation, monitoring and contingency triggers.

For existing buildings, pair remediation with seasonal paired sampling. Combine results with Johnson and Ettinger modeling and the conceptual site model to establish a site-specific AF that sets risk-based cleanup and, when appropriate, closure.

Document inputs, assumptions and data quality so reviewers can rely on the number.

Where mitigation is installed, prepare an operation, maintenance and monitoring plan that ties system performance metrics to the site-specific AF. This linkage allows adjustments without reopening endpoint debates.

What to Do Now: Recommendations for Regulated Parties

Generate high-quality paired indoor-air and subslab or soil-gas data, and submit them in agency formats for GeoTracker. Maintain Johnson and Ettinger runs with California-realistic inputs as the post-screening alternative to 0.03.

In correspondence, state that 0.03 is for screening, and that site-specific, risk-based Afs should set remedies and closure once building data and controls exist.

Align lenders and insurers so that transaction documents don’t fix 0.03 as a remedial standard. When negotiating transactional terms, anchor representations and triggers to measured indoor-air results and the documented site-specific AF, not to the statewide screen.

Conclusion

CalEPA’s workshop series provides a forum to test methods while statewide AF work proceeds over a longer horizon. Keeping 0.03 at screening, while moving cleanup and closure to site-specific, risk-based AFs, protects occupants, supports infill and brownfield projects, and builds the record California needs for future guidance.

The approach also gives project sponsors and financiers a clearer framework: Design for protection, measure performance and let the building’s data — not a generic screen — set the remedy.

Rep. Ken Luttrell, R-Ponca City, vice chair of the Oklahoma House Energy Committee, traveled to Gulfport, Mississippi, where he joined legislators from across the United States and Canada for a multi-state conference examining the future of North American energy policy. Lawmakers gathered to confront rapidly shifting demands on the power grid and to identify strategies that keep states competitive and energy-secure.

Lawmakers Tackle Grid Reliability, Data Centers, and Energy Demand

Conference organizers built the sessions around the most urgent topics facing state energy leaders. Legislators addressed how states must reinforce grid resiliency as extreme weather, population growth, and industrial expansion increase strain on electric systems. Speakers also detailed how the explosive growth of data centers, driven by artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and high-density server farms, continues to reshape long-term energy planning.

Regulators, utility executives, and policy strategists explained the legal obstacles that states face when they attempt to modernize infrastructure or integrate large-load industrial customers. Participants reviewed real-world permitting timelines, courtroom challenges, and legislative solutions that other states already implemented.

Permitting Reform and LNG Export Momentum Take Center Stage

Lawmakers also explored ways to streamline permitting for major energy projects, a topic that touched everything from transmission lines to power plants to natural gas processing infrastructure. Presenters emphasized that long delays often increase project costs and block states from meeting economic development goals.

The conference also highlighted ongoing LNG export initiatives, particularly along the Gulf Coast. Experts explained how increasing global demand for U.S. natural gas continues to shape investment, workforce planning, and regional infrastructure development.

Luttrell Brings Oklahoma’s Perspective to National Discussions

Luttrell said he valued the opportunity to collaborate with policymakers who confront similar issues in their own states.

“This conference provided valuable insight into the challenges and opportunities ahead,” Luttrell said. “We’re all looking toward a future where reliable, affordable energy is essential for families, businesses and national security. These conversations help us make informed decisions for Oklahoma.”

He emphasized that he plans to bring the insights back to the Capitol as lawmakers craft policy to support electric reliability, responsible development, and long-term affordability.

Luttrell said he looks forward to applying what he learned as lawmakers continue working on policies that strengthen Oklahoma’s energy landscape.

CEF China engagement lead Caroline Wang stated that the flood of outbound activity is partly driven by a simple structural imbalance. In her words, “China’s got a supply glut when it comes to green technology, like solar panels and batteries, because of a structural supply-demand mismatch, so they need overseas markets to absorb their products.”

Investments abroad are now performing a dual function for China. They deflect domestic margin pressure and extend global market share at a moment when clean technology realignment sits at the center of energy security, industrial competitiveness, and climate transition diplomacy.

Shifting Trade Dynamics After United States Tariffs

The report links the acceleration to new U.S. tariff policy implemented under President Donald Trump. Several markets strengthened cleantech cooperation with China rather than retreat from it, a result that has layered geopolitical complexity into supply chain diversification conversations occurring in Washington, Brussels, and Tokyo.

This trend has amplified China’s leverage in a sector where it already dominates refining, module production, and battery processing. Outbound infrastructure projects effectively create demand for Chinese-manufactured components and embed its technology across third countries’ grids, industrial zones, and transportation systems.

The governance context matters. Countries balancing energy affordability, industrial growth, and climate commitments are accepting Chinese capital, but those same investments cement dependencies that may shape global energy politics long past the current decade.

Opportunity and Risk for Emerging Economies

CEF’s findings indicate that these capital flows are disproportionately landing in emerging economies. Research from the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins University estimates that 75 percent of China’s low-carbon foreign direct investment sits across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.

Southeast Asia remained the strongest magnet for manufacturing-linked projects, particularly electric vehicles and energy storage. New solar manufacturing slowed due to U.S. trade measures, but power generation, battery plants, and EV assembly capacity continued to scale with momentum.

The Middle East and North Africa region delivered the fastest-growing deal volume. Here, state diversification strategies away from oil reliance intersect directly with Chinese cleantech capacity. Countries seeking to hedge hydrocarbon exposure are accelerating partnerships, often through joint venture structures and vertically integrated project plans.

Wang framed the opportunity clearly. She noted that expansion offers emerging markets a route to reduce fossil fuel import exposure while building new industrial capabilities. At the same time, she warned that participation is time sensitive. “China’s leading the world in the technologies, in the innovation, and if you don’t get into the supply chain quickly, there’s a risk you miss out on innovation opportunities,” she said.

Mega-Projects Reveal Supply Chain Strategy

The scale of recent investments reinforces China’s long-view industrial posture. Among the largest new commitments highlighted by CEF is an USD 8.28 billion green hydrogen venture in Nigeria led by Longi Green Energy. CATL is building a USD 6 billion battery plant in Indonesia that will anchor regional EV ecosystem development. The report notes that firms increasingly prefer upstream-to-downstream integration, locking in mineral inputs, refining capacity, module fabrication, and end-use product assembly under one umbrella.

These structures reduce risk exposure, insulate manufacturers from price swings, and deepen host-market dependency on imported Chinese technical standards and components. For investors, such configurations offer scale and continuity. For governments, they deliver rapid infrastructure but also shape long-term industrial policy.

What Global Leaders Should Track Next

For C-suite leaders, fund managers, and policymakers, the question now shifts from whether China will drive cleantech expansion abroad to how host nations position themselves within that growth. Countries able to absorb technology, develop local supply chains, and negotiate balanced industrial terms stand to gain. Those that rely solely on inbound capital may find themselves locked into externally controlled value chains.

As global transition spending intensifies, China’s USD 180 billion outbound footprint illustrates a redistribution of climate investment power. Emerging markets are becoming the next arena of scaling, competition, and innovation. The next decade of cleantech leadership will likely be defined in Lagos, Jakarta, Riyadh, and Hanoi as much as in Beijing, Brussels, and Washington.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/China-Drives-80-Billion-in-Overseas-Clean-Technology-Expansion.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:01:36.778764

Bottom Line The Ninth Circuit’s injunction offers temporary relief, but uncertainty looms.","California’s ambitious climate disclosure regime has hit a significant roadblock. On November 18, 2025, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted an injunction halting enforcement of SB 261, the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, pending resolution of a constitutional challenge. This ruling comes just weeks before the law’s first compliance deadline of January 1, 2026, creating uncertainty for thousands of companies doing business in the state.

What SB 261 Requires

SB 261 mandates that U.S. companies with over $500 million in annual revenue and operations in California publish a climate-related financial risk report every two years, starting January 2026. These reports must outline climate-related financial risks and strategies for mitigation and adaptation, aligning with frameworks such as TCFD or IFRS S2.

The Ninth Circuit’s Decision

The injunction stems from a lawsuit led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups, arguing that SB 261—and its companion law, SB 253—violates the First Amendment by compelling speech on controversial policy matters. While SB 261 enforcement is paused, SB 253, which requires greenhouse gas emissions disclosures for companies with revenues over $1 billion, remains unaffected. CARB has proposed an initial SB 253 compliance deadline of August 10, 2026.

Oral arguments on the SB 261 appeal are scheduled for January 9, 2026, but the court could rule earlier or later, leaving companies in limbo. Meanwhile, CARB has delayed issuing final implementing regulations for both laws until Q1 2026, though statutory deadlines technically remain in place.

Legal Landscape

The Ninth Circuit’s injunction does not invalidate SB 261—it merely pauses enforcement. If lifted, compliance obligations could resume immediately. Adding to the complexity, ExxonMobil filed a separate challenge in October 2025, asserting similar constitutional claims and arguing federal preemption under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act. That case is now on hold pending the Ninth Circuit’s decision.

What Companies Should Watch

Ninth Circuit Ruling: A decision could come before or after January’s oral arguments.

CARB Rulemaking: Draft regulations expected in early 2026 will clarify scope, definitions, and enforcement.

Potential Supreme Court Review: If SB 261 survives appeal, plaintiffs may escalate.

SB 253 Compliance: No injunction applies—companies should continue preparing for emissions disclosures.

Recommendations

Despite the injunction, companies should maintain a “ready posture”:

Continue Preparations: Draft SB 261 reports using TCFD or IFRS S2 frameworks.

Assess Applicability: Review CARB’s preliminary list of covered entities and revenue thresholds.

Integrate ESG Strategy: Align SB 261 planning with SB 253 efforts for efficiency.

Monitor Developments: Stay alert for Ninth Circuit rulings and CARB updates in Q1 2026.

Bottom Line

The Ninth Circuit’s injunction offers temporary relief, but uncertainty looms.

Senate Bill 54, introduced by Senator Liz Brown, would prevent cities, towns, and counties from creating new solar overlay districts after December 31, 2025, unless every underlying zoning district already permits commercial solar development. The measure would apply to all future projects and would require rezonings for any district that lacks explicit solar authorization.

Overlay districts have been a central tool for counties managing the growth of utility-scale solar. They allow officials to set standards—such as setbacks, vegetative buffers, road use requirements, and decommissioning rules—without overhauling long-standing zoning classifications. In many rural counties, agricultural zoning is the default land use, and overlays have helped bridge the gap between traditional land-use maps and modern energy infrastructure needs.

SB 54 would eliminate that flexibility. Any county hoping to use an overlay in the future would need to address zoning first, bringing solar-related decisions into a more formal—and often more contentious—rezoning process. Rezoning requires public hearings before plan commissions and local legislative bodies, which typically draws greater attention and offers opponents more opportunities to slow or block a project.

The potential impact on Indiana’s solar development pipeline is considerable. Many counties have not updated their zoning codes in years, and several lack clear definitions for commercial solar use. Under SB 54, those gaps become barriers. Developers may face longer timelines, while local agencies will need to reconcile outdated maps with growing interest in renewable energy.

The bill does not prohibit commercial solar, but it shifts critical decision-making upstream, turning land classification—not overlay standards—into the deciding factor for project viability. For Indiana, where energy markets are expanding and counties vary widely in their approach to renewable siting, SB 54 represents a notable recalibration of local authority and a more structured framework for governing where utility-scale solar can be built.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251208-070744-79c-Panoramic%20view%20of%20rural%20solar%20panels%20and%20agricultural%20fields%20under%20blue%20sky..jpg,N,,2025-12-08 12:03:29.423156

Among other things, it requested commitments be made to transition the existing local skilled labour supply into the Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme, under which the UK Government hosts its annual renewable energy auctions.

MPs also want to see more measures to encourage local governments to accelerate the roll-out of retrofit and take the lead on place-based approaches to net-zero; and accelerate the adoption of clean energy and retrofit skills policies in the UK Government’s Spending Review, creating a ten-year horizon for initiatives and funding, to be revised every five years.

The ESNZ Committee called for the Government to launch new initiatives promoting clean energy and retrofit careers for underrepresented groups, and bring forward the Warm Homes Plan, to determine the workforce needed for the project and how that workforce will be found.

The Plan should be published before Christmas. It will detail more than £13bn of spending to benefit predominantly low-income and social homes with energy efficiency improvements and electric heating.

Given the fact that around 70% of individuals studying construction-related further education courses either do not complete the course or do not enter the sector once qualified, the Committee recommended that the Government expands ‘try before you buy’ training opportunities.

Currently, the UK needs a further 250,000 workers to meet new housing targets, and more will be needed to accelerate retrofit. While the Climate Change Committee estimates a gain of between 135,000 and 725,000 jobs created from the energy transition in the next four years, most of these workers will be required to retrain or reskill, with some specifically skilled workers needing to be imported from overseas, at least short term.

Clean energy jobs

The recommendations from the ESNZ Committee come shortly after the UK Government published its first clean energy jobs plan, building on the 10-year Industrial Strategy and with an aim to train and recruit workers for the energy transition. The headline ambition is doubling employment in clean energy and energy transition sectors to more than 850,000 roles by 2030.

The clean energy jobs plan identifies 31 occupations which will suffer severe skills gaps in the near future, including welding, carpentry, joining and electrical engineering. The new plan forecasts a total of 400,000 new full-time equivalent roles, including 20,000 in Scotland and 20,000 in the East of England.

ESNZ Committee chair Bill Esterson, the Labour MP for Sefton Central, stated: “It is essential that we build the workforce for the energy transition so that the Government can hit its clean energy targets and, importantly, ensure that the UK makes the most of the growth opportunity of the century.

“The Committee has found that market forces alone cannot overcome the skills gap. We need policy certainty for the long-term, locally directed investment in training, and policies that make clean energy careers attractive and accessible.

“For British workers this isn’t about hitting deadlines; it’s about securing good jobs, driving innovation, and ensuring Britain leads in the global race for clean energy.”

As winter approaches, so do reports of electric vehicles being stranded in frigid temperatures at charger stations or along the road. The same can happen to gas-powered vehicles, but it's EVs that make the headlines, since the cold has a more pronounced effect on range, efficiency, and charging speeds. They have their own driving style, which requires some adjusting to.

A cold weather study of EVs in freezing temperatures by Recurrent Auto, an EV battery research firm, examined over 10,000 vehicles and found that, on average, electric vehicles lose nearly 30% of their range (find further tips for improving your range here). With this in mind, CarMax partnered with the car experts at Edmunds to round up some tips on how to improve your EV's range in cold weather.

How does the cold affect EVs?

There are three main factors that determine how cold weather can impact an EV.

Cold temperatures slow down the chemical reactions that occur in an EV battery. Electrolytes are the battery component that transfers ions-charge-carrying particles-back and forth between the two electrodes, causing the battery to charge and discharge. In colder conditions, these electrolytes become thick or viscous, making it harder for the ions to travel to the cathode, reducing efficiency. Put differently, imagine that you were thirsty and needed a bottle of water. However, you accidentally left the bottle in the freezer too long, and the water is now slushy, making it a lot harder to drink than if it were at room temperature.

The second is charging, and the same viscous electrolyte problem applies here, too. If the temperature is too low, the battery will have trouble storing the energy from the charge plug. The battery must be brought up to the proper temperature to charge at its full potential. If the EV has not been preconditioned (heating the battery to a more ideal temperature), or if it isn't equipped with a thermal management system, Recurrent says that the first 30-45 minutes of your charging session may not add any charge but instead just raise the battery's temperature to prepare for the actual charging.

The third factor is that when it's cold, most people will usually run the heater. However, an EV needs to use more energy to create that heat, whereas a gas-powered car can redirect the heat naturally generated from the engine.

Tips to extend an EV's range in the cold

Precondition both the battery and the cabin.

Ideally, you should charge the car in your garage to minimize the impact of the cold. Many EVs will allow you to schedule charging. Set it to finish shortly before you plan on leaving the house. You'll also want to turn on the car's heaters while it is still charging. This approach ensures that both the cabin and battery will be warm without affecting the range.

If you're on the road and need to fast-charge, make sure to set the EV to precondition the battery to get to the proper temperature for charging. You can manually set it to precondition in the charge settings, but some newer EVs do it automatically when you use the in-car navigation to route to a charger. This feature does use up some energy, so avoid using it if you're running low on range. However, it can save you time and money spent on public chargers.

Use seat and steering wheel heaters.

If you're on the road and need to fast-charge, make sure to set the EV to precondition the battery to get the proper temperature for charging.

These accessories consume less power than a typical heater and can still keep you warm on your journey. If it's not too bulky, you might also consider leaving your jacket on, which should help with keeping warm in combination with the seat heaters.

Check your tire pressure.

As a rule of thumb, every 10-degree drop in temperature can reduce the pressure of your tires by 1 pound per square inch (psi). Tires that are low on pressure can not only reduce grip but can also reduce your vehicle's range.

Always be charging.

Even if your EV has a sufficient charge for your commute, it can be a good idea to keep it plugged in as much as possible during the colder months. Recurrent recommends setting the charge limit anywhere between 70% and 80% because this keeps the battery at an ideal temperature. With this method, the vehicle will use the power from the outlet to keep it warm rather than drawing from the battery itself.

Consider an EV with a heat pump.

An EV heat pump is a device that generates heat for the cabin more efficiently than a basic EV heater. Having a heat pump puts less strain on the battery and reduces the range penalty that would otherwise occur, also potentially reducing maintenance costs. Some cars have better thermal management than others and will lose less range in freezing temperatures.

Heat pumps are standard in many, but not all, modern electric vehicles. Unfortunately, it can be hard to tell which models have a heat pump just by looking at them. You'll need to do some research on the year, make, and model of the EV you're interested in. Some notable models with heat pumps include the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and EV9, Subaru Solterra, Toyota bZ4X, 2021 and newer Teslas, Jaguar I-Pace, the recent BMW i models, and more.

Consider winter EV tires.

If you live in an area that regularly experiences freezing temperatures, a good set of winter tires designed for an EV will help maximize its range since there is less rolling resistance. Additionally, winter tires are typically noisier than non-winter tires, and given that EVs operate quietly, a good-quality winter tire can help minimize road noise that would be more noticeable in an EV.

Don't let the cold scare you

We're not pointing this issue out to scare you off from buying an EV if you live in a colder climate, but rather to educate you on how the cold affects them in distinctly different ways than gas cars. For perspective, the cold hasn't scared people off in Norway, where EV adoption is over 80%, and the average winter temperature is about 19.8 degrees Fahrenheit. In other words, with proper precautions, most people should be able to manage an EV in the winter.

By growing our movement throughout the year, you powered many meaningful victories. This speaks volumes given the unprecedented political headwinds we’re facing.

Your acts of generosity, resistance, and perseverance led to wins that bring real relief to our families, our communities, and our planet — relief that can be felt by all of us.

Here are just a few accomplishments you made possible this year.

Together we:

1. Protected a key water safety rule for lead-free water

Intense nationwide grassroots pressure, led by Food & Water Watch, stopped a dangerous attempt by House Republicans to strip away the Lead Out of Water Rule, officially called Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI). This rule mandates the elimination of toxic lead service lines in most communities over the next decade.

This means that many cities and towns across the country that rely on federal funding to replace lead service lines can make their water safer for their communities. Every person deserves safe, lead-free water.

2. Drove support for the Climate Change Superfund Act in states coast to coast

Together, we’re working to pass Climate Change Superfund Acts in Massachusetts, New Jersey, California, and Maryland. Modeled after similar laws passed in New York and Vermont, these bills would ensure the fossil fuel industry, not taxpayers, foots the bill for infrastructure projects to help states become more resilient to flooding, severe storms, and other climate impacts.

You powered campaigns that drove over 60 New Jersey municipalities — and counting! — to support its version of the bill, and passed nearly 20 resolutions in California.

3. Protected our oceans from industrial fish farming

Food & Water Watch and a coalition of allies solidified a legal win from late last year when a federal judge invalidated a nationwide factory fish farming permit, which threatened to pave the way for dirty offshore aquaculture projects.

This permit would have allowed for the construction of industrial fish farms in U.S. federal ocean waters to produce massive quantities of finfish such as salmon, trout, and bass — along with massive amounts of pollution.

Fish farming threatens marine ecosystems as well as endangered whales, salmon, sea turtles, and many other imperiled species. It also threatens traditional fishing economies, Tribal Nations’ food security, and public health.

HARRISBURG — Attorney General Dave Sunday is leading a coalition of 36 Attorneys General in urging Congress to pass into law H.R. 1633 — the Workforce Reentry Act, sponsored by Congressman Lloyd Smucker (R-Lancaster) — which will equip individuals released from prison with resources and skills to successfully reintegrate into society.

The legislation would increase public safety by reducing recidivism rates, while cutting taxpayer burdens related to incarceration costs, and empowering the paroled individuals to lead fulfilling lives.

H.R. 1633 would make permanent grant funding opportunities for resources and programming, while ensuring efficient use of those funds by attaching new requirements to the grants.

“Successful reentry benefits everyone, so we need to do all we can to provide people leaving incarceration the tools they need to land on their feet and be contributors for their families and communities,” Attorney General Sunday said. “We are asking Congress to recognize the essential resources and services made available to reentrants under the Workforce Reentry Act. Employment provides a person with an identity, a sense of self-worth and pride that positively impacts everything they do.”

According to federal data, the national recidivism rate is around 68 percent for individuals within three years of completion of incarceration. That number soars to 83 percent over nine years.

Recidivism not only potentially endangers every person, family, and community when a new crime is committed, it also results in tremendous taxpayer costs associated with arrest, prosecution, and incarceration.

Recidivism, however, is not inevitable. Research shows the impetus for recidivism is lack of opportunities and skills for those leaving prison — including employment opportunities.

Currently, funding for programs that bolster those skills and opportunities is in flux and oftentimes not available at all. The Workforce Reentry Act would make permanent grant funding streams to stabilize resources related to successful reentry.

Communities that have embraced reentry programs have seen significant decreases in recidivism rates and prison populations.

The same can happen to gas-powered vehicles, but it's EVs that make the headlines, since the cold has a more pronounced effect on range, efficiency, and charging speeds. They have their own driving style, which requires some adjusting to.

A cold weather study of EVs in freezing temperatures by Recurrent Auto, an EV battery research firm, examined over 10,000 vehicles and found that, on average, electric vehicles lose nearly 30% of their range (find further tips for improving your range here). With this in mind, CarMax partnered with the car experts at Edmunds to round up some tips on how to improve your EV's range in cold weather.

How does the cold affect EVs?

There are three main factors that determine how cold weather can impact an EV.

Cold temperatures slow down the chemical reactions that occur in an EV battery. Electrolytes are the battery component that transfers ions—charge-carrying particles—back and forth between the two electrodes, causing the battery to charge and discharge. In colder conditions, these electrolytes become thick or viscous, making it harder for the ions to travel to the cathode, reducing efficiency. Put differently, imagine that you were thirsty and needed a bottle of water. However, you accidentally left the bottle in the freezer too long, and the water is now slushy, making it a lot harder to drink than if it were at room temperature.

The second is charging, and the same viscous electrolyte problem applies here, too. If the temperature is too low, the battery will have trouble storing the energy from the charge plug. The battery must be brought up to the proper temperature to charge at its full potential. If the EV has not been preconditioned (heating the battery to a more ideal temperature), or if it isn't equipped with a thermal management system, Recurrent says that the first 30-45 minutes of your charging session may not add any charge but instead just raise the battery's temperature to prepare for the actual charging.

The third factor is that when it’s cold, most people will usually run the heater. However, an EV needs to use more energy to create that heat, whereas a gas-powered car can redirect the heat naturally generated from the engine.

Tips to extend an EV's range in the cold

Precondition both the battery and the cabin.

Ideally, you should charge the car in your garage to minimize the impact of the cold. Many EVs will allow you to schedule charging. Set it to finish shortly before you plan on leaving the house. You'll also want to turn on the car's heaters while it is still charging. This approach ensures that both the cabin and battery will be warm without affecting the range.

If you're on the road and need to fast-charge, make sure to set the EV to precondition the battery to get to the proper temperature for charging. You can manually set it to precondition in the charge settings, but some newer EVs do it automatically when you use the in-car navigation to route to a charger. This feature does use up some energy, so avoid using it if you're running low on range. However, it can save you time and money spent on public chargers.

Use seat and steering wheel heaters.

If you're on the road and need to fast-charge, make sure to set the EV to precondition the battery to get the proper temperature for charging.

These accessories consume less power than a typical heater and can still keep you warm on your journey. If it's not too bulky, you might also consider leaving your jacket on, which should help with keeping warm in combination with the seat heaters.

Check your tire pressure.

As a rule of thumb, every 10-degree drop in temperature can reduce the pressure of your tires by 1 pound per square inch (psi). Tires that are low on pressure can not only reduce grip but can also reduce your vehicle's range.

Always be charging.

Even if your EV has a sufficient charge for your commute, it can be a good idea to keep it plugged in as much as possible during the colder months. Recurrent recommends setting the charge limit anywhere between 70% and 80% because this keeps the battery at an ideal temperature. With this method, the vehicle will use the power from the outlet to keep it warm rather than drawing from the battery itself.

Consider an EV with a heat pump.

An EV heat pump is a device that generates heat for the cabin more efficiently than a basic EV heater. Having a heat pump puts less strain on the battery and reduces the range penalty that would otherwise occur, also potentially reducing maintenance costs. Some cars have better thermal management than others and will lose less range in freezing temperatures.

Heat pumps are standard in many, but not all, modern electric vehicles. Unfortunately, it can be hard to tell which models have a heat pump just by looking at them. You'll need to do some research on the year, make, and model of the EV you're interested in. Some notable models with heat pumps include the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and EV9, Subaru Solterra, Toyota bZ4X, 2021 and newer Teslas, Jaguar I-Pace, the recent BMW i models, and more.

Consider winter EV tires.

If you live in an area that regularly experiences freezing temperatures, a good set of winter tires designed for an EV will help maximize its range since there is less rolling resistance. Additionally, winter tires are typically noisier than non-winter tires, and given that EVs operate quietly, a good-quality winter tire can help minimize road noise that would be more noticeable in an EV.

Don't let the cold scare you

We're not pointing this issue out to scare you off from buying an EV if you live in a colder climate, but rather to educate you on how the cold affects them in distinctly different ways than gas cars. For perspective, the cold hasn't scared people off in Norway, where EV adoption is over 80%, and the average winter temperature is about 19.8 degrees Fahrenheit. In other words, with proper precautions, most people should be able to manage an EV in the winter.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/32/63254b6c-45d4-517c-89d8-4872562f7184/6936f9c969143.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C23&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-08 12:03:33.462166

Southern is a U.S.-based developer of low-cost, biomass-derived clean fuels, best known for its flagship project in Louisiana that plans to transform regional wood-waste feedstock into green methanol and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on a large commercial scale. The two organizations will merge under a newly formed, U.S.-domiciled parent company that is expected to be listed on Nasdaq after fulfilling all customary closing requirements.

The new combined entity aims to play a central role in helping global aviation and maritime operators comply with increasingly stringent decarbonization mandates issued under frameworks such as ReFuelEU and by global regulatory bodies like the International Maritime Organization (IMO). By developing a fully integrated clean-fuels platform anchored in Louisiana, the company intends to use domestic resources, secure supply chains, and a local workforce to manufacture carbon-negative SAF and green methanol at competitive prices.

Under the proposed structure, the combined organization will operate through two core divisions. The first will focus on climate-oriented solutions that generate environmental assets such as carbon credits. The second division will concentrate on clean-fuel production, with its initial emphasis on the previously announced Louisiana biomass-to-fuel project. By merging DevvStream's environmental-asset expertise with Southern's biomass-conversion technology, the new company seeks to lower production costs and remove a major barrier that has slowed alternative fuel adoption across the aviation and maritime industries.

Management anticipates that by taking advantage of early federal incentives, combined with co-products generated during fuel production, the platform can ultimately achieve cost competitiveness even without government subsidies. Additionally, the company plans to leverage early engagement from airlines and maritime offtakers who are preparing to meet future carbon-reduction obligations. For investors, this strategic move signifies a transformation of DevvStream—from a smaller services-oriented company into a scalable industrial clean-fuels producer with long-term revenue visibility.

Leadership of the newly formed company is expected to be headed by Carl Stanton, who will assume the role of CEO. The organization will operate under the name Southern Energy Renewables. The transaction is currently expected to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory clearances and shareholder approvals.

Stanton highlighted the urgency behind the merger, noting that aviation and maritime companies face some of the most aggressive global decarbonization requirements.

By Lakshita Dey

Electric vehicles (EVs) are powering a transformative revolution, paving the way for a cleaner, greener future. EVs offer a significant environmental advantage by eliminating the reliance on fossil fuels, but their widespread adoption faces challenges related to high costs and limited accessibility.[1] As society pushes for these technological advancements, two critical legal questions arise: are incentives working as intended, and are the benefits of these incentives distributed equitably across income groups?

Governments are accelerating EV adoption by providing tax credits and rebates, as they recognize the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions and foster a clean energy future.[2]￼ The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) extends tax credits for new and used EV purchases through 2032, offers credit for commercial EVs, and revives credits for charging infrastructure.[3] The IRA has demonstrated the government’s commitment to the EV transition, which has significantly boosted the market by reassuring consumers and businesses.[4] Automakers are responding by announcing massive investments in EV production.[5]

Despite these legislative efforts and progressive market shifts, equity challenges remain. The price of an EV presents a hurdle for many families. Even though the average price of an EV is falling, it is still notably higher than the price of a gas-powered car.[6] This economic reality highlights a fundamental issue of deep-seated financial barriers which hinder equitable access. By their very nature, tax credits only benefit those with sufficient tax liability to claim them, which means that many of these incentives provide little to no direct benefit for low-income families. Consequently, the cost of EV ownership remains a financial burden, even with governmental assistance.

Beyond the purchase price, EV infrastructure presents another barrier to fair access. Owning an EV comes with the challenge of charging. Uneven geographic distribution of public charging stations furthers the lack of accessibility. Research consistently shows that residents of low-income and minority neighborhoods have significantly less access to reliable public charging stations.[7] This inequitable distribution creates “charging deserts,” making EV ownership impractical for those without consistent home charging.[8]

Solving these challenges requires an approach that addresses both the upfront costs of EVs and the inequity of charging infrastructure. Federal bills provide grants to companies that prioritize projects in rural areas and low-to-moderate-income communities.[9] Point-of-sale rebates can solve the issue of the current tax credit model benefiting only those with sufficient tax liability.[10] This approach is more equitable because it offers a direct, immediate discount at the time of purchase, making the financial benefit accessible to all households, regardless of their tax burden. For instance, the HOMES rebate program allows for a point-of-sale rebate that provides an immediate discount on the EV’s price at the dealership, eliminating tax return[11] This shift represents a significant improvement in legislation and policy, directly addressing a key barrier to equitable access.

Alongside tax rebates, holistic strategies are essential to ensure an equitable EV transition. For example, California’s “Clean Cars 4 All” program addresses two major issues: it promotes access to clean transportation and improves local air quality by getting old, high-polluting vehicles off the road.[12] The program provides significant incentives for low-income residents who trade in their gas-powered cars for cleaner options.[13] This targeted approach promotes equitable access while also directly improving local air quality in disadvantaged communities.

Another crucial strategy is implementing community-based solutions. Specifically, EV car-sharing services provide on-demand access to electric vehicles without the burden of full ownership, insurance, or maintenance.[14] Likewise, investing in and electrifying public transportation directly benefits low-income communities by improving local air quality and providing a clean, affordable alternative to personal vehicle ownership.[15] By combining these diverse strategies, policymakers and communities can achieve a truly sustainable future, ensuring that the benefits of the EV revolution are accessible to all, not just a privileged few.

While community-based solutions are vital, they cannot succeed without an extensive upgrade to charging infrastructure. The success of the EV revolution also depends on closing the charging infrastructure gap. Federal and state governments should continue to prioritize the deployment of affordable and publicly accessible charging stations in low-income neighborhoods and rural areas.[16] To offset profitability issues, charging manufacturers can be incentivized to accept a longer return on investment for charging stations that may not be immediately profitable through tax rebates.[17] Furthermore, the state legislature could also create a subsidized charging card payment for lower-income residents to access public chargers.[18] The solution is not just about individual car ownership; it’s about providing access to clean mobility.

The legal and policy challenges of EVs demand a holistic approach that acknowledges the economic and infrastructural barriers. While the IRA and subsequent statutes represent a commitment to EV transition, achieving equitable access depends on continued legislative and community efforts. This means not just more incentives, but effective ones that are accessible and wide-reaching. Only then can the ongoing EV revolution be truly transformative, with benefits that reach everyone.

No. 119-21, 139 Stat. 1 (2025). Consequently, the OBBBA ensures that EV ownership remains primarily limited to high-income consumers, directly contradicting the distributional equity goals of the IRA.

At the heart of this new generation is a state-of-the-art architecture that not only fundamentally influences vehicle design, but is also intended to take the electric powertrain to a new level.

BMW boosts EV intelligence with new super brains

A central element of this new e-platform is the high-voltage battery. It is equipped with a highly intelligent control unit called the Energy Master, which manages all essential functions in the area of high- and low-voltage power supply as well as data communication relating to the electric drive. At the same time, BMW is introducing a high-performance computing module that, together with other super brains, is designed to deliver the typical BMW driving experience. With the New Class, BMW is switching to a highly networked and software-centric vehicle architecture that redefines the character of driving.

These four completely new super brains will be at work in the BMW of the future: high-performance computers that intelligently bundle what previously ran separately. The Heart of Joy super brain was developed entirely in-house. Three other super brains are responsible for automated and highly automated driving, infotainment, and basic functions such as climate and comfort, vehicle access, and interior and exterior lighting.

“The Heart of Joy takes driving pleasure to the next level. We are also achieving a further efficiency boost and thus greater range, as the driver will in future brake almost exclusively via recuperation,” comments Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management responsible for Development. And incidentally, the superbrains not only make the New Class future-proof because such an architecture is easier to update and upgrade than many individual control units. BMW also retains control over all key functions because, for the first time, the hardware and software were developed exclusively and independently in Munich.

Neue Klasse centralises power control with the in-house Energy Master

In previous electric vehicles, the power electronics were often distributed, for example in separate components or in modules within the battery. In the New Class, however, a central part of the electric drive's super brains is moving to the penthouse – i.e., the top of the battery pack.

The control center for all power flows in the vehicle is located on the roof of the high-voltage battery system. BMW refers to this unit as the Energy Master, which is developed and produced entirely in-house. It is the interface to the on-board power supply, monitors the battery, and controls the electric motor(s) as well as communication between the high-voltage and low-voltage systems. This proximity to all relevant components allows the vehicle's energy management to be handled particularly effectively.

Cell-to-pack design cuts weight and boosts BMW’s driving dynamics

The decision to dispense with classic battery module production and to insert the new round cells directly – BMW refers to this as cell-to-pack – also saves space, weight, and costs. The fact that the battery is structurally integrated into the vehicle floor (pack-to-open body) enables a flatter design. All of this contributes to a lower centre of gravity and thus to greater driving dynamics, a classic BMW characteristic that is to be retained in the fully electric era.

800-volt design delivers sharper response and faster charging

The combination of high system voltage, short response times, and highly integrated control logic results in immediate, direct drive behavior. The New Class is designed to feel more lively, especially during intermediate sprints or spontaneous evasive maneuvers in critical situations, because control interventions – for example, in the event of traction loss – take place in real time.

In addition, the 800-volt architecture allows for remarkable ranges to be recharged in very short periods of time. Short charging breaks and continuously available power ensure a completely new ease of travel.

The sound is also different: instead of a classic engine sound, there is a subtle hum that BMW can tune for different models. This creates a new, futuristic sound that, according to the manufacturer, is more emotionally appealing than simple silence.

In-house battery and Energy Master development strengthens BMW’s EV control

By deciding to keep the development and production of the high-voltage battery and the Energy Master in-house, BMW ensures maximum control over quality, technology, and costs. The BMW plant in Landshut plays a central role in this, producing the highly complex control unit in a highly automated process. Production is being continuously expanded – by 2026, up to 700 employees are expected to be working in the Energy Master production area.

Inside BMW’s smart logistics strategy at Debrecen

BMW is redefining automotive logistics with direct delivery systems, real-time tracking, digital twins, and autonomous transport at its Debrecen plant. The OEM’s tech-driven approach integrates production, quality, and sustainability – setting a new standard for next-gen vehicle manufacturing.

The New Class focuses on a holistic electric concept in which highly integrated battery cells, central control units (Penthouse), and powerful computers (Heart of Joy) provide a completely new driving experience. The Power of Joy results from the sum of technological innovations and is reflected in increased dynamics, comfort, and range.

The key feature here is the close integration of the electric motor, battery, energy distribution, and vehicle architecture. The fact that the key systems—from the Energy Master to the motor and battery control systems—were largely developed in-house gives BMW a high degree of freedom and flexibility. This means that the driving experience can be continuously enhanced via software updates, which is just as new as the combination of driving dynamics and state-of-the-art electric drive technology.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/2574605.jpg?imageId=2574605&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-12-08 13:03:47.465748

“For me, that is a helpful frame to consider the scope of the challenge, where we have focused our energies, and where we still need to go.” Following is a summary of Director Roos’ comments on the PFAS life cycle: Upstream There’s no naturally occurring level of PFAS, it’s a man-made chemical.
Some states have been active on PFAS product bans, but Michigan has not made this move yet.
For example, when PFAS contamination is discovered over drinking water criteria, MPART coordinates between EGLE, local health and state health officials to test and notify nearby drinking water well users.","Phil Roos, director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, kicked off the plenary session of the Great Lakes PFAS Summit held virtually last week, focusing on the entire PFAS life cycle. Over 2,250 participants registered for the event, representing 50 states, two U.S. territories, and 11 countries.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – also known as “forever chemicals” – continue to present some of the biggest challenges in chemical contamination across the world. States throughout the nation, including the Great Lakes region, are finding PFAS contamination in a growing number of locations where these persistent chemicals pose a threat to human health and the environment.

“When I think about PFAS, I tend to think through the whole PFAS life cycle – from upstream, to preventing the spread, detection, remediation, and ultimately destruction,” Roos said. “For me, that is a helpful frame to consider the scope of the challenge, where we have focused our energies, and where we still need to go.”

Following is a summary of Director Roos’ comments on the PFAS life cycle:

Upstream

There’s no naturally occurring level of PFAS, it’s a man-made chemical. And it’s still being produced and used in lots of products. Some states have been active on PFAS product bans, but Michigan has not made this move yet.

Prevention

The next step is PFAS prevention. Once PFAS is out in the world, we have the challenge of preventing it from spreading, and specifically keeping it out of our lakes, streams, and groundwater

EGLE’s Water Resources Division has been working with wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), through the Michigan Industrial Pretreatment Program, to drive decreases in PFAS discharges:

Since implementation, 20 municipal WWTPs have adopted PFAS restrictions on the industrial users discharging into their municipal systems, and 86 industrial facilities have installed pretreatment or other source control measures.

This has resulted in a 59% reduction of PFOS discharges to surface waters for participating WWTP since 2018.

Michigan’s Biosolids Interim Strategy also continues to show successes and is serving as a model for other states. This program requires WWTP to test all biosolids for PFAS and places limits on what material can be land applied. That gives WWTP a huge incentive to control PFAS at the source.[RP1]

This year, we had to tackle a big challenge related to dredging. Michigan has more than 80 active harbors, many of them managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Seventeen of those harbors are impacted by PFAS, and we are worried about spreading PFAS from the sediment that is dredged out of those harbors. We were able to work with USACE to develop a clear set of guidelines for testing and placement of sediment that allowed our harbors to stay open while preventing the spread of PFAS from dredging activities.

Detection and Remediation

This is one of the areas where MPART has placed a lot of its focus. MPART just released their annual Fast Facts, a report showing what they accomplished in 2025.

In Fiscal Year 2025, MPART added another 32 MPART sites and eight “Areas of Interest,” for a total of 40 investigations that revealed areas where groundwater is contaminated by PFAS.

The team maintained and grew their PFAS monitoring activities, including collecting 702 water samples, 1,860 fish samples from 64 waterways, and instituting monitoring at 124 wastewater treatment plants.

The state has had success in completing enforcement and litigation actions. Michigan’s Attorney General settled three big cases.

MPART has also highlighted the importance of coordination and collaboration within state government. For example, when PFAS contamination is discovered over drinking water criteria, MPART coordinates between EGLE, local health and state health officials to test and notify nearby drinking water well users.

We’re also learning from other states. Maine hosted several staff from Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and Michigan State University staff for three full days, where they toured farms and shared information about their farmer assistance program, which helps farmers impacted by PFAS contamination.

Destruction

Finally, there’s PFAS destruction. We ultimately need to stop moving PFAS around and find economically viable ways to destroy it.

Our partners at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were leading the research on this topic, and unfortunately the cuts to the EPA Office of Research and Development are really going to hurt our ability to make progress on emerging contaminants.

There is still good research happening at states, at universities, and new technologies being piloted in the private sector that will advance our capabilities to address PFAS at every step of its life cycle — whether that’s replacing it in products, improving filtration and detection, better understanding things like crop uptake, and working on permanently eliminating “forever chemicals” from our lives.",https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Images/EGLE-Logos/Social.jpg?rev=fa9af8ebc6cc48f4ab7777c144d928b5&hash=AD089C78988ABC2E4DD23E2D36B9B8E6,N,,2025-12-08 12:02:43.515381

Senate Bill 54, introduced by Senator Liz Brown, would prevent cities, towns, and counties from creating new solar overlay districts after December 31, 2025, unless every underlying zoning district already permits commercial solar development. The measure would apply to all future projects and would require rezonings for any district that lacks explicit solar authorization.

Overlay districts have been a central tool for counties managing the growth of utility-scale solar. They allow officials to set standards—such as setbacks, vegetative buffers, road use requirements, and decommissioning rules—without overhauling long-standing zoning classifications. In many rural counties, agricultural zoning is the default land use, and overlays have helped bridge the gap between traditional land-use maps and modern energy infrastructure needs.

SB 54 would eliminate that flexibility. Any county hoping to use an overlay in the future would need to address zoning first, bringing solar-related decisions into a more formal—and often more contentious—rezoning process. Rezoning requires public hearings before plan commissions and local legislative bodies, which typically draws greater attention and offers opponents more opportunities to slow or block a project.

The potential impact on Indiana’s solar development pipeline is considerable. Many counties have not updated their zoning codes in years, and several lack clear definitions for commercial solar use. Under SB 54, those gaps become barriers. Developers may face longer timelines, while local agencies will need to reconcile outdated maps with growing interest in renewable energy.

The bill does not prohibit commercial solar, but it shifts critical decision-making upstream, turning land classification—not overlay standards—into the deciding factor for project viability. For Indiana, where energy markets are expanding and counties vary widely in their approach to renewable siting, SB 54 represents a notable recalibration of local authority and a more structured framework for governing where utility-scale solar can be built.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251208-070744-79c-Panoramic%20view%20of%20rural%20solar%20panels%20and%20agricultural%20fields%20under%20blue%20sky..jpg,N,,2025-12-08 11:04:07.881069

25%: Car Sales Sink As Americans Target ‘Affordability’

2026 Ford Mustang Mach-E California Special

This spike in car prices is nothing new, unfortunately. They've been on the rise for years but significantly increased during and after the pandemic. But for the past two years or so, EVs represented a bright spot in the affordability landscape. Aggressive lease deals, the $7,500 tax credit and other incentives often made going electric the cheapest and best way to get a decent new car.

When all of that went away, I wondered if they’d take the entire new-car market down with them. And November sales data show this to be happening, according to Automotive News:

Light-vehicle deliveries fell 6.3% in November from the same month last year, when there was one additional selling day, GlobalData said in a preliminary report. On a selling day-adjusted basis, sales dropped 2.6 percent.

Sales of most EVs declined significantly, continuing a recent trend. While the overall market fell for the second consecutive month, some brands such as Toyota and Kia posted modest gains driven by strong demand for hybrids and lower-priced models.

“People are looking for affordability right now,” Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, told Automotive News. “We know there’s higher prices, interest rates are still high from a historical perspective, and that is kind of coming to roost at this point in the year where people are more deal-oriented.

It is certainly and unfortunately true that without the tax credits, the biggest sales declines are in the EV segment. But it’s key to know that it’s not just EVs that are sliding: people everywhere are saying no to high prices, especially with big trucks and SUVs. How else do you explain this, from Ford?

Overall, the automaker’s utility vehicle sales slid 4.9 percent while truck sales were flat. Sales of entry-level trims on the Maverick, Ranger, Bronco Sport and Explorer all surged by double digits.

Sales slid 15 percent at Honda Motor Co., with volume down 17 percent at the Honda division and 1.4 percent at Acura.

The company blamed global semiconductor shortages, mostly at Nexperia, which have reduced output and inventories. The company said it ended November with 145,634 Honda-branded models in stock, down from 169,063 at the end of October and 173,704 a year earlier.

Not everyone who scored a sub-$200 monthly lease on a Honda Prologue was passionate about Honda’s road to electrification (with General Motors’ help, of course). Many of them just wanted a great deal. And those deals helped to prove to those buyers—who may not have considered this otherwise—that it is possible to break up with gasoline.

Now, the American car market is without EV incentives, and it also faces record-high prices and broader economic uncertainty. On the plus side, the holiday deals are here, but what happens after that?

50%: Hyundai’s Advanced Vehicle Chief Resigns, Laments Slow Growth In Autonomous Tech

2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT

The EVs from the Hyundai Motor Group like the Ioniq 5, Kia EV9 and so on tend to be some of my go-to recommendations for anyone looking to go electric. The Korean automaker's offerings generally have excellent range, class-leading fast charging and tons of style.

But as advanced as they are, Hyundai’s cars tend to lag behind rivals in advanced software—and especially in autonomous driving technologies. An Ioniq 5 is a great car, but forget hands-free highway driving as you’d get from GM’s Super Cruise.

Now, Song Chang-hyeon, head of Hyundai Motor Group's Advanced Vehicle Platform division and chief of the group's software research arm 42dot, is apparently falling on his sword and leaving the company. Here’s more from Korea’s Yonhap News Agency:

Song appears to be taking responsibility for the group's limited progress in autonomous driving technologies, as Hyundai Motor Group has been viewed as falling short of expectations compared with rivals despite significant investment in the AVP division.

""We have been preparing for the future automobile market, where only software-defined vehicles (SDVs) and autonomous driving technologies will remain after global automakers have spent tens of trillions of won only to fall short,"" Song said in the message.

Hyundai Motor Group appears to be lagging behind rivals, including Tesla Inc., which has been strengthening its presence in South Korea by adopting its supervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. Other global carmakers, such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW, have already incorporated Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities into their production models.

At the very least, Hyundai continues to partner with several autonomous taxi firms in the U.S. and beyond, including Waymo, Motional and Avride. And the Korean automaker seems to have some slick next-generation software due out next year.

For now, the company is definitely playing catch-up on driverless technology—not just with Tesla but also GM, Ford, Rivian and any number of Chinese players.

75%: Can GM’s Sterling Anderson Deliver A Long-Promised Tech Revolution?

GM Escalade IQ Lidar

Over the years, GM has poached several big names from Silicon Valley tech companies and startups like Tesla as it seeks to position itself as a leader in autonomy, batteries, software and innovation. But it’s not always great at keeping those folks around. At least two executives I chatted with at the GM Forward tech event in New York City in October have since moved on from the company.

But GM says that its secret weapon is Sterling Anderson, the roboticist, former Tesla executive and co-founder of the autonomous trucking firm Aurora Innovation. Anderson is now GM’s Chief Product Officer, and as CNBC puts it, “he oversees the company’s vast product portfolio—from the vehicles themselves to the software powering them.” And at least some recent tech departures at GM seem tied to his reorganization efforts. From CNBC:

He has consolidated power to oversee “the end-to-end product lifecycle” of GM vehicles, including manufacturing engineering, battery, software and services product management, and engineering teams, according to GM.

“My priority is to accelerate the pace of innovation. One of the ways we do that is with this disaggregation of, or this abstraction of, software from hardware,” he told CNBC during an Oct. 22 technology event in New York. “That’s the point of the role, I think, is it brings together all of these pieces into a unified approach to how we do product going forward.”

Since then, the company’s acclaimed heads of software and artificial intelligence have unexpectedly exited the company after relatively short tenures. Their main responsibilities related to vehicles now fall under Anderson.

GM attributed the abrupt departures of Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, and Barak Turovsky, head of AI, to restructuring efforts.

Another software executive, Baris Cetinok, reportedly left to pursue another opportunity. But as CNBC points out, several other high-profile poaches from Apple and Google and others haven’t lasted long at GM—often for the same reasons that most “legacy” automakers struggle to become nimble, software- and tech-focused operations:

″[Traditional U.S. automakers] have very much had a significant struggle with understanding software and electronics technology, and that has caused them to have a parade of experts quote ‘coming in to help,’” said Peter Abowd, an engineer turned automotive and technology consultant.

“It’s just kind of setting the person up for a bit of failure,” Abowd said. “In a couple years, you can’t culturally shift an organization ... so the best thing to do is to part ways.”

Anderson is an incredibly smart guy, but he’s got his work cut out for him. I do think GM's made big strides in recent years on both autonomy and software efforts (if you can live without Apple CarPlay, of course). But creating a true software ecosystem that can power a connected, increasingly automated future for its giant fleet is a very tall order.

100%: What's The Most You'd Pay For A New Car?

Nissan Leaf Chevy Equinox EV Edmunds

This is a personal question that's unique to everyone. But I feel like for most Americans, the fact that the ""average"" new car is now about $50,000 doesn't make that pill go down more easily. What's the most you would ever pay at the new-car lot? I've always bought used (or leased, with my Kia EV6) and if car prices keep going the way they are, my current fleet is going to stick around for a while.

The copper supply chain is under strain, tight from mining to concentrate production.
But until there is any clarity on the tariff front, the tariff risk will keep ex-US supply tight and global prices elevated.
Major copper smelters in China recently pledged to jointly cut intake of copper concentrate as falling processing fees squeezed margins.
In addition, although similar pledges were made last year, they didn’t result in significant reductions in refined copper output.","Copper supply has seen a wave of disruptions this year, tightening the 2025 and 2026 balance, most recently Freeport’s declaration of force majeure at its giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia. Grasberg is the world’s second-largest copper mine, contributing around 4% of global production. Two minor mining areas recovered production as planned in November, while the main area, which is responsible for 70% of output, is expected to slowly resume operations next year. A full recovery is expected in 2027.

The disruption at Grasberg has added to the already high number of supply disruptions this year, including the flooding of the Kamoa-Kakula mine in the DRC in May and an accident hitting the El Teniente mine in Chile in July.

Chile, the world’s largest copper producer, continues to struggle with falling ore grades and operational setbacks. Meanwhile, Ivanhoe Mines trimmed the outlook for production from its Kamoa-Kakula mine as it continues to recover from the flooding earlier this year.

The copper supply chain is under strain, tight from mining to concentrate production. Meanwhile, the refined metal flows are being disrupted by tariff risks and unusually high US stockpiles.

Our refined copper balance for 2026 is now showing a deficit of around 600kt for 2026, following a deficit of around 200kt in 2025.

The recent update by the US Geological Survey to its list of critical minerals, which has added 10, including copper, lead, metallurgical coal, and silver, is a strategic move to strengthen US mineral supply chains and national security. This development, which expanded the list to 60 minerals, may reinforce speculation about a potential increase in US import tariffs in 2027. If implemented, tariffs could widen the price difference between COMEX and LME markets, mirroring trends seen in July 2025.

But if Trump decides against tariffs on refined copper once again, significant volumes of US copper stockpiles could flow back to the global market. This would lead to a collapse of the COMEX premium, pushing US prices lower, and moving the global refined balance into a surplus.

But until there is any clarity on the tariff front, the tariff risk will keep ex-US supply tight and global prices elevated.

China’s copper smelters posted a succession of record production figures this year despite a tightening feedstock market and despite the government’s campaign against industrial overcapacity and excessive competition. The copper industry has been granted more leniency due to its strategic role in high-tech and clean energy manufacturing. Chinese smelters’ advantage also comes from higher prices of sulfuric acid, a byproduct of copper smelting, as well as ownership stakes in mines.

Meanwhile, smelters abroad are struggling to keep their operations running amid rising cost pressures and aggressive Chinese competition. Earlier this year, Glencore received a government bailout to keep its Mount Isa smelter and refinery in Australia running for another three years.

TC/RCs are likely to remain under pressure next year as concentrate supply growth lags expanding smelter capacity. Unless new mine projects ramp up quicker than expected, smelters will continue to face margin compression and may curtail output.

Major copper smelters in China recently pledged to jointly cut intake of copper concentrate as falling processing fees squeezed margins. The China Copper Smelters Purchasing Team (CSPT), a group of 13 major smelters, said it will cut concentrate processing rates by more than 10% next year. Still, while CSPT’s proposed 10% smelter cut reflects tight concentrate availability, it does not necessarily imply a meaningful change in the global refined copper balance, with the concentrate that China does not process simply reallocated to other smelters globally.

In addition, although similar pledges were made last year, they didn’t result in significant reductions in refined copper output. This year, China has produced almost 10% more refined copper through October.

In the near term, supply disruptions should keep a floor under prices around the $11,000/t level. However, for the rally to extend, stronger demand – particularly from China, the largest consumer – will be crucial. For now, prices will remain rangebound.

We see prices peaking in Q2 at $12,000/t as copper stockpiles keep building in the US, tightening ex-US markets before losing a bit of momentum in H2 as tariff policy should become clearer. The downside risk here is the reversal of these flows if the refined metal is exempt from tariffs once again.

We see prices averaging $11,500/t in 2026.

Upside risks include potential cuts to Chinese domestic output, additional supply disruptions and stronger investment momentum in energy transition sectors and AI.

On the downside, risks include further weakening in demand, a potential US tariff change that could push inventory onto global markets, and wider macro headwinds.

The long-term bullish narrative remains intact for copper, supported by structural demand from the grid, electrification and renewable infrastructure and, increasingly, from data centres and AI infrastructure.",https://think.ing.com/uploads/hero/_w800h450/shutterstock_editorial_15335370b.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 13:02:58.658662

The most consequential rulemaking of the week was the DOT proposed rule on “The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule III for Model Years [MY] 2022 to 2031 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks.” This proposal represents the Trump Administration’s latest salvo regarding the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, markedly reducing the rate at which MY-over-MY fuel efficiency targets increase. DOT estimates that this would yield total cost reductions of $219.5 billion dollars through 2050 (or $18.3 billion on an annualized basis). Much as with the Biden-era set of CAFE standards it seeks to replace, it represents a substantial rulemaking that is nevertheless dwarfed by associated Environmental Protection Agency vehicle standards.

As noted in this current rulemaking, this shift in the overall standards for affected MYs comes on the heels of the provision in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) legislation that zeroed out the civil penalties levied against manufacturers that are out of compliance with relevant CAFE standards. This provision would seem to essentially neuter the effective enforcement of any level of standards, thereby throwing the projected manufacturer decisions – and the resulting economic effects – into doubt. Yet in its analysis DOT expects that, based upon previous manufacturer statements, affected entities will continue to follow the relevant standards to remain in legal compliance.

The other major rulemaking of the week was the HHS interim final rule on “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Repeal of Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities.” As the title plainly suggests, the rulemaking would repeal the standards set by the Biden Administration in May 2024. HHS is implementing the rule directly as an interim final rule under the auspices of (another) OBBBA provision that restricts the agency from “implementing, administering, or enforcing the minimum staffing standards…until after September 30, 2034.” The agency estimates that this will result in $55.1 billion in total cost savings for affected facilities over a 10-year window. As HHS itself notes, this savings total exceeds the net-cost total of the original Biden-era rule by a sizable margin. This divergence is due to:

A shift in the analytical window, with the Biden rule examining a 2024–2033 window vs. this current window that assumes an additional $6.6 billion in projected economic impacts in 2034; and

Adjusting “all estimates to 2024 dollars” whereas the Biden rule used 2021 dollars in its calculations.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

The main non-rulemaking regulatory policy news of the week was the Senate passing another CRA resolution of disapproval. The upper chamber passed H.J. Res 131 by a 49-45 vote this past Thursday. The resolution would repeal another Biden-era Department of Interior oil and gas leasing determination. It now joins the recently passed H.J. Res 130 at the White House for President Trump’s expected signature.

The AAF CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 69 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

TOTAL BURDENS

Since January 1, the federal government has published $976.1 billion in total regulatory net cost savings (with $128.5 billion in cost savings from finalized rules) and 75.1 million hours of net annual paperwork cuts (with 50.9 million hours coming from final rules).",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/regrodeo-12-5-25.png,N,,2025-12-08 11:03:32.064813

What Happened

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated November 14, Manatuck Hill Partners, LLC acquired 2.5 million additional shares of Plug Power Inc. (PLUG). The estimated value increase of $5.84 million reflects both the new share purchases and changes in Plug Power’s market price during the third quarter. The fund now holds just over 2.5 million shares valued at $5.9 million at quarter-end.

What Else to Know

This buy brings the Plug Power stake to 1.9% of Manatuck's $302.3 million in reportable U.S. equity holdings as of September 30.

Top holdings after filing:

NYSE: ZETA: $14 million (4.6% of AUM)

NASDAQ: REAL: $13.6 million (4.6% of AUM)

NYSE: IMAX: $11.1 million (3.8% of AUM)

NASDAQ: OPRX: $9.7 million (3.3% of AUM)

NYSE: HLF: $8.4 million (2.9% of AUM)

As of Friday, Plug Power shares were priced at $2.20, up 10% over the past year and slightly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up 13% in the same period.

Company Overview

The company generates revenue through direct product sales, integrated hydrogen infrastructure, service programs, and strategic partnerships across the supply chain, logistics, stationary power, and mobility sectors.

It serves a diverse customer base in North America and internationally, targeting material handling, on-road electric vehicles, telecommunications, transportation, and utility markets.

Plug Power Inc. is a leading provider of hydrogen fuel cell solutions, focused on building a comprehensive green hydrogen ecosystem. The company leverages proprietary technology and strategic partnerships to address the growing demand for clean energy across multiple industries. Plug Power's integrated approach and robust infrastructure position it as a key player in the transition to zero-emissions power solutions.

Foolish Take

Manatuck's buoyed interest in Plug Power seemingly signals a willingness to underwrite a potential multiyear turnaround rather than treat recent volatility as a permanent state. Plug is still absolutely nowhere near historical highs, but its latest quarter showed operational progress that could influence future sentiment. Revenue climbed to $177 million, driven by electrolyzers and hydrogen fuel sales, and the company sharply improved operating cash burn, cutting usage by 49% year over year to about $90 million. Management also highlighted record hydrogen production uptime at the Georgia Green Hydrogen Plant and a $370 million capital raise — moves that extend liquidity as Plug works toward its EBITDAS-positive target in 2026.

Still, losses remain substantial, with a GAAP gross loss of roughly $120 million and a net loss of $363.5 million for the quarter. In that context, Plug’s modest position within Manatuck’s portfolio — far smaller than Zeta, The RealReal, or IMAX — suggests the fund views the stock as an asymmetric option rather than a core holding.

NEW YORK, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RK Equity today released a new policy white paper titled ""The USA Strategic Lithium Reserve: Stabilizing Price Volatility from China-Dominated Oversupply.” The report outlines a practical, rapidly deployable mechanism the United States can use to counter extreme lithium price volatility and reduce dependence on Chinese chemical conversion.

The paper argues that a U.S. Strategic Lithium Reserve (SLR)-modeled on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve-could provide the price stability needed for private capital to finance new lithium mining and conversion projects across the Western Hemisphere.

A Market-Based Alternative to Subsidies and Price Floors

Lithium prices have swung 10-15× in recent cycles-far beyond what most long-term capital can withstand. Much of this volatility stems from China’s dominance of lithium chemical conversion, where oversupply and subsidized lepidolite production exert sustained downward pressure on global prices. The result: U.S., Canadian, and allied projects struggle to reach Final Investment Decision (FID) even when resource quality and management execution are strong.

""A Strategic Lithium Reserve is the simplest, fairest, and fastest policy tool available,” said Howard Klein, Founder of RK Equity.

""It doesn’t pick technologies or subsidize risky projects. It neutralizes volatility so private capital can back the best projects.”

How the SLR Works

The SLR would operate as a rules-based reserve of lithium carbonate, purchasing material when prices fall below incentive levels-typically around $20,000-25,000 per tonne-and releasing it during extreme price spikes, supply disruptions, or export restrictions.

Establishing a 170,000-tonne reserve today would cost approximately $3.4-4.25 billion. A fully built-out 300,000-tonnereserve by 2030 would cost $6.0-7.5 billion. These sums are modest compared to existing U.S. industrial policy initiatives such as:

DOE Loan Programs Office: >$100B

Inflation Reduction Act clean energy incentives: >$400B

CHIPS Act: ~$50B

Immediate Strategic Impact

The white paper highlights that the Americas-particularly Chile and Argentina-are already the largest non-China producers of lithium carbonate. Redirecting a portion of these flows away from China and toward a U.S. reserve would provide immediate strategic supply security.

""Unlike permitting a new mine or building a U.S. refinery, which takes years, the SLR can begin stabilizing the market within months,” Klein added.

""It is the lithium-age analogue to the SPR.”

Complementary Industrial Strategy

In addition to the SLR, the paper recommends:

Continued use of the 45X Production Tax Credit, a broad-based, non-distortive incentive

Targeted LPO, EXIM Bank, or Department of the Navy’s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) support for nationally significant, long-lived strategic projects

Limited, performance-linked incentives for companies with demonstrated ability to build and operate large-scale conversion capacity

The white paper also presents a three-phase implementation roadmap, beginning with authorization and early purchases, followed by hemispheric project alignment, and culminating in a fully operational SLR capable of dampening market extremes across cycles.

In a letter sent to Congress today, more than 50 organizations from across New York State called for a full national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers. The letter cites massive and unsustainable consumption by data centers of energy and water resources, and skyrocking utility costs for families and small businesses. The letter was facilitated by the national environmental organization Food & Water Watch, and signed by national and statewide groups including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Americans for Financial Reform, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Citizen Action of NY, NY Communities for Change, and For the Many.

The letter states, in part:

“The rapid expansion of data centers across the United States, driven by the generative artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto booms, presents one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation. This expansion is rapidly increasing demand for energy, driving more fossil fuel pollution, straining water resources and raising electricity prices across the country… We urge you to join our call for a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities, our families, our environment and our health from the runaway damage this industry is already inflicting.”

“At a time when New Yorkers are struggling with soaring utility bills, data centers threaten to inflict even more costs on our communities,” said Eric Weltman, senior New York organizer at Food & Water Watch. “It’s prudent that we press the pause button on Big Data’s voracious and expanding appetite for energy and water before it’s too late to prevent massive harm.”

Already, energy demand from data centers in the U.S. is expected to increase up to threefold between 2023 and 2028. And recent analysis from Food & Water Watch found that by 2028, AI-supporting data centers could consume:

720 billion gallons of water annually simply to cool the facilities — equal to more than 1 million Olympic-size swimming pools, or enough water to meet the indoor needs of 18.5 million American households.

300 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy annually — enough electricity to power over 28 million American households.

“Communities across the country are being inundated with this unchecked expansion of data centers, leaving residents to bear the burden of skyrocketing utility rates, worsening water and air pollution, and serious public health concerns.” said Yvonne Taylor, Vice President of Seneca Lake Guardian. “When an AI data center comes to town, our communities are promised an economic boost. Instead they are steamrolled, with developers depleting natural resources and refusing to take accountability for the harm they inflict. For too long, our representatives have sat back and watched as we are taken advantage of. We need leaders who will step in to protect residents against this exploitation, and put public health and safety above corporate profit.”

“Data Centers have quickly emerged as a false solution, as these new massive industrial projects create very few permanent jobs, introduce new environmental justice concerns for nearby residents, jack up energy and water costs for communities, and create headaches for local governments,” said Bridge Rauch, Environmental Justice Organizer with Clean Air Coalition of Western New York. “We need a federal moratorium on new data centers to give state and local governments a chance to work with their constituents to develop regulations that work for their communities.”

Meanwhile, this summer the Trump administration released an “AI Action Plan,” which outlines its priorities related to the advancement of so-called “artificial intelligence” and the industries supporting it – including massive energy- and water-intensive data centers. Among other things, Trump’s plan seeks to dismantle existing environmental and land use rules that it views as a hindrance to the unfettered growth of these industries.

In October, Food & Water Watch initially called for a full moratorium on data center approval and construction, likely becoming the first national organization to do so.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FWA_RGB_FWW_Stacked-Logo_FC.png,N,,2025-12-08 11:03:01.117375

They are data centers for local customers willing to pay for low latency. Data centers cluster in Santa Clara because that city’s power has been the cheapest in Silicon Valley. The San Jose Mercury News recently reported that two data centers in Santa Clara are empty, waiting for a $450 million upgrade to be completed in 2028 — three years out. Power is a limiting constraint for data centers across the USA.

Figure 1: One of dozens of data centers in Santa Clara, California (Silicon Valley)

Morgan Stanley recently projected a US power shortfall through 2028, totaling 45 gigawatts (20% of total data center demand), some of which can be handled by on-site power generation. It will get worse. OpenAI alone is projecting 250 GW just for its data centers by 2033.

The good news is that semiconductor innovations exist that can probably close the gap.

GenAI demand continues to grow exponentially

GenAI demand growth to date has been stunning. And projections are for further fast growth.

OpenAI’s ARR (annual run rate) has soared from $1 billion in 2023, to $5 billion in 2024, and now is expected to be $20 billion+ by the end of this year. OpenAI’s projections are bullish enough to enter into $1.4 trillion of capacity contracts over the coming 7 years.

Anthropic is keeping pace with $1 billion last year and expecting to end this year with $9 billion. Anthropic recently projected $70 billion in revenue in 2028 with positive cash flow!

Google TPU and AWS Trainium volumes have moved into millions of units.

Nvidia is asking TSMC to ramp production to satisfy rapidly growing Blackwell demand.

The major hyperscalers continue to ramp up their CapEx plans and report huge increases in tokens processed year-over-year.

Meanwhile, adoption of GenAI is still low with <10% of companies and probably <10% of people at those companies using AI really well. That means the upside for GenAI usage is huge as others catch up (or the leaders take the market share of the laggards).

The US power grid can’t keep up

The US power grid hasn’t grown much for years. Demand increases were offset by efficiencies. But now data centers are starting to significantly increase the demand on the US power grid.

In the US, the lead time for major transmission lines or natural gas pipelines is over a decade. New power generation plants take 5+ years to approve, longer for nuclear. Solar is now the cheapest form of power, but most panels are made in China and are now subject to very large tariffs. And the places with lots of space in the USA have limited transmission capacity. (Contrast this to China with the world’s largest solar and wind installations in northwest China carried by >40 new ultra-high-voltage transmission lines to the populous East).

Data centers now are being built where grid power is available.

The next step is for data centers to generate their own power on-site or near-site. The demand for gas turbines has capacity booked through 2030. Once-unloved fuel cells are now in huge demand. Airplane engines are being converted to power generation. At some point, data centers may be built in locations where very large solar and wind fields can be sited, if water is available, or at natural gas fields that have capacity in excess of the pipelines they feed.

The challenge in acquiring power will cause data centers to shift to more power-efficient chips (even when power is available, electricity costs are a major factor that is good to reduce).

Chips that can get more GenAI throughput from scarce watts

There are several ways semiconductors can help new data centers get more throughput per watt: power electronics, more memory with less latency, larger pod sizes, more efficient accelerators.

SiC/GaN FETs increase power converter efficiency & reduce cooling requirements

Power supply units (PSUs) in the data center take in AC power and convert it to DC power for the chips. Traditional PSUs are 90% to 95% efficient (5% to 10% of the AC power is lost to heat in conversion, which is a double whammy as more power-hungry cooling is required).

SiC (Silicon Carbide) MOSFETs and GaN (Gallium Nitride) FETs from Wolfspeed, STM, Infineon, On Semi, Navitas, and TI can boost PSU efficiency to 98% or more.

A data center with SiC/GaN PSUs can cut AC power requirements by ~5% to 10%.

800V HVDC replacing existing 48-54V

TI, ADI, Infineon, Renesas, and others are enabling 800V HVDC (high-voltage DC) architectures for next-gen data centers.

Until now, data centers have distributed DC power at 48 to 54V. Power loss in transmission is proportional to the square of the current (Ploss = I2R). Increasing the voltage from 48/54V to 800V reduces the current required by about 6%. 800V HVDC reduces power requirements by ~5%. It also means cables are thinner and lighter for the same amount of power, cutting copper use by half. (Initial NVL72 racks shipped with 54V, but are designed to shift to 800V.)

CXL-attached Memory

In GPU pods now, aggregate HBM is often not enough to handle growing KV-Caches (cache memory to store earlier computations to avoid re-computation) and growing context windows (that enable the model to remember past interactions, key data, etc.).

Astera Labs recently announced that Microsoft is the first to deploy its CXL Smart Memory Controllers into Microsoft’s Azure M-Series VMs. This provides up to an additional 2TB of DDR5 memory capacity with relatively low latency. (An NVL72 GB200 rack has 13.5TB of HBM3e memory).

Figure 2: Astera Labs Leo A1000 CXL Smart Memory Add-in Card

Astera claims this boosts throughput by 40% for LLMs (not clear if this is for 1 card or multiple). Since GPUs spend a lot of time idle, increasing throughput means increased utilization of the GPUs. Getting the results 40% faster roughly means using 40% less power for the same throughput. The additional DDR5 DRAM burns incremental power, but that’s relatively small compared to the NVL72 Blackwells. And the CXL-connected DRAM means that the higher latency DRAM can be reduced in size.

Nvidia recently bought Enfabrica for $900 million for its Accelerated Compute Fabric, which creates a high-speed network to connect GPUs with large pools of DDR expansion memory.

Optimized AI Accelerators

GPUs can run any kind of model and do training as well as inference.

LLMs today are primarily transformer models, and the growing majority of demand is for inference. AI accelerators that are optimized for what the main market needs can be more efficient for those applications. For example, Anthropic, in a recent press release, stated that Google’s TPUs are typically more power-efficient than Nvidia’s GPUs.

Figure 3: Google Ironwood Rack with Optical Inter-rack connection (Source: Hot Chips 2025)

Larger pods using SoW-X (system-on-wafer, 2nd generation)

Nvidia and others have been increasing GenAI throughput/watt with more powerful AI Accelerators, more per package, and scale-up networks connecting more AI accelerators. Nvidia introduced NVL72 this year, and its roadmap grows pods to NVL144, then NVL576. GPUs are going from 1 to 2 to 4 per package. All this uses copper, which is constrained to 1 to 2 meters within a single rack.

As long as copper is the backbone of the scale-up network, a logical next step is to use an entire wafer as an interposer to squeeze more GPUs into a single rack. TSMC in 2020 introduced the first solution called InFO-SoW, which was used by Tesla’s Dojo. More recently, it introduced SoW-X, which adds HBM integration. At the IEEE ECTC (Electronic Components and Technology Conference), TSMC presented a paper on SoW-X describing integration of 16 full-reticle-sized ASICs, 80 HBM4, and 2,800 224Gb/s long-range SerDes, providing massive bandwidth. Clustering more GPUs closer together boosts performance. TSMC estimates SoW-X delivers almost 2X better power efficiency (AI throughput per watt). The number of GPUs per compute tray will double or quadruple (depending on packaging and power density constraints). The GPU 2X efficiency increase is amplified by a 2 to 4X larger pod, which will deliver very roughly a 4 to 8X improvement in throughput/watt. (The rack power is way up, but throughput is up a lot more.)

Figure 4: Nvidia CEO holding what looks like a System on Wafer (GTC March 2025)

There is another TSMC technology, CoWoP (Chip on Wafer on Platform), which removes the package substrate and connects the interposer directly onto the motherboard. Digitimes reports that Nvidia is considering CoWoP. Reducing a layer in the interconnect stack will improve signaling performance at lower power and improve power management.

CPO (co-packaged optics) for scale-out networks

CPO cuts power substantially in scale-out networks. It uses 1/3 the power of pluggable optics and is cheaper and smaller. Roughly 5% to 10% of data center power today is used by pluggable optics. CPO for scale-out networks can reduce this by two-thirds. Broadcom and Nvidia have already introduced CPO switches in parallel with copper versions.

Larger pods using CPO (co-packaged optics)

CPO improves throughput/watt versus copper by enabling pod-size to span multiple racks – whatever copper can do, CPO can enable 4 to 10X increases in pod size, which dramatically reduces the power for a given level of GenAI throughput.

CPO is not an alternative to SoW-X. Both can be used together. If a 2-XPU package can have 256+ optical links, an SoW-X with 16 XPUs could have 1,024 to 2,048 optical links, enabling potentially much larger, much more power-efficient pod sizes.

SoW-X isn’t limited to compute. Imagine a SoW-X switch with 2,048 optical links connecting to 2,048 SoW-X accelerators, each with 16 XPU dies. This creates a 32,000 GPU pod with single hop latency. This would provide much higher throughput/watt for the largest models.

Replace older AI racks

All of the above lead to much greater power efficiency than was available in the past. If power is otherwise unavailable, Hyperscalers will be incentivized to replace older Nvidia GPUs with the latest to get a doubling or quadrupling of throughput per watt. This will be economically feasible if the demand is there.

Software can help too: small language models (SLMs)

The leading-edge models have giant compute requirements and a huge database of knowhow. But if you have a focused application, you don’t need the ability to speak Chinese, quote every line of Shakespeare, or list the Kings of England since 1066. A small language model (SLM) is trained on a focused database optimized for a specific task. It will therefore have one or two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and corresponding lower compute cost and power, but can answer the questions needed about the focused database.

Nature Magazine recently reported on Tiny Recursive Models that outperformed the best LLMs on visual logic puzzles like sudoku and mazes using 1/1,000th the compute.

Emerald.AI’s Conductor Platform is software that works with the data center and the power grids. It appears to give the power grid the ability to, among other things, pause/slow down batch processes to temporarily reduce grid demand. This gives the power provider a lot more flexibility that Emerald AI says will enable the power provider to provide grid access in months, not years. They are working with Nvidia and Digital Realty on the first power-flexible AI factory in Virginia.

Power-efficient AI chips will maximize the US grid & save $

There are numerous options for significant improvements in GenAI power efficiency with ICs.

Even in places where power is plentiful (China, Saudi Arabia), electricity is still a significant cost factor in data center operations.

Power constraints in the USA will spur development of more power-efficient AI chips that should enable the demand for rapidly growing GenAI capacity to be met and save money on electricity. This is also important to reduce the political backlash that will come with rising residential electricity rates.",https://semiengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tate1.jpg?fit=1430%2C840&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 12:01:57.286106

First, we look at the evolution of fermentation in ethanol production, specifically how glucoamylase-expressing yeast changed the game. When Lallemand Biofuels & Distilled Spirits introduced the first such product onto the market in 2012, it was a tough sell. As an LBDS spokesperson told us, “Ethanol producers like to be first to be second.” The assessment is quite accurate, in our experience. Today, GA-expressing yeast are a regular and even prominent offering in fermentation product portfolios. Our feature on the evolution and its impacts on yield maximation starts on page 16.

Our second feature this month, starting on page 22, explores the approval of E15 in California, as the California Air Resources Board continues its research into the fuel’s sustainability. It was the last holdout allowing E10, but not E15. It’s an important step for the industry and will help drivers in the state save some money at the pump, as fuel prices continue to rise. The accomplishment is a result of work from trade groups and industry, as well as retailers. A combined effort and significant win.

But as the ethanol industry has focused on E15, what happened to the push for flex-fuel vehicles? While they’ve continued to roll off the assembly line for consumers in other parts of the world, their production stalled in the U.S., swapped for electric vehicles to satisfy Biden-era mandates. But 2025 saw a resurgence, bringing six FFV models onto the market. The ethanol industry has not abandoned the battle to ensure FFVs are a standard option, and the fight continues.

But it will bring the plant’s CI score down a couple points, and comes with cost savings and tax credits. Take a look, on page 36.

Yeast evolution, a policy win, the FFV push and solar power. It’s all here. Enjoy the read.

North Carolina’s rapid population growth is reshaping the state, creating new opportunities but also straining housing, transportation, schools, and healthcare — challenges that will define the next several decades.

Growth is uneven, with metro areas booming while many rural counties face population loss, declining services, and widening disparities that threaten statewide cohesion and competitiveness.

Meeting the moment requires a coordinated statewide strategy, including major investments in housing, transit, schools, and healthcare, paired with intentional support for rural communities to ensure North Carolina’s future prosperity is shared by all.

Today, Carolina Forward is releasing our latest policy report: North Carolina’s Next Chapter: Harnessing Growth and Shared Prosperity. Our state is entering a defining new era – one that demands clarity, resolve, and long-term thinking.

Policy

North Carolina’s Next Chapter

A strategy for North Carolina’s future

North Carolina is growing at a remarkable pace. The state recently surpassed 11 million residents and added more than 165,000 people in a single year, one of the largest increases in the nation. Demographers project that North Carolina will become the 7th most populous state by the early 2030s, adding between 1 and 3 million residents over the next two decades.

This rapid growth underscores what so many already know: North Carolina is an exceptional place to live, work, and raise a family. But growth also brings real challenges. Housing costs are rising faster than wages. Roads and transit systems are straining under demand. Schools are overcrowded in some areas and under-enrolled in others. Rural communities face shrinking populations and fewer healthcare options. The choices we make now will define the state’s future for decades.

Uneven Growth and Diverging Futures

Population growth in our state is increasingly concentrated in major metro areas such as Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham, and Wilmington. Raleigh alone surpassed 500,000 residents in 2024. Coastal and mountain counties are also attracting new residents, particularly retirees and remote workers seeking natural amenities.

In contrast, many rural counties are experiencing economic stagnation and population decline, especially in the northeast and far west of the state. Younger residents continue to leave these areas in search of opportunity in metro areas; in their place, nearly all rural population growth is coming from out-of-state retirees. These dual effects worsen birthrates and worsen the long-term demographic challenges rural communities face. These shifts make it harder for local governments to maintain schools, roads, and essential services.

Without a statewide strategy, the divide between fast-growing and struggling counties will deepen. That divide will make it harder to pass the investments North Carolina needs to remain competitive.

Housing: A Crisis Touching Every Region

Housing affordability is now one of the state’s most pressing issues. More than one million North Carolinians spend over a third of their income on housing. Median home prices have risen 58 percent since 2017, while incomes have not kept pace. The statewide shortfall now exceeds 764,000 homes through 2029.

Urban regions face bidding wars, soaring rents, and rapid gentrification. Rural areas struggle with aging housing stock and wages that are too low for even modest homes. Without a significant increase in supply and updated zoning laws, affordability will continue to erode.

Transportation: A System Falling Behind

North Carolina maintains the second-largest state-run road system in the United States. A third of major roads are in poor or mediocre condition. Congestion is worsening, too. Raleigh drivers lose 36 hours per year in traffic, and Charlotte commuters lose 47.

Transit expansion has stalled. Projects such as Charlotte’s Silver Line and the Triangle commuter rail have run into political and funding barriers. Rural counties face even more severe challenges with limited public transit and long distances to jobs and healthcare.

North Carolina, if it fails to modernize funding and invest in both roads and transit, will face worsening bottlenecks that harm economic growth.

Education: Overcrowding, Decline, and a Shrinking Teacher Pipeline

Fast-growing counties struggle with overcrowded schools, while rural districts face declining enrollment and shrinking tax bases. North Carolina has not passed a statewide school construction bond since 1996, even though unmet school capital needs now exceed $13.5 billion.

The teacher pipeline has also weakened significantly. Enrollment in UNC education programs has declined 35 percent. Districts across the state cannot fill positions in subjects such as math, science, and special education. Rural schools, which cannot match urban salary supplements, struggle the most.

These trends threaten North Carolina’s long-term workforce and economic competitiveness.

Healthcare: Metro Expansion and Rural Loss

Urban regions are dominated by large hospital systems, many of which have merged and reduced competition, contributing to higher prices for patients. Rural communities face the opposite problem. Eight rural hospitals have closed since 2010, leaving some counties without emergency rooms or maternity care.

Medicaid expansion increased coverage for hundreds of thousands, but recent federal policy changes have put that progress at risk. Many rural counties already face severe shortages of providers. Losing hospitals accelerates economic decline and worsens health outcomes.

Building One Stronger North Carolina

North Carolina stands at a turning point. The decisions we make today will shape our state’s future for decades to come. In North Carolina’s Next Chapter, we provide a policy roadmap for lawmakers to make the key investments today that will harness growth to serve all our state’s people:

Build more housing and modernize zoning.

Modernize transportation funding and expand transit.

Pass a statewide school construction bond and rebuild the teacher pipeline.

Stabilize rural healthcare and protect Medicaid expansion.

Reform the tax structure so counties are not forced to carry the burden alone.

Invest intentionally in rural communities so growth is shared.

North Carolina has the momentum and the talent to build a stronger future. With thoughtful leadership and smart investments, we can ensure that every community, from Murphy to Manteo, shares in the state’s success.",https://carolinaforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fork.webp,N,,2025-12-08 11:03:49.854934

When presented with the report that June, Richmond City Council was taken with the idea.
“The state of California has a new industry being created with offshore wind that requires all ports to make it work,” said Mayor Eduardo Martinez.","First in a two-part series on Richmond’s exploration into wind turbine manufacturing. This series is part of “The Stakes,” a UC Berkeley Journalism project on executive orders and actions affecting Californians and their communities.

After decades of manufacturing declines, Richmond leaders have a new pitch: retool the city’s industrial legacy for clean energy.

In October, California placed a bet on that vision. The California Energy Commission awarded Richmond a $750,000 grant to study the feasibility of bringing wind turbine manufacturing to the city’s port. More specifically, exploring the development of a fabrication and logistics facility for floating offshore wind turbines.

While the grant covers the cost of the planning phase, the actual construction of a facility capable of handling and manufacturing floating turbine components is a significant financial undertaking. For context, a similar project in California focused on staging and assembly has an estimated cost of $4.7 billion.

The development of this type of facility is heavily reliant on public investment, as the required infrastructure upgrades are often too costly for private entities alone, making state funding critical for “de-risking” the investment and attracting private capital.

Proponents, however, remain supportive of the proposal and argue the long-term benefits of the facility justify the effort.

“A project like this will bring revenue and jobs to the city, and by building green infrastructure we’re also going to have a better environment,” said Richmond Vice Mayor Cesar Zepeda, a champion of city environmental initiatives.

While wind turbines produce green energy, they are not entirely good for the environment. For example, construction of an offshore platform requires dredging, which would disturb marine habitats and kick up contaminants that have settled on the sea floor. Such a project also would bring more vessels — and subsequent air, water and noise pollution — as platforms and turbines are assembled and installed. Once in operation, turbines would be hazardous to birds. And eventually, they would need to be decommissioned, posing additional environmental concerns.

For the past several years, California’s long coastline has been seen as an asset to transitioning the state to alternative energy. In 2021, the Biden administration announced the development of first-of-a-kind offshore wind energy projects in central and northern California, aiming to deploy 4.6 gigawatts by 2030, enough energy to power 1.6 million homes.

By December 2022, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management secured over $750 million in bids from energy companies willing to jump in the water, and began leasing sites. It seemed only a matter of time before the Biden era industrial policy spurred a wind production boom, setting off a race between cities to attract the industry.

But investment was abruptly halted by the Trump administration, which canceled $679 million in nationwide funding for offshore wind infrastructure projects in August. To recoup some of those losses, California legislators authorized $225.7 million in state funds in September for offshore wind ports and related facilities.

Adam Stern, executive director of the advocacy group Offshore Wind California, said in a Sept. 12 statement that despite “the unfortunate federal headwinds this year,” the grants were a “proof point of California’s progress and continued support for offshore wind.”

The Energy Commission’s award to Richmond is part of a larger $42.5 million package for wind energy projects at five ports: Long Beach, $20 million; Humboldt Bay, $18.25 million; Port San Luis, $3 million; and Oakland, $750,000.

Much like Richmond, the Port of Oakland will use its grant money for a feasibility study to identify, evaluate and design port areas for a potential offshore wind manufacturing and staging facility.

If the facility does get built, skilled workers would be welding and fabricating blades that are nearly as long as a football field, over 330 feet long, weigh up to 77,000 pounds, and are made from materials such as fiberglass and carbon fiber reinforced polymers to keep them from breaking down in the ocean. The blades would then be staged and pre-assembled at the port before being shipped out for installation on platforms at sea.

Green-blue jobs

Richmond has long ties to the fossil fuel industry. The Chevron Refinery, which opened in 1902 as Standard Oil Co., pre-dates the city itself. Today, Chevron is the city’s largest employer, with 2,500 workers and its refinery produces 257,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

Two decades ago, nearly 20% of the city’s workforce was employed in manufacturing, the highest rate in the East Bay, according to Richmond’s economic development plan. But Richmond has lost at least 500 manufacturing jobs since then and has become increasingly reliant on Chevron, which also is the city’s biggest taxpayer.

City leaders want to position the port and its skilled workforce for the next generation of clean energy jobs, setting the goal in the city’s “Green-Blue New Deal” of creating 1,000 of these jobs by 2040. The term “green-blue” is meant to center sustainable ocean practices as part of greening the economy. The city also pledged to end all fossil fuel use by the same date.

Tim Sbranti, executive director of the Contra Costa Building and Construction Trades Council, described the grant — and the potential manufacturing facilities it could help unlock — as a “great opportunity” for Richmond’s work force.

Richmond’s advantages

The agreement between Richmond and the state Energy Commission is about planning, identifying potential sites and taking development up to 30% of the design stage. Potential sites at Richmond’s port include Terminal 1, Terminal 2, Terminal 3 and Point Potrero Marine Terminal.

The yet-to-be-named contractor, which is currently awaiting City Council approval, also will assess permitting and environmental challenges, develop a strategy for local workforce training and make inroads with community stakeholders. The study is slated for completion by March 2030.

Charles Gerard, Richmond port director, said that the approval process will be completed this month and the contractor’s name will be made public once City Council approves the project. Gerard added that the development of a terminal could take five to 10 years.

“There’s a lot of variables related to the development and deployment of offshore wind and many of those are hard to predict,” Gerard said, adding that the lack of federal support would create delays.

If all goes well, there’s no guarantee manufacturers will move in. Officials positioned the Port of San Francisco as a potential hub for developing offshore wind infrastructure, self-funding a conceptual plan in 2023. However, according to Eric Young, port spokesperson, the project has not secured any additional funding since then.

Richmond, too, has been looking at bringing offshore wind infrastructure to the city for a few years.

In April 2022, the city awarded a $300,000 contract to consulting firm Appraccel, LLC, which published a report about a year later recommending offshore wind turbine manufacturing as key to bringing in new jobs. That helped Richmond leaders boost their case for the state grant, Zepeda said.

In June 2023, the City Council received an assessment by the consultant firm Moffatt & Nichol about the potential to host an offshore wind manufacturing facility. The assessment, which was part of a regional study paid for by the U.S. Interior Department, identified a few hurdles, particularly manufacturing constraints in the port and uncertainties around the assembly process.

It found Richmond had several advantages, including a navigable channel, a sheltered harbor, large assembly yards and a skilled workforce.

When presented with the report that June, Richmond City Council was taken with the idea.

“The state of California has a new industry being created with offshore wind that requires all ports to make it work,” said Mayor Eduardo Martinez. “Richmond is set to be one of those ports.”

The company behind Michigan's proposed potash mine has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Austin, Texas-based potassium-ion battery developer, laying the groundwork to use the mined minerals for potassium-ion batteries, according to a news release. The batteries would fuel AI data centers and their massive power needs.

""Together, (Michigan Potash & Salt) and Group1 represent the bookends of a new American potash ecosystem − linking domestic raw-material extraction with advanced battery manufacturing to anchor a secure, sovereign and scalable U.S. energy-technology supply chain,"" company officials stated.

Michigan Potash's proposed mine would draw almost 800,000 tons of potash, an agricultural fertilizer, from a facility in mid-Michigan's Osceola County.

Here's what to know about potash mining in Michigan.

What's happening with Michigan Potash?

Michigan Potash is partnering with Group1 Inc., an Austin-based startup, which is developing a potassium-ion battery that it says will be safer than lithium-ion batteries and will help America meet its exponentially growing power needs without critical minerals from foreign sources not always friendly to the U.S.

""From agriculture to energy, we're proving that the same element that powers our crops can power our critical infrastructure,"" said Group1 CEO Alexander Girau in a release.

Under the memorandum of understanding, the companies will explore not only long-term supply and co-investment opportunities, but strategic links between Michigan Potash's production and processing infrastructure and Group1's advanced potassium-ion battery manufacturing. The agreement envisions Group1 battery backup systems in use at the potash mine in Evart.

What is potash?

Potash is a trade name for potassium-bearing minerals typically used for agricultural fertilizer, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management said. Potash includes potassium nitrate, potassium chloride and potassium sulfate.

Potassium-ion batteries are considered an alternative to lithium-ion batteries.

Where is potash found in Michigan?

Large reserves of high-grade potash are more than a mile and a half underground in north-central Michigan.

The Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the American multinational food processing and commodities trading giant, also has partnered with Michigan Potash to sell its fertilizer directly to farmers and the U.S. agricultural industry.

What is the Michigan Potash project?

Michigan Potash is seeking to open a potash mine that would extract nearly 800,000 tons per year of potash and 1 million tons per year of table salt. The mine, which would use a fracking-like process, has been in the works for more than a decade.

Michigan Potash would use a process known as solution mining, which would pump heated water and brine (concentrated salt water) into a deep geologic formation known as the A1 Evaporite.

The fluids would dissolve salt and potash, which would be pumped back to the surface. The process would require millions of gallons of water.

Where would Michigan Potash's mine be located?

The proposed potash mine would be near Schofield Road and 120th Avenue in Evart Township in Osceola County, in mid-Michigan.

Where do Michigan Potash's permits stand?

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy's Air Quality Division last approved an air permit ""to install"" for Michigan Potash on March 28, according to the MiEnviro Portal map.

The status of wetland permits could not be found on the state's interactive map.

Policy delays are starting to bite.
During our ongoing dialogue with government, BEAMA is consistently calling for policy action to catch-up with the UK’s ambitions to inspire business confidence again.","With the government’s Industrial Strategy, clean jobs growth plan and commitment to Clean Power 2030 setting a solid foundation for growth, BEAMA’s latest Pulse Report shows room for industry optimism, while warning of the effects of greater policy and political uncertainty upon the industry; a point raised at its conference by BEAMA CEO Yselkla Farmer.

The reports findings show a bounce back in sales for Q3 vs Q2 across many sectors of the electrotechnical industry. However, continued policy delays, bottlenecks in construction approvals, and long network infrastructure lead times has dragged back optimism to a five year average.

The government has set ambitious goals for decarbonising the UK energy system by 2030, banning the sale of new ICE vehicles from 2035, and accelerating progress towards Net Zero 2050 – all measures which should increase industry confidence in reliable demand for electrification products over the coming decades. However, lack of detailed implementation plans and policy reversals, such as the government’s decision to water down the ZEV mandate, have undermined causes for optimism, which should be some cause for concern for government.

Industry optimism is not a theoretical metric but translates into tangible benefits for the UK economy: a more optimistic industry – confident in the demand for its products – can invest in UK manufacturing capacity, creating thousands of high skilled jobs. Greater investment leads to a more efficient industry, driving down the cost to consumers of essential upgrades to UK energy, transport and heating infrastructure.

BEAMA CEO, Yselkla Farmer, outlined the challenges the industry is facing:

Whilst we are very pleased to see sales growth in the last reported quarter, we must be mindful that members’ lukewarm optimism could soon undermine investor confidence if the UK government does not address growing political uncertainty and a lack of clarity on market delivery. Construction and network investment are both coming under pressure from Gateway 2 and 3 delays. Electrical network business plans must prioritise more consistent and predictable order patterns under Ofgem’s supervision. To accelerate progress towards Clean Power 2030, the government must urgently address these challenges and follow through with credible delivery plans.

Policy delays are starting to bite. Repeated delays to the Future Homes Standard and the Warm Homes Plan do not inspire confidence. Couple these with the lack of a sustainable long-term resolution to electricity pricing other than the ‘quick fix’ budget intervention and we can see there is much more government can be doing to promote growth.

Amongst the greater concerns for our sector is the average underutilisation of manufacturing capacity across our industry; operating between 67.8% and 76.8% depending on the specific BEAMA sector measured. With at least 25% of manufacturing capacity sitting idle and unproductive, our industry is not experiencing a one-in-a-generation ‘all hands to the pump’ coordinated effort often described in Government rhetoric. During our ongoing dialogue with government, BEAMA is consistently calling for policy action to catch-up with the UK’s ambitions to inspire business confidence again.",https://elementallondon.show/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BEAMA-Market-Pulse-Cover-q3-2025.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 13:03:04.632152

OSLO, Norway (P&GJ) — Carbon-capture company Capsol Technologies has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a major U.S. utility to develop the first commercial-scale gas-fired power plant using the company’s CapsolGT® technology.

The agreement grants the Norwegian firm exclusivity to advance project development for what would mark Capsol’s entry into the North American utility market. The project aims to demonstrate a low-carbon, dispatchable power solution for natural-gas generation using direct carbon capture.

“In the U.S. utility market, decarbonization must go hand in hand with affordability and reliability,” said Philipp Staggat, Chief Product Officer at Capsol Technologies. “CapsolGT® is engineered to be the cost leader for decarbonizing existing gas turbine plants, giving utilities and large power users a practical route to low-carbon, dispatchable power.”

Generators 'take advantage' of market Nationally, the Australian Energy Regulator's (AER) last market report found electricity prices were staying relatively high despite increasing renewable generation, which is cheaper.
That's in part because some generators were withholding electricity from the market, which can artificially drive up prices.","The cost of electricity is being driven up by tens of millions of dollars by some Western Australian power producers breaking the rules and charging more than they're allowed, the state's economic watchdog alleges.

In the latest alleged breach, WA's largest privately-owned generator, Bluewaters Power, hiked the wholesale price of electricity by about $30 million over eight months, the Economic Regulation Authority (ERA) claims.

Wholesale costs make up about 40 per cent of the average household power bill.

In WA, the state government shields households from the immediate impacts of spikes in wholesale prices, but the more they happen, the more they can trickle down to bills.

A complex market

The ERA's chair Steve Edwell said the Bluewaters blowout was part of an ""increasing number"" of electricity generators using their power in a concentrated market to charge higher prices than they should.

Such behaviour is not allowed in WA as generators are only allowed to sell electricity to retailers, like Synergy, at-cost.

But the Japanese-owned company said its pricing was necessary to ensure it could reliably power the WA electricity grid, and argues its market impact was only a fraction of the $30 million claimed by the ERA.

""The alleged breaches relate to periods of time when Bluewaters faced coal and water shortages and was managing its generation,"" a Bluewaters spokesperson said.

Supply shortages can lead to reduced production capacity, which is often reflected in the market with higher prices.

Bluewaters claimed the ERA had ""misunderstood the relevant facts"" and incorrectly applied the law.

It follows another case earlier this year, where the ERA found Alinta had increased the cost of generation by $66 million over a similar time span, which the company is also disputing.

One thing both the regulator and industry can agree on is the market, and the rules, have become increasingly complex with the uptake of renewable energy.

Generators 'take advantage' of market

Nationally, the Australian Energy Regulator's (AER) last market report found electricity prices were staying relatively high despite increasing renewable generation, which is cheaper.

That's in part because some generators were withholding electricity from the market, which can artificially drive up prices.

""Participants can take advantage of market conditions to make significant financial returns,"" the report said.

In a statement, an AER spokesperson said the practice of setting higher prices ""cannot be false or misleading"", but was otherwise allowed.

""However patterns of this kind of behaviour could lead to inefficiencies in the market and may not be in the best interests of energy consumers,"" the spokesperson said.

Cost of living concerns

The market behaviour noted by the AER is not allowed in Western Australia, where generators are only allowed to sell electricity to retailers at cost price.

Instead, they are paid to be available on demand, such as in times of high need — a sort of insurance policy in what's called a capacity market.

Mr Edwell acknowledged the energy market was becoming increasingly complex with the onset of renewables, which may be contributing to some market breaches.

But he warned those companies still had to ensure they ""only recover their legitimate costs"".

""It's important that we pay no more than we need to, and that's no more apparent than now with the cost pressures we're all facing,"" he said.

WA Energy Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said it was not appropriate for her to comment on the Bluewaters case while it was being considered by the regulator, and did not respond to questions about reforms to regulation.

""It is my expectation that all generators operate lawfully to ensure customers are not disadvantaged,"" she said.

Griffin uncertainty

Bluewaters' alleged breach comes amid uncertainty about the future of its power plants in WA, as the coal mine that fuels them, operated by Griffin Coal, approaches the end of its government lifeline.

Indian-owned Griffin Coal has been kept afloat by $308 million in taxpayer subsidies since entering receivership in 2022, with debts of about $1.5 billion.

The WA Government has committed to ending its funding of Griffin Coal by June 2026.

Griffin Coal has continued to pay off some of its debt to Indian lenders since receiving the government payouts, raising concerns about WA taxpayer dollars being used to offset the losses of foreign investors.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3e69493bce26a00deed71ca6d61beda0?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=574&cropW=1021&xPos=0&yPos=53&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-12-08 10:01:22.645186

To further strengthen the ecosystem, the Ministry of Power has issued the 2024 Guidelines for EV Charging Infrastructure, outlining standards, interoperability norms and protocols for both charging and battery-swapping stations. Setting up charging stations remains an unlicensed activity, allowing private entrepreneurs to participate freely. The PM E-DRIVE Scheme has also earmarked ₹2,000 crore exclusively for public charging infrastructure.

The Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) highlighted ongoing efforts to boost electric mobility and manufacturing. Under the PM E-DRIVE’s electric bus procurement programme, 10,900 e-buses have been allocated to five cities in Phase I, with bids opened on 14 November 2025. Another 2,900 e-buses have been sanctioned under Phase II.

While no fixed national EV targets have been set, the Centre is implementing multiple incentive-led schemes:

Advt

PLI Auto & Auto Component Scheme (₹25,938 crore) to promote domestic manufacturing of advanced automotive technology, including EVs.

PLI for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Batteries (₹18,100 crore) to build a 50 GWh battery manufacturing ecosystem.

PM E-DRIVE Scheme (₹10,900 crore) supporting e-2W, e-3W, e-trucks, e-buses, e-ambulances and public charging infrastructure.

PM e-Bus Sewa–PSM Scheme (₹3,435 crore) enabling deployment of over 38,000 electric buses with payment security support.

Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India (SPMEPCI) requiring minimum investment of ₹4,150 crore and localisation milestones of 25 per cent (Year 3) and 50 per cent (Year 5).

Minister of State for Heavy Industries Bhupathiraju Srinivasa Varma shared these updates in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, noting that the government’s multi-scheme approach is aimed at accelerating EV adoption, strengthening domestic manufacturing and building a reliable charging network nationwide.

It is therefore especially fitting that the 2025 Eurocities Economic Development Forum took place at OGR Torino, a former railway repair depot in the heart of the city, now transformed into a hub for creativity and entrepreneurship.

This year, Eurocities joined forces with the European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency (EISMEA) to organise the Cities Innovate Summit, bringing together the Economic Development Forum and the iCapital Awards under one roof on 3-4 December 2025. It was a unique opportunity to gather cities from across Europe to discuss talent, innovation, inclusion and sustainability.

Cities driving Europe’s new innovation agenda

The Cities Innovate Summit in Turin came at a crucial moment for Europe. Cities are expected to lead on climate neutrality, industrial transformation and social cohesion, while competing globally with innovation powerhouses in the United States and China.

Innovation is truly effective when people are at the centre

— Stefano Lo Russo, Mayor of Turin

From the start, the message was clear: innovation only works when it focuses on supporting people. “Innovation is truly effective when people are at the centre,” said Stefano Lo Russo, Mayor of Turin, underlining the city’s ambition to remain an open and connected place that attracts talent, ideas and investment while creating social inclusion. “Technology accelerates this process, but real change comes from working together.”

This approach reflects Turin’s legacy as European Capital of Innovation: winning through innovation, growing through collaboration, lasting through legacy. Participants in the forum explored how cities can combine innovation, inclusion and competitiveness, ensuring no one is left behind while powering Europe’s industrial and green transition.

“Cities are where Europe’s industrial future will be built,” said André Sobczak, Secretary General of Eurocities. “They are already innovating on the ground, but they need more recognition, skills and resources to keep leading the way.”

The power of place and identity

Identity and visibility are strong assets for cities to thrive. Barcelona offered a compelling example. As Marc Sans from the city explained, “The Barcelona Brand is now one of the most powerful city brands in the world, but it’s based on collaboration, not competition.”

Working hand in hand with the Catalan government, Barcelona has developed joint initiatives such as the Barcelona Catalonia Startup Ecosystem, promoting startups and research centres abroad.

Elsewhere, Ghent showed how smaller cities can make a global mark. With a strong biotech and cleantech ecosystem, the city has turned its regional identity into an advantage. “Start with who you are, find your edge and never forget that it’s a people’s game,” said Frederik van Hacke, from the municipality of Ghent. “The stronger your network, the stronger your ecosystem.”

Cities are already innovating on the ground, but they need more recognition, skills and resources to keep leading the way

— André Sobczak, Secretary General of Eurocities

Cities also shared strategies to balance tourism and liveability. In Spain, where housing affordability tops public concerns, Barcelona is tightening rules on short-term rentals and redirecting tourist tax revenue to retrofit public buildings. Genoa, Ghent and Frankfurt, meanwhile, are using similar taxes to fund maintenance or diversify visitor flows beyond crowded areas, redefining tourism as a driver of balanced and sustainable urban economies.

Lenka Kolarova from Prague, Chair of the Economic Development Forum for 2025–2026, set the priorities for the coming year: “City attractiveness, skills for the green and digital transitions, balanced tourism and reindustrialisation. Our goal is to make these priorities practical for city managers.”

Innovation districts where creativity meets technology

If collaboration is the engine of innovation, innovation districts are where that engine comes to life. The OGR Torino venue itself embodies this shift.

Through programmes like Hello Torino, ToTem for Founders and Ignite Torino, the municipality helps innovators settle in the city, offering mentoring, legal support and access to accelerators and urban testing. Over 450 startups have already benefited from the initiative, which blends municipal support with private partnerships.

Gavin Poole, CEO of Here East in London, shared how East London transformed the 2012 Olympic Park into a living innovation ecosystem. “What if all these buildings became engines for innovation?” he asked. The result is a campus for games design, fashion and tech that has created over 10,000 jobs. “If you leave culture out of your innovation district, you weaken your ability to create and grow,” he said.

Across Europe, cities are experimenting with similar models. San Sebastian’s dense innovation ecosystem, Bologna’s Tecnopolo and Innovation Square and the collaborative platforms in Aalborg, Grenoble Alpes Metropole and Nicosia all show how urban spaces can become testbeds for sustainable industry, driven by public-private partnerships and local talent.

We must electrify our whole economy, rebuild our industrial base, and do it in a social way so that people don’t lose their jobs.

— Willem van Winden, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences

Building cities that attract and keep talent

Innovation is meaningless without people. Cities are now focusing on how to attract, develop and retain talent in ways that improve quality of life.

San Sebastian’s experience stood out. Through its municipal development agency Fomento de San Sebastian, the city supports researchers and entrepreneurs with housing, co-working and training spaces. Its EKINN programme even facilitates accommodation for people looking to start a business. “We want people not only to work here, but to live here,” said Yesenia Otamendi, from the city of San Sebastian. The quality of life is also boosted by the Basque city.

In Bologna, the Innovation Square brings together local firms, universities and startups in challenge-based programmes that foster collaboration and showcase the city’s creative potential. Regional laws in Emilia-Romagna now link new investment to talent retention, ensuring that economic growth benefits residents.

Europe’s next industrial transformation starts in cities

The next decade will define how Europe’s industry adapts to a green and digital future. Cities are leading this shift: redesigning grids, rethinking manufacturing and investing in clean technologies. But they cannot do it alone.

Willem van Winden, from Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, summarised the challenge: “We must electrify our whole economy, rebuild our industrial base, and do it in a social way so that people don’t lose their jobs. Cities are where this transformation will actually happen.”

Across the sessions, the consensus was that cities need long-term competences, funding and partnerships to bridge the gap between innovation policy and real change on the ground. Europe’s strength lies in its diversity of cities: large and small, northern and southern, where ambition and creativity drive local innovation for the benefit of all.

Celebrating innovation: the 2026 iCapital Awards

The Cities Innovate Summit also hosted this year’s European Capital of Innovation Awards, celebrating cities that excel in adopting innovative solutions to improve residents’ lives.

If you leave culture out of your innovation district, you weaken your ability to create and grow

— Gavin Poole, CEO of Here East in London

Grenoble Alpes Metropole was crowned European Capital of Innovation 2026 for its forward-thinking approach to sustainable urban development, renewable energy, smart infrastructure and community-driven innovation. Rotterdam and Liverpool followed in second and third place.

In the European Rising Innovative City category, the city of Aalborg took first place, recognised for integrating technology into urban planning and fostering cross-sector collaboration across education, healthcare and clean energy. San Sebastian and Nicosia were awarded second and third place respectively.

Watch the full awards ceremony.

Looking ahead to Barcelona 2026

The forum in Turin closed with a shared sense of purpose: to continue leading Europe’s green and digital transformation, cities need the right tools, resources and recognition at every level. The journey continues next year, when the Eurocities Economic Development Forum heads to Barcelona in 2026.

From the railways that once connected Europe’s industrial past to today’s innovation districts, the message remains the same: cities drive a sustainable, inclusive and prosperous future for all.

I started my career at V.C. Summer, working alongside hundreds of dedicated engineers, technicians and community leaders who believed deeply in the promise of nuclear energy. We believed in what the project could mean for the state — reliable power, good-paying jobs, and a long-term investment in South Carolina’s economic resilience.

Those early years shaped not only my professional path but my commitment to advancing nuclear energy as a force for progress.

Seeing momentum return to V.C. Summer brings both pride and hope.

Pride because I know the caliber of the people who poured their expertise, sweat and heart into the site.

Hope because the renewed attention signals something bigger — a second chance to fulfill the potential this project has always held.

The future of V.C. Summer isn’t just about reactors, concrete, or systems.

It’s about people. It’s about the workforce that will be trained, the families who will thrive on new opportunities, and the communities that will benefit.

When a state commits to developing nuclear infrastructure, it commits to stability, innovation, and economic strength for decades to come.

That’s why events like the 2nd Annual South Carolina Nuclear Summit are so important to our state and industry.

Leaders from across the country will gather here in South Carolina to discuss the future of nuclear energy, the electric grid and the role our state can play in strengthening the energy landscape.

As someone who began his career at V.C. Summer, I see this summit as a powerful opportunity for professionals to come together, share ideas and advance the conversations that will shape our region’s growing need for nuclear infrastructure, reactor development, and reliable clean energy.

New nuclear power plants don’t make sense for South Carolina

South Carolina is uniquely positioned right now.

With the right vision, V.C. Summer can be a catalyst — not only for energy generation but for job creation, technology development, and statewide economic growth.

As someone who has spent nearly two decades in nuclear development, both in the field and through years of research leadership, I’ve seen firsthand what successful deployment requires.

It takes technical excellence, committed leadership, intentional planning, and a shared belief in the long-term value of clean, reliable energy.

It also takes experienced teams who understand the complexities of nuclear development from design to deployment — and who know how to get the work done safely and responsibly.

V.C. Summer shaped the beginning of my career.

Who foots the bill? - CalMatters,"Alejandro Lazo, Alejandro Lazo Climate",,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/12/data-center-energy-san-jose/,"How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?
The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need.
According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity.
No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.
PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers.","San Jose, the symbolic capital of Silicon Valley, is now ground zero in California’s battle over how to govern the rise of data centers used to power artificial intelligence.

The county seat of Santa Clara is touting its partnership with Pacific Gas & Electric, claiming the city is “the West Coast’s premier destination for data center development.” The investor-owned utility now estimates it has enough capacity in its planning pipeline to push the city’s electricity use to almost three times its current peak.

Those plans are forcing major grid upgrades, PG&E and city officials say, while raising questions about who pays for them and whether the state can keep the power clean.

Panelists at a CalMatters event in downtown San Jose clashed over key issues. They included a local official working with PG&E on the city’s data-center buildout, a tech advocate urging California to seize the economic moment, a Stanford energy expert pressing for a more modernized grid and a utility watchdog skeptical of AI’s promised benefits.

Their discussion centered on how quickly California should move to accommodate new demand, what information the public should be entitled to and how to keep customers from shouldering the cost of infrastructure that may never be fully used.

Proposals to more strictly regulate data center development died in the Legislature this year. Going forward, several state agencies and commissions are expected to take up further discussions, including the California Energy Commission, the Little Hoover Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission.

How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?

The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need. Companies can propose large facilities without committing to build them, the computing demands behind AI are changing quickly and cooling needs vary across the state. These factors make long-term energy needs hard to pin down.

According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity. That’s enough to power roughly 18 million homes, compared with California’s estimated 14 to 15 million. Regulators don’t expect all of those projects to be built, and assume the ones that do will come online gradually and operate at less than their requested capacity, producing a forecast of between 4 and 6 gigawatts by 2040.

Liang Min, who directs Stanford’s Bits & Watts Initiative, and a speaker on CalMatters’ panel, said that forecasting is particularly tough because companies are rolling out new AI apps — or “application layers,” as he put it — at breakneck speed. They include products like ChatGPT that use large language models. No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.

“Right now we’re really struggling,” Min said. “The risk is extremely high in the application layers.”

The Public Advocates Office, an independent consumer watchdog within the California Public Utilities Commission, recently warned that rapid data-center growth could leave Californians paying for billions of dollars in grid upgrades if projects never materialize or use far less power than promised.

“Ratepayers could end up paying for costly infrastructure upgrades that may not be needed for many years – or at all,” the office said in its commentary.

Min said forecasting data-center load is a national challenge, but California will need better tools to keep rates in check, meet its clean-energy targets and stay competitive with states racing to attract data centers and high-paying tech jobs.

Local officials have also begun to grapple with the uncertainty. In San Jose, city energy officials say they are reluctant to procure additional power until they know which projects will actually be built. “We do not want to buy more power than we need,” said panelist Lori Mitchell, director of San Jose Clean Energy, the city’s publicly-owned electricity provider. “That’s job No. 1.”

What are the environmental concerns around the data center boom?

California’s data-center boom is bringing a wave of environmental concerns that state officials are only beginning to understand. Those concerns center on water use, the carbon emissions tied to rising energy demand and the air pollution from diesel backup generators.

Air quality is a particular concern. While back-up generators run only intermittently, their presence is concentrated in a handful of regions. In Santa Clara County, where many facilities sit close together in dense industrial areas, the local impacts could be greater simply because so much equipment is packed into a small space.

Yet the state still has limited visibility into what data centers are doing. Attempts to require more transparency stalled this year amid tech industry opposition. The only measure that became law gives regulators the authority to determine whether data centers are driving up costs — but stops short of requiring environmental reporting.

Ahmad Thomas, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and another panelist, said his group opposed the electricity disclosure and water reporting measures because they would make California less competitive.

“It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states,” he added.

Consumer advocates say the lack of information leaves communities unprotected. “We certainly think there needs to be more transparency — that’s a good thing,” said panelist Mark Toney, the executive director of the The Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group..

Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy?

The rapid growth of data centers could slow California’s clean-energy transition if it keeps the state tied to natural gas. And some of the carbon-free alternative energy sources that could meet their power needs are deeply controversial among environmentalists.

The state has pledged to reach 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, yet it still depends heavily on natural-gas plants during hot summer days. A recent report by the environmental think tank Next 10 and UC Riverside estimated that data-center carbon emissions nearly doubled from 2019 to 2023 — largely from gas-fired generation — underscoring how even a relatively clean grid may struggle to absorb AI-driven load without higher emissions.

State leaders are making policy shifts as AI demand grows. California this year approved joining a broader Western power market, a move driven in part by new demands on the grid, including data centers. Critics warn the change could expose the state to dirtier electricity from other states and weaken its control over clean-energy rules.

Min of Stanford argues that California will need to rely on options some environmentalists would rather avoid. That includes holding onto existing resources like the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. In a recent report, Min argued the state will also need more “clean, firm” power — resources that can operate around the clock — such as geothermal energy or natural-gas plants with carbon capture.

PG&E agrees. Spokesperson Stephanie Magallon told CalMatters in an email that nuclear power, carbon-capture systems and large solar-plus-battery projects are all options under consideration for powering data centers in its region. But environmental justice critics in California have opposed carbon capture technology calling it unproven tech that risks extending fossil-fuel use.

Mitchell said community choice aggregators can manage new data-center load while keeping power clean and affordable. San Jose’s mix is already 60% renewable, and she said the biggest opportunity is flexibility — getting data centers to shift use off the hottest afternoons so the city can avoid buying additional power.

Will data centers raise your electric bill?

California’s data-center boom is reshaping the fight over electricity bills, exposing a divide over whether these new customers will lower costs — or drive them higher for everyone else.

PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers. It also claims the grid is underutilized on average — operating at about 45% of capacity — although the grid faces real strain during the hottest hours and in parts of the system that routinely run close to their limits. If data centers can be connected in places with available capacity, PG&E argues, they could help spread costs without worsening congestion.

Toney, another panelist, urged the state to slow down, warning that California is planning major infrastructure without knowing which data centers are real or how their costs will land on customer bills.

“I’m worried that we’re engaged in what I call faith-based policymaking,” he said. “The benefits are very speculative, but the costs are very real.”

Some states, said Toney, have begun tightening rules around the growth of data centers. One law in Oregon will require data-center grid costs to remain off household bills. A Minnesota law will give very large data centers their own billing category so regulators can keep their costs separate from other customers’ electric bills.

“This issue of data centers and the connection between affordability and clean energy is of national concern, and California is actually behind on this,” Toney said. “There’s this mythology about California being the leader all the time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120425_Edgecloud-Link-Data-Center_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 10:01:00.918424

Hawk Dunlap isn’t used to being cold. On a gray day last January when I visited him in West Texas to tour abandoned oil wells, Dunlap—in his mid-50s with a James Brolin vibe—was bundled up, a sweatshirt pulled over his signature red coveralls.

As we drove, Dunlap told me, with a note of sorrow in his deep Texas drawl, that he used to live in Bali, where he went days without wearing a shirt or shoes and swam in a pool he’d installed with the shape of Texas tiled on its bottom. Outside the windshield of his white pickup was an endless expanse of desert scrub and red dirt. Sweeping his arm toward the flat land and looming sky, he laughed and asked, “You see any blue water out here?”

For me, a climate journalist interested in the wreckage of oil and gas drilling, Dunlap is a microcelebrity. For a few years, I have watched videos from him and his partner, lawyer Sarah Stogner, on TikTok. They have gained an avid following by documenting the environmental disasters caused by abandoned wells here in the Permian Basin, one of the most productive oil and gas fields in the world. The two make the blight charming—even funny. One of the first posts that I recall seeing showed Dunlap visiting a sea of wellhead wastewater in the middle of scrubland, wearing that same red boiler suit he donned in January, set over the 2002 hip-hop anthem “Ooh Ahh (My Life Be Like).”

For more than a century, oil companies have sunk wells in this desert looking for liquid gold, leaving countless scars behind. Dunlap showed me wells ensconced by rusted-red pipes and decrepit pumpjacks strewn about the desert. These thousands of forgotten wells are not just inert fossils of economic history. Many emit ­methane­—a greenhouse gas that’s nearly 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide—and leach chemicals, including benzene, a human carcinogen. Recently, another problem has emerged: Old, dormant wells have begun mysteriously leaking—oozing brine onto the land—and shooting geysers of toxic water into the sky.

So far, well cleanup efforts have been haphazard. Many of the original owners never registered their drilling and abandoned their wells when they ran dry. The more conscientious owners plugged them as best they could, but early attempts sometimes used sand or wood—far from the best practice today. Ideally, wells should be plugged with cement deep in the ground, and pumpjacks removed. But landowners say state regulators weren’t motivated enough to make sure that happened. The result has been a mess.

Dunlap is well acquainted with the problem. For 30 years, he worked for oil and gas companies to fix and plug wells all over the world. “I enjoy the outdoors,” he explained. “I used to hunt. I fish, I scuba dive, I play golf. I’m not housebroke, so I’m not inside an awful lot. I care about land, I care about landowners’ rights, I care about water. If that makes me an environmentalist, then so be it. That’s a label that, you know”—his tone turned mocking—“‘Oh, you’re an environmentalist.’ Yeah, okay, I’m a tree hugger. I’ll hug any tree that doesn’t have thorns.”

Dunlap has become part of an unlikely band of folks living in West Texas who are trying to force the government and industry to address the abandoned oil well catastrophe. There’s Ashley Watt, the owner of Antina Ranch, who’s suing oil companies, including Chevron, for the damage they allegedly did to her land. There’s Laura Briggs, whose family runs two local newspapers and who has been a critic of state regulators for years. There’s Schuyler Wight, a fourth-generation rancher, who for the past three years has traveled hundreds of miles to Austin almost every month to give officials a piece of his mind. And there’s Stogner, a take-no-prisoners attorney whose talent for making viral videos—including a campaign ad she filmed of herself straddling a pumpjack wearing nothing but star-shaped pasties and a cowboy hat—has gotten tens of thousands of people to pay attention to this complex issue.

This small crew has spoken to national and local news outlets, spent hundreds of hours on social media, traveled around Texas raising awareness and nagging regulators, and even run for office. Far from being stereotypical lefty climate activists, they have a uniquely Texan approach to safeguarding the land. Each wants the oil industry to thrive. But the lack of accountability has turned them into reluctant, if determined, warriors.

In Texas, where landowners often do not control the rights to the minerals under their property, and oil and gas companies regularly do, a unique political identity has emerged. “I’m not necessarily an environmentalist on all land, but I’m definitely an environmentalist on my land,” Watt said. “That is a very common flavor of West Texas landowner. As you can imagine, West Texas ranchers skew conservative. From an environmental perspective, they could probably care less about saving the whales, but they care a whole lot about their land.”

For Dunlap, it is personal. He is determined to hold an industry that has provided four generations of his family with employment to account. “We’ve been doing things wrong for a very long time,” he said, “and now that we know we’re doing things wrong, we need to start fixing it.”

The exact scope of the abandoned wells problem is hard to pin down but is undeniably enormous. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates the number of abandoned oil and gas wells in the US at about 3.9 million, with 2.2 million unplugged. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) says that tackling the abandoned well problem could be equal to removing up to 4.3 million cars from the road for a year.

In recent years, attending to old wells seemed like a rare practical climate solution that everyone could agree on. In 2021, the Biden administration pledged $4.7 billion to help states remediate their orphan wells, more than $300 million of which has been slated for Texas.

Still, that is not nearly enough to address the problem. Regulators report there are more than 10,000 orphan wells—sites with no known owner who could be held responsible for cleaning them up—in the Lone Star State alone. That’s on top of more than 147,000 inactive wells with an identified owner.

The state should be ahead of the curve, with a program created in the 1980s to plug abandoned wells, funded by fees collected from producers. But landowners say Texas continues to be slow in plugging some wells, while refusing to touch others that cause massive problems, from leaks to blowouts.

A big issue is cost. Plugging runs into the mid–five figures, or more, per well. The money needed to tackle the country’s well problem “is staggering,” noted Adam Peltz, a lawyer and director of EDF’s energy program. “It’s at least an order of magnitude more than we have set out now.”

The initial $25 million federal grant given to Texas paid for just 737 wells. When I visited Texas last January, regulators reported the 82 wells it had plugged that month cost more than $2.7 million.

This void has left room for people like Dunlap. After flying from Bali to visit his mother in Houston in late 2021, coronavirus travel restrictions prevented him from returning. An old colleague, with whom Dunlap still talked, had been contacted by residents in Crane County, where a well drilled in the 1940s suddenly shot out a 100-foot geyser of brine on New Year’s Day 2022.

One of those residents was Watt, a former Marine and Harvard Business School graduate who owns Antina Ranch, a 22,000-acre property that spans Crane and Ward counties, 45 minutes southwest of Odessa. Watt was increasingly sounding the alarm about busted wells on her property after one owned by Chevron had mysteriously sprung a leak the year before, causing toxic water to gush to the surface.

Dunlap’s colleague, sensing his friend was cooped up in his mom’s house, recommended him as someone who could help with the blowouts. A stir-crazy ­Dunlap agreed to forfeit his usual fee. “I said, ‘Look, fly me out, put me up, feed me some Allsup’s burritos and some Dr Pepper, and get me what I need to work with, and it won’t be nothing.’”

When he first visited Antina Ranch in January 2022, Dunlap began to realize how big the well problem in the Permian Basin ­really was. Giving me a version of a tour of the ranch he first received from Watt back then, Dunlap showed me one of the things that he first noticed: The mesquite trees—spiny desert scrubs that are nearly impossible to kill—were all dead near sites of the old wells. “When I first put my feet on the ground out here,” he recalled, “I knew something was wrong.”

Watt hired Dunlap to help excavate and investigate the old wells on her property. It was a far cry from what he was used to earning from helping major industry players plug wells. But, he explained, “I wanted to understand what was happening.” From there, the interest grew. “Once I understood what was happening, I started seeing how much of a bigger problem it was across the state—and across the nation.”

Perhaps the most extreme example is a site that locals call Lake Boehmer: a massive, briny, sulfuric, radioactive pool of toxic water springing from a cluster of abandoned wells near the tiny town of Imperial. Lake Boehmer’s original wells were drilled in the 1950s for oil, then later repurposed for water to irrigate farmland—a not-uncommon practice for unproductive oil wells.

All was quiet until the early 2000s, when the wells suddenly began churning up a poisonous mix of oil, arsenic, refuse, and water saltier than the ocean from deep underground. Over the past two decades, the lake, named after its absentee owner, has grown into a 60-plus-acre bright cerulean sea, noted even on Google Maps. In the lake, you can see one well bubbling up like a massive jet of a Jacuzzi, spewing 200 gallons per minute.

Lake Boehmer is perhaps the most ­visually shocking disaster in the region, but it’s far from the only one. In October 2024, residents in Reeves County smelled rotten eggs. Soon after, a 100-foot geyser shot out of an old well. (It took almost three weeks to seal it.) In Upton County, a 200-foot-wide, 40-foot-deep sinkhole appeared around a well—the air around it stunk like crude oil.

Experts suspect that fracking, which ramped up significantly in the Permian in the 2010s, is the cause. At drill sites, the fracking process involves pumping millions of gallons of water—along with sand and chemicals—down into tight rock formations. The water pressure creates cracks and releases natural gas and oil; the wastewater then travels back up to the surface. In Texas, most of that wastewater is reinjected underground. Initially, frackers sent this water deep into the earth. But geologists said that practice caused earthquakes. So oil and gas companies began to reinject the water closer to the surface, which, growing research suggests, causes the leaks and blowouts in old wells, as the wastewater travels unpredictably through geological faults. (A 2024 study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found that the 2022 New Year’s Day geyser was likely the result of overpressurization of a local aquifer, thanks to wastewater injection several miles away.)

The wells on Antina Ranch present yet another aspect of the problem around the Permian. Many of the wells on Watt’s property are technically not orphaned. In fact, most have been registered as plugged and fixed in state databases. But, for the most part, owners of those wells haven’t been required to do maintenance or check on them. ­Dunlap discovered, when he started digging on Antina, all of the wells he looked at that the state counted as plugged were leaking. The plug jobs had steadily eroded after decades in the elements, and trash had been poured down some of them. Dunlap calls these “zombie wells.”

“[Some of] these wells are 70 years old,” he explained. “If you take a 70-year-old man, and he’s in the hospital and he’s having multiple failures, you’re not going to be able to heal him for cheap. It’s going to be days in the hospital, treatments, it’s going to be medication, it’s going to be surgery…and it’s going to run into the millions. You can’t really just give him a can of ­Gatorade and a can of Vienna sausages [and say], ‘Take one of these, drink one of these, you’ll be fine.’”

Despite the varied issues, the problem of the wells can be traced back to an original sin. “We’ve drilled a lot of wells that we didn’t take proper care of,” said Peltz, the EDF attorney. “If you don’t deal with them, you get stuff like Boehmer Lake.”

When Stogner first came to West Texas, she couldn’t believe what she was seeing. She visited Lake Boehmer and “was like, ‘What the fuckity fuck is this?’” she recalled. “How are we all not like, ‘This is not okay, guys’?”

Like Dunlap, Stogner also used to work for the industry, providing legal services for oil and gas companies for more than 10 years in Louisiana before moving to Texas in 2017. During the first wave of Covid, she befriended Watt on Twitter. As Stogner went through a separation from her husband, Watt let her move into her pool house in 2021. Living on Watt’s ranch, Stogner, now in her early 40s, started making TikToks about bad plugging jobs and the ensuing pollution, which began amassing views.

She soon focused on what she saw as a key problem: the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC), the confusingly named state regulatory body that oversees oil and gas production and the plugging of wells. ­Officially, abandoned wells are plugged in order of urgency, determined by the risks they pose to the environment and human populations. But because the RRC lacks serious enforcement mechanisms—critics say there are minimal fines and a lack of monitoring for lax operators—few incentives exist for companies to clean up their messes. Bigger operators often end up selling aging wells to smaller entities as less oil is produced; those smaller firms tend to lack resources to clean things up.

The RRC has said in the past that it is working “aggressively” to plug wells and that it enforces strict rules and stringent regulations around plugging. In a statement, the agency also told me that officials “remain steadfastly committed to addressing issues related to produced water injection through diligent monitoring and scientific research.” Still, landowners and advocates I spoke with ­believe the agency is far too cozy with the industry to be an effective regulator. A 2023 Texas Monthly investigation found that the family of Christi Craddick, who has served on the three-person RRC board since 2012, raked in $10 million in 2022 alone from oil and gas royalties.

By late 2021, Stogner was pissed off enough to challenge RRC Commissioner Wayne Christian for office. With little to lose, she filmed the campaign video of herself, nearly nude, straddling a pumpjack—an approach, she told me, that was thought up over a couple of beers on Super Bowl Sunday. The spot went viral and caused an uproar: The San Antonio Express-News even pulled its endorsement of her. But Stogner didn’t much care what the public thought of her, so long as her message was getting out.

“My only regret is that I didn’t do it sooner,” she told me at the time. “I thought, ‘I am confident that I’ve got the substance behind me, so if I can just get their attention, I’ll win them over.’ Like, ‘Vote for anybody but Wayne [Christian]—take a look.’” She was right. A month later, the San Antonio Express-News re-endorsed her, contrasting Stogner’s solid critiques of the orphan well problem with Christian’s “heavy ethical baggage” in taking funds from polluting companies.

Stogner lost the primary in 2022, but by then, she had a fan base. Her TikTok videos about old wells had amassed tens of thousands of followers. She was now a force to be reckoned with. Using evidence Dunlap was collecting on the ranch, Stogner helped Watt file a lawsuit alleging that Chevron and other operators had left behind hundreds of improperly plugged wells on Antina. Stogner thinks the companies should clean up the wells and compensate owners for the damage. The lawsuit is set to go to trial in 2026 and, if successful, could open the door for other landowners to hold big oil companies accountable.

When I first got to Antina Ranch, ­Dunlap and Stogner took me out to the remnants of a well drilled in the 1950s and later plugged. It’s a big hole surrounded by chunks of crumbled concrete; at the bottom, a rusted pipe sticks a foot up from the dirt, vile liquid pooling around a cap in the top. Dunlap dipped in his pinkie, and it came away black and slick with oil.

“They need to spend about a million dollars on this just to replug it,” Stogner said. “Then they need to spend probably another million or $2 million delineating and remediating the extent of pollution…If they’d done it right in the first place, they probably could have done it for a couple hundred thousand. But because they tried to do it for $5,000 or $10,000—this is what we get.”

After examining the well, Dunlap and Stogner drove me to a low-slung ranch house on Antina that they refer to as the “headquarters” for its well operations. Over Topo Chicos, they told me the story of how they first started working together in early 2022. Following ­Dunlap’s first visit to Antina, as Stogner’s RRC campaign heated up, she began peppering him with questions over text about various issues with wells on the ranch. Dunlap, who’d returned to his mom’s house back in Houston, had all the time in the world to answer.

“Hawk had nothing else to do, and he was very knowledgeable—he was bored,” Stogner explained. “He was responsive, and I trusted what he had to say. I knew that he wasn’t trying to mess with me.”

Dunlap, in turn, found himself with an unexpectedly eager wellhead pupil. “She was running around out here, putting her fingers in wellheads and stuff—well, I was telling her to,” he remembered. “She’d send me a picture and say: What is this?Well, put your finger in it.” He was surprised, he said, when she took the joke literally: “She’d go, wait a minute, I’ll be back. No, no, no—don’t do that.”

Dunlap’s jobs overseas kept getting canceled due to Covid. Eventually, he figured he’d tag along on Stogner’s campaign and give her a crash course in abandoned wells. They hit it off on the road. Stogner told me later that she knew she had a potential social media darling on her hands, comparing him to famous oil well firefighter Red Adair.

“People loved the well stuff, but they hated me because I was a woman—what do I know?” she said. “But when the messenger is him, and his accent, and the lip of tobacco, yes, I knew he was going to hit.”

Stogner encouraged Dunlap to begin making his own TikToks. Now, his account has nearly 120,000 followers. The two began to design their own online gags together, too. They put up signs near Lake Boehmer labeling two leaking wells as Lake Craddick and Christian Springs, after the RRC commissioners. They filmed mock tourism videos of the sites for ­TikTok. They put Dunlap up on a pumpjack in a callback to Stogner’s infamous campaign video, his red boiler suit pulled seductively down to his waist.

Stogner also helped Dunlap launch his own bid for an RRC seat. In 2024, he ran as a Libertarian against Craddick, a Republican. Craddick won handily, raising $10 million, with hefty donations from oil and gas powerhouses.

But the pair did not give up on politics. That same year, Stogner ran for office again, courted by the local GOP despite her criticisms of Big Oil and distaste for President Donald Trump. With a tough-on-crime platform that highlighted her bona fides in protecting landowner rights, she challenged the long-serving Democratic district attorney in Texas’ 143rd Judicial District—and won.

Talking in the living room, where a cozy fire was burning to offset the chill of the day, the pair clearly were exhausted. As Stogner stretched out in front of the fire, the toll of driving hundreds of miles each week for her new job, which covers three counties and entails an intense caseload, was apparent. Stogner now only has time to work on oil well issues in her spare hours.

“We excavate [a well],” she said. “We’re like, wow, that’s clearly fucked. And then Chevron’s like, ‘Nothing to see here.’ And the Railroad Commission [is] like, ‘We’ll get back to you.’ I’m tired, because it’s like, okay—and now I’m having to deal with little girls [who] are getting raped. So I come back and [Chevron’s] lawyers are bitching about something and I’m just like, get over yourselves. Like, we have real problems in the world. Why can’t you just admit that this was a fuckup and fix it and do the right thing?”

And then she answers her own question: “They can’t, because it bankrupts the industry as we know it.”

Until coming to Texas, I wasn’t prepared for the scale of its landscape, how empty the desert can feel driving between the ranches and tiny towns, with little except gas stations. As I made my way toward Laura Briggs’ property, about a half-hour from Antina Ranch, I could barely focus on the road. I was so distracted by what I could see out of my car: ancient pumpjacks toiling away, bobbing slowly up and down as they produce small amounts of oil for tiny operators. Tall, spindly flare stacks dotted the horizon, some topped with bright flames as excess gas burned off into the sky in a fiery smear.

So many political ideas collide in this part of Texas: the desire to preserve the rights of landowners, the eagerness to offer subsidies and favors to an industry that provides jobs and tax revenue, and an almost religious commitment to a hands-off government. When a business that controls the mineral rights deep underground wrecks a property, the owners of the land above have few options. For residents like Briggs, that means dealing with strangers routinely coming onto her land, sometimes leaving messes of equipment; spills of mysterious, toxic liquids; and poorly plugged wells.

Briggs and her husband, Smokey, live on 900 acres they bought in the late 2000s after the previous owner died when an old pumpjack fell on him as he attempted to escape a group of aggressive hogs. When I pulled up to the bright, chaotic ranch house—which the couple built themselves—friendly dogs rushed up to greet me; pens containing goats, pigs, and cows surrounded the driveway. A slight woman with a mass of blond hair tucked into a braid, Briggs has the welcoming smile of a favorite elementary school teacher. Inside the kitchen, she offered me raspberries she freeze-dried herself. Her new ­Chihuahua puppy, Amigo, nipped at my feet. As we talked about her various well problems, Briggs dug into a file cabinet full of binders, pulling out court filings and reams of correspondence with regulators.

Briggs noticed that long-dormant wells on their property were leaking. Noxious water seeped out of the ground. Smears of oily liquid muddied the loose dirt. In 2024, a sulfuric spring appeared a few hundred yards from their house. “It is like whack-a-mole,” she said of trying to clean up the wells. Briggs laid the blame on careless fracking: “All the orphan wells [weren’t] a problem until this produced water injection started.”

During our conversation, Briggs, who seemingly can make a friend everywhere she goes, rattled off a list of names of RRC inspectors who have been on her land. “I used to bake cookies and hang them on the gate and be like, ‘If my cows are any problems, please let me know,’” she said. But to date, she said the RRC has plugged only six wells on her property—leaving more than two dozen untouched.

With so few folks around, it’s important to get to know your neighbors. And when the Earth itself seems to be revolting beneath your feet—when the big industry in town won’t clean up its messes on your land and regulators seem to be deliberately unresponsive—people tend to start talking to each other about how to fix it.

In 2022, Briggs and Smokey traveled to report on a leaking well for their newspapers. On the trip, they met Watt and Stogner. A few months later, Briggs’ neighbor, Schuyler Wight, asked her to host some of his ranch hands for Thanksgiving. Briggs invited Watt, Stogner, and Dunlap to dinner. That night, over turkey and wine, the neighbors all compared notes about the well problems on their land.

“We realized this wasn’t just something happening on my property—it was happening on Schuyler’s property, it was happening on Antina, it was happening on neighboring ranches,” Briggs said. “I was like, ‘You know, God put us all together for a reason, so we should work on this together.’”

Briggs has been bugging the RRC for years about her well problems; she’s spoken to national and local media and driven to Austin to talk with regulators directly. But working alone, she was “easy to write off.” As we drove to look at the mess of wells on her land, the dogs trailing behind her truck, she told me that it was their collective power that was now making a difference. “I tell you what, it was so nice meeting people who understood what I was talking about,” she said. “I think what the Railroad Commission didn’t count on was somebody with Schuyler’s time and knowledge and somebody with Ashley’s money.” (In addition to funding the lawsuit, Watt put $2 million into Stogner’s first campaign for the RRC.) “And I’m grateful for the media coverage.”

In August 2024, after yet another well on her property sprang a leak, Briggs started her own TikTok series. And she called ­Dunlap, whom she’d come to rely on for help. The RRC has a 24-hour emergency ­hotline, but Dunlap was able to get there first to dig an emergency pit to divert the flow of oily water. (The RRC eventually plugged the well.)

“It’s kind of gotten to the point where people will call me before the Railroad Commission, because I’ll come,” Dunlap said. “I’ll answer the phone. It’s kind of an honor that they do that, but at the same time, it’s sad.” (The RRC has said it “takes immediate action to eliminate any pollution threats” from leaking wells.)

In May, the well near Briggs’ house—on the orphan list for 23 years—sprang another leak, creating another pool of murky water; Dunlap was again one of the first on the scene to help stem some of the damage. It took the RRC almost four months to permanently plug the well. “This should be illegal,” Briggs told me. “Like, somebody should be in trouble for this.”

I wanted to see for myself how the RRC worked, so I hopped on a plane to Austin to attend its monthly public meeting. They are usually overwhelmingly dry ­affairs, packed with updates on permit applications and waste reports. But the public comment period can get heated, especially when Wight shows up.

Which he has, nearly every month, for the past three years. On the day I was there, Wight, a fourth-generation rancher, wore neat Wrangler jeans and a button-up checked shirt, his white cattleman’s hat tucked next to his briefcase on the chair next to him. A few people came over to shake his hand, updating him on their own business or simply asking how he was.

Wight’s family has been working as ranchers in West Texas since the late 1800s. He knew there were abandoned wells scattered over the thousands of acres he owns. But he kept discovering more over time. Many are leaking briny water or letting off toxic emissions—and some aren’t on the official RRC lists of orphan wells.

When I visited his property a year ­earlier, we stopped by a crater in the desert, with a dusty waterslide running into the parched ground. Wight pulled up photos on his phone of the same spot from less than a decade ago, when the crater was a lush swimming hole fed from a local spring; in the photo, his daughter swam happily in the water. He suspected that the water-thirsty process used in certain fracking techniques was responsible for depleting the groundwater that fed his spring. (Stogner made a TikTok of the site with the voiceover: “When you use all the fresh water for fracking instead of recycling it, you lose Redneck Riviera.”)

“I don’t think they’re gonna get serious about policy until we flat run out of water,” he told me. “I don’t want to sound like, ‘The world’s falling, the sky’s falling, we’re all gonna die.’ But just in my lifetime since I’ve been down here ranching, I’ve seen it change so much.”

Wight isn’t typically a man of many words. Standing before the RRC commissioners, he got right to the point. “Why do I have to do your job for you? Why is that?” he said, before adding, “That’s a rhetorical question, and I’m not asking that in a mean way.” (RRC Commissioner Craddick, accustomed to Wight’s presence at these meetings, thanked him for his time before moving on to the next public commenter.)

“One thing’s for sure, I’ve got them stirred up,” he told me flatly. “They’re not happy with me.”

All the hard work this band of neighbors has put in seems like it is starting to yield some results. In 2025, Texas passed a law forcing companies to plug or reactivate wells that have been dormant for more than 15 years. The legislature also allocated $100 million to help plug wells and an additional $1.3 million to establish a team to investigate issues with underground water injection.

The law was drafted with support from an oil and gas industry coalition. “It’s a marker that industry has said, ‘Okay, this is a real problem and we need to curb our worst excesses here,’” EDF lawyer Peltz said.

But the law has industry-friendly loopholes, too. Operators can delay plugging their wells until the early 2040s. Experts worry the next 20 years could see many of the same problems. And while the RRC also passed new restrictions that could help to stop injected water from blowing out old wells, fracking itself isn’t going away anytime soon. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has loosened the Biden administration’s original requirements around the well-plugging grants, removing environmental reviews and methane measurement requirements. Texas regulators applauded the move, saying it will help speed up well plugging.

But Dunlap is dismissive of the new Texas law, describing it as “nothing.” He’s running again against RRC Chair Jim Wright in 2026, this time as a Republican. (Dunlap’s TikTok bio now reads: “4th generation TX Oilfield Republican Candidate Texas Railroad Commission.”) He posted his campaign announcement video on—where else?—TikTok in early August. “Fuck it! I’m running again for Railroad Commission in 2026,” he announced. The video has more than 33,000 likes.

He was further frustrated after talking with landowners in East Texas, where the RRC had granted permits to build an oil field waste site to an operator with a lengthy list of violations. “I just woke up pissed off one morning and I said, ‘Okay, that’s it. I’m running. I’ll give it one more shot to fix this.’ Texas is waking up to the Railroad Commission. There are things that Sarah and I have been raising hell about for the last three years—I think people are starting to see it.” He chuckled. “If it doesn’t work, I’ll go back to Bali and play golf again.”

Here’s How Other Groups Across the Country Are Finding and Capping Old Wells

By Henry Carnell

The Moms in Pennsylvania

In 1859, Edwin Drake sunk a well in Northwest Pennsylvania and kicked off the world’s first oil boom. Back then, “people would go out literally in their backyard and just start drilling,” says Patrice Tomcik of Moms Clean Air Force, which searches for orphan wells. Today, Pennsylvania has 30,000 documented abandoned oil wells. (Experts think the total could be up to 700,000.) To do this work, Moms Clean Air Force has teamed up with the Environmental Defense Fund and state regulators with plans to use everything from drones equipped with magnetometers to college students with backpacks full of monitoring equipment. So far, even without all of these upgrades, these sleuths have discovered 250 orphan wells.

The Kids in North Carolina

In 2024, three high schoolers in Cary, North Carolina, raised $11,000 to plug an orphan well more than 500 miles away in Ohio. Sebastian Ng, one of the students, says the project made him realize that “we could help make a real difference.” The plug was completed by Montana’s Well Done Foundation, a nonprofit founded by retired oil executive Curtis Shuck. “We hope that our work inspires people to find their own ways of creating positive impacts,” Shuck says.

The Grad Student in Alaska

University of Alaska Anchorage graduate student Hoyt Thomas uses lidar—the terrain-­scanning tech behind most self-driving cars—and a machine learning algorithm to locate orphan wells that cannot be caught otherwise. “Not all of these wells are emitting methane, and they still pose risks,” Thomas says. The next step? Make the algorithm scalable so it can be applied in other communities.

The Scientists in California

At Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, geochemists have scoured through old maps for evidence of abandoned wells. It’s like “finding a needle in a haystack,” says Charuleka Varadharajan, a scientist involved with the project. Researchers trained an AI model on handmarked US Geological Survey maps to find more than 1,300 potential orphan wells in California and Oklahoma, where they’re working with the Osage Nation to document wells in their territory.

The Lost Satellite in Space

MethaneSAT, a satellite launched in March 2024 by the EDF and the New Zealand Space Agency, tracks global methane pollution—in part to “name and shame” the world’s worst polluters. Its data, freely available online, reveals previously untraceable emissions across the world. A major setback occurred in July 2025, when the satellite was declared lost in space. But even as scientists aim to replace it, they’re sifting through the enormous data set from MethaneSAT’s 15 months in orbit. “It’s early days yet,” principal investigator Steven Wofsy told the Harvard Gazette.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/511_WELLWATCHERS_A_2000.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-12-08 11:03:39.075699

There is always a risk of the solar energy systems producing energy and not being able to use it all, because of the risk of having the energy banked.","New York is starting one of the largest solar farms in the state’s history, the Cider Solar Farm. This farm will be 3,000 acres, have five hundred megawatts of renewable energy, and one million solar panels. It will be able to power the town of Elba and the village of Oakfield in Genesee County when finished.

This is an important milestone towards New York’s climate goals

According to Greenbacker Capital, Cider Solar Farm is the start of many important milestones toward completing New York’s challenging climate goals. It will allow the state to remain on track to New York’s 2030 goal to have 70% of the state’s electricity come from renewable sources. These large-scale solar farms are becoming the best way to meet these goals.

The farm will be able to provide enough electricity to power 125,000 homes, which will tremendously help to reduce the use of fossil fuels and carbon emissions. New York is becoming one of the leaders in sustainable infrastructure, and the use of solar energy on farms like this will allow it to maintain this leadership role.

The enormity of the Cider Solar Farm demonstrates the market’s need for clean energy sources. The facility will have one million solar panels and will be one of the largest in New York’s Northeast. The farm will also produce energy at a considerable scale and employ hundreds for construction and periodic maintenance.

Maximal solar contact will be achieved through the specific positioning of the panels

The solar farm will also economically benefit the region as well as the local populations through the creation of new jobs and the increased available tax revenue, which will allow for new investments to be made in the local economies.

According to Greenbacker Capital, the Cider Solar Farm complements the independence of the national energy grid and revitalizes economically depressed rural areas.

The farm will also have the positive externality of sequestering hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, the equivalent of removing thousands of cars from the road. It will therefore help to transition the economy to a low-carbon one and mitigate climate change.

The risks of the project: What could go wrong?

While these solar farms do provide a multitude of benefits and are the starting point for greener solar energy in the U.S, these solar farms do not come without challenges. Without a doubt, one of the biggest challenges is land use. These farms take up a lot of land, and in an effort to minimize disruption of the land, including disruption of agriculture and wildlife, developers work with the local authorities to figure out a solution that is suitable for all parties.

Another of these challenges is the requirement of the electrical infrastructure feeding the power to the electrical grid of the state, and the subsequent planning that needs to go into it in order not to adversely impact the electrical grid’s reliability. There is always a risk of the solar energy systems producing energy and not being able to use it all, because of the risk of having the energy banked.

New York is setting an example in the renewable energy sphere

Battery systems are installed to mitigate fluctuations that can occur in solar energy output and ensure a reliable supply. Like Cider Solar Farm, many other solar farms are also the starting point of the use of solar power on a large scale in the U.S, and they are also the beginning of the use of solar power with minimal impact on the economy. The construction of Cider Solar Farm has begun, and with it, New York is starting to show how it can lead other states in the U.S in achieving a high level of sustainability.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/36.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 09:00:27.046127

Final marketing and distribution agreement for renewable ammonia from the Saudi Arabian project (NEOM Green Hydrogen Project) is targeted for the first half of 2026.

LEHIGH VALLEY, PA USA / OSLO, NORWAY (December 8, 2025) - World-leading hydrogen supplier and global industrial gases company Air Products (NYSE:APD) and world-leading crop nutrition and ammonia company Yara International ASA (OSE:YAR) are working to combine Air Products’ industrial gas capabilities and low-emission hydrogen with Yara’s ammonia production and distribution network:

Louisiana Clean Energy Complex: Air Products is developing the world’s largest low-carbon energy complex in the state of Louisiana. The complex is designed to produce >750 million standard cubic feet per day of low-carbon hydrogen, capturing 95 percent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) generated during normal operation.

Air Products is the project developer and once the ammonia plant has achieved agreed upon performance levels, Yara would acquire the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities for approximately 25 percent of the total project cost (estimated between $8-9 billion). Yara would assume responsibility for related operations and integrate the entire ammonia output into its global distribution network.

Air Products would own and operate the industrial gases production, where approximately 80% of the low-carbon hydrogen would be supplied to Yara under a 25-year long-term offtake agreement to produce 2.8 million tonnes of low-carbon ammonia per year. The remaining hydrogen would be supplied to Air Products’ customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast via Air Products’ 700-mile hydrogen pipeline system. About five million tonnes per year of high purity CO2 captured by the Air Products facility would be sequestered by a third party under a long-term agreement to be announced later.

Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Project: The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia is more than 90 percent complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. Air Products is the sole offtaker of up to 1.2 million tonnes per year of renewable ammonia.

Air Products and Yara anticipate entering into a marketing and distribution agreement where Yara would commercialize, on a commission basis, the ammonia not sold by Air Products as renewable hydrogen in Europe. The model maximizes value for both companies and enables ammonia from the world’s first large-scale renewable ammonia plant to be delivered worldwide by Yara’s unparalleled shipping fleet. The marketing and distribution agreement is targeted to be completed during the first half of 2026.

Leveraging complementary strengths to drive value creation in low-emission ammonia

Yara is the world’s largest trader and shipper of ammonia, currently transporting over four million metric tonnes annually, which is supported by Yara’s 12 ammonia vessels and 18 import terminals. In addition, Yara has a significant internal ammonia demand. Air Products is the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and brings leading low-emission hydrogen and ammonia production at scale. The collaboration would enable the companies to meet the increasing demand for low-emission ammonia in the coming years, particularly in Europe both for Yara's internal consumption and other customers.

“We are pleased to be working with Yara, the world’s leading fertilizer company, as we advance the global low-emission ammonia market and maximize value from our projects in Louisiana and Saudi Arabia,” said Air Products’ Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Menezes.

“Air Products’ two advanced projects are a strong strategic fit with Yara’s flexible nitrogen system – enabling energy diversification and profitable decarbonization while aligning with our disciplined capital allocation policy. The Louisiana project builds on a proven, capital-efficient model; producing ammonia from externally sourced hydrogen and delivering strong returns,” said Yara’s CEO Svein Tore Holsether.

It says targeting consumer demand is necessary but not sufficient, and public funding to address the supply of skills directly is needed now.

The Committee calls for ‘local skilled labour’ conditions in Contracts for Difference, an expanded skills passport scheme, a leading role for local authorities, and greater clarity for industry on levies, EPC ratings and the Warm Homes Plan.

The UK needs an estimated 250,000 additional workers just to meet new housing targets, and many more for retrofit. After shocking failures in previous Government-backed retrofit and insulation schemes, the Committee calls for a new, nationally recognised, industry-backed construction and retrofit skills programme.

The energy transition offers substantial opportunity. The Climate Change Committee estimates net employment gains from the energy transition of between 135,000 and 725,000 jobs in the next four years . But the vast majority of these workers will have to train or reskill. The UK may need to import some specific skilled workers from overseas, at least in the short term, to meet its targets.

With up to 70% of those embarking on construction-related FE qualifications not completing or not entering the sector, the Committee says Government should expand and formalise ‘try-before-you-buy’ training opportunities. SMEs, the backbone of the construction and retrofit supply chain, will need support in taking on inexperienced trainees.

Bill Esterson MP, Chair of the Committee, said: “It is essential that we build the workforce for the energy transition so that the Government can hit its clean energy targets and, importantly, ensure that the UK makes the most of the growth opportunity of the century.

“The Committee has found that market forces alone cannot overcome the skills gap. We need policy certainty for the long-term, locally directed investment in training, and policies that make clean energy careers attractive and accessible.

“For British workers this isn’t about hitting deadlines; it’s about securing good jobs, driving innovation, and ensuring Britain leads in the global race for clean energy.”

The Committee calls on Government to:

Put commitments to transition the existing local skilled labour supply into Contracts for Difference, leveraging UK manufacturing content requirements where possible.

By the end of 2026, set out the options for conditionality that can leverage more skilled immigration in the short-term and crucially boost support for home-grown talent longer-term.

Empower devolved government across the UK to lead on approaches tailored to local and regional strengths or weaknesses – and facilitate a greater role for local authorities to accelerate the roll-out of retrofit.

Give the Office for Clean Energy Jobs and Skills England the authority and resources to ensure the necessary consistency that will make skills portable across the country, in both the clean energy and the retrofit workforces.

Accelerate the adoption of clean energy and retrofit skills policies in the Spending Review, with a ten-year horizon for initiatives and funding which is revised and extended every five years. -Identify how new technologies can bring increases in productivity to help meet the scale of labour demand identified in this inquiry.

Launch new initiatives to promote clean energy and retrofit careers among under-represented groups and those outside the existing workforce.

Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality D. Reid Wilson recognized FRCE for its 20th year as an Environmental Steward in the program Oct. 14. During the visit to the facility, Wilson presented FRCE Commanding Officer Capt. Randy Berti with a plaque to commemorate the accomplishment. Berti said the achievement is a testament to the depot’s dedication to environmental sustainability, regulatory compliance and stewardship.

“We have made it a priority to go above and beyond because we understand the importance of taking care of our planet,” said Berti. “We want to do everything we can do be good stewards of the environment and our community. We live, work and eat here and we want to continue to do so safely, well into the future. That is why we do everything we can to protect the health of our workforce and our neighbors, and the natural beauty here on the Crystal Coast.”

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Environmental Stewardship Initiative recognizes and supports companies and facilities that go above and beyond to reduce their impact on the environment. The program’s mission is to assist organizations in reducing their environmental impacts beyond regulatory requirements and recognize those that achieve and maintain this commitment.

FRCE Environmental Division Director Andrew Krelie said the depot was one of the earliest organizations in the state to earn the title of Environmental Steward in 2004 and is the only Department of War facility participating in the Environmental Stewardship Initiative. He said maintaining the Environmental Steward title for 20 years has been a collaborative effort among the entire workforce.

“FRC East sets aggressive environmental objectives that go far above the minimum compliance requirements because we are committed to being good stewards of the environment,” said Krelie. “To be able to say we have continued to raise the bar, met all our compliance requirements and gone above and beyond every year for 20 years straight is quite the achievement, one that has taken the entire workforce banding together to accomplish.”

The Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers three member levels: Partner, Rising Steward and Steward. Each level is designed to fit the organization’s needs based on the maturity of its environmental management system and performance success. The Partner level is the beginner level for organizations that are interested in developing a systematic approach to improving their environmental performance, whereas the Steward designation is given to organizations that have mature environmental management systems and are committed to exemplary environmental performance beyond what is required by law.

Stephen Azok, program manager for the depot’s environmental management system, said as a Steward, FRCE establishes at least three long-term objectives to improve its environmental performance. The depot’s current objectives focus on reducing the facility’s energy usage, decreasing how much industrial wastewater it generates, and increasing its landfill diversion efforts, he said.

“This year, we are putting two of our three goals in sustainment, which means we have reached those goals, but need to continue monitoring results to make sure we can maintain them,” said Azok. “In the meantime, we are now looking to establish new goals that are more aggressive. For example, we’re always looking to reduce our solid waste. If we find a way to avoid generating solid waste altogether, then we wouldn’t have to recycle it, which aids our landfill diversion efforts. It’s a harder objective to establish because it involves so many elements but if find a way to do it, we are going to.”

Azok said FRCE exceeded its landfill diversion goal for this year, achieving a 64% rate compared to the 62% target. He said FRCE actively seeks opportunities to donate reusable materials to local businesses and groups, which helps reduce waste and support the community.

“We are always looking for ways we can aid the community,” said Azok. “We reach out to local businesses to see if there’s anything that we generate that we can provide them, such as scrap wood or pallets. At one point, we were even donating our toner cartridges to churches and schools because they could recycle them. We are always looking for those kinds of partnerships. They help the community and help us be better stewards of the environment.”

FRCE aims to use 25% less energy in 2025 than it did in 2024, a target the facility is on track to achieve, said Azok. Krelie said the depot has taken many steps to reduce the amount of energy it uses daily to achieve this goal, many of which have been simple fixes, such as replacing the facility’s old sodium vapor light bulbs with energy efficient LED bulbs. Additionally, FRCE has partnered with Duke Energy to help assess the facility’s energy usage and provide insight to reduce it, he said.

“Part of going above and beyond means doing everything we can to reduce our environmental footprint, even if it’s not required of us by law,” said Krelie. “Replacing the lead-acid batteries with lithium in our battery-powered carts because they are more energy efficient is a great example. With the old batteries, the carts had to be plugged in daily, which constantly used energy. Duke Energy also helped us find that we have lost a lot of energy in our compressed air system. We are working on getting that replaced now. Not having any leaks in our compressed air system will save a significant amount of energy and cost savings.”

Krelie said FRCE has reduced its wastewater generation by 65% this year, nearly doubling its original reduction goal of 36%. He said they were able to achieve such a significant reduction by closely monitoring each building’s usage and identifying areas of overuse.

“One of our buildings was using upwards of 70,000 to 80,000 gallons of processed water a day,” said Krelie. “The clean lines in that building were using a lot of rinse water when cleaning aircraft parts, and the water was running constantly. We were able to reduce that down to less than 10,000 gallons a day by simply analyzing the input and output and implementing simple controls, such as having the artisans shut the water valve at the end of the day. “We smashed our wastewater reduction goal with just the savings in that building,” he continued. “Even though we met our desired end state, we need to stay aggressive. We don’t want to hang our hat on the fact that we met our goal early when we know we can do more. We tweaked that goal a little bit because it became easy once we saw how simple it was to effect change.”

Not only have these changes helped FRCE become more environmentally friendly, but many of them have helped save the depot money, allowing additional funds to be refocused on supporting warfighter readiness, said Krelie. “There’s a huge financial benefit to all of this,” Krelie said. “We received a significant credit on our utility bill when we reduced that 70,000 gallons of wastewater per day to 10,000 gallons. And replacing the lightbulbs with LED meant our electric bill went down. Because we are a working capital fund, these savings go back to our total operating expenses at the end of the year. We remain good stewards of the environment so we can continue to do what we do best, and we love hearing the sound of freedom in this local community.”

Azok said the facility has developed and implemented many workflows and regulations into its operations to mitigate their potential effect on the environment.

“We have strict controls in place in our shops that use these materials to control their usage,” said Azok. “There’s a lot of testing involved to make sure we’re not sending out anything that could negatively affect the wastewater treatment plant. We also have emission control devices, such as the air filtration system in our aircraft paint barn, to help protect our air from any chemicals. All chemicals are strictly managed so that no one can check them out unless they are trained, authorized and have demonstrated that they can maintain positive control over them from the time they are purchased, to when they are used and disposed.”

FRCE also requires employees to complete annual environmental training courses to increase awareness and effectiveness, said Azok.

“Everyone, no matter what they are hired as, has to participate in annual environmental training,” said Azok. “There is the environmental management system training that offers a high-level overview of the environmental regulations that we have here at FRC East, and the hazardous communication course that teaches you how hazardous materials interact with each other, with the environment and how they are managed. There are also many other required courses that many of us take, depending on our job descriptions and the areas we work. Our goal with these is to teach employees about the products we work with and our processes so we can properly identify and mitigate any potential issues and continue to be good stewards of our environment, all while keeping the workforce safe.”

Being a part of the Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers FRCE many benefits, Azok said, including mentorship and collaboration opportunities with other businesses within North Carolina.

“At the Steward level, not only are you at the highest level in the program, but you also have the opportunity to coach those who are in the lower levels and problem solve with other companies at the Steward level,” said Azok. “It opens up the ability to reach out and get information from other members. For example, another Steward reached out to us and asked how we manage our lithium batteries, since we’re one of the few organizations in the state that deal with that amount of those size and type of lithium batteries. We provided that information, along with some of our emergency procedures. It’s a great avenue for networking.”

Krelie said although FRCE has seen many environmental successes this past year, the focus remains on continuous improvement.

“We take a proactive stance because we want to make sure that we are not doing anything that can cause damage,” said Krelie. “Our first priority is to protect and preserve our environment, our workforce and the people in our community. We stay on top of new technology and research because if we can make changes to improve our green procurement of chemicals or find a better way to dispose of something, even if it’s not a regulatory requirement, we want to do that. We don’t want to have to play catch up later on down the road.”

FRCE is North Carolina's largest maintenance, repair, overhaul and technical services provider, with more than 4,000 civilian, military and contract workers. Its annual revenue exceeds $865 million.

In 2023, the company was so gung ho about carbon capture that it hired 25 lobbyists to block more than a dozen Louisiana bills related to limiting carbon capture.
Here’s the kicker: now, even Air Products doesn’t seem to want the carbon capturepart of the project anymore.
Air Products is still barreling forward to secure permits for the full project — including carbon capture and storage.
Air Products’ carbon capture project is a bad deal for Louisiana.","At dawn in the Maurepas Swamp, you can see 11 pink Roseate spoonbills rise into daybreak, off to feast on a lavish buffet of Louisiana shrimp and crabs. The swamp is one of the last wild places left in south Louisiana. It’s a place that still remembers what this land once was and still is — a living, breathing estuary.

But this quiet sanctuary could soon be spoiled by injection wells, pipelines and industrial noise. That’s the future that Air Products, the giant industrial gas corporation, has planned for Lake Maurepas.

Within this area, one of the most conservative in the state, the opposition to the project is high. But there’s still a possibility that the governor may approve permits for it. That’s why it’s important to understand what’s behind the scenes, in Air Products board rooms and on the ground in Louisiana community meetings.

In November, hundreds of people packed into a church in St. John the Baptist Parish for a public hearing on the company’s massive “blue hydrogen” and carbon capture scheme.

Air Products calls it clean energy. But there’s nothing clean about building a hydrogen and ammonia plant in Ascension Parish, capturing some CO₂, and piping it 38 miles for injection beneath Lake Maurepas. It was once touted as the world’s largest carbon-storage project.

In 2023, the company was so gung ho about carbon capture that it hired 25 lobbyists to block more than a dozen Louisiana bills related to limiting carbon capture.

Here’s the kicker: now, even Air Products doesn’t seem to want the carbon capturepart of the project anymore.

Last spring, the company’s CEO told investors that Air Products was “actively working to de-risk” its Louisiana project and was in “ongoing discussions to divest the carbon sequestration and ammonia production elements.”

Let us translate that for you: Air Products wants to offload the liability for its company but has no problem leaving it with Louisiana’s people and wetlands.

If it’s too risky for Air Products, we’re going to venture to say it’s too damn risky for Louisiana.

Air Products is still barreling forward to secure permits for the full project — including carbon capture and storage. But from what the company told its investors, once those permits are issued, the project becomes a hot potato — so dangerous, expensive, and politically toxic that Air Products plans to sell the carbon-capture portion of the project. And with billions in federal tax breaks for so-called “clean energy” on the table, another company might take the bait.

Meanwhile, communities across the five-parish footprint are united in opposition to the entire project.

At a hearing attended by nearly 300 residents, everyone was opposed to the proposed plant, pipeline, and carbon capture scheme except for two paid representatives from economic development groups.

The proposed CO₂ pipeline could run just half a mile from Sorrento Primary School, a mother told the crowd, describing her fears. “Imagine your child playing on the playground within feet of that [CO2] pipeline, with flares from the facility in the background,” she said. “No child deserves poison in their playground.”

She’s right to worry! If this pipeline were to rupture so close to her son’s elementary school, 660 students could be enveloped by CO2 in minutes, according to a recent report.

In 2020, a CO₂ pipeline ruptured near Satartia, Mississippi, sending a suffocating cloud of CO2 through the community. Forty-five people were hospitalized; some were found unconscious more than a mile away. People gasped for air on the side of the road after their cars stalled — CO₂ had displaced oxygen in their lungs and their combustion engines.

When Yazoo County emergency director Jack Willingham arrived, he was stunned: “It looked like you were going through the zombie apocalypse,” he said.

We’ll say it again: it’s too damn risky for Louisiana.

At least six elected officials — a mayor, two parish councilors, two state representatives and a state senator — spoke against Air Products’ plan to invade Lake Maurepas and the surrounding swamp. Because they have watched industry in Louisiana, they know how this story ends: once one company drills, others follow. Soon, the serene waters could echo with compressors, barges and drilling rigs — all in the name of “clean energy.”

Carbon capture and storage is being sold as a climate solution. But the reality is clear to climate groups across Louisiana: this new technology is a costly distraction that prolongs pollution rather than stopping it.

Public opposition to carbon capture is spreading fast from Republicans and Democrats alike, driven by communities who refuse to be sacrificed for a corporate experiment. And leaders are listening.

In October, Councilman Coates proposed a resolution opposing carbon sequestration wells and pipelines in Livingston Parish and the Council passed it unanimously. Altogether, the Council represents more than 152,000 people!

On October 15th, Gov. Jeff Landry — no stranger to siding with industry — showed that he, too, is feeling the political pressure, as he declared a temporary moratorium on new carbon capture injection well applications.

Gov. Landry’s moratorium was lifted last Sunday, but the fate of Air Product’s project still rests with the Governor and state agencies. Our experience tells us that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will likely follow the state’s lead in deciding whether Air Products gets the green light to break ground in our quiet swamp.

Since he’s taken office, Gov. Landry often talks about protecting Louisiana’s way of life. Well, this is his chance to protect this part of Louisiana, by denying the permits for this project.

In this matter, the governor has a choice: side with the people of Louisiana, or with corporate interests trying to bury their waste beneath our land and public waters.

Instead of energy that relies on hydrogen and ammonia and requires a PR campaign and dozens of lobbyists to hide its true impacts, Louisiana deserves real clean energy — solar, wind and efficient power.

Louisiana can’t afford to get stuck on stupid again, as Gen. Honoré often says.

Air Products’ carbon capture project is a bad deal for Louisiana. Now Air Products — the company that dreamed it up — wants to walk away. Doesn’t that tell us everything we need to know?

Nobody wants carbon capture. Not the public. Not the parishes. Not even Air Products itself.",https://i0.wp.com/thelensnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/pexels-photo-10885355.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1253,N,,2025-12-08 10:02:03.750832

Read the full report Australian graphite: A path to a global battery market opportunity PDF (1 MB),","Australia stands on the brink of a significant opportunity in the global battery market, driven by the increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems.

At the heart of this opportunity lies graphite, a critical material for lithium-ion batteries. As the world moves to cleaner energy solutions, graphite is becoming all the more important.

In our new report, Australian graphite: A path to a global battery market opportunity PDF (1 MB), co-authored by CSIRO, Geoscience Australia and Stanford University, we highlight the immense potential of Australia's graphite resources and the strategic importance of developing a robust graphite industry.

The strategic importance of graphite

Graphite is the primary anode material for lithium-ion batteries, which are essential for the rapidly expanding EV market. Graphite's unique properties, including high conductivity, mechanical stability and compatibility with battery cathodes, make it indispensable in battery production.

Despite holding substantial natural graphite resources, Australia currently lacks large-scale production capability for battery-grade graphite. Thus, we have a significant opportunity to establish domestic manufacturing capabilities and become a preferred supplier of graphite in the global market.

Australia's graphite resources

Geoscience Australia data, as of December 2023, ranks Australia 8th in the world for natural graphite with around 4% of the world's resource. Our graphite is predominantly located in South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, with recent discoveries in the Northern Territory expected to add to the resource base.

However, Australia's current lack of large-scale production capability for battery-grade graphite shows the need for strategic investment and development.

Economic and market opportunities

The substantial price jump from graphite concentrate to anode materials highlights the economic potential of downstream processing. Developing domestic processing capabilities could add significant value to Australia's graphite resources.

Moreover, global market dynamics present a unique opportunity for Australia. China currently dominates 95 per cent of the downstream processing market for anode materials, posing a risk to supply chain stability.

So, enhancing our processing capabilities, international collaborations, support by targeted government initiatives, and industry-research partnerships will be essential to building a resilient and sustainable graphite supply chain.

Environmental and technological advancements

Integrating renewable energy into graphite processing could pose a competitive advantage for Australia. Technologies such as solar, wind and thermal storage could drive down the cost of the energy needed for graphite processing and deliver 'emissions-free' graphite. Additionally, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning could help identify graphite deposits, improving the efficiency and yield of mining operations. These innovations could not only make the graphite industry more sustainable but also position Australia as a leader in environmentally responsible mining practices.

A timely opportunity for action

In the report, we're encouraging industry leaders across Australia to recognise the strategic importance of developing a robust graphite industry. By investing in domestic processing capabilities, leveraging technological advancements and fostering strategic collaborations, Australia could secure a stable supply of critical battery materials. We’d be able to better support the growing energy storage systems and EV industries and position ourselves as a key player in the global battery anode market. Potential benefits include increased energy security, job creation and technological advancements in battery manufacturing.

In conclusion, the development of a graphite industry in Australia represents not just an economic opportunity but a strategic investment in a secure domestic supply chain and national resilience. The opportunity is here for the graphite industry to contribute to a sustainable and secure energy future.

Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality D. Reid Wilson recognized FRCE for its 20th year as an Environmental Steward in the program Oct. 14.
FRCE Environmental Division Director Andrew Krelie said the depot was one of the earliest organizations in the state to earn the title of Environmental Steward in 2004 and is the only Department of War facility participating in the Environmental Stewardship Initiative.

Stephen Azok, program manager for the depot’s environmental management system, said as a Steward, FRCE establishes at least three long-term objectives to improve its environmental performance.","Fleet Readiness Center East (FRCE) recently reached a milestone, marking 20 consecutive years of participation in the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Environmental Stewardship Initiative and demonstrating a long-standing commitment to environmental conservation and protection efforts.

Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality D. Reid Wilson recognized FRCE for its 20th year as an Environmental Steward in the program Oct. 14. During the visit to the facility, Wilson presented FRCE Commanding Officer Capt. Randy Berti with a plaque to commemorate the accomplishment.

Berti said the achievement is a testament to the depot’s dedication to environmental sustainability, regulatory compliance and stewardship.

“We have made it a priority to go above and beyond because we understand the importance of taking care of our planet,” said Berti. “We want to do everything we can do be good stewards of the environment and our community. We live, work and eat here and we want to continue to do so safely, well into the future. That is why we do everything we can to protect the health of our workforce and our neighbors, and the natural beauty here on the Crystal Coast.”

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Environmental Stewardship Initiative recognizes and supports companies and facilities that go above and beyond to reduce their impact on the environment. The program’s mission is to assist organizations in reducing their environmental impacts beyond regulatory requirements and recognize those that achieve and maintain this commitment.

FRCE Environmental Division Director Andrew Krelie said the depot was one of the earliest organizations in the state to earn the title of Environmental Steward in 2004 and is the only Department of War facility participating in the Environmental Stewardship Initiative. He said maintaining the Environmental Steward title for 20 years has been a collaborative effort among the entire workforce.

“FRC East sets aggressive environmental objectives that go far above the minimum compliance requirements because we are committed to being good stewards of the environment,” said Krelie. “To be able to say we have continued to raise the bar, met all our compliance requirements and gone above and beyond every year for 20 years straight is quite the achievement, one that has taken the entire workforce banding together to accomplish.”

The Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers three member levels: Partner, Rising Steward and Steward. Each level is designed to fit the organization’s needs based on the maturity of its environmental management system and performance success. The Partner level is the beginner level for organizations that are interested in developing a systematic approach to improving their environmental performance, whereas the Steward designation is given to organizations that have mature environmental management systems and are committed to exemplary environmental performance beyond what is required by law.

Stephen Azok, program manager for the depot’s environmental management system, said as a Steward, FRCE establishes at least three long-term objectives to improve its environmental performance. The depot’s current objectives focus on reducing the facility’s energy usage, decreasing how much industrial wastewater it generates, and increasing its landfill diversion efforts, he said.

“This year, we are putting two of our three goals in sustainment, which means we have reached those goals, but need to continue monitoring results to make sure we can maintain them,” said Azok. “In the meantime, we are now looking to establish new goals that are more aggressive. For example, we’re always looking to reduce our solid waste. If we find a way to avoid generating solid waste altogether, then we wouldn’t have to recycle it, which aids our landfill diversion efforts. It’s a harder objective to establish because it involves so many elements but if find a way to do it, we are going to.”

Azok said FRCE exceeded its landfill diversion goal for this year, achieving a 64% rate compared to the 62% target. He said FRCE actively seeks opportunities to donate reusable materials to local businesses and groups, which helps reduce waste and support the community.

“We are always looking for ways we can aid the community,” said Azok. “We reach out to local businesses to see if there’s anything that we generate that we can provide them, such as scrap wood or pallets. At one point, we were even donating our toner cartridges to churches and schools because they could recycle them. We are always looking for those kinds of partnerships. They help the community and help us be better stewards of the environment.”

FRCE aims to use 25% less energy in 2025 than it did in 2024, a target the facility is on track to achieve, said Azok.

Krelie said the depot has taken many steps to reduce the amount of energy it uses daily to achieve this goal, many of which have been simple fixes, such as replacing the facility’s old sodium vapor light bulbs with energy efficient LED bulbs. Additionally, FRCE has partnered with Duke Energy to help assess the facility’s energy usage and provide insight to reduce it, he said.

“Part of going above and beyond means doing everything we can to reduce our environmental footprint, even if it’s not required of us by law,” said Krelie. “Replacing the lead-acid batteries with lithium in our battery-powered carts because they are more energy efficient is a great example. With the old batteries, the carts had to be plugged in daily, which constantly used energy. Duke Energy also helped us find that we have lost a lot of energy in our compressed air system. We are working on getting that replaced now. Not having any leaks in our compressed air system will save a significant amount of energy and cost savings.”

Krelie said FRCE has reduced its wastewater generation by 65% this year, nearly doubling its original reduction goal of 36%. He said they were able to achieve such a significant reduction by closely monitoring each building’s usage and identifying areas of overuse.

“One of our buildings was using upwards of 70,000 to 80,000 gallons of processed water a day,” said Krelie. “The clean lines in that building were using a lot of rinse water when cleaning aircraft parts, and the water was running constantly. We were able to reduce that down to less than 10,000 gallons a day by simply analyzing the input and output and implementing simple controls, such as having the artisans shut the water valve at the end of the day.

“We smashed our wastewater reduction goal with just the savings in that building,” he continued. “Even though we met our desired end state, we need to stay aggressive. We don’t want to hang our hat on the fact that we met our goal early when we know we can do more. We tweaked that goal a little bit because it became easy once we saw how simple it was to effect change.”

Not only have these changes helped FRCE become more environmentally friendly, but many of them have helped save the depot money, allowing additional funds to be refocused on supporting warfighter readiness, said Krelie.

“There’s a huge financial benefit to all of this,” Krelie said. “We received a significant credit on our utility bill when we reduced that 70,000 gallons of wastewater per day to 10,000 gallons. And replacing the lightbulbs with LED meant our electric bill went down. Because we are a working capital fund, these savings go back to our total operating expenses at the end of the year. We remain good stewards of the environment so we can continue to do what we do best, and we love hearing the sound of freedom in this local community.”

Azok said the facility has developed and implemented many workflows and regulations into its operations to mitigate their potential effect on the environment.

“We have strict controls in place in our shops that use these materials to control their usage,” said Azok. “There’s a lot of testing involved to make sure we’re not sending out anything that could negatively affect the wastewater treatment plant. We also have emission control devices, such as the air filtration system in our aircraft paint barn, to help protect our air from any chemicals. All chemicals are strictly managed so that no one can check them out unless they are trained, authorized and have demonstrated that they can maintain positive control over them from the time they are purchased, to when they are used and disposed.”

FRCE also requires employees to complete annual environmental training courses to increase awareness and effectiveness, said Azok.

“Everyone, no matter what they are hired as, has to participate in annual environmental training,” said Azok. “There is the environmental management system training that offers a high-level overview of the environmental regulations that we have here at FRC East, and the hazardous communication course that teaches you how hazardous materials interact with each other, with the environment and how they are managed. There are also many other required courses that many of us take, depending on our job descriptions and the areas we work. Our goal with these is to teach employees about the products we work with and our processes so we can properly identify and mitigate any potential issues and continue to be good stewards of our environment, all while keeping the workforce safe.”

Being a part of the Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers FRCE many benefits, Azok said, including mentorship and collaboration opportunities with other businesses within North Carolina.

“At the Steward level, not only are you at the highest level in the program, but you also have the opportunity to coach those who are in the lower levels and problem solve with other companies at the Steward level,” said Azok. “It opens up the ability to reach out and get information from other members. For example, another Steward reached out to us and asked how we manage our lithium batteries, since we’re one of the few organizations in the state that deal with that amount of those size and type of lithium batteries. We provided that information, along with some of our emergency procedures. It’s a great avenue for networking.”

Krelie said although FRCE has seen many environmental successes this past year, the focus remains on continuous improvement.

“We take a proactive stance because we want to make sure that we are not doing anything that can cause damage,” said Krelie. “Our first priority is to protect and preserve our environment, our workforce and the people in our community. We stay on top of new technology and research because if we can make changes to improve our green procurement of chemicals or find a better way to dispose of something, even if it’s not a regulatory requirement, we want to do that. We don’t want to have to play catch up later on down the road.”",https://www.navair.navy.mil/themes/custom/navy/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-08 09:00:44.659540

""Together, the three platforms create a fully integrated clean-energy flywheel from Manufacturing to Storage to Renewable Generation to Digital Energy Solutions.","New Delhi [India], December 8 (ANI): The Reliance Group unveiled a pivotal new phase of transformation driven by two high-impact national opportunity areas under its flagship company, Reliance Infrastructure--Integrated Solar Manufacturing, and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)--complemented by the rapid expansion of Reliance NU Energies, the integrated renewable energy platform of Reliance Power, the company said in a statement on Monday.

""Together, these next-generation growth engines place the Group at the forefront of India's clean-energy revolution,"" it said.

Reliance Group is setting up Integrated Solar Manufacturing Giga Factory an advanced, fully integrated solar manufacturing ecosystems spanning ingots, wafers, cells and modules.The key highlights include Next-gen technology using TopCon+ with future-ready configurations for back-contact and tandem cell technologies, the company said.

Plugged into policy tailwinds with Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) expansion to ingots, wafers and cells; PLI incentives; domestic content-mandated schemes.

It further said India will need 55-60 GW of solar modules annually by 2030, while upstream capacity remains significantly short. A high-value, vertically integrated platform to reduce import dependence and strengthen India's clean energy security.

The Group is establishing an end-to-end battery manufacturing ecosystem covering cell manufacturing, pack assembly and grid-scale containerised BESS systems, the statement said.

With India's installed stationary storage capacity currently below 1 GWh and projected to surge to nearly 250 GWh by 2032, the Group aims to address a massive supply gap, as domestic manufacturing today meets less than 10% of anticipated demand.

Strong policy incentives--including VGF support, PLI schemes and mandated storage requirements for renewable projects--further reinforce the strategic timing of this investment. Additionally, capacity constraints among global Tier-1 manufacturers create a unique India-centric opportunity, allowing Reliance to capture value through a midstream-focused BESS business that accounts for 60-70% of the total storage value chain, the statement said.

Alongside its manufacturing thrust, the Group is accelerating the growth of Reliance NU Energies, its premium, integrated renewable energy platform, the statement said.

""Reliance NU Energies is powering the shift from plain-vanilla solar to hybrid and firm, round-the-clock (RTC) renewable energy,"" the company said in its statement.

Over the past 12 months, the platform has secured a sizeable portfolio comprising 4.0 GW of solar capacity, 6.5 GWh of BESS installations and 770 MW of hydropower capacity in Bhutan backed by long-term, high-quality 25-year power purchase agreements.

Highlighting the platform's strategic edge, the company said it has the ability to deliver dispatchable green power through Solar + Wind + BESS hybrids, High-quality revenues through peak/RTC tenders, Digital optimisation for energy trading, forecasting and arbitrage as well as the multi-revenue stack leading to superior IRRs vs conventional renewables.

""Together, the three platforms create a fully integrated clean-energy flywheel from Manufacturing to Storage to Renewable Generation to Digital Energy Solutions. This positions the Group as a future-ready energy leader capable of supporting India's 500 GW non-fossil target and its broader Atmanirbhar Bharat vision,"" it said. (ANI)

He envisioned replacing America’s level of 1975 energy consumption with a 100 percent renewable system that does not replace 100 percent of the 1975 energy.
His view is that we should be substantially reducing per capita energy consumption as an integral element of the energy transition.
This seems like an awfully roundabout way of saying “do a carbon tax,” which is a fine idea, but it isn’t going to make electricity cheaper.
growth, then you clearly want a lot more electricity infrastructure, not just better demand-management.","I had an odd dispute with an energy policy wonk a few months ago in which I was saying that electricity is expensive in California — meaning that the price of electricity is high — and he was saying that it’s cheap, by which he meant the average household’s monthly electricity bill is not particularly high.

His point is true because the average California household uses a below-average amount of electricity compared to residents of other states. That’s in part because of energy efficiency standards, but it’s in part a function of weather and infrastructure.

They don’t use a lot of electricity for air conditioning in California because in large swaths of the state it’s generally not that hot in the summer. In the South, where you might think the mild winters would balance out the incredibly hot summers in terms of relative energy use, people tend to have inefficient, “good enough” electric resistance heaters for the occasional cold snaps (compared to places where it’s really cold, where people tend to burn gas or oil for home heat). So even though electricity is much cheaper in Alabama than in California, the average monthly electricity bill in Alabama is a lot higher.

Why does this matter?

Well, it’s a reminder that influential elements of the environmental movement are driven by their roots as a conservation movement. The core desire expressed here is to shrink the human footprint: to use less energy, build less stuff, and live more humbly and in harmony with a somewhat superstitious conception of “nature.”

You also see this in the Sierra Club’s strange journey on immigration, which they used to be very hostile to because of their degrowth values. They eventually dropped their anti-immigration stance and later became good progressive allies to the immigration advocates because of the awkward coalition politics.

But the Sierra Club and many other environmental groups didn’t drop the degrowth ideology.

They often say that they’ve dropped it, and I think they sometimes genuinely believe they’ve dropped it. But whenever the rubber hits the road, they are fundamentally more interested in learning to get by with less than in developing abundant clean energy.

And this is popping up in a serious way as the movement wrestles with rising electricity demand. Building a clean energy economy is going to require huge amounts of new electricity. That means tons of new generation and tons of new transmission infrastructure — gargantuan projects that will allow us to use electricity to power our cars, to cook our food, to heat our homes, and maybe eventually to ship our freight or provide heat for industrial purposes.

But instead of focusing on how to get all that electricity built as quickly and cleanly as possible, the greens want to impose tighter price controls on utilities, minimize infrastructure investment, and meet household energy needs with rationing.

The long war on utilities

Almost no one thinks that market competition works for electrical utilities. There are too many complexities involving public rights of way, and it’s too expensive to maintain multiple overlapping sets of transmission and distribution infrastructure that compete with each other.

There are a few ways to handle this non-competitive situation. One is public power, like you see with the Tennessee Valley Authority. Another is electric co-ops, of which there are many in the United States, but they’re generally small. A third is a regulated utility, where a private company acts as a monopoly provider but its rates are regulated by the government.

The utility model itself comes in two forms: “vertically integrated,” where the utility also owns power plants (this is most common in the Southeast), and “deregulated,” where, despite the name, the utility is highly regulated but purchases its actual electricity at market prices from competing generators. In both the vertically integrated and deregulated models, though, the utility’s profit margins and rate of return are capped.

What’s not capped is that if you build more infrastructure and sell people more electricity, you make more money. The point, traditionally, of utility regulation was to make electricity abundantly available. You prevent the utility from gouging its customers, but you encourage it to sell them more electricity.

Environmentalists have always hated this model, because they don’t think we should sell people more electricity. Amory Lovins and the Rocky Mountain Institute, for instance, spread the idea that the cheapest and greenest kilowatt-hour is the one you never use. Environmentalists want to promote conservation. They acknowledge that people need electricity, but they think that’s bad. If everyone can switch to different kinds of light bulbs so they don’t need as much electricity, that’s the win. They think the point of utility regulation should be to provide people with an adequate amount of energy to get by. That means there should be a positive financial incentive to get people to use less, rather than a positive financial incentive for the utility to build more and supply more.

Lovins — regarded as an authority by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra, and other major green groups — illustrates this well in his “soft energy path” charts. He envisioned replacing America’s level of 1975 energy consumption with a 100 percent renewable system that does not replace 100 percent of the 1975 energy. His view is that we should be substantially reducing per capita energy consumption as an integral element of the energy transition.

You can’t really make sense of anything these groups do without understanding that as the goal.

And of course it’s great to be less wasteful. But I think this is a fundamentally unappealing vision, which is why the groups that are promoting it tend not to state it as clearly as Lovins does. But with public anxiety about electricity prices rising, the opportunity has presented itself to kill two birds with one stone: if you can force utilities to accept a lower rate of return, you’ll address consumer demand for relief and achieve the long-term goal of handicapping energy infrastructure growth.

As you see greens try to address the political demand for affordability, keep your eyes peeled. There’s a big difference between an agenda to make energy more affordable through abundance and more affordable through rationing.

The soft path to rationing

Leah Stokes’s recent Atlantic article outlining ideas to make electricity cheaper is an example of both the agenda, and the tendency to rhetorically soft-pedal what the agenda actually is.

She writes that you could make electricity prices lower by cutting utilities’ rates of return, and that one benefit of this policy is that it would cause them to invest less.

Legislators could trim these profits directly by more closely aligning utilities’ guaranteed rates of return with their actual costs. Such adjustments could also limit utilities’ endless quest for more infrastructure.

I’m glad she said it so clearly here. Recently, Neale Mahoney and Bharat Ramamurti wrote an op-ed trying to convince people like me to worry less about price controls and see that those controls could be part of a one-two package of immediate consumer relief plus long-term supply-side measures.

And they definitely could be! But to understand the landscape, you have to understand that Stokes (a favorite at Sierra, League of Conservation Voters, Evergreen, and other mainstream green groups) doesn’t see the anti-supply impact of price controls as an undesirable downside — she sees it as a benefit. In their view, utilities are problematically overbuilding infrastructure, and we need to cut their rates of return, not just to save consumers money in the short term but to slow down utilities’ pace of investment.

Stokes offers two other ideas to make electricity cheaper. One is to take the portion of infrastructure costs that can be plausibly related to climate change off the ratepayers’ books, and instead allocate the blame for them to fossil fuel companies who will then be charged a fee. This seems like an awfully roundabout way of saying “do a carbon tax,” which is a fine idea, but it isn’t going to make electricity cheaper.

Then last but not least, she wants utilities to vary their pricing by the time of day.

In places with a lot of solar, including California, some installations are producing more energy than is being consumed, so some power is being wasted. If people shifted more of their electricity use toward the middle of the day, the grid’s overall costs would go down, because demand would decrease in later hours, when prices are the highest. And the easiest way to nudge people toward using that midday power is to make it cheaper — or even free.

Variable pricing seems like a reasonable idea to me (my uncle co-authored a paper advocating this a few years ago if you want a much more detailed version of the case), but it’s disingenuous to act like this is just going to be a case of cheap electricity in the early afternoon. To make this work, you need to have symmetrically higher prices at other times. More to the point, the green wing of the energy wonk community is suddenly buzzing in a frenzied way about responsive demand, as if this is some kind of magic alternative to major new capital investment, in a way that doesn’t make any sense to me.

Imagine if you electrified everything

A tell here, in my opinion, is that these takes often emphasize the question of data centers as drivers of new electricity demand. But imagine everyone decides tomorrow that AI is fake and nobody ever wants to build a data center again.

The climate movement itself has spent years prepping people to replace fossil fuels in cars, stoves, and furnaces with electricity. They want to ban gas leaf blowers and have people use electric ones instead. Electric boats aren’t quite ready for the mass market, but people are working on it. Electrifying heavy construction equipment, trucking, or freight rail seems further off, but one can imagine it happening and, again, it is specifically the climate movement that wants to do this.

Well, that means we’re gonna need a lot of electricity!

A small price nudge to encourage people to charge their electric vehicles at midday rather than in the evening is not going to replace the need for new infrastructure if you imagine a world where 100 percent of the cars are electric. And it’s definitely not going to work if you’re also electrifying home heating and larger and larger swaths of industry.

You of course do want to use infrastructure efficiently rather than inefficiently, but if you want to electrify large parts of the economy in the context of population growth and per capita G.D.P. growth, then you clearly want a lot more electricity infrastructure, not just better demand-management. That’s the appealing, optimistic vision of a modern dynamic approach to climate change.

But people who favor such an approach to climate change need to understand that the Stokes/Lovins vision that the green groups embrace is fundamentally different — they want decarbonization by rationing to avoid new infrastructure.

It’s important to be clear about the goal here because I think the progressive community raises reasonable questions about the whole regulated investor-owned utility model. There’s a lot to be said for the public power alternative!

But how we organize the utility sector is fundamentally less important than to what end we’re organizing it. If we replaced the investor-owned utilities of the Northeast with a T.V.A.-style agency, I think the goal should be to promote emissions reduction by making electricity cheaper and more abundant via a mix of natural gas, renewables, and transmission while hoping to participate in breakthroughs in nuclear and geothermal. And if we stuck with regulated utilities, I think the goal should also be to promote emissions reduction by making electricity cheaper and more abundant. We can debate the best policy mix to promote that goal, but we also need to debate the goal, and it’s one the green groups fundamentally reject.

They’d like you to see their posture as being more hardcore about climate change, but if you have a halfway realistic view of the politics, it’s not even that. People aren’t going to switch to electric cars and electric home heating if doing so raises their fuel costs, and you’re not going to have enough electricity to keep prices low in the context of electrification unless you build the infrastructure.

The case for ambition

Beyond the weeds of utility regulation, I’d like to motivate people to get off the soft path by reminding the world of the potential upsides of truly abundant energy.

One of the really big ones is the ability to do vertical farming.

This is a thing that people get excited about every few years because the benefits would be massive. Not only do vertical farms have a dramatically smaller geographical footprint than conventional farms, they are also wildly more resource efficient in terms of things like water and pesticides. The agriculture sector is responsible for dramatically more consumption of these resources than the overhyped data centers, but obviously people can’t just not eat food. The problem is that, offsetting all these benefits, a vertical farm would require lots of electricity to run, so it’s not within light-years from being cost-effective right now.

Similarly, if we could grow animal protein in a factory rather than raise livestock, we would achieve incredible ecological benefits and a massive reduction in cruelty. Powering such a factory with electricity is also in some sense more energy-efficient than growing crops to manufacture animal feed to give to chickens we then slaughter. But in a more literal sense, it would mean you’d need a ton of electricity.

It would also be nice to be able to actually do carbon removal to mitigate the harms of the global emissions overshoot that the world is all-but-certain to engage in. Perhaps this is doable, but it requires energy.

These somewhat utopian dreams are not policies for 2029 or even necessarily for 2050, but we ought to set high aspirations for a dynamic, cleaner, high-energy future. Sure, we should use our infrastructure as efficiently as we reasonably can. But the future ought to involve dramatically more electricity, which is going to mean dramatically more supportive infrastructure. A vision for utilities that doesn’t support that isn’t going to work.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBpD!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13c59467-5f25-4182-810e-b283c0133762_8000x5998.jpeg",N,,2025-12-08 10:01:40.640451

The privately held INOXGFL arm had filed its draft red herring prospectus confidentially in July, with plans to raise Rs 6,000 crore through its initial public offering. However, since then the company has completed multiple acquisitions and has other large acquisitions underway, prompting it to withdraw its DRHP on a temporary basis.

These transactions are expected to substantially increase the operational and pipeline IPP portfolio, as well as developments across the solar manufacturing business, the people aware of the matter told PTI.

Since these major developments are not yet reflected in the existing draft, Inox Clean Energy has opted to withdraw the draft papers and will re-file a revised version incorporating all updates, they added.

The company is also planning another significant fundraising through a private placement with commitments from multiple investors after securing sizable commitments from private equity investors, including a major global investor, that enabled it to raise around Rs 5,000 crore in the pre-IPO round.

After making these modifications and incorporations to its preliminary filings, Inox Clean Energy is expected to refile its IPO papers, the sources said.

The milestone follows years of foundational support the startup received through riidl Somaiya Vidyavihar University, an incubation centre which nurtures startups by providing them with resources, labs, facilitating government grants, investor connections, funding and mentorship. A joint initiative of Somaiya Trust and Somaiya Vidyavihar, riidl provides mentorship through, early prototyping infrastructure, and access to government-backed programmes. Business incubators of riidl Somaiya Vidyavihar University are supported by the Department of Science & Technology; BIRAC, Department of Biotechnology; MeitY, Government of India and Maharashtra State Innovation Society, Government of Maharashtra. It has incubated over 300 startups and facilitated in creating 1000+ jobs and internship opportunities, while the total revenue generated by the startups is over INR 400 Cr. riidl Somaiya Vidyavihar University has been bestowed with the National Award for the year 2020 in the Emerging Technology Business Incubator category by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.

ACS Energy benefitted from the NIDHI Prayas prototyping grant by the Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India and its participation in the HDFC Parivartan Manufacturing Accelerator by HDFC Bank and riidl Somaiya Vidyavihar University, which enabled the team to build its early systems, engineering processes, and core charging technology, all while being supported by the Maharashtra State Innovation Society, Government of Maharashtra.

ACS Energy develops modular, user-friendly EV charging solutions for residential townships and high-rise buildings — an underserved but rapidly growing segment in India’s EV ecosystem. With this investment, the company aims to expand its charging network across Mumbai and other urban markets, strengthen its hardware-software stack, and accelerate deployments in gated communities and residential societies.

ACS’s chargers have already helped avoid more than 80 tonnes of tailpipe CO₂ emissions by shifting daily commuting from ICE vehicles to EVs charged on its network. Based on the total kWh delivered and average EV efficiency, this is equivalent to over 6,00,000 green kilometres of cleaner travel powered through ACS.

Founded by SVU alumni, ACS Energy traces its research roots to riidl and the ecosystem at Somaiya Vidyavihar University, where the team first began exploring EV technologies, system design, and early prototypes. The university’s research culture, engineering labs, and sustained incubation support through riidl Somaiya Vidyavihar University helped the founders transition from an academic project into a commercially deployable venture. ACS Energy’s first EV charging station was deployed on the Somaiya Vidyavihar University campus, providing the team with a live environment to test, validate, and optimise the technology before commercial rollout.

The green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress halt the proliferation of energy-hungry data centers, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and for exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.

“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.

The push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new data centers, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 data center projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.

These seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing data centers.

This threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.

However, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”

Yet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming data centers for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a nonpartisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.

“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.

“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”

Hua said the causes of the electricity cost rises are nuanced, with aging transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.

But it is the growth of data centers to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.

More broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.

This focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.

At the current rate of growth, data centers could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars onto the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.

But it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, one of the groups behind the letter to lawmakers.

“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.

“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7487c3a8c1ce3e04080db3f644342c8d03f0a1c9/250_0_7493_5995/master/7493.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1485952012d8787a058afb4ae905f485",N,,2025-12-08 08:01:04.738153

This article was produced in collaboration with the Environmental Justice Oral History Project.

Whitney Parker can’t escape the steady stream of trash that flows into his rural hometown.

From sunrise to sundown, six days a week, heavy-duty garbage trucks rumble past his home en route to the approximately 1,000-acre Sampson County Landfill in Roseboro. The trucks deliver roughly 1.8 million tons of waste each year from 44 counties across North Carolina. The air in the surrounding area is permanently tinged with the odor of rotting meat, sewage, and chemicals that lasts long after the trucks are gone.

“I sit in my yard and watch 18-wheelers full of toxic waste drive by—20 or 30 trucks within an hour,” Parker said. “And people say, ‘That’s just how it is.’”

In addition to the landfill, animal feeding operations and processing facilities have long contributed to environmental challenges in Sampson County, placing a heavy burden on the predominantly and historically Black communities that call the area home.

Decades of advocacy by residents of Roseboro’s Snow Hill neighborhood—plus a lawsuit filed by an environmental legal group—culminated in a landmark cooperative agreement in December 2024 between the Canadian solid waste company GFL Environmental and the local group, Environmental Justice Community Action Network.

Since that deal was inked last year, GFL has updated its pollution and odor monitoring procedures surrounding the landfill and agreed to establish several recycling programs and water filtration systems across the Sampson County School District.

“It’s not to say that the problems have been completely eliminated; residents are still reporting some issues,” said Kyron Williams, the Snow Hill community liaison for the network. “But I think generally speaking, at least as far as has been expressed to me, there’s been pretty good satisfaction between now and last year.”

More recently, the company and community representatives have also begun to establish a new community center and a nonprofit organization. But GFL has missed key deadlines to acquire property for the community center.

And some residents say concerns about the landfill, which are supposed to be handled through a new complaint system, aren’t being meaningfully addressed. The odor from the landfill is still unbearable, locals say.

GFL Environmental did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the cooperative agreement or ongoing community concerns.

“Every time we demand A, B, C, D, we’re told, ‘Calm down, give them time.’ But this is a billion-dollar company,” Parker said. “It’s been a lot of promises and press releases—but if anybody wants to challenge what we’re saying, show us the receipts.”

From Farm to Foul

The last time Paul Fisher saw Snow Hill in its original state was in 1966, when he left to serve in the military. He remembers it as idyllic.

“It was a nice, quiet community. It was clean. Everybody knew everybody,” he said.

In 1970, Sampson County commissioners first allocated funds for a new solid waste program. The original plan called for several smaller municipal dumps scattered throughout the county. However, after a wave of resistance from majority-white neighborhoods, officials quietly shifted direction.

By 1973, with little public notice or community consultation, they selected the rural, predominantly Black community of Snow Hill as the site for a consolidated county landfill. Construction began in 1975, the same year Fisher returned from military service.

Fisher brought his two daughters and built a home on land about a mile away from the landfill that had been in his family since the early 1900s, hoping they could experience a similar childhood. But as they settled in, he noticed many of his former neighbors moving out.

Though ownership and operators of the landfill have changed hands over the years, eventually landing under the management of GFL Environmental, the burden of the county’s decision has remained with Snow Hill’s residents for nearly half a century.

Eventually, Fisher’s children moved away as well. “My children are a little skeptical about retiring and moving back here … and I wouldn’t blame them if they decided not to come back,” he said.

Maia Hutt, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the lawsuit sought to force GFL to address problems stemming from generations of deferred action by the facility.

“Prior to this court-enforceable settlement agreement, community members expressed that complaints of nuisance conditions—odor, vermin, traffic, and garbage truck spills—were going unaddressed,” Hutt said in an email.

According to the original 2024 lawsuit, PFAS, a family chemicals known to accumulate in the human body, have been sent to the landfill for years.

The lawsuit also claimed that significant methane emissions, groundwater and soil contamination, and other nuisances—such as roadway waste and pests attracted to the rotting smells—reduced the wealth and quality of life for residents.

The provisions in the cooperative agreement aim to help make Snow Hill livable again. “This was the product of a multiyear effort by residents, scientists, and local activists,” Hutt wrote.

Fisher says he knows better than to blindly trust GFL. “I think GFL wants to do things for the community—not just because they want to, but because the laws have been changed and they don’t have too much choice,” he said.

The Agreement at a Glance

Williams, who was one of the network’s founding board members and formally joined the staff in November 2024, has been working to ensure GFL lives up to its commitments. According to him, the agreement requires GFL to take action to curb pollution and provide economic and health support for residents. “We used the environmental laws we had access to to bring some relief to the residents of Snow Hill,” Williams said.

The agreement does this by requiring GFL to stop discharging PFAS into nearby surface waters and enacting strict limits and monitoring to ensure that discharges meet Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards. The company also must get state approval to temporarily treat contaminated water discharged from two landfill points. During the first two months, GFL was supposed to remove at least 50% of five key forever chemicals; within three months to a year, it must remove 80%; and after one year, the treated water must meet the EPA’s official drinking water limits for those chemicals.

Additionally, the agreement requires GFL to remove PFAS from its leachate, or the water contaminated when filtered through the facility’s waste, a historical first for North Carolina landfills. The landfill is also required to expand its air quality tracking by deploying methane-sensing drones and hiring an outside consultant to design a continuous monitoring system.

To date, GFL has submitted applications to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality requesting permits to remove the vast majority of PFAS in its wastewater. On September 24, the state responded by issuing a public notice requiring the installation of a groundwater remediation system to reduce PFAS discharge levels by 90%. The order took effect on November 15.

The facility has also begun installing a perimeter odor management system to collect data that the public can use to better understand what’s being emitted in real time. GFL launched a complaint hotline and website where residents can report offensive odors, truck spills, reckless trash truck driving, or any other problem causing harm or nuisance from the facility. GFL must respond to complaints within seven business days and meaningfully address them within 14 business days.

Guarded Optimism

There are signs of progress as the agreement approaches its one-year mark. A public-facing dashboard to monitor odor surrounding the facility went live in November. In addition to the updated pollution monitoring procedures, the landfill has established 10 recycling programs and agreed to implement water filtration systems across the Sampson County School District.

Jamie King, superintendent of the Sampson County School District, said GFL initially approached him about supporting a recycling program at all Sampson County schools, one of the original terms of the settlement agreement. GFL representatives also suggested a composting system, but King told them he didn’t see the purpose.

As a regular attendee of county commission meetings, King was familiar with residents’ concerns about potential water contamination near the Sampson County Landfill. He believed new water filtration systems would provide a far greater benefit for students. “I came across water filtration systems for that area of the county and asked if it was something [GFL] would consider for students,” King said.

Although routine testing had not detected pollutants in the district’s water systems, King said the new filtration systems, currently installed only in Lakewood High School with plans for expansion districtwide if funding allows, provide added assurance for students and staff while serving as a critical environmental education tool on local water quality.

Born from this community agreement will be a new nonprofit organization, the Snow Hill 501(c)(3), whose primary function will be to administer community development projects funded through this community agreement. The agreement requires GFL to establish a community-controlled fund, the Snow Hill Community Fund, to support Snow Hill revitalization efforts and a regular public meeting cadence for consistent updates and feedback.

“This component of the settlement will be what the people of Snow Hill make it, and I am heartened to see the community coming together to start the process,” wrote Hutt.

According to Hutt, the community and GFL have begun the joint process of selecting a site for a new community center and allocating the first round of Community Fund grants.

However, the company has missed key deadlines for property acquisition for the community center, and no architectural plans are available for broader community input. Williams attributes the delay to factors beyond GFL’s and the community’s control.

“I know a lot of the residents were generally concerned that GFL was refusing to be compliant. But it’s actually a question of finding someone in an area with suitable land that they want to sell,” Williams said.

GFL and the lawyers representing the community are currently in negotiations to extend the deadline for land acquisition given the lack of available land. There’s also concern about the cost of remediation and the quality of a center that’s located on polluted land. “This is a landfill, so you’re talking everything from possible contamination to diesel spills from all the trucks. There’s some mess there that just may be cost prohibitive.”

Parker says the community meetings held to date haven’t allowed for accountability, with representatives arriving unprepared to present and providing minimal tangible updates. Although GFL established a complaint system, all responses from the landfill have been limited to explanations of the problem or the odor’s cause; community members say there have been no escalations or meaningful steps to address complaints.

Combined with still-unbearable odors and industrial dump trucks that speed through the neighborhood at the expense of residents’ and children’s safety, many in the community remain skeptical that this agreement will bring change.

“The phrase we keep hearing is, ‘We’re working in good faith,’ but there’s no documentation, no proof,” Parker said. “A year later, we’re still waiting.”

Now in his 40s, Parker has lived in the Snow Hill neighborhood his entire life. While he doesn’t remember a time before the landfill dominated his family’s ancestral land, he does recall when the acrid stench and unending parade of garbage trucks didn’t define daily life in his community.

“We went from thriving and living in technicolor to existing in black and white,” Parker said.

As a child, Parker remembers helping his mother till her garden for their daily produce and riding ATVs through the woods. But he says fresh food and outdoor play were quickly replaced by burning eyes, sore throats, and restless nights that could only be soothed by the constant hum of fans and a rotating collection of air fresheners.

It wasn’t long before daily discomfort turned into health problems; many residents, Parker included, link the landfill to pervasive respiratory illness, cancer, and kidney disease among Snow Hill residents. “Middle school was when we started seeing family with bone cancer, asthma, lung disease,” he recalled. In 2021, Parker’s parents died after years of battling unexplained illnesses.

Williams said Fisher and Parker are not the first nor will they be the last to raise concerns about the agreement, noting that some would have preferred a more aggressive legal approach against GFL in pursuit of reparations for the decades of hardship the community has endured.

“The existing environmental laws and regulations are not really designed to compensate the people that have been harmed. If they want a more aggressive approach, or they’re seeking financial damages … they would need to find outside attorneys that specialize in those types of lawsuits,” Williams said. “There was definitely anger … and even some mistrust, and that’s perfectly understandable and valid.”

After nearly three decades fighting landfill expansion, Fisher continues to attend public meetings convened under the cooperative agreement.

Fisher says he feels especially compelled to stay tuned in to ensure that the money allocated for community use is appropriately spent. “One of my biggest concerns is making sure nobody is doing anything to advance themselves,” he said. “The agreement is for the people.”

Fisher remains hopeful that if this agreement leads to lasting change, his children might return home.

“I feel tied to the property itself and would love to stay around here, pass it on to my children,” he said.

The National Security Strategy (NSS) of the United States, released on December 4, 2025, by the Trump administration, outlines a fundamental reorientation of U.S. foreign policy centered on an “America First” doctrine.

The 33-page document replaces the previous administration’s focus on global competition between democracies and autocracies with a highly transactional approach prioritizing core national interests: homeland security, domestic economic strength, and unilateral action.

Here is a summary of the strategy’s core priorities and shifts:

1. Core Strategic Priorities

Elevating the Western Hemisphere: The strategy declares the Western Hemisphere as the United States’ top priority. It calls for asserting and enforcing a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the region, focusing on securing the border, controlling illegal migration, and using lethal force to combat drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations.

Economic Reindustrialization: Economic security is defined as national security. The NSS pushes for an aggressive reindustrialization effort, tax cuts, deregulation, and “energy unleashing” to bolster the domestic industrial and manufacturing base, secure supply chains, and protect against predatory trade practices and grand-scale intellectual property theft.

A New Military Focus: The strategy emphasizes building the world’s most powerful military, including a robust nuclear deterrent and next-generation missile defenses dubbed the “Golden Dome.”

2. Realigned Global Posture

Europe and NATO (Burden-Shifting): The document marks a sharp departure from traditional alliances, explicitly tying U.S. support for NATO to a massive increase in defense spending and burden-sharing by European allies. It contains highly critical language, warning of “civilizational erasure” in Europe due to migration and stating the U.S. will focus on “cultivating resistance” to Europe’s current trajectory.

China and the Indo-Pacific: While China remains a key competitor, the strategy redirects focus away from the previous administration’s view of it as the “primary threat.” It calls for containing China’s global ambitions and addressing issues like IP theft and supply chain vulnerabilities. A priority remains deterring conflict over Taiwan by maintaining military overmatch in the First Island Chain and pushing allies like Japan and South Korea to step up their defense investments.

Russia: The document is restrained in its treatment of Russia compared to the previous NSS. It largely positions the U.S. as an arbiter, stating that the U.S. will prioritize “managing European relations with Russia” to mitigate the risk of conflict between Russia and European states.

Middle East: The strategy significantly downgrades the Middle East, stating that the historic reason for U.S. focus (energy reserves) is obsolete due to U.S. energy self-sufficiency. It advocates for accepting the region and its leaders “as they are,” reducing long-term commitments.

Rivian Percoco downgraded Rivian from Equalweight to Underweight with a price target of $12.00 — implying a downside of 33.1% based on the Friday’s closing price.

“However, high expectations on the latter have brought the stock closer to fair valuation.” The new price target implies 6% downside from current levels.
Lucid Percoco downgraded Lucid from Equalweight to Underweight with a price target of $10.00, down sharply from $30.00.","Shares of Lucid and Rivian fell more than 3% in early Monday trading after Morgan Stanley cut its price targets and ratings on both electric vehicle makers.

The investment bank — which also downgraded Tesla but raised its price target — cited concerns over slowing EV adoption and the loss of federal tax credits.

Morgan Stanley’s auto research coverage is now led by analyst Andrew Percoco, who took over from Adam Jonas.

Jonas said last August he would switch roles within the firm to focus on physical and embodied artificial intelligence (AI), including autonomous vehicles, electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, space and humanoid robots.

Rivian

Percoco downgraded Rivian from Equalweight to Underweight with a price target of $12.00 — implying a downside of 33.1% based on the Friday’s closing price.

The analyst said the company faces significant challenges as it prepares to launch its mid-sized SUV R2 into a difficult market environment.

The $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired on the last day of September, removing a key purchase incentive for consumers.

“Rivian faces outsized risk heading into 2026 as it launches its lower-priced R2 into a challenging EV market, where slowing adoption, loss of the $7,500 tax credit, and persistent consumer concerns (range anxiety, charging infrastructure, residual values, battery tech, affordability) create headwinds that a mass-market vehicle may struggle to overcome in the near-term,” Percoco wrote.

While the R2 expands the EV maker’s addressable market, the analyst warned of additional pressures on Rivian‘s existing lineup.

“We believe the company will also face residual-value pressure from R1 lease returns and potential demand cannibalization,” he added.

The company founded and led by RJ Scaringe says it will have annual production capacity for more than 150,000 R2 vehicles once ramped up, with an R2 completed on average every two minutes.

Percoco acknowledged Rivian‘s strengths but noted competition from Tesla‘s autonomous driving technology remains a concern.

“Rivian‘s strong design and performance help, but Tesla‘s rapidly advancing FSD will require greater conviction in Rivian‘s AV capabilities,” he wrote, adding that investors should “expect more details at Rivian‘s upcoming AI day on December 11th.”

Over the last few weeks, Tesla has been accelerating the rollout of new FSD (Supervised) versions in the US while starting test rides in several key European markets.

Looking at Rivian‘s financial outlook, Percoco forecasts that auto gross margins excluding credits will remain relatively stable in 2026 as R2 scaling reduces bill-of-materials costs, with software and services contributing incremental high-margin revenue.

The analyst projected a $2.9 billion adjusted EBIT loss for the year.

After approximately $300 million of working capital needs and $1.6 billion of capital expenditures, Percoco expects Rivian to burn $4.2 billion of free cash flow, though he noted the company should receive its next tranche of capital from Volkswagen upon completion of winter testing in the first quarter of 2026.

Rivian ranked first for the third consecutive year in Consumer Reports’ Owner Satisfaction ratings, which evaluates vehicles based on performance, comfort and usability.

According to the survey, 85% of Rivian owners would buy the company’s vehicles again, the highest score among the 26 automakers evaluated.

BMW ranked second with a 71% rate, while Tesla followed closely in fourth place with 69%.

Tesla

Percoco downgraded Tesla from Overweight to Equalweight with a price target of $425.00, up from $410.00.

Tesla shares closed at $455 on Friday and are up 12.7% year to date.

The stock reached its 2025 high at $474 in early November, just $14 below the all-time high of $488.54 registered exactly a year ago.

Following the Morgan Stanley note, shares traded 1.2% lower in Monday’s pre-market session.

Aside from the note, Chief Executive Elon Musk escalated over the weekend political tensions, urging to “Dissolve the EU and return power to the people.”

Morgan Stanley’s analyst said Tesla deserves a premium valuation given its leadership position across multiple sectors but noted the stock has moved closer to fair value.

“Tesla is a clear global leader in electric vehicles, manufacturing, renewable energy, and real world AI and thus deserving of a premium valuation,” Percoco wrote. “However, high expectations on the latter have brought the stock closer to fair valuation.”

The new price target implies 6% downside from current levels.

While acknowledging that Tesla is more than an auto manufacturer, Percoco cautioned investors to expect volatility ahead.

“We expect a choppy trading environment for the TSLA shares over the next 12 months, as we see downside to estimates, while the catalysts for its non-auto businesses appear priced at current levels, driving our EW rating,” he wrote.

The analyst said Morgan Stanley conducted a comprehensive review of its Tesla model, adding humanoid robot valuation supported by the firm’s Global Humanoid team’s total addressable market analysis, expanding its robotaxi model with proprietary market research, broadening its Network Services model including Full Self-Driving, and moderating its Auto and Energy forecasts.

Lucid

Percoco downgraded Lucid from Equalweight to Underweight with a price target of $10.00, down sharply from $30.00.

The new target is equivalent to $1.00 when adjusted for the 1-for-10 reverse stock split that became effective in September.

Based on Lucid‘s closing price last Friday, the revised target implies downside of 25.5% and would represent a new all-time low for the California-based EV maker.

The analyst said Lucid‘s premium positioning offers some protection against near-term volatility from the expiration of federal EV tax credits compared to mass-market competitors.

“Lucid‘s premium positioning and higher ASPs help buffer near-term volatility from the loss of EV tax credits relative to other mass-market EV OEMs,” Percoco wrote.

He highlighted the company’s industry-leading battery efficiency, which led to a technology-licensing agreement with Aston Martin, but said long-term success depends on executing its expansion into more affordable vehicles.

“Its path to profitability hinges on successfully scaling its more affordable midsize platform,” the analyst wrote, noting start of production is expected in late 2026 with production ramping in 2027.

Percoco does not forecast Lucid reaching gross profitability until 2028. While operating expenses are expected to remain stable and EBIT losses per vehicle should improve from $216,000 in 2025 to $126,000 in 2026, he projects losses will persist until 2031.

The analyst also flagged significant dilution risk for shareholders, estimating the company will need to raise approximately $2 billion in equity by the second half of 2026 relative to its $4.6 billion market cap.

The bearish outlook contrasts with recent comments from Lucid management.

Chief Financial Officer Taoufiq Boussaid said last week in a fireside chat that the company will register a new sales record in the fourth quarter as new orders trend as expected.

Asked about the usual stronger quarter in the final months of each year, Boussaid said: “There is definitely some seasonality. So we tend to compare versus last year, obviously, versus previous quarter. So as it trends now, I mean, we will see quarter-over-quarter growth.”

The CFO did not provide specific sales or production targets for the quarter, nor did he reference the company’s 18,000-unit annual production guidance.

Meeting that target would require approximately 8,034 units in the fourth quarter — more than double the third quarter’s 3,891 units — based on the 9,966 vehicles produced in the first three quarters.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rivian_R3X_Ext_01.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 07:00:37.281298

The action is a major step on the road to a broad permitting compromise that members of both parties want to pass this Congress. But deep divisions persist between and within parties.

House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-W.Va.), for example, has been looking to secure support for the “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” H.R. 4776, which would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act. It’s scheduled to reach the floor next week.

Many Democrats say it would go too far in cutting oversight of polluters and public participation. Far-right conservatives are now saying it would continue federal incentives for renewable energy.

Bills on the floor agenda this week are likely to pass easily. Some are even expected to advance with broad bipartisan backing under a process called suspension of the rules.

One sweeping measure, H.R. 3898, the “Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today (PERMIT) Act,” cobbles together several Republican bills to facilitate Clean Water Act reviews.

The bill would limit state authority to block projects like pipelines, would add limits for environmental suits and would restrict EPA’s ability to veto Army Corps of Engineers permits.

The package has the backing of major trade groups. Environmentalists and most Democrats, on the other hand, argue the legislation would tie the hands of EPA and state regulators.

Also on deck this week, H.R. 3668, from Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), would amend the Natural Gas Act to empower the Federal Regulatory Agency Commission to accelerate pipeline reviews.

On the suspension calendar are: H.R. 4503, the “ePermit Act,” which would better digitize the permit process, and H.R. 573, the “Studying NEPA’s Impact on Projects Act,” which would direct the Council on Environmental Quality to publish an annual report.

NEPA bill drama

This week’s legislation includes key Republican demands in the broader permitting discussions. A bipartisan trade-off, in theory, could include a mix of faster reviews, litigation limits, permitting certainty for specific renewable projects, a transmission build-out and perks for mining.

Republicans have succeeded in rolling back NEPA’s reach on Capitol Hill and in the Supreme Court. But they want more. Democrats, for their part, are focused on promoting renewable energy, making sure that green generation can reach population centers and stopping President Donald Trump from attacking projects.

Westerman, trying to corral both sides, is running into trouble with House Freedom Caucus members who say his bill would give Democrats too much. They find a bipartisan committee amendment on permit certainty particularly egregious.

“The last thing we need to do with offshore wind is to tie the administration’s hands in stopping that ridiculously expensive source of energy that enriches foreign companies with American taxpayer dollars,” said Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) last week. “Unfortunately, that’s exactly what the ‘SPEED Act’ would do.”

Last week, Westerman went on the Newt Gingrich’s podcast to talk about the need for NEPA reform, echoing an argument that has been blaring from the White House: affordability.

“There’s probably not any one issue that effects every American more than NEPA other than tax policy,” he said, pointing to its impact on ports, airports, pipelines and the grid. “Some way or another the NEPA process effects all Americans,” he said.

Tom Pyle, president of the conservative American Energy Alliance, said the measure “shouldn’t be controversial since it is seeking to get NEPA back to its original intent.”

But he argued it should not be used as a bargaining chip for socializing the cost of transmission. “That would be a lopsided trade,” he said. “We would need way more than that.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/31/e8/d4341b0a4a118a9e48e27a6f1744/u-s-congress-78047.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 08:01:19.457063

Our Great Lakes are not a bargaining chip.
Upholding the law to protect them isn’t a threat to our prosperity, it is its very source.","We are told we face a difficult choice: protect our water or secure our energy. This is a false narrative, manufactured by a foreign corporation and its allies to disguise their illegal occupation of our Great Lakes. The real choice before us, and the urgent duty before our state officials, is between upholding the law or capitulating to corporate power.

My remarks are directed to those in Lansing with the power to act.

An orderly, planned shutdown of Line 5 is not a concession; it is an affirmation. It is how we uphold the laws that protect the Public Trust Doctrine enshrined in our state constitution. It is how we defend state sovereignty by enforcing our Governor’s valid revocation of an easement that a corporation continues to violate with impunity. It is how we honor Tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, respecting the original stewards of these waters whose survival and culture are non-negotiable.

Critically, moving forward with a shutdown is how we boost jobs and domestic energy security. Since the Snyder administration, studies have confirmed that alternatives exist, but corporate greed has blinded our decision makers. Shutting Line 5 means investing in Michigan labor to build and maintain modern, safer energy infrastructure, not relying on a 70-year-old line in the heart of our Straits to send Canadian oil to foreign markets. True energy independence is built on innovation and resilience, not on doubling down on a risky, outdated conduit.

Yet, we are trapped in a cycle of unreasonable court delays, a strategy employed by Enbridge to run out the clock and amplify their threats to our communities. Every day our state wavers in its political will to enforce its own laws is a day we normalize this illegality.

This moment sets a national precedent. If Michigan, surrounded by the world’s greatest freshwater system, cannot summon the courage to prioritize the Great Lakes over a Canadian oil giant’s profits, what state can? We are signaling to every corporation that they can defy environmental orders, manipulate legal systems, and place their infrastructure above the public interest. As a wave of data centers enters the chat, Enbridge is paving their way for lawlessness. We are telling our citizens and Tribal nations that their rights are secondary to corporate convenience.

We do not need more grandstanding. We need the bold leadership that was promised when the shutdown was ordered. We need leaders who see that enforcing the law is the pro-jobs, pro-sovereignty, and pro-American energy path.

The call is clear. Use every tool of State government to end this illegal occupation and manage a transition that protects our water and our workers. Demonstrate to the nation that when the health of the Great Lakes and the rule of law are at stake, Michigan will lead.

Our Great Lakes are not a bargaining chip. They are the foundation of our identity, economy, and future. Upholding the law to protect them isn’t a threat to our prosperity, it is its very source.

The political will to act now is the only leadership worthy of this moment and this magnificent trust.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dsc_0486-1024x6831765191816.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=ELY9iUS4,N,,2025-12-08 07:01:38.695449

While unconfirmed, various media reports suggest that the battery supply now under negotiation is intended for Mercedes’ mid-range and entry-level electric vehicles.
Korean media, however, reported that the contract was based on 46-series cylindrical cells, which are to be supplied from 2028 onwards.
Here, too, media reports identified the 46-series cylindrical cells as the subject of the contract.
Since the newly announced deal spans similar timeframes as the two aforementioned contracts, it seems logical that Mercedes has not ordered 46-series cylindrical cells again—though this is not yet certain.","Several Korean media outlets report, citing a regulatory filing from LG Energy Solution (LGES), that the new contract provides for the supply of LG batteries to Mercedes-Benz in North America and Europe over a period of seven years, from 1 March 2028 to 30 June 2035. However, LGES stated in its filing that the contract value and duration may still change, and no further details are currently available. For now, it remains unclear whether only battery cells or complete battery packs will be supplied.

The contract value of two trillion won, as reported by Pulse, the English-language edition of Maeil Business News Korea, represents around eight per cent of LGES’s revenue in the previous year. At that time, the company generated 25.62 trillion won. While unconfirmed, various media reports suggest that the battery supply now under negotiation is intended for Mercedes’ mid-range and entry-level electric vehicles. “Considering that the three major supply deals between the companies over the past two years were believed to involve cylindrical 46-series batteries for high-performance, high-end models, analysts view this new deal as targeted toward mid-priced vehicles,” the newspaper report states. No further details—such as form factor or cell chemistries—have been disclosed.

One thing is clear: the ties between both parties are strengthening. As early as October 2024, LG Energy Solution signed a contract with Mercedes-Benz for 50.5 GWh of batteries. Details remained scarce at the time, and it was unclear whether only cells or ready-to-install battery packs would be delivered. Korean media, however, reported that the contract was based on 46-series cylindrical cells, which are to be supplied from 2028 onwards. This September, another major deal covering 107 GWh was announced (75 GWh for delivery to the USA between mid-2029 and the end of 2037; 32 GWh for Europe between mid-2028 and the end of 2035). Here, too, media reports identified the 46-series cylindrical cells as the subject of the contract. If all details are confirmed, the total volume of the two contracts amounts to nearly 160 GWh of large cylindrical cells. Since the newly announced deal spans similar timeframes as the two aforementioned contracts, it seems logical that Mercedes has not ordered 46-series cylindrical cells again—though this is not yet certain.

Incidentally, according to further information from Korean portals, the September contract was only awarded after intense competition with Chinese battery manufacturers such as CATL and Farasis. Both companies, along with LGES, are already regular battery suppliers to the Stuttgart-based automaker. While Mercedes is also involved in a battery manufacturing joint venture, namely ACC, its demand far exceeds the planned output of ACC. This is particularly true as plans for two of the three ACC plants are currently on hold, and the proposed factory in Italy is reportedly on the verge of being scrapped.

Mercedes CEO Ola Källenius is therefore seeking stability in supplier relations: in mid-November, Källenius met with representatives of the LG Group in Seoul to discuss future collaboration in the mobility sector. The Mercedes top executive subsequently stated that Mercedes-Benz and LG share a common vision based on innovation, quality, and sustainability—and that they are working together to set new standards in the global automotive industry.

The bipartisan state law that created the program doesn’t mandate that HUB-certified businesses are granted state contracts, but sets goals that state agencies are encouraged to meet.
West disputed Hancock’s ability to alter the HUB program in such a significant way without the approval of the Legislature.
She credited the HUB program with her success winning government contracts soon after starting her business in 2016 and said she believes the Comptroller’s decision will cause her business to lose money.
Many companies use their HUB certification as a marketing tool, but now they will have to find other ways to attract customers, she said.","Julie Irvin Hartman started her Tuesday with welcome, but confusing news.

The application she had submitted weeks ago to renew her business’s certification as a Historically Underutilized Business had been approved, despite acting state Comptroller Kelly Hancock’s late October announcement that he was freezing the program intended to give businesses owned by women, minorities and disabled veterans a boost when seeking state government contracts.

But hours later, the comptroller’s office emailed Hartman again, notifying her and more than 15,000 other small businesses — nearly 97% of the certified HUB businesses in Texas — that they were being removed from the HUB program entirely.

Then her phone notifications exploded.

The owner of Tomball-based B2G Victory, Hartman has built her business around advising other small businesses about how to navigate the world of government contracting, making her the first call for many of her confused clients who also received the comptroller’s email.

“I’m the expert in this space and I’m charging expert fees, and telling people, ‘I don’t know,” Hartman said. “So what value am I providing? It’s tough right now … I’ve had a lot of sleepless nights.”

Hartman and thousands of other HUB-certified businesses have faced uncertainty since Hancock first announced the freeze of the decades-old program, arguing that it may run afoul of both the state and U.S. constitutions, without pointing to any specific violation. No state or federal judge has ruled the program unconstitutional.

The program launched in the 1990s and is administered by the Comptroller’s office, which certifies HUB businesses that can show a majority of their ownership is “economically disadvantaged” people — including women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Americans and service-disabled veterans.

The bipartisan state law that created the program doesn’t mandate that HUB-certified businesses are granted state contracts, but sets goals that state agencies are encouraged to meet.

Hancock said it was necessary to freeze and review the program to ensure it complies with Gov. Greg Abbott’s January executive order banning programs that promote “diversity, equity and inclusion” from state agencies. Then the Comptroller’s office announced Tuesday that the HUB program will now only be available to small businesses controlled by veterans with a 20% percent or higher service-connected disability.

That decision excludes the vast majority of the previously HUB-certified businesses while maintaining the status quo for 485 disabled veteran-owned businesses, according to a May comptroller’s report. All 485 are owned by men, according to the report.

“Our nation’s veterans have always stepped up for us,” Hancock wrote in a statement Tuesday. “VetHUB is Texas’ way of stepping up for them — cutting red tape, restoring constitutional integrity and opening doors for the men and women who wore our nation’s uniform. These emergency rules ensure Texas’ state contracting is free from gender or race discrimination and keep the program centered on those who earned this support through their service.”

A frequently asked questions page on the Comptroller’s website assured HUB businesses with current government contracts that those agreements would be honored for the duration of the contract.

Garry Olson, owner of Austin-based IT solutions company Semper Feye Solutions and a service-disabled veteran, had spent weeks fretting over the possibility of losing his ongoing state contracts if the HUB freeze did not end before his certification expires in February.

“I have heard that there were issues with the program before, but I’ve never had any problems with it,” Olson said. “I was thankful to be a part of it, and I’m thankful to still be a part of it.”

Efforts to kill HUB program failed in Legislature

State Sen. Royce West, a Dallas Democrat who co-authored the 1999 bill that created the HUB program, said it’s a necessary tool to correct historical discrimination in government contracting.

“Black businesses, Hispanic businesses, women-owned businesses, all the other categories in the HUB statute were not able to have meaningful participation for procurement opportunities with the state,” West said. “Recognizing quotas would be illegal, we put together a good faith program to look at whether or not agencies are making good faith efforts to bring in those categories that have been historically discriminated against.”

Several Republican bills aimed at killing the HUB program entirely were filed earlier this year in the Legislature. They all died without making progress in either chamber.

West disputed Hancock’s ability to alter the HUB program in such a significant way without the approval of the Legislature.

“If we allow an officer not associated with the legislative body that passed the law signed by the governor to do this to this program, what else will they attempt to do that is outside the scope of their statutory authority?” West said.

Companies scrambling to adjust without HUB

Kate Kossack’s staffing agency, Cedar Park-based HireOps Staffing, was HUB-certified as a woman-owned business and is a subcontractor on a state contract in the health care field. She credited the HUB program with her success winning government contracts soon after starting her business in 2016 and said she believes the Comptroller’s decision will cause her business to lose money.

“In staffing, it’s hard to compete with bigger firms … Not having restrictions from the state will open the door to let (larger companies) do absolutely whatever they want,” Kossack said. “We could just be left in the dust.”

Helen Callier, who owns Kingwood-based BradLink LLC, a HUB-certified architectural design and project management firm, said she knows she will still be able to find work despite losing her HUB status, but her company will have to make changes. Many companies use their HUB certification as a marketing tool, but now they will have to find other ways to attract customers, she said.

“I know some folks that are sweating because they see their certification as the only means of doing business at the state level,” Callier said. “The bottom line is that’s not the case, but you have to suit up and go after it now.”

Hartman, the government contracting adviser, said losing her HUB status is unlikely to put her out of business, but she saw her revenue drop after the Comptroller’s office froze the program.

Hartman’s company is paid by procurement offices and chambers of commerce to host seminars explaining the certification process to other small businesses, and she said many of them have been canceled since the freeze began. Clients have hesitated to renew their contracts with her company after the freeze began, she added, and the company stands to lose as much as 25% of its annual revenue this year alone.

As she fields calls from confused clients and works to interpret the latest guidance from the Comptroller, Hartman has spent the past week driving back and forth between the Houston area and Austin as she moves her father into hospice care.

“I’m having to make a decision between what’s right for my industry, what’s right for my company, what’s right for my clients and what’s right for me as a daughter being there for my family,” Hartman said. “I’ve been an entrepreneur for 23 years … this has been the hardest year.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251204-Julie-Irvin-Hartman-HUB-LS-07.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 07:01:16.507030

For us at Rolec and other businesses in the marina sector, it is a mindset and an ongoing commitment that combines ethical responsibility with practical business sense. Done properly, it is about anchoring changes that last and not simply ticking boxes.

‍We all know that the marina sector is closely tied to nature. Coastal and inland waters are delicate ecosystems and those who manage, operate and develop marinas cannot ignore their duty to protect and preserve. Visitors increasingly expect clean energy, waste reduction and sustainable infrastructure and not as optional extras. The challenge is not whether we can afford to act, but whether we can afford not to.

A longstanding commitment

The most responsible companies were already taking steps that aligned with environmental stewardship long before “sustainability” became a boardroom talking point. At the time, many of these decisions weren’t branded as such, we simply viewed them as good practice.

For example, using local supply chains reduced unnecessary transport miles and supported regional economies. Engineering products for durability meant fewer replacements, lower material usage and extended product life cycles. Minimising waste was about efficiency and diligence. On Rolec’s part, these principles were quietly embedded into the company’s operations long before they became part of environmental, social and governance (ESG) checklists.

At its core, sustainability has always been about consciously building for the future. Decisions made in design, sourcing and manufacturing directly affect customers, industry and future generations. ISO 14001 certification - as we achieved in 2015 - can formalise our environmental management systems and give structure to future sustainability initiatives.

The strength of manufacturing control

The strength of manufacturing contro

As UK manufacturers, Rolec maintains full control over the build and development of our core product range. This visibility across the entire life cycle - from concept to creation, delivery and ongoing maintenance - gives us opportunities to implement positive innovations at every stage.

For example, by upgrading our solar array and reducing our consumption of heating oil across the site, we achieved an estimated annual CO₂ saving of 76,410kg. Battery storage can also capture excess solar energy to power factories and charge electric vehicles without drawing from the grid. These steps not only reduce emissions but also improve energy resilience, something that many marinas are equally striving to achieve as energy prices fluctuate and sustainability targets tighten.

Reducing the size of packaging is another simple way that companies can become more sustainable. After we reduced the size of our packaging, we could ship 50 percent more products per pallet, which has cut transport-related emissions by 33 percent and lowered logistical costs. This benefits both our operations and operators who are conscious of supply chain impact. At the same time, we ensured all materials used in preparing products for shipping are certified by the UK’s Forest Stewardship Council and 100 percent recyclable. A switch to water-based inks further reduced our carbon footprint by nearly 40 percent. These measures may sound incremental, but collectively they demonstrate how small, thoughtful decisions build towards meaningful results.

Closing the loop

Waste is another area where continuous improvement can deliver change for sustainability-conscious companies across the marina industry. Not only should manufacturing refuse be diverted to recycling facilities, but any remaining waste can be converted into solid recovered fuel (SRF) to avoid sending things to landfill. At Rolec, at the time of writing, 70 percent of our manufacturing refuse is diverted to recycling facilities, and the remaining 30 percent of waste material is converted into SRF.

This approach reduces environmental burden while supporting a circular economy, meaning one where raw materials are continuously repurposed. For the marina sector, the concept of circularity has particular resonance. Marinas generate waste ranging from packaging and plastics to maintenance residues, and every site has a role to play in ensuring these materials are handled with care throughout multiple life cycles.

ESG beyond compliance

Today, ESG factors dominate the conversation around a green future. But the real test is ensuring that these commitments go beyond compliance. ESG for show does nothing to serve the long-term interests of businesses, communities or natural environments.For marinas, ESG must be genuine and measurable. Coastal protection, biodiversity, energy efficiency and the experience of berth holders all intersect in ways that cannot be managed through surface-level initiatives. Customers are discerning and regulators are watching.

The businesses that will thrive are those that view ESG not as a hurdle, but as an opportunity to enhance operations and work towards an ever more sustainable future.Our role as manufacturers is to align our processes and supply chains with these long-term goals. That means designing durable products, reducing emissions, managing waste ethically and providing infrastructure that helps marinas meet their own sustainability goals.

‍Looking ahead

‍No single company can claim to have “solved” sustainability. The nature of the challenge is that it demands constant progress, adaptation and shared responsibility. The real impact comes from working together, and collaborations across the industry can deliver holistic solutions that help marinas achieve better energy management, more effective solar initiatives, measured resource consumption and long-term strategic development.

As Rolec’s Commercial Director, Holly Brown, put it: “Sustainability in practice is about doing what’s right because we always have and because we always will.” That’s why sustainability efforts should not be a finite project, but instead an ongoing process. Each year brings new opportunities to reimagine, refine, reduce and renew no matter what the industry, and the marina sector is no different. The real measure is not in what one says, but in what one does.

Ottawa, Ontario--(ACN Newswire - December 8, 2025) - Focus Graphite Inc. (TSXV: FMS) (OTCQB: FCSMF) (FSE: FKC0) (""Focus"" or the ""Company""), a leading developer of high-grade flake graphite deposits and innovator of next-generation lithium-ion battery technology, is pleased to announce that it has moved from conditional approval to a fully executed, non-repayable contribution agreement (the ""Agreement"") with Natural Resources Canada (""NRCan"") for funding up to $14,062,500 under the Global Partnerships Initiative (""GPI"").

The Agreement formalizes the federal government's support for Focus Graphite's project titled: ""Transformation of Canadian Flake Graphite into Ultra-High Purity Battery & Advanced Materials Using Electrothermal Fluidized Bed Technology"" (the ""Project""). The Project unites Canadian, Ukrainian, and U.S. partners to produce ultra-high purity graphite for global battery, aerospace, defence, and advanced material markets.

The Agreement provides non-dilutive funding for the development, piloting, and commercial demonstration of Focus's clean electrothermal purification process, enabling conversion of Quebec sourced natural flake graphite into ultra-high purity anode and advanced materials products. The Project also advances broader NATO, G7, and European policy objectives for secure, diversified, and ESG aligned critical mineral supply chains.

Once complete, the demonstration system is expected to produce purified graphite at volumes sufficient not only for downstream qualification, but also scalable to supply meaningful quantities to defence, aerospace, energy storage, and advanced materials markets. This production capability represents a major step toward commercial readiness and supports the Company's downstream strategy by enabling Focus to deliver high purity material for evaluation and early market entry while continuing to advance its mining projects and longer-term processing infrastructure.

""Execution of this Agreement significantly strengthens Focus Graphite's ability to help supply our allies with secure, ESG aligned, high purity graphite,"" said Dean Hanisch, Chief Executive Officer. ""Chinese graphite is currently embedded throughout North American military, aerospace, and energy systems, creating strategic vulnerabilities across the entire allied value chain. The ability to produce ultra-high purity material domestically, and process it using a clean, chemical free purification method, positions Focus to directly support the shift toward reliable, non-Chinese sources of strategic critical minerals.""

""This Agreement unlocks our ability to move qualified graphite samples to international partners at a much faster pace, which is essential for advancing offtake discussions,"" said Jason Latkowcer, Vice President of Corporate Development. ""We will continue to advance our Lac Knife and Lac Tetepisca projects while simultaneously delivering the high-purity material that allied partners require to validate Canadian graphite within their defence, aerospace, energy storage, and advanced-materials supply chains.""

For years, North Carolina did this, taking a broad view on whether isolated and semi-dry wetlands deserved additional protections.
Thus if the proposed EPA rule becomes law, it would strip protections from North Carolina wetlands that previously had to meet more stringent state regulations.","Environmentalists worry the change could increase flooding risks and allow unsafe development in North Carolina.

Supporters of the new rule state it will provide clarity for landowners and reduce regulatory burdens.

North Carolina law now mirrors federal wetland protections, meaning the state will not offer more stringent regulations.

Following a trend that started in 2023 with a U.S. Supreme Court decision, it's been a rough few years for North Carolina's wetlands and their supporters.

Now an announcement by the Trump administration that it could further water down federal protections for certain types of wetlands has raised more red flags among environmentalists, emergency managers, and local officials. They are worried about what losing even more marsh areas could mean in a state that's shown itself to be vulnerable to flooding from heavy storm events like 2016's Hurricane Matthew and 2018's Hurricane Florence − weather events that are expected to increase in coming years and decades thanks to climate change.

Some officials also fear the removal of wetland protections will see development allowed in these historically ""wet"" areas, putting additional people and properties in harm's way.

""Wetlands are an important line of defense in North Carolina’s flood-prone communities,"" said Will McDow, associate vice president with Environmental Defense Fund, in a news release. ""With this ruling, we may see significant decline in healthy wetlands and watch developers build unsafe housing that either floods or increases flooding to neighbors.”

What's new?

Two years ago the Supreme Court released a decision that dramatically reduced the protections offered to wetlands under the federal Clean Water Act. The court said only wetlands that have a ""continuous surface connection"" that make it ""indistinguishable"" from a federally protected waterway should be protected by the law. That meant isolated wetlands or areas that are only ""wet"" during certain times of year could lose their protections.

Prior to the ruling, isolated wetlands and wetlands that are only wet for part of the year, like pocosin wetlands that are common in many areas of Eastern N.C., had been protected in many states, including North Carolina, through a broad interpretation of what constitutes a federally protected wetland.

While the Supreme Court said what the requirement for federal protections of wetlands should be, it didn't define what constitutes a surface connection or what makes one wetland indistinguishable from another.

On Nov. 17, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to float a new rule that ""would establish a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.""

What would be the impact of the proposed rule?

The EPA's proposed new definition would exclude wetlands that abut or touch streams that do not flow during dry periods. It also could exclude ephemeral streams and ponds, which sit dry for much of the year and only fill up only after rains. The National Resources Defense Council has estimated up to 55 million acres of wetlands nationwide could lose federal protections under the new language.

According to an EPA release, the proposal ""will cut red tape and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act.""

Lee Zedlin, head of the EPA, said the new rule would return control of private property back to landowners and out of the hands of bureaucrats and regulators.

""We heard from Americans across the country who want clean water and a clear rule,"" he said. ""No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.""

For years, farmers and developers have claimed the environmental community has overstated the economic, wildlife, water quality, and flood-control benefits of isolated and ""pocket"" wetlands that aren't part of larger natural systems.

They also said the old interpretation of which wetlands, like manmade drainage ditches, should receive federal protection made life difficult for farmers and limited what property owners could do with their land, hampering economic development opportunities in many communities.

What about flooding?

But environmentalists and others say stripping protections from many inland wetlands will worsen an already worrisome situation.

They say North Carolina has millions of acres of isolated and semi-dry wetlands that will see their protections watered down According to the Southern Environmental Law Center, that includes an estimated 527,000 acres of wetlands in the Cape Fear River watershed. But that number could increase even more if the EPA's narrow interpretation of what wetlands deserve protection becomes law.

From an environmental point of view, scientists say non-tidal wetlands are among Mother Nature's most valuable natural resources. They act like sponges, absorbing floodwaters and allowing the water to seep back into the ground, recharging groundwater supplies and eventually deep aquifers. Wetlands also provide vital habitat for a wide swathe of flora and fauna species.

Because they slow down water flows, wetlands also are very effective in removing contaminants. They also help store carbon in their soils, something that's seen as increasingly important as the world continues to pump more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change.

“Water moves in ways we can’t always see, and wetlands that look isolated can still be connected to other bodies of water,"" said Dr. Stacy Woods, a research director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, in a release. ""The revised definition will leave these wetlands at risk of further degradation, which could harm the rivers and streams that people in the United States depend on daily for clean water.""

Opponents of the pared-down definition of wetlands said there's also an economic component involved in the EPA's proposal.

McDow with Environmental Defense Fund said the U.S. already spends billions annually responding to disasters created by allowing development in risky areas. This new proposal could see that figure increase exponentially.

Weren't N.C.'s semi-dry and isolated wetlands previously protected?

While federal rules are the minimum requirements, states have the option of adopting additional protections and requirements, something California often does with its environmental regulations.

For years, North Carolina did this, taking a broad view on whether isolated and semi-dry wetlands deserved additional protections.

But the N.C. Farm Act of 2023 limits state protections of “wetlands” to essentially those enshrined in the federal Clean Water Act, and thus now mirrors the watered-down federal protections. Thus if the proposed EPA rule becomes law, it would strip protections from North Carolina wetlands that previously had to meet more stringent state regulations.

After a public comment period and some public hearings, the proposed EPA rule could become law early next year.

When 95% of climate scientists confirm climate change is real, our planet is warming, it seems there would be wisdom in taking the side of caution.","NREL has a rhythmic resonance that won’t be matched by NLR, Colorado’s newly christened National Laboratory of the Rockies. Nearly lost to memory is how the National Renewable Energy Laboratory authorized by President George H. W. Bush in 1991 was preceded by the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI), which opened in 1977 on the mesa east of Golden. It was Chris Wright, a Colorado oil-and-gas fracking mogul appointed as the Secretary of Energy by the Trump White House, who announced this most recent name change. Originally created in the wake of the Arab oil embargo of 1973, NREL’s research focus has been development of ever more efficient energy alternatives to fossil fuels. Nearly every president during the past 35 years has made at least one visit to this premiere sustainable energy research facility.

It’s apparent more than a name change is now in store for the laboratory. DOE’s announcement explains, “The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL. We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources.” It seems likely this means much of the lab’s current work enabling a sustainable energy future will be mothballed in favor of “clean coal” and petroleum technologies reflecting… the Trump administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research.” This policy trajectory from pioneering the search for an environmentally sound energy strategy to a “burn it while you have it” philosophy represents a Republican about-face over the past half-century, both nationally and here in Colorado. It was President Richard Nixon and congressional Republicans who created the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, proudly pointing out the joint origin of the terms conservative and conservation. It was Ronald Reagan who observed, “Preservation of our environment is not a liberal or conservative challenge, it’s common sense.”

In 1979 both chambers of the Colorado legislature, which each enjoyed a two-thirds Republican majority, created the Colorado Energy Research Institute (CERI) located at the School of Mines in Golden. It was another legislative response to long lines statewide at gas pumps resulting from the Arab embargo and was initially focused on conservation measures, including social behavioral programs like carpooling. At the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency was focused primarily on pollution clean-ups following the 1969 fires on the surface of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio, and a decade later the Love Canal poisoning of domestic water supplies detected in 1980. At the same time, acid rain destruction of northeastern forests followed by the 1981 Montreal protocol to protect and restore the ozone holes over the poles enhanced the credibility of environmental regulation. This attention was abruptly reversed with the arrival of the Reagan administration and the appointment of another Coloradan, Anne Gorsuch (mother of Supreme Court Justice Neil), as the administrator of the EPA.

Gorsuch cut the agency’s budget by 20% and its staff by 25%. Rita Lavelle, her deputy, so mismanaged the superfund program she would later be sent to a federal prison. Resigning in 1983, Anne Gorsuch was replaced with the original EPA administrator appointed by Nixon in 1969, well-regarded former Republican Congressman Willam Ruckelshaus with a charge to restore environmental competency for the Reagan administration. Although there had been sporadic scientific indications since mid-century carbon dioxide build-up in the atmosphere was likely contributing to climate change and/or “global warming,” it wasn’t until the 1990s national attention turned to this economic and public health threat. Early in the decade, Colorado’s Republican legislators quietly shuttered CERI, although its remnants live on in comparable research efforts at CSU and the University of Colorado. The United Nations began to pay attention in the 1980s to climate issues, convening a periodic policy roundelay that has mostly sounded alarms with little concrete action.

As the public debate between environmental groups and the fossil fuel industry heated up, along with annual average temperatures, congressional Republicans began to migrate toward climate skepticism while Democrats placed renewable energy and sustainable policy as centerpieces of their political agenda. Nonetheless, it was George W. Bush’s administration when EPA identified carbon dioxide as a pollutant shortly after the turn of the 21st century. This designation was affirmed by the Supreme Court, although it is expected to be challenged again now that the Supreme Court has overturned its Chevron precedent. Stripping the EPA of the authority to regulate CO2 in our atmosphere would throw open the door to unlimited fossil-fuel emissions. With a president who labels climate change a hoax and a Democratic “con”, and his Department of Energy claiming, “Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs and help this country meet its energy demand. The National Laboratory of the Rockies will play a vital role in those efforts,” We can guess where national energy policy is headed.

I suspect a sizeable share of Republicans harbor doubts about this change in direction. At the same time, some Democrats have begun to question whether voters really care about climate change. That may be a misreading of polls where an overwhelming majority express their concern even if they don’t make it a priority. When 95% of climate scientists confirm climate change is real, our planet is warming, it seems there would be wisdom in taking the side of caution. Even if this prediction proves wrong, there seems to be both logic and prudence in pursuing sustainable energy technologies. NREL and its partners have already driven the cost of renewable energy generation substantially cheaper than fossil-fuel power.

Since 1973, the United States has become the world’s largest petro-carbon producer, so we no longer face the risk of fuel shortages from an embargo. Good for us, we’re now energy independent. My advice to the NLR staff is to save their NREL letterhead. It won’t be long before a new president restores their name and international reputation for excellence.",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/e14624bd66e223ef3f050d5b1a37255d.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 06:00:39.925027

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has circulated detailed data on India’s installed solar manufacturing capacities to the Finance Ministry and key non-banking financial companies.

The move is aimed at improving the quality of loan assessments for new clean energy manufacturing proposals.

The information has been shared with the Department of Financial Services and major lenders, including PFC, REC, and IREDA. It covers the entire solar photovoltaic value chain, including modules, solar cells, ingots and wafers, and polysilicon. Details of supporting industries, such as solar glass and aluminium frames, have also been included.

Officials say the data will help financial institutions take an informed approach when reviewing loan applications. It is expected to encourage lenders to support manufacturing projects across upstream segments, rather than confining their exposure to module-making units.

The guidance will also make it easier to evaluate proposals for ancillary components essential to the sector’s growth.

The Ministry stressed that it has not instructed banks or NBFCs to halt lending to renewable energy developers or to equipment manufacturers. Instead, the exercise is meant to expand confidence in the sector and guide future financing decisions.

“It is hereby clarified that MNRE has not issued any advisory to Financial Institutions for stopping lending to either renewable energy power projects or to renewable energy equipment manufacturing facilities,” said the official statement.

The government has reiterated its goal of building a self-reliant and globally competitive solar manufacturing ecosystem. Several policy tools support this mission, including the Production Linked Incentive scheme for high-efficiency modules and measures designed to strengthen the position of domestic producers.

These interventions have delivered significant results. India’s solar module manufacturing capacity has grown from 2.3GW in 2014 to around 122GW now listed in MNRE’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers.

MNRE says it will continue to work with stakeholders to strengthen infrastructure, promote innovation and ensure India remains on track to achieve 500GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.

As of 31 October 2025, the installed capacity from non-fossil sources stands at about 259GW, with 31.2GW added in the current financial year up to October 2025.",https://www.electronicsforyou.biz/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solar-Panel-880x579.jpeg,N,,2025-12-08 08:00:59.986249

For more than a century, Big Oil lobbying has tyrannized American climate and tax policy, driving climate catastrophe while deepening economic inequality. Lavish tax breaks and subsidies for fossil fuel companies help explain why corporate giants like Chevron enjoy single-digit tax rates – lower than what many nurses or firefighters pay. After fossil fuel lobbyists flooded COP30 in unprecedented numbers, outnumbering nearly every other country’s delegation and stalling calls for a rapid fossil fuel phaseout, it’s more transparent than ever how the fossil fuel industry maintains its grip on global climate policy.

In the U.S., aggressive Big Oil lobbying has secured enormous government giveaways so extensive that the largest U.S. oil and gas companies now pay more in taxes to foreign governments than to the U.S. Treasury, finds a recent report by the FACT Coalition.

The report analyzed the financial disclosures of 11 U.S. oil and gas companies with extensive overseas operations and concluded that decades of heavy industry lobbying has engineered a U.S. tax code that pays for a dying fossil fuel industry, specifically for new oil and gas development abroad.

At the report’s launch in D.C. earlier this fall, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) explained how U.S.taxpayers are effectively forced to subsidize fossil fuel production through a tax code highly favorable to Big Oil. The report’s researchers explained that under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) regime, multinational companies that shift operations offshore already receive a 50 percent income tax deduction. But Big Oil lobbying has successfully created special exemptions allowing the largest fossil fuel companies to bypass all U.S. tax on foreign oil and gas extraction income.

As a result, despite producing more oil and gas domestically than in all other countries combined, American multinational oil and gas companies collectively pay more in taxes to foreign governments than to the U.S. While domestic operations account for more than 57 percent of total upstream production among the companies studied in the report, they generate less than a quarter of total taxes due.

ExxonMobil, for example, extracts 31 percent of its global oil and gas domestically, but owes only 10 percent of its total taxes in the U.S. Instead, ExxonMobil reported paying nearly five times as much tax to the U.A.E as to the U.S. in 2023 and 2024. Similarly, in 2023 Chevron paid a combined $6.25 billion to Nigeria, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea, compared to just under $2 billion paid to the U.S. government.

Before Trump’s 2017 tax law, corporate income earned abroad from refining, transporting, and selling oil was taxed immediately at the full U.S. rate. But Trump’s Big Oil tax breaks shifted this income into GILTI. Although the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tried to curtail government subsidies to fossil fuels, the 2025 “One Big Beautiful Bill” expanded 2017-level tax giveaways, including more direct incentives for foreign drilling. To secure the sweeping benefits contained in the 2025 tax law, the industry’s largest players spent nearly $20 million lobbying Congress in the six months preceding the bill’s passage.

The bill adds $30.8 billion per year in existing subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, restores federal royalty rates to their pre-IRA levels of 12.5-16.7 percent, and introduces a new carveout allowing oil and gas companies to deduct intangible drilling costs (IDCs) – which represent 60-80 percent of total well expenses – from income subject to the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) (a 15% minimum tax on corporations earning more than $1 billion in book profits). The president of the American Petroleum Institute (API), said that Trump’s 2025 tax reform “includes almost all of our priorities.”

Allowing the wishes of Big Oil to take precedent over the wellbeing of people and the planet is dooming our shared ecosystem. Today, U.S. taxpayers not only subsidize the fossil-fuel industry by nearly $35 billion every year, they also shoulder more than $100 billion annually in climate-related costs. A Brookings study estimates that climate change now costs the average U.S. household $220 to $570 per year.

Meanwhile, the companies driving these damages continue to profit. Chevron and ExxonMobil rank among the world’s five highest-emitting corporations, and a 2025 Nature study estimates that each is responsible for nearly $2 trillion in climate damages. The report notes that federal handouts to U.S. fossil fuel companies operating overseas are especially damaging. They erode the U.S. tax base, accelerate the climate crisis, undermine American energy independence, and fail to generate well-paying domestic jobs.

Working-class people are paying for the continued life-support of an already dying industry that’s fueling the climate crisis. Erich Pica, President of Friends of the Earth, noted during the report launch that without federal subsidies, 60 percent of U.S. oil and gas production would be economically unviable. This sentiment has been well known by economic and political advisors across the political spectrum for decades. For instance, the report quotes Kevin Hassett, a current Trump top economic advisor, who said in a 2006 article that, “ending subsidies for fossil fuel production would level the playing field among energy sources and shift us from a policy of promoting fossil fuel supply to encouraging a reduction in fossil fuel consumption.” The entrenched government support incentivizing our current extractive economy starves the renewable energy sector of crucial federal investment necessary to curb polluting emissions. And eliminating these tax breaks would save U.S. taxpayers more than $75 billion over the next decade.

The FACT Coalition recommends several essential reforms to counter traditional pro-oil tax policies. Eliminating domestic fossil fuel tax preferences and subsidies that fund oil and gas production abroad, ensuring that multinational corporations cannot shift production overseas to scapegoat domestic tax rates, and strengthening corporate tax transparency policy to include how much companies pay in taxes country-by-country.

“Tax fairness is climate justice,” Whitehouse concluded his remarks at the report launch.

Corporate and political greed deepens multigenerational economic vulnerability by eroding safety nets like SNAP and Medicaid, while financially and politically killing the potential of a thriving renewable energy sector that could create stable, well-paying jobs to replace those declining under Big Oil. Our government continues to prop up oil and gas companies over people and the planet, and is fueling climate disaster at home and abroad. We must refuse to let our paychecks fund the industry that is destroying our homes, our lands, and our loved ones.

Duke Energy has already paid hundreds of North Carolinians to let it tap power from their home storage systems when electricity demand is highest. It’s Duke’s first foray into running a ​“virtual power plant,” in which the company manages electricity produced and stored by consumers, much as it would control generation from its own facilities.

In September, the utility proposed a similar model for its nonresidential customers, asserting that the scheme will save money by shrinking the need for new power plants and expensive upgrades to the grid. The recognition signals a way forward for distributed renewable energy and storage as state and national politicians back away from the clean energy transition.

The initiative now needs approval from the five-member North Carolina Utilities Commission, where the virtual-power-plant model has faced some skepticism. But the apparent merits of Duke’s plan, which has broad backing, may be too enticing for commissioners to ignore — especially when the state is grappling with rising rates and voracious demand from data centers and other heavy electricity users.

“In an era of massive load growth, something that should lower costs to customers while helping meet peak demand — to me, it’s an absolute no-brainer,” said Ethan Blumenthal, regulatory counsel for the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an advocacy group. ​“I’m hopeful that [regulators] see it the same way.”

Duke’s trial residential battery incentives grew out of a compromise with rooftop solar installers. Like many investor-owned utilities around the country, the company sought to lower bill credits for the electrons that solar owners add to the grid. When the solar industry and clean energy advocates fought back, the scheme dubbed PowerPair was born.

The test program provides rebates of up to $9,000 for a battery paired with rooftop photovoltaic panels. It’s capped at roughly 6,000 participants, or however many it takes to reach a limit of 60 megawatts of solar. Half of the households agree to let Duke access their batteries up to 18 times each year, earning an extra $37 per month on average; the other half enroll in electric rates that discourage use when demand peaks.

The incentives have been crucial for rooftop solar installers, who’ve faced a torrent of policy and macroeconomic headwinds this year, and they’ve proved vital for customers who couldn’t otherwise afford the up-front costs of installing cheap, clean energy.

But the PowerPair enrollees already make up 30 megawatts in one of Duke’s two North Carolina utility territories and could hit their limit in the central part of the state early next year, leaving both consumers and the rooftop solar industry anxious about what’s next.

Duke’s latest proposal for nonresidential customers — which, unlike the PowerPair test, would be permanent — is one answer.

Battery incentives for businesses: ​“A long time coming”

The proposed program is similar to PowerPair in that it’s born of compromise: Last summer, the state-sanctioned customer advocate, clean energy companies, and others agreed to drop their objections to Duke’s carbon-reduction plan under several conditions, including that the utility develop incentives for battery storage for commercial and industrial customers. The Utilities Commission later blessed the deal.

“This was pursuant to the settlement in last year’s carbon plan,” said Blumenthal, ​“so it’s been a long time coming.”

While many industry and nonprofit insiders refer to the scheme as ​“Commercial PowerPair,” its official title is the Non-Residential Storage Demand Response Program.

That name reflects the incentives’ focus on storage, with solar as only a minor factor: Duke wants to offer businesses, local governments, and nonprofits $120 per kilowatt of battery capacity installed on its own and just $30 more if it’s paired with photovoltaics.

The maximum up-front inducement of $150 per storage kilowatt is much less than the $360 per kilowatt offered under PowerPair. But more significant for nonresidential customers could be monthly bill credits: about $250 for a 100-kilowatt battery that could be tapped 36 times a year, plus extra if the battery is actually discharged.

Unlike households participating in PowerPair, which must install solar and storage at the same time to get rebates, nonresidential customers can also get the incentives for adding a battery to pair with existing solar arrays.

“That could be very important for municipalities around North Carolina that have already installed a very significant amount of solar, but very little of that is paired with battery storage,” said Blumenthal.

Duke has high hopes for the program, projecting that five years in, over 26,000 participants will enroll statewide. The company says that level of engagement would help it avoid building nearly 28 megawatts of new power plants to meet peak demand, saving over $13.6 million. That’s significantly more than the cost of providing and administering the incentives, which Duke places at nearly $11.8 million.

“The Program provides a source of cost-effective capacity that the Company’s system operators can use at their discretion in situations to deliver economic benefits for all customers,” Duke said in its September filing to regulators. ​“Importantly, the Company received positive feedback from its customers … when sharing the details of the Program.”

Indeed, the proposal has been met with support not just from the Sustainable Energy Association and other clean energy groups but also organizations like the North Carolina Justice Center, which advocates for low-income households. It earned praise from local governments represented by the Southeast Sustainability Directors Network and conditional support from the state-sanctioned customer advocate, known as Public Staff, too.

Tipping the scales for more and bigger batteries

The good vibes continued last week, when Duke responded positively to detailed suggestions from these parties on how to improve the program. That included a request from Public Staff that the company raise the per-customer limit on battery capacity to align with the maximum amount of solar that a business or other nonresidential consumer can connect to the grid, which is currently 5 megawatts.

“Larger batteries sited at larger customer sites can help provide more significant system benefits and can reduce the need for incremental utility-owned energy storage installed at all ratepayers’ expense,” the agency told regulators in its November comments. It recommends a cap tied to a customer’s peak demand; for example, a business that consumes more energy at once should get incentives for a bigger battery. Duke agreed in its Dec. 5 comments, calling that limit ​“reasonable.”

Still, questions remain about how to make the incentives most impactful.

Public Staff, for instance, believes Duke should increase its monthly payment to customers for keeping their batteries charged and ready to deploy. This ​“capacity credit” is now set at $3.50 per kilowatt but effectively reduced to $2.48, because the utility assumes that a percentage of users won’t properly maintain their systems, based on its experience with households. The company calls that a ​“capability factor,” but the agency dubs it ​“collective punishment” for all customers and says it should be eliminated or recalibrated for ​“more sophisticated” nonresidential participants.

Raleigh, North Carolina–based 8MSolar, a member of the Sustainable Energy Association, is among the many installers that have been eagerly anticipating Duke’s proposal.

The program on its own likely won’t ​“move the needle unless the incentives get bumped up,” said Bryce Bruncati, the company’s director of sales. However, the scheme could tip the scales for large customers when stacked on top of two federal tax opportunities: a 30% incentive available through the end of 2027 and a deduction tied to the depreciation value of the system — up to 100% thanks to the Republican budget law passed this summer.

“The combined three could really have a big impact for small- to medium-sized commercial projects,” Bruncati said. The Duke program would represent ​“a little bit of icing on the cake.”

Whatever their size and design, the fate of the incentives rests entirely with the Utilities Commission, now that the final round of comments from Duke and other stakeholders is in. There’s no timeline for a decision.

At least one commissioner, Tommy Tucker, has voiced skepticism about leveraging customer-owned equipment to serve the grid at large. ​“I’m not a big fan of the [demand-side management] or virtual power plants because you’re dependent upon somebody else,” the former Republican state senator said at a recent hearing, albeit one not connected to the Duke program.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Duke-Energy-Power-Lines.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=de0aca3f7267ce8e449e408628d4d27e,N,,2025-12-08 06:00:48.895447

BP's decision to pull out of building a hydrogen plant has been described as ""discouraging"" by scientists working on decarbonisation.

Last week, the energy giant backed out of its plans at Teesworks in Redcar following a row with landowners over whether the site would be better suited to housing a data centre.

Prof Simone Abraham, Durham Energy Institute executive director, said the decision raised ""a lot of questions about the commitment to hydrogen development among industry and government"".

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said the government had backed the industry with £500m. BP has been approached for comment.

Prof Abraham said the move was ""discouraging"" but that she still believed hydrogen would play an important role in future energy systems.

BP backed out of the HSTeesside project ahead of a government decision on the plans, citing a ""material change in circumstances"" to the land it had been due to be built on.

At the time, a spokesperson said: ""We continue to move forward with other projects on Teesside, including our investments in Net Zero Teesside Power and the Northern Endurance Partnership, and remain an active partner in the region.""

Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said he would continue to work with the BP on that project, which aims to be ""the world's first gas-fired power station with carbon capture and storage"".

'Economic case collapses'

Decarbonisation expert Prof Dawid Hanak, from Teesside University, said BP's decision to pull out of the scheme would make it ""challenging"" to meet the country's goal of producing up to 10GW of low carbon hydrogen by 2030.

Prof Maria Sharmina at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research pointed to the fact that BP had also suggested one reason it pulled out of the scheme was because the companies which it planned to sell its hydrogen to had ""postponed decarbonisation plans"".

She said: ""You can build all the supply infrastructure you like, but if the industrial users who were meant to switch to hydrogen are pulling back, then the economic case collapses.""

A DESNZ spokesperson said the hydrogen industry would ""play a key role"" in delivering its Industrial Strategy and its ""mission to become a clean energy superpower"".

""That's why this government backed the industry with £500m in the summer spending review,"" they said.

""Our ambitious Hydrogen Strategy will set out our vision and clear intentions for the UK's industry, driving clean energy investment and unlocking thousands of skilled jobs up and down the country.""

The reports had surfaced following an office memorandum dated November 28 from MNRE that called for Prudence in Lending for Solar PV Modules. The memorandum had flagged representations made by the All India Solar Industries Association (AISIA), an association of solar manufacturers that claimed a looming overcapacity issue for the sector, especially the module sector. The MNRE, in its memorandum, acknowledged the AISIA representation with key points, and urged relevant stakeholders in the Ministry of Finance and others to exercise due diligence accordingly when evaluating solar module financing. Not a proposal to freeze lending by any stretch.

The AISIA has also made a representation to the Indian Banking Association (IBA) with the same issues. The AISIA focus also seems to have been limited to solar modules, and no cells, wafers or the rest of the constituents of the solar cycle, including projects etc. The AISIA site lists 18 members in the body, with Waaree Energies, Vikram Solar, Emmvee and Goldi Solar among the notable majors, even as it has notable misses like Adani Solar, Solex Energy, Premier Energies etc.

No pause on green energy financing

MNRE stated that it has not advised any bank or financial institution to suspend or restrict lending to renewable energy power projects or solar equipment manufacturing facilities.

It stressed that continued policy support and financing will be essential to maintain the country’s growth momentum and to ensure that India emerges as a major, resilient player across the solar PV manufacturing value chain.

Focus on calibrated, informed lending

According to the Ministry, it has shared detailed data with the Department of Financial Services and key non-banking financial institutions, such as PFC, REC, and IREDA, on existing domestic solar PV manufacturing capacities.

This includes information on modules, upstream stages like cells, ingots-wafers and polysilicon, and ancillary components such as solar glass and aluminium frames.

The objective is to enable lenders to adopt a calibrated and well-informed approach while appraising proposals, and to encourage them to diversify financing beyond just module manufacturing to more upstream and ancillary segments of the solar value chain.

Strengthening India’s solar manufacturing ecosystem

MNRE underscored that its policy thrust remains firmly on building India’s self-reliance in solar PV manufacturing and strengthening the country’s role in the global solar value chain.

This is being pursued through a comprehensive set of measures, including the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for high-efficiency solar PV modules and steps to ensure a level playing field for Indian manufacturers. Notably, India’s domestic solar module capacity has expanded from about 2.3 GW in 2014 to roughly 122 GW currently listed in the Ministry’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM).

The Ministry reiterated its commitment to inclusive, competitive and sustainable growth of the solar ecosystem as part of India’s broader goal of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.

As of 31 October 2025, installed capacity from non-fossil sources has reached around 259 GW, with 31.2 GW added in the current financial year up to October 2025.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/saur-energy/media/media_files/2025/12/08/mnre-denies-advisory-for-clean-energy-financing-freeze-2025-12-08-13-04-15.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 06:00:14.222084

The combined entity will focus on producing green methanol and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at scale, using wood-waste biomass sourced from Louisiana. The merger brings together DevvStream’s carbon management expertise and Southern’s low-cost biomass-to-fuel platform, reports Antara News.

The new company aims to support airlines and shipping operators as they face stricter environmental rules worldwide. Its operations will be built around two divisions — one dealing with climate-related solutions and another focused on clean fuels — starting with Southern’s planned biomass-to-fuel project in Louisiana. Management expects that combining both companies’ strengths will help lower production costs and make alternative fuels more competitive. Carl Stanton, who will lead the merged company as CEO, said the merger is intended to position the new entity as a stronger industrial-scale fuels and credits business. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026.

Stanton said the aviation and shipping sectors “are under pressure to cut emissions, and they want practical solutions that they can afford.” He added that renewable fuels “are still far costlier than conventional fuels,” and the merger is meant to “bring down those costs and help companies meet the new rules without slowing their operations.”

Southern Energy Renewables CEO Jay Patel said Louisiana continues to be a key partner for the project. “The state’s access to feedstock, infrastructure and a skilled workforce gives us a strong foundation for long-term growth,” he said, adding that the company expects the partnership with the state to deepen as work progresses.

Nevin Smalls, Chief Strategy Officer at Southern, said the project has been designed to produce clean fuels “on a large scale and at lower cost than many global competitors.” He noted that their production route — converting biomass waste into methanol and then into SAF — uses established technologies and integrated carbon capture, enabling “one of the lowest emissions footprints in the market.”

Stanton also confirmed that Southern has made an initial investment of about $2 million in DevvStream through the purchase of 128,370 shares. He said the investment “shows confidence in DevvStream’s core work and its importance in reducing costs for customers,” while giving DevvStream shareholders meaningful ownership in a larger and more diverse clean-fuel platform.

Final marketing and distribution agreement for renewable ammonia from the Saudi Arabian project (NEOM Green Hydrogen Project) is targeted for the first half of 2026.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. and OSLO, Norway, Dec. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- World-leading hydrogen supplier and global industrial gases company Air Products (NYSE:APD) and world-leading crop nutrition and ammonia company Yara International ASA (OSE:YAR) are working to combine Air Products' industrial gas capabilities and low-emission hydrogen with Yara's ammonia production and distribution network:

Louisiana Clean Energy Complex: Air Products is developing the world's largest low-carbon energy complex in the state of Louisiana. The complex is designed to produce >750 million standard cubic feet per day of low-carbon hydrogen, capturing 95 percent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) generated during normal operation.

Air Products is the project developer and once the ammonia plant has achieved agreed upon performance levels, Yara would acquire the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities for approximately 25 percent of the total project cost (estimated between $8-9 billion). Yara would assume responsibility for related operations and integrate the entire ammonia output into its global distribution network.

Air Products would own and operate the industrial gases production, where approximately 80% of the low-carbon hydrogen would be supplied to Yara under a 25-year long-term offtake agreement to produce 2.8 million tonnes of low-carbon ammonia per year. The remaining hydrogen would be supplied to Air Products' customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast via Air Products' 700-mile hydrogen pipeline system. About five million tonnes per year of high purity CO2 captured by the Air Products facility would be sequestered by a third party under a long-term agreement to be announced later.

Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Project: The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia is more than 90 percent complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. Air Products is the sole offtaker of up to 1.2 million tonnes per year of renewable ammonia.

Air Products and Yara anticipate entering into a marketing and distribution agreement where Yara would commercialize, on a commission basis, the ammonia not sold by Air Products as renewable hydrogen in Europe. The model maximizes value for both companies and enables ammonia from the world's first large-scale renewable ammonia plant to be delivered worldwide by Yara's unparalleled shipping fleet. The marketing and distribution agreement is targeted to be completed during the first half of 2026.

Leveraging complementary strengths to drive value creation in low-emission ammonia

Yara is the world's largest trader and shipper of ammonia, currently transporting over four million metric tonnes annually, which is supported by Yara's 12 ammonia vessels and 18 import terminals. In addition, Yara has a significant internal ammonia demand. Air Products is the world's largest supplier of hydrogen and brings leading low-emission hydrogen and ammonia production at scale. The collaboration would enable the companies to meet the increasing demand for low-emission ammonia in the coming years, particularly in Europe both for Yara's internal consumption and other customers.

""We are pleased to be working with Yara, the world's leading fertilizer company, as we advance the global low-emission ammonia market and maximize value from our projects in Louisiana and Saudi Arabia,"" said Air Products' Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Menezes.

""Air Products' two advanced projects are a strong strategic fit with Yara's flexible nitrogen system – enabling energy diversification and profitable decarbonization while aligning with our disciplined capital allocation policy. The Louisiana project builds on a proven, capital-efficient model; producing ammonia from externally sourced hydrogen and delivering strong returns,"" said Yara's CEO Svein Tore Holsether.

Climate lawfare is a Big Business. State, county and city lawyers have filed some 30 lawsuits, alleging that oil companies misrepresented the impacts of their products and caused billions of dollars in climate and weather damages.

After being approached by EarthRights International, Boulder and Boulder County, Colorado joined San Miguel County in April 2018 to sue Suncor Energy and ExxonMobil.

Leaving out the hurricanes and rising seas emphasized by coastal litigants, plaintiffs’ 105-page complaint alleges that the oil companies have severely harmed their property, health and safety, by causing higher temperatures, more droughts and wildfires, and dwindling snowpack that adversely affects water supplies and the farming and skiing industries.

They want a trial by local jurors and seek billions of dollars to compensate their jurisdictions for past and future damages and costs, evaluate and mitigate climate change impacts, abate and remediate its hazards, and compensate them for decreased agricultural and urban property values.

Defendants argue that the case raises major, complicated national and even international issues and therefore belongs in federal, not state courts. But after years of legal wrangling, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in May 2025 that the lawsuit could indeed proceed in state court.

So now Suncor and ExxonMobil have petitioned the US Supreme Court to review the case. Plaintiffs strongly oppose this. But there are compelling reasons why the Supremes should move it to federal venues, after declining earlier lawsuits that they said did not present a ripe or perfect case for review.

Fifty-plus years ago, I lived in Boulder, Denver and often went downhill and cross-country skiing. We had variable snow seasons: early and long, late and short, great snowpack or rocks. Back then the mantra was global cooling and a new ice age, but it later shifted to “global warming” when average global temperatures rose slightly, and finally to the all-encompassing “climate change” narrative.

I saw the aftermath of Colorado’s worst natural disaster ever, the 1976 Big Thompson flood. I witnessed other monster rainfalls, droughts and dust storms, and multiple wildfires. Decades-long Anasazi droughts underscore Nature’s destructive forces centuries ago.

Plaintiffs cannot possibly make a convincing historical or scientific case that today’s climate and weather are unusual or unprecedented. Nor can they separate natural forces and effects from fossil fuel or other manmade influences.

Team Boulder claims its case involves only local damages, issues, legal claims and remedies. However, ExxonMobil and Suncor production and refining activities, sales, emissions and alleged climate impacts are hardly confined to two counties or even the State of Colorado. The lawsuit’s effects would ripple like tsunamis across the USA and world.

Indeed, current and former county attorneys and officials have said the primary goals of this litigation include imposing “an indirect carbon tax” on defendants’ products; “raising the price” of those products so that they become too expensive for most families; curtailing fossil fuel use; and effecting “systems-level change” to America’s energy, economic and social systems.

The products include transportation fuels for Colorado and US cars, trucks, tractors and aircraft; natural gas to generate electricity for lights, computers, medical equipment, and lifesaving heating and air conditioning; and petrochemical feedstocks for over 6,000 essential products, including paints, plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, fertilizers, and skis, ski boots and clothing of all descriptions.

Climate activists have been unable to enact national legislation to curb or eliminate the use of coal, oil or natural gas – or persuade Congress to ratify international treaties that compel all countries to slash their fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions. Climate lawfare, via local and state courts, has thus become a central tactic for imposing their radical agenda, controlling our lives and reducing our living standards.

They know COP30 was an abject failure and overtures to “climate cataclysms” are falling on deaf ears.

They want to avoid federal courts and lawyers that might closely examine their far-fetched claims from national, international, scientific and economic perspectives. They know a US Supreme Court ruling in defendants’ favor would likely end any option for them to circumvent federal legislative and judicial processes.

Climateers also know that US states that enforce wind and solar power mandates have electricity prices at least two times higher than those that have not. Worse, residential prices in climate-obsessed Britain, Germany and other European countries are 2-3 times higher than the US average: 30 to 40+ cents per kilowatt-hour in Europe versus 15 cents in the USA.

They know (but vigorously deny) that German, British and other European electricity prices have caused their industries to lose millions of jobs and left families unable to heat their homes properly, leading to thousands of needless deaths every winter. Iberia’s peninsula-wide blackout in April 2025 proved reliance on wind and solar power can be disastrous, even deadly.

It’s hardly surprising that no other city or county has joined the lawsuit. That Colorado’s governor and former governor have refused to support it. Or that Colorado’s own attorney general joined 14 other state AGs in signing an amicus curiae brief opposing a very similar suit by California cities.

The AGs argued that cities should not be able to use the common nuisance law to “harness the power and prestige of federal courts to remedy global climate change.” They also noted that: “questions of global climate change and its effects … are political questions not suited for resolution by any court.” Indeed, such judicial interference would trample on “Congress’s carefully calibrated process of cooperative federalism where states work in tandem with EPA to administer the federal Clean Air Act.”

These issues are for Congress and the Executive Branch to debate, balance competing needs and interests, and decide at the national level. In dismissing New York City’s similar climate lawsuit, Federal Judge John Keenan made the same points.

Perhaps most importantly, over the past few years, the US Supreme Court has significantly curtailed the powers of federal agencies. In West Virginia v. EPA (2022), it held that, in the absence of clear legislative authority, government agencies cannot unilaterally issue regulations that have “major” economic or political significance.

Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2023) reversed the “Chevron deference” rule. Silent or ambiguous statutory texts no longer give administrative agencies unfettered power to interpret laws in ways that let them increase control over people’s lives and livelihoods.

Cities, counties and states certainly should not have greater power than federal agencies – or be able to employ common law rulings – to control America’s fossil fuel production, use and products, in a futile attempt to control Earth’s perpetually changing climate. Especially when the vast majority of global greenhouse gas emissions now come from China, India, Russia and other countries.

The climate litigation charade must end.

Let’s hope the Supreme Court agrees that Boulder’s lawsuit is an excellent opportunity to terminate frivolous climate lawfare, expand on the guidance it provided in these two previous cases – and end attempts by climate activists to impose destructive national policies through local and state courts.",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-121.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 02:58:31.091822

Advt

On Sunday, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy said that it had asked the finance ministry to advise lenders to adopt a ""calibrated and well-informed approach"" when evaluating proposals for additional standalone solar photovoltaic module capacity, citing oversupply risks. It added that the advisory was not intended to stop funding for the entire clean energy sector.

""This broad-based caution, if applied without distinction, could hurt solar cell manufacturing,"" said Chetan Shah, the chairman and managing director of Solex Energy.

""Restricting financing now will disrupt under-construction projects and deepen reliance on imported cells,"" he said.

Several Indian firms ramped up module production in recent years, betting on exports to the U.S. But higher American tariffs and tighter scrutiny of Indian shipments for Chinese-origin components have hit exports, raising fears of a glut at home.

India's module capacity is projected to surge by a third to 200 gigawatts (GW) in the next few years, while cell output could quadruple to 100 GW, according to the clean energy ministry.

The ministry remained committed to strengthening solar manufacturing through policy support and infrastructure development, it said on Sunday.>

Batteries are the backbone of America’s technological ambitions. Electric vehicles, drones, aircraft, defense systems, grid storage, consumer electronics—the entire future runs on electrons stuffed into metal boxes. They are so crucial that they may ultimately determine whether the U.S. remains a global technology leader or cedes that advantage to China, which is racing ahead in electrification.

2025 was a massive year on the battery front, packed full of promising breakthroughs and disappointing setbacks. Below, we've compiled some of the biggest battery developments of the year. But first, let's explore how we got to this moment.

Batteries in 2025: A Recap

The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was a shot of adrenaline for battery projects. It injected hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies into the space, helping sprout sprawling factories (or at least plans for them) nationwide. We all know what happened next.

After President Trump returned to the White House in January, there was immediate whiplash on the policy front. Several battery plants either paused or shut down, jobs evaporated and automakers scrambled to redirect investment into stationary storage systems to soften the blow from the EV slowdown.

Still, 2025 proved that the the ship had already sailed. Projects announced in the Biden era that had come far along marched toward completion. EV prototypes with solid-state batteries hit the road as automakers continued to make bolder promises about the “holy grail” tech.

Meanwhile, today’s lithium-ion batteries continued to improve. Automakers released new or refreshed EVs with more efficient batteries delivering longer range at more competitive prices. We also saw lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) technology return to America, along with novel approaches such as the lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) battery chemistry to address affordability concerns.

The torrent of battery news in 2025 felt like five years compressed into one. And because this industry impacts everything from how we drive to how we power our homes and how we deal with natural disasters, the InsideEVs team covered it all obsessively, with scoops, technical deep dives, factory visits and interviews with industry leaders.

10 EV Battery Stories That Defined 2025

As the year winds down, here are the top battery stories this year from our editors, staff writers and contributors. If you couldn’t keep up with the battery news cycle this year, we don’t blame you. These 10 stories paint a solid picture of what happened in the battery world in 2025—and where it's going next.

How Ford And GM Are Plotting A Battery Breakup With China

General Motors and Ford are working on a breakthrough battery chemistry called lithium-manganese-rich (LMR), which aims to deliver driving range closer to current nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) packs at costs comparable to cheaper lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. I visited General Motors’ top-secret battery facilities in Warren, Michigan, this Spring to learn how these LMR batteries are made and what their implications are for the EV industry. I also spoke to engineers at Ford who described LMR tech as “LFP of the West” and the answer to “what’s next?”

Mercedes’ Solid-State Battery Prototype Comes Out Of The Lab, Onto The Road

This year, Western automakers inched closer to bringing their solid-state dreams to reality. These batteries promise longer range, faster charging times and improved thermal safety. A Mercedes-Benz EQS equipped with U.S.-based start-up Factorial’s semi-solid-state battery began road tests in Europe this year. BMW seems to have gone a step further, installing an all-solid-state (ASSB) pack from another U.S.-based start-up, Solid Power, in a prototype i7. While their roadworthiness is now being tested, expect more such announcements in the coming months as the technology continues to mature.

Ford’s Affordable EV Comeback Starts Here. But Not Without Controversy

LFP batteries are central to making EVs more affordable, as they’re cheaper to produce and don’t use expensive nickel or cobalt. But most LFP batteries today are made in China. Ford is working hard to change that. The company is building its $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, where it will make LFP batteries for its future EVs, licensing CATL’s tech. Patrick George visited the plant in June and reported that reaching this stage for Ford wasn’t without difficulties or controversy.

GM Is Bringing LFP Battery Production To America

GM had a huge year in the battery department. Not only did it surpass Tesla to become America’s largest battery cell manufacturer, but it’s also planning to bring LFP battery production stateside. The automakers’ two main battery suppliers, LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, will retrofit part of their U.S. plants, originally designed for NMC batteries, to assemble LFP packs. Both the Chevy Bolt EV and the Silverado EV have been confirmed to get LFP packs, but local production won’t begin until the end of 2027. Until then, GM will reportedly import LFP batteries from China’s CATL.

BMW Gen6 Batteries May Foreshadow Class-Leading EV

Lithium-ion batteries are advancing so rapidly that one wonders, do we even need chemistries such as solid-state? BMW’s Gen6 batteries will offer up to 620 miles of range (depending on the vehicle type) and 30% faster charging. This pattern of improved batteries was common across the industry this year. Toyota’s 2026 EVs feature batteries that are better than ever. From 2027 onwards, Hyundai’s batteries will be 30% cheaper and 15% more energy dense. And Tesla is working with Panasonic to develop anode-free cells that could boost the Model Y’s range by 90 miles.

We Built Too Many EV Battery Factories. Here’s What Happens Next

Battery plants worth billions were canceled this year as the Trump administration rolled back clean energy programs and tax credits. Still, North America and the rest of the world are staring down a battery manufacturing glut. China's battery production capacity outpaces demand by five times. Europe makes double the number of batteries than its car buyers need. And North America’s capacity-to-demand ratio is 1.9. Mack Hogan explained in his story how battery companies reached this stage and what the future might look like.

The Facts Are In: You Shouldn’t Worry About EV Battery Replacements

Battery replacements may have been common on the first-generation Nissan Leaf or some model years of the Chevy Bolt which had defective packs. But it’s very rare for modern batteries to randomly fail. Experts say there’s really nothing to worry about these days. Tim Levin outlined in his story that the latest EVs have battery replacement rates of just 0.3% and are basically worry-free for at least 15 years on average.

‘Vital To Our Future’: How Lithium-Ion Batteries Are Saving The Grid

Commercial electricity was invented more than a century ago. Yet the process of managing and distribution remains fragile, as heat waves and natural disasters keep knocking the grid off. States and utilities have been using battery energy storage systems as backup for years, but this year more automakers joined the fray to offset lower EV battery demand with batteries for energy storage. BESS allows companies to store and deploy renewable energy more efficiently, so that our lights remain on when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow. I spoke with experts to understand how the economics and engineering of BESS batteries differ from those of EVs.

China’s 100-Second EV Battery Swaps Are Here

Nio’s battery-swapping stations have been around in China for a while, but battery giant CATL has promised to take battery swapping to the next level. The company’s swappable “Choco-SEB” batteries—named after their chocolate bar design—can be swapped in just 100 seconds. So in a little over a minute, you can be in and out of the swapping station. And no, this tech isn’t 10 years away. It’s already launched in China and is now expanding.

CATL’s Sodium-Ion EV Battery Loves The Cold

The same core element that makes your lunch taste better, i.e., salt, is now also powering EVs in China. Research suggests that sodium is 1,000 times more abundant than lithium, but batteries made out of it don’t enjoy the same supply chain advantages and scalability as lithium-ion packs. But seeing potential in the technology for certain applications, CATL created its Naxtra sodium-ion subbrand in Spring. The company has started making high- and low-voltage sodium-ion battery packs in China, which can even operate at temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit.

,American Energy,2025-12-08 05:23:44+00:00,Governing,There's More Than One Way to Power Data Centers - Governing Magazine,"Carl Smith, www.governing.com, Carl-Smith.html",,,,,https://www.governing.com/resilience/theres-more-than-one-way-to-power-data-centers,"A report from an energy think tank makes the case for a broader perspective on how to meet data center energy needs.
By the end of 2025, U.S. data centers are projected to need 22 percent more grid power than they did the year before and almost three times more soon after.
Negotiating Power It’s well known that data centers can have serious environmental impacts and require massive amounts of water to cool the servers.
The usual criticism of these sources is that they don’t provide a constant enough supply to power giant data centers.
Energy demand from AI data centers may be enormous, but they don’t operate at peak demand at all times.","In Brief:

AI companies are growing at a rapid pace — and continued growth depends on increasing energy supply.

Data centers are sprouting up all over the country, sometimes facing community backlash thanks to their water usage and the strain they threaten to put on the energy grid.

A report from an energy think tank makes the case for a broader perspective on how to meet data center energy needs.

Hundreds of billions of dollars are pouring into artificial intelligence, driving the U.S. economy. The profits that technology leadership investors seek depend on meeting the electricity needs of data centers, warehouse-sized facilities filled with servers that power the digital world, including AI.

By the end of 2025, U.S. data centers are projected to need 22 percent more grid power than they did the year before and almost three times more soon after. S&P Global puts the 2030 need at over 134 GW (gigawatts). One GW is enough to meet the average annual energy needs of about 700,000 homes.

Eric Gimon, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, hopes to provide legislators and state officials working to attract data centers with a more nuanced picture of what they can do to fill gaps between energy demand and supply.

“It’s the normal human thing when we’re dealing with complexity to cling to the simplest ideas,” he says. “People have devolved to the thinking that the way to deal with a big new load is a big new generator.”

Through a new report, Gimon hopes to move beyond what he calls “firm fixation.” He makes the case that overemphasis on “firm” power — electricity from sources that are always “on,” such as nuclear reactors or gas-fired power plants — leads to missed opportunities.

It can cause utilities and developers to overlook solutions like energy efficiency, or batteries connected to solar and wind generators, that cost less, can be implemented more quickly and reduce risk from overinvestment in local fixed capacity vulnerable to shifts in demand, he argues.

Negotiating Power

It’s well known that data centers can have serious environmental impacts and require massive amounts of water to cool the servers. Communities have increasingly pushed back on their construction, with complaints about noise and the possibility of increased energy costs. States and localities have the best chance of making deals to address these issues when a data center is first built, Gimon says — when it’s getting permits, authorization to connect to the grid, and when the utility is deciding how much to charge.

This is the time to ensure data center developers make fair commitments to help cover the infrastructure costs that come with their energy needs, and to push them toward solutions that make the most of existing resources and support the energy grid, Gimon argues. These could include energy efficiency requirements, using data center waste heat to generate electricity or flexibility regarding peak use times.

Gimon also points to a report from Rewiring America arguing that household energy efficiency and rooftop solar could potentially free up enough existing grid energy to meet the needs of the biggest data centers. Governments may be able to secure agreements from companies to fund efficiency projects for the rest of the grid to help meet their needs.

They may be better able to get these kinds of commitments from large technology companies like Amazon Web Services or OpenAI, which are building huge data centers to deliver their services. These companies may have a vested interest in gaining community buy-in and have a greater ability to make long-term energy use projections, Gimon argues.

It may be harder to secure these kinds of promises from “co-location” facilities — large warehouses owned by developers and rented out to multiple separate entities. These developers may be hesitant to make any deals that might affect their ability to draw tenants or the long-term value of their properties, Gimon says.

Drawing From Existing Resources

It’s common for conversations about data centers and energy use to focus on giant power sources like gas-fired plants or nuclear energy facilities. And certainly they will have to make use of those existing energy sources.

But Gimon argues that states and localities shouldn’t be afraid of a varied approach to meeting energy demands, leaning more heavily on renewables like wind and solar. The usual criticism of these sources is that they don’t provide a constant enough supply to power giant data centers.

That's not the whole picture, Gimon says. Energy demand from AI data centers may be enormous, but they don’t operate at peak demand at all times. “Depending on what they are doing, they could be running their chips 70 percent of the time, 50 percent of the time or 40 percent of the time,” says Gimon. “They also turn off and on a lot.”

They also tend to be built in phases. “That’s part of what makes it difficult to serve them with one big power plant,” says Gimon. “You can be undersized or oversized depending on where you are in phase in or phase out.”

Using batteries can assuage concerns about the intermittent nature of renewables. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, wind and solar account for more than two-thirds of utility-scale electric-generating capacity additions planned for 2025.

If governments can secure agreements with data centers to avoid peak energy use during periods of high demand for other grid users (like the afternoon of a summer day, for example), it can create more flexibility in choosing energy sources that can meet need.

“By exploring the nuanced solutions, policymakers can avoid overcommitting to outdated firm resources and instead adopt strategies that embrace modularity, flexibility, and clean energy,” Gimon writes. This can require a deeper dive in the complexity of energy systems by those in government who have responsibility for regulation or legislation.

The Tip of the Spear

Over the last 20 years, energy use decreased from 60 percent of what was available to users to 40 percent, Gimon says. The emergence of an energy-intensive industry, and cross-sector conviction that the nation’s fate depends on growing it as fast as possible, is a head-spinning reversal of this trend.

Data centers are just the tip of the spear, Gimon says. The dawning era of building electrification and the growth of electric vehicles, including heavy duty trucks, mean load growth will continue even if the data center craze crashes and burns.

“We’re in a new era of demand growth that we haven’t seen in a long time in the U.S.,” Gimon says. “It’s going to require an all-of-government approach to manage that, to manage new facilities, manage new generation and find ways to do a better job of using the infrastructure that we have.”

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF.

“Today I would like to share two major bits of progress first: I will start with the fact that I am proud to announce that the FX Super One First Pre-Production Vehicles Roll-off Ceremony is scheduled for December 21 at our manufacturing facility in Hanford, CA! We have reached a critical state of readiness: the full set of components for the first several pre-production vehicles have arrived on site. With nearly 3,000 parts per vehicle now in hand, we will formally launch production tomorrow.

This milestone carries significance in six areas:

1. It marks the near completion of the Bridge Closure for our Bridge strategy, covering a closed loop of supply chain, testing, logistics, customs clearance and production. This further validates the feasibility and strategic value of the Bridge model, across tariff adaptation, ICTS compliance, cost management, operational efficiency, and so on.

2. It marks that the Hanford factory has entered the FX pre-production phase. Our production, industrialization, supply chain, and Bridge systems are now forming a closed-loop synergy.

3. It could provide a replicable, fast-track mass production framework for the scalable deployment of future FX models.

4. It represents a new breakthrough in the Company’s business and supports improvements in our capital position and capital market expectations.

5. It could empower the global expansion of China's automotive supply chain and unlock its value within the U.S.— the world's highest-value market.

6. It could fill a structural gap, tap the blue-ocean segment in the U.S., and generate incremental value in the U.S. market, including job creation and contributions to manufacturing reshoring.

The second bit of progress is that the Board has conditionally approved FF and FX’s five-year volume production plan, including the target of 400,000-500,000 cumulative production and sales, contingent upon securing the necessary financing, as well as more support and agreements with strategic partners. This could help us build a solid foundation for our strategic advancement and stockholder value maximization.

On EAI flywheel—other FFAI updates this week:

S5 Capital Markets and Finance — FF attended UBS’s Global Industrials and Transportation Conference in Florida — a major platform for global capital, industrial and mobility sectors. During the event, we held in-depth discussions with multiple institutional investors, providing a systematic overview of our strategy and core business progress.

Turning to S6 Middle East — Following the delivery of the very first Super One to global icon Andrés Iniesta — coinciding with the UAE’s 54th National Day — our Middle East team brought FF 91 and FX Super One across all seven Emirates, where the “Twin Stars” shined across the region. Next, the Middle East team will speed up assembly ramp up and keep pushing for the assembly and delivery of the FX Super One AIHER variant and the potential battery electric variant, so that more users can be among the first to experience the unique value of First Class EAI-MPV and have the region truly enter the era of AI-powered luxury mobility.

Finally, our issues, reflections, and solutions — Since the FX Super one Initial Product Launch on July 17, we know that our stockholders, investors, and users have been eagerly waiting updates on our milestones and our business vision for the next few years. Our goal has always been to share a roadmap that is clear and executable. Due to complex review cycles and approval procedures, we have not been able to share these details as quickly as intended. This experience has underscored the need for us to improve our internal synergy and operational efficiency.

With our Five-Year Plan closing in on approval, the path could soon be clear for us to share our key milestone goals and forward-looking business plans. We will begin releasing these updates soon and look forward to your continued attention. That’s it for today. I’ll see you at the Hanford factory on December 21.”

Fresh-cut or fake trees? What experts say is more sustainable might surprise you

At Sullivan Hardware and Garden, Christmas tree sales are already brisk.

“We have a large seasonal business which includes fresh-cut Christmas trees and artificial trees,” said Pat Sullivan, President of the hardware and garden store.

Millions of families buy a tree each year, but the environmental impact varies widely depending on whether they choose real or fake.

“When looking at options, it sometimes seems like the more sustainable option is to get a fake tree that you can use for multiple years, but the real tree is actually the way to go,” said Lizzie Hortviz, a sustainability expert and founder of Finch, a platform that educates consumers on sustainability.

Horvitz tells WRTV the carbon footprint of artificial trees is far heavier than most people realize.

“Real Christmas trees typically carry an average carbon footprint of 3.5 kg of CO2, if disposed of through burning or wood chipping,” she said. “A two m artificial Christmas tree has a carbon footprint of around 40 kg, more than 10 times that of a real tree… then, unfortunately, at the end of life, the only thing we can do is landfill them.”

At Sullivan, both types of trees are popular, but this year, the store says fresh trees are stocked up again on their store shelves.

“There's been a shortage of trees and fresh-cut for the last five years, and it's kind of coming to an end,” Sullivan said. “We're paying big dollars just to try to get trees, so the prices of fresh cut around town should either be stable or drop.”

The National Christmas Tree Association and the American Christmas Tree Association estimate the average fresh tree cost in 2024 was between $80 and $100. Artificial trees ranged from $85 to more than $1,000.

Beyond price, Horvitz says real trees offer environmental benefits long before they end up in someone’s home.

“Christmas trees are also doing all that good tree stuff. They're absorbing carbon, they're providing wildlife habitat, etc.,” she said.

""The most important thing is that we support these Christmas tree farms, because for every tree purchased, farmers plant one to three seedlings in its place. So, this guarantees the future of green space and farmland,” she added.

For those who prefer artificial trees, Horvitz says the key to sustainability is longevity.

The meeting brought together Minister Nicola Willis, Minister Simon Watts, Treasurer Dr Jim Chalmers and Minister Chris Bowen to deepen collaboration on emerging technologies and future-ready energy systems that can support more resilient and affordable pathways to net zero.

The discussions placed strong emphasis on how technology-led climate action and increased investment in renewable energy can relieve pressure on household power costs, improve productivity and reinforce energy security across both countries.

With the global economy shifting towards low-emissions technologies, Ministers highlighted opportunities for industries scaling clean products, digital innovation and climate-aligned investments, noting that updated Nationally Determined Contributions signal new clean-tech development aligned with the Paris Agreement.

They also acknowledged the unique value of trans-Tasman cooperation in generating tangible benefits for businesses and communities, including Māori and First Nations Australians, through innovation partnerships and integrated market design.

Climate pressures are reshaping regional supply chains, infrastructure and local economies, prompting both countries to focus on strengthening resilience and ensuring that economic development remains regionally driven and future-oriented.

Ministers reflected on progress since the previous dialogue, including New Zealand’s second emissions reduction plan for 2026–2030 and its National Adaptation Framework, along with Australia’s national Net Zero Plan and risk assessment initiatives designed to encourage long-term investment in sustainable technologies.

A major area of collaboration centres on harnessing technology to build an affordable and secure trans-Tasman energy system. Both countries are moving to align regulatory frameworks, simplify investment pathways and ensure that sustainable finance systems can interoperate effectively.

New commitments include upgrading the Equipment Energy Efficiency Program, supporting smart EV chargers, aligning Vehicle-to-Grid standards and boosting solar and battery sector collaboration to reduce compliance, enhance savings and expand clean-tech opportunities.

Ministers also highlighted emerging opportunities in sustainable aviation fuel, supported by ongoing work on a trans-Tasman SAF Strategy and Australia’s investment in low-carbon fuel production.

Clearer net-zero pathways and internationally relevant standards were recognised as crucial for attracting climate-aligned finance, with both countries working to develop interoperable sustainable finance frameworks.

Australia’s launch of its national Guarantee of Origin scheme and New Zealand’s alignment through its Hydrogen Action Plan mark important steps toward certifying the emissions intensity of green hydrogen, sustainable fuels and green metals, supporting a trusted market for future clean-energy trade.

Agricultural innovation remains a priority, with both countries investing substantially in technologies that reduce livestock emissions and can ultimately transform farming systems internationally. Ministers committed to deeper technical collaboration to speed up the development and adoption of these climate-smart solutions.

Beyond climate and energy, the dialogue also reinforced the importance of innovation in economic reform. Ministers discussed aligning productivity agendas, reducing business costs and accelerating digital payments, licensing reforms and digital asset regulation.

Agencies are exploring greater alignment in non-financial risk management and regulatory tiering in the banking system, while work will continue on harmonising building standards and product safety settings. A new working group will support collaboration on ensuring long-term accessibility and resilience in insurance markets.

Ministers emphasised their responsibility to support the Pacific amid growing climate impacts, reaffirming commitments to expand renewable energy through joint technical assistance, training initiatives in 2026 and deeper regional cooperation.

New Zealand also welcomed Australia’s agreement with Türkiye on COP31 hosting arrangements, which will help amplify Pacific perspectives and accelerate global clean-energy momentum.

According to official data, as of 31 October 2025, the country’s installed non-fossil fuel capacity stands at around 259 GW, including 31.2 GW added in the current financial year up to October.

Amid reports suggesting that the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has instructed lenders to pause financing of renewable energy projects due to excess capacity concerns, the ministry has issued a clarification refuting the claims.

No Directive to Halt Financing, Says Government

MNRE stated that no advisory has been issued to banks, financial institutions, or NBFCs to stop funding renewable energy power projects or equipment manufacturing units.

The ministry clarified that it has only circulated updated information on existing domestic manufacturing capacities—covering modules, solar cells, ingots-wafers, polysilicon and ancillary components such as solar glass and aluminium frames—to bodies including the Department of Financial Services, PFC, REC, and IREDA. The intent, it stated, is to enable lenders to take informed financing decisions and encourage support for upstream solar value chain development rather than focusing solely on module manufacturing.

Government Reaffirms Support for Solar Manufacturing Ecosystem

The ministry reiterated the government’s continued commitment to strengthening domestic solar PV manufacturing with the goal of making India a key global player in the solar value chain. This strategy is supported through policy measures such as the PLI Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules and ongoing efforts to provide a competitive environment for manufacturers.

The ministry noted that India’s solar module manufacturing capacity has increased from 2.3 GW in 2014 to approximately 122 GW today as listed under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM). This growth, it said, highlights the success of coordinated efforts between the central government, state governments and industry stakeholders.

As demand for power, compute and hyperscale data centers surges, Palantir is positioning the platform as a foundational tool for the next era of U.S. industrial growth.

The company says the real bottleneck to AI progress is no longer the models themselves, but the energy and compute capacity required to run them at scale. Chain Reaction is designed to bridge this gap by linking utilities, energy producers, construction firms, and data center operators through a unified system built for unprecedented load and operational complexity.

According to Palantir, the platform is engineered to help transform outdated generation resources into high-uptime systems, stabilize the grid under massive new demand, speed up construction of new generation and transmission assets, and standardize future hyperscale data center design.

“The energy infrastructure buildout is the industrial challenge of our generation,” said Tristan Gruska, Palantir’s Head of Energy and Infrastructure. “But the software that the sector relies on was not built for this moment. We have spent years quietly deploying systems that keep power plants running and grids reliable. Chain Reaction is the result of building from the ground up for the demands of AI.”

CenterPoint Energy Expands Its Partnership

CenterPoint Energy — serving roughly 7 million customers across Texas, Indiana, Minnesota, and Ohio — is one of the platform’s founding partners. After Hurricane Beryl’s impact in 2024, the utility ramped up investments in resilience, selecting Palantir as its software backbone. Now, CenterPoint is leveraging Chain Reaction to accelerate “speed-to-power” and gain deeper operational visibility across its system.

“Never before have technology and energy been so intertwined in determining the future course of American innovation, commercial growth, and economic security. In the Greater Houston region, our energy consumption is projected to increase by nearly 50% in five years and double by the mid 2030s. This exponential growth is being driven by a diverse set of sectors, including high tech, healthcare, energy, industrial, pharmaceutical, and fleet, and is accelerating job creation across the communities we are privileged to serve. We are excited to team with Palantir and our other Chain Reaction partners to enable this future sooner,” said Jason Wells, Chair & Chief Executive Officer of CenterPoint Energy.

NVIDIA Partnership Deepens

NVIDIA, already collaborating with Palantir on operational AI systems, is expanding its involvement through Chain Reaction. By integrating NVIDIA’s accelerated computing stack — including Nemotron models, CUDA-X libraries, and Palantir’s AIP and Ontology — the initiative aims to streamline the complex supply chain behind gigawatt-scale “AI factories.”

“A new industrial revolution has begun—one where intelligence is manufactured at scale through an extraordinarily complex supply chain of AI infrastructure, now being built across America to strengthen our economy, workforce and security,” said Vladimir Troy, vice president, AI Infrastructure, NVIDIA. “By partnering with Palantir and our ecosystem, we are accelerating this transformation—powering the engines of the AI age, transforming data into intelligence and securing America’s technology leadership for decades to come.”

A Nationwide Buildout for the AI Era

Chain Reaction sits at the intersection of energy, construction, and digital infrastructure. The platform’s goal is to unify real-time operations, planning, and predictive analytics so that new power plants, transmission lines, and data centers can be built faster and operated with fewer disruptions.

Palantir framed the launch as a turning point for America’s ability to meet future AI-driven electricity demand. With load forecasts climbing rapidly — often by triple digits in fast-growing regions — utilities and developers are looking for tools that help compress timelines and improve reliability.

The company stresses that Chain Reaction is designed for reproducibility, enabling standardized hyperscale builds across multiple locations. By coordinating permitting, supply chains, construction, and grid interconnection in a single system, Palantir says developers can move from concept to megawatts more efficiently.

The announcement also underscores Palantir’s broader push into critical infrastructure, government systems, and industrial AI deployments. As energy systems become more digitally intertwined with compute infrastructure, Palantir is positioning itself as one of the key software players shaping the backbone of America’s AI economy.",,N,,2025-12-08 01:00:36.872858

Wood wants to increase food accessibility among Fort Worth youth through agriculture and environmental stewardship by using the green space at the 150 acres of the now defunct Woodhaven Country Club and golf course.

His environmental nonprofit Econautics aims to use the east Fort Worth site to foster connectivity to nature among children and families.

“That’s the goal,” Wood said. “It could meaningfully increase the quality of life for youth in the neighborhood.”

Crescendo Development, the company that now owns the acreage at the Woodhaven golf course, is one step closer to its vision for agriculture, housing and retail at the site now that Econautics has signed on.

The nonprofit is the first organization to put the land to use after Crescendo received approval from city officials in October for its preliminary plan to create the mixed-use development that faced some pushback from neighbors who worried about the traffic and density it would bring.

“We want to preserve as much green space as possible while having an economically viable project,” Crescendo Development owner and founder Will Northern said. “Econautics will serve as a healthy, holistic draw that will show it is possible to have agricultural-type uses adjacent to development.”

Bridging the gap

Econautics leased out 10 acres of the Woodhaven property in November with plans to use former warehouses and sheds to teach families and youth how to garden and grow quality produce, Wood said.

Fields of crops and greenhouses will also dot the land.

“We want to help bridge the gap in the food safety net in our country and my hometown of Fort Worth,” he said.

Econautics launched in 2012 with the mission of educating the public on how to apply sustainable practices into business operations in response to environmental concerns, such as poor water quality.

Now it focuses on environmental stewardship and teaching youth how to use clean technology to promote sustainable food production. Sustainable agriculture is an approach aimed at producing food while protecting the environment and expanding natural resources.

Plans for Woodhaven will involve assistance from a nurse practitioner and nutritionists to bring Econautics’ “outdoor kitchen” to life, Wood said.

Meanwhile, accessing the green space at the site will help improve the quality of life for east Fort Worth’s youth, he added, noting that Quanah Parker Park is the only park in Woodhaven now.

“Connecting with nature, that’s one of the things we’d like to have on-site,” he said.

Having grown up playing outdoors, hiking, and swimming in ponds, Wood wants other children to have a similar experience as they grow healthy foods, learn about environmental science and become grounded in nature at the former golf course.

“These are all things that promote longevity and address chronic diseases, which is a huge strain on the health care system and especially these communities,” Wood said.

Mixed feelings

Crescendo’s plans to revitalize the area drew mixed reactions from the public. Some neighbors opposed the project saying they worried about the increase in traffic and impact on the environment from building single-family homes, apartments and shops in the area.

Keith Larson, Woodhaven Neighborhood Association vice president, is looking forward to the environmental education Econautics will make available to youth.

“To show people in a not terribly big piece of property that you can actually grow and cultivate food that you can eat is a pretty exciting opportunity,” Larson said.

He finds Crescendo has done an “admirable job” of meeting with nearby residents to learn more about what they want to see at the site, which he said includes the light revitalization of a golf course and trails to access the Trinity River and Quanah Parker Park.

“There’s a lot of opportunity in the plan there, and we hope very much that the vision is going to play out as explained,” Larson added.

However, other residents believe Crescendo’s plans to increase retailers and business would not serve the neighborhood.

Woodhaven resident Erika Graham finds it “inappropriate” to develop a commercial space in a densely populated residential area.

Her concerns also stem from how the neighborhood’s tax increment financing district’s funds will be applied to the redevelopment of the golf course.

“While the apartment owners may be paying into the (TIF), it is ultimately the apartment residents that are out of pocket for it,” Graham said.

She and other residents would have preferred the city purchased the land and lightly redevelop the area with amenities such as an event venue, walking trails and a community center for neighborhood members to meet.

“However this property is developed, it needs to include amenities for all Woodhaven residents,” Graham said.

Envisioning Woodhaven’s future

Econautics’ mission aligns with Northern’s goals of preserving green space and nature while also being business-friendly, he said.

Whatever changes may come for Woodhaven, Crescendo Development wants to incorporate as much nature as possible into the site’s future, Northern said.

Even where new housing will be built, they’ll be designed to maintain green space, he said. While the golf course has not been in operation for several years, Crescendo has identified a large parcel of the area to become a smaller golf course.

Sitting on the left edge of the acreage is potential parkland, Northern said. While development of that parcel relies on public funds, he hopes to one day revamp the land to become a park, amplifying green space in the Woodhaven area.

“I want to … bring out and preserve those beautiful areas that make this place so special,” he said.

There are 27,000 known brownfields, or sites contaminated with pollutants, dotting Michigan. Many of them are locations where factories once stood.

About half are what the state calls “orphan sites,” meaning there’s no responsible party that owns the land and would otherwise have to clean up the pollutants, said Phil Roos, the director of the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.

“Sometimes people don’t even want to touch it if they don’t know the nature of the contamination or can’t address it,” Roos said.

That’s why the state is funding restoration projects, offering developers grants of up to $2 million, he said.

The grants cover assessing what the contaminants are, the best ways of removing them and often helping with the first stage of clean up, Roos said.

“Because we have a lot of these sites around the state, we need to de-risk it by providing some funding that will allow whoever’s developing the site to raise capital to do the development, knowing that it’s safe and they don’t have to address those issues any further,” he said.

The grants stem from the state budget for RenewMI which allocates $77 million. RenewMI is the department’s environmental remediation program.

When brownfields are cleaned up, they can be revitalized and turned into new housing developments, parks, commercial establishments or new industrialization.

The Lugnuts Stadium in Lansing, home to a minor league professional baseball team, is on a former brownfield, Roos said.

Since 2019, the state has been funding brownfield cleanup. The department has done 474 redevelopment projects in 50 communities, leading to $184 million in incentives and creating over 20,000 jobs, he said.

Those projects included the Grayling Northern Market and the Grayling Sawmill in 2018. The Grayling Northern Market used to be a planing mill and lumber yard, while the sawmill was a hotel, saloon and stores.

There have been four brownfield clean-up projects since 2020 in Traverse City. The most recent project in 2025 is Grandview Vision.

The site used to be an ice cream factory, and an antique store is on the property next door, according to Environment, Great Lakes and Energy’s website.

Cadillac has also seen four brownfield projects, including one in 2025 to clean up a former dry cleaners, grocery store and retail buildings.

In the past year, there has been an influx of housing developments built on cleaned-up brownfields. Roos said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has made those projects a priority because of the state’s housing shortage.

“We can, in many cases, make it so there’s no threat to public safety and turn them into beautiful places to live,” he said.

However, not every brownfield site is equal, said Mike Witkowski, the director of environmental and regulatory policy at the Michigan Manufacturers Association.

Some “legacy sites” like abandoned gas stations and factories have contaminated an area to the point where the amount of money needed to clean it for residential development is unrealistic, he said.

There are different standards that dictate what brownfield sites can be used for while helping to prevent human exposure to harmful chemical pollutants, he said.

Those especially contaminated sites can still be cleaned up to meet standards for things like new industrial development.

“If you can come through and say, ‘All right, let’s turn this into a parking lot or another industrial setting and keep it at those standards’ – that’s really not only the best way to handle those contaminants, but it’s also the most economically sound for the state and private investment,” Witkowski said.He said the number of existing brownfields makes it impossible for the state to clean all of them, meaning private developers cleaning up sites is all the more important.

“One of the best things we can do is have a robust and and really well-functioning brownfield redevelopment program that allows these new private investment dollars to come in and say, ‘Hey, we want to build here on this site and not only are we going to provide jobs, but we’re also going to help clean up the the contaminants there and make this space usable property again,’” Witkowski said.

The Michigan Manufacturing Association opposes a bill currently in the Michigan Senate that would add additional clean-up standards, and extend liability for developers, saying it would likely discourage private investment into brownfields, he said.

“It really complicates it in a problematic way, which we feel is going to lead to less cleanups and less investment in our industrial sites and really more expansion into green space developments where there’s never been a development or any industry before,” Witkowski said.

He said the current brownfield program as it stands has been sufficiently vetted by the state and environmental engineers. It’s helped the economy grow across the state and has been successfully cleaning up contaminated sites.

“To try and bring that in a little bit or make change is going to hurt the trajectory of our environmental cleanups and economic growth,” Witkowski said.",https://greatlakesecho.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/36911_404499488300_92573353300_4464360_1537553_n_bigger.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 01:58:44.602952

Farmers have experienced multibillion-dollar export declines in some of their largest trading markets, including China.
As farmers were harvesting a crop, many of them didn’t have storage and had to sell at harvest-time lows,” Newton said.
Ethanol Could Fuel Economic Rebound At a time when the farm economy is facing a downward turn, farmers are looking for expanded market opportunities.
Increased biofuel production could be one avenue to boost farm revenue and support the entire rural economy.","U.S. farm income is under immense pressure as input costs have increased dramatically while crop prices have fallen sharply — resulting in margins that have been at or below break-even for several consecutive years.

Farmers urgently need economic assistance, according to a new Market Intel report from the American Farm Bureau Federation.

The key takeaways of the report are:

• Farm financial stress is severe and persistent. Margins are below break-even for many crops, working capital has been eroded, Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies are on the rise and, according to a recent survey of commercial lenders by the American Bankers Association, profits will remain elusive going into 2026.

•​​​​​​​ Trade losses have compounded economic pressures. Farmers have experienced multibillion-dollar export declines in some of their largest trading markets, including China. Trade frameworks have been announced, but increased export volumes have yet to materialize and cash prices remain at or below levels seen in early 2025.

•​​​​​​​ Without action, long-term viability is at risk. Additional financial support is critical to offset trade losses and provide a bridge until farm bill enhancements from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” go into effect. This will stabilize the farm economy, sustain rural economies and maintain affordable food prices.

“Input costs have increased dramatically over the last few years — up in some cases 30%, 40%, 50% — but at the same time, commodity prices have come crashing down. For many crops they’re at historically low levels,” said John Newton, AFBF vice president of public policy and economic analysis.

“Trade has slowed, and the effect is we’ve had margins that have been at or below break-even for many crops and specialty crops for many years in a row, and that’s starting to impact farm financial conditions.”

Trade losses heightened the challenges in an already difficult economic environment.

“As the Chinese backed out of the market, that put further pressure on prices. As farmers were harvesting a crop, many of them didn’t have storage and had to sell at harvest-time lows,” Newton said.

“So, even though we’ve got a framework in place and the Chinese are starting to buy product, for a lot of growers, the economic benefits of these frameworks may come too late.”

While some help was made available in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed by President Donald Trump on the Fourth of July and the American Relief Act, which was signed by President Joe Biden last December and mainly served as yet another one-year extension of the 2018 farm bill, that assistance won’t reach farmers until some time next year.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pledged $12 billion in economic support to help offset trade losses, Newton said.

“We hope to see details of that in the next few weeks, but the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ while it made a historic investment in farm bill risk-management programs, those benefits won’t materialize on the farm for over a year,” he said.

Ethanol Could Fuel Economic Rebound

At a time when the farm economy is facing a downward turn, farmers are looking for expanded market opportunities. Increased biofuel production could be one avenue to boost farm revenue and support the entire rural economy.

One simple solution for expanding biofuel demand would be to allow for year-round E15 in American gas pumps.

Most gasoline sold across the country is blended with 10% ethanol, but 15% blends are becoming increasingly common, particularly here in the Midwest, where most corn is grown. By the way, E15 gasoline generally costs at least 10 cents less a gallon than E10 gasoline.

But the Environmental Protection Agency has previously prohibited its sale during the summer over concerns that its use during that driving season could increase smog.

For the economic and energy security benefits of E15 to be fully realized, the marketplace needs long-term certainty — and there’s a straightforward path to make this possibility a reality.

Right now, the ethanol industry relies on the EPA to grant a series of short-term waivers to sell E15 in the summers.

A congressional fix to get year-round E15 that does not rely on those emergency waivers would allow producers to have some stability and know that they will be able to blend ethanol all year.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/lONFG1BYH-xDXfgrRKMhsqV7Ap0=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/S5JV6SGRY5HBZOZMK2NCS2SZ7Y.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 20:58:49.985713

But experts say ERCOT is still in a stronger position than it was during the deadly 2021 winter storm.

The findings come just days before ERCOT's board of directors meets to discuss how large energy-hungry facilities, including data centers and cryptocurrency mines, are reshaping electricity demand across the state.

According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, winter electricity demand continues to rise across the ERCOT region, driven in part by the growth of 24/7 data centers powering AI systems and other high-tech operations.

NERC's 2025–2026 Winter Reliability Assessment warns that these facilities are ""reshaping"" when Texans use power. Because data centers run around the clock, the report says they are flattening the daily load curve, stretching peak demand periods into longer windows — particularly before sunrise and after sunset, when solar isn't available.

The assessment shows ERCOT has enough capacity under normal conditions, but in an extreme cold scenario, the grid could face tighter reserves, similar to what the state experienced during Winter Storm Uri.

""If a storm comes through like we had in February of 2021, ERCOT estimates a 20% likelihood of rolling blackouts,"" Hirs said. ""That's a lot better than last year's estimate of 80%.""

According to ERCOT's Monthly Outlook for Resource Adequacy for January 2026, the grid operator's highest-risk hour this winter is around 8 a.m., when cold morning temperatures coincide with little or no solar production. ERCOT estimates just a 1.4% chance of issuing an Energy Emergency Alert during that peak hour under normal conditions — far below the emergency conditions Texans experienced nearly five years ago.

Hirs says the strain on the grid isn't only from data centers. Cryptocurrency mining — another high-power, round-the-clock industry — has become one of Texas' biggest electricity users.

""The cryptocurrency miners now in the past year have used as much electricity as El Paso and the city of San Antonio,"" Hirs said. ""Now, just in 2021, that was up to the level of Austin.""

Many of those companies are planning to bring their own on-site power generation, which could help ease pressure on the statewide grid.

""Most of them are working to bring their own electricity generation with them,"" Hirs said. ""Texas has been fortunate with a huge build-out of wind, solar, and batteries, so we're better able to absorb these new data centers — at least for the time being.""

ERCOT's board will meet Tuesday in Austin to discuss and address the issue of large electronic loads, a category that includes both data centers and crypto mining operations.

Britain's National Energy System Operator will prioritise grid connection for the most viable power generation and storage projects in a huge overhaul of the system, it said on Monday, designed to root out zombie projects clogging up the process.

Britain has a target to largely decarbonise its power sector by 2030 which will require many more renewable power plants such as wind and solar which will need to be connected to the electricity grid.

The government has also said it wants the country to become an artificial intelligence “superpower” which will require grid connection for power-hungry data centres.

The overhaul replaces a first-come, first-served system that had created a queue of more than 700 gigawatts of projects seeking connection - four times the amount Britain needs to meet its 2030 clean power targets.

""These changes will cut grid bottlenecks by prioritising ready-to-build projects, giving certainty about when and where they can connect and unlocking billions in clean energy investment,"" Kayte O’Neill, NESO Chief Operating Officer, said.

Under the new process, projects with planning permission, land rights and alignment with national energy goals will be fast-tracked for connection.

Around 3,000 grid connection applications were assessed, with 132 GW identified as crucial for meeting the government's Clean Power 2030 target and a further 151 GW needed by 2035.

A further 99 GW of projects seeking power from the grid, such as data centres, will also be prioritised for connection, NESO said.

More than 300 GW of projects will not advance, having failed to demonstrate readiness or alignment with national objectives, it said.

Britain's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government inherited ""a broken system where zombie projects were allowed to hold up grid connections for viable projects.""

The reforms follow months of collaboration between NESO, network operators, industry, regulator Ofgem and government officials, NESO said.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 22:00:13.627836

It’s just a society deciding that health care is part of the common good – like roads, schools, or clean water.
Here in America, we’ve built something powerful – some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world.
In the country with the largest economy in the world, we still treat health care like a privilege to be earned.
We’ve built a system where survival comes with fine print, where you can buy a truck on credit more easily than you can see a specialist.","I’ve been thinking a lot about what it really costs to stay alive in this country. Not in the spiritual sense – in the literal one. The bills. The trade-offs. The quiet math families do when pain meets the price tag.

When I was 20, I broke my ankle. I had insurance. I did everything I was supposed to. Still, I’m paying for it – literally – years later. The surgery cost nearly $50,000. Even with insurance, I owed more than $10,000 out of pocket – payments that stretched on long after my leg healed.

More recently, I hurt my wrist chopping firewood to heat our home. My first thought wasn’t “how bad is it?” it was “can I afford to get this looked at?”

That’s the part people outside this reality don’t understand. It’s not the injury that breaks you, it’s the hesitation. The pause before asking for help because you already know the answer: it depends on your deductible.

Across the Shenandoah Valley where I live, people make this same calculation. Can I afford to get better?

We don’t talk about it much, but the numbers tell the story plain: about four in 10 adults in America carry medical or dental debt, and rural folks are more likely to struggle with it than people living in urban areas. Research shows medical problems and bills are among the leading contributors to personal bankruptcy. And for about seven in 10 adults with health care debt, the bills came from a one-time or short-term medical expense – a single hospital visit, an ER trip, or an unexpected procedure. One broken bone. One bad diagnosis. One stroke of bad luck, and your whole future can tip.

You learn to live smaller after that, to stretch prescriptions, to work through pain, to keep quiet about what hurts. To walk around with the silent fear that your body might betray your budget.

We’ve all become experts at pretending the system is normal, because it’s the only one we’ve ever known. But it’s not normal, it’s a choice.

Other nations – Norway, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, just to name a few – have made different choices about how to care for their people. None of them are perfect, and they’re not all the same. But they’ve each decided on one simple idea: getting sick shouldn’t mean going broke.

These countries pay for it in different ways, some through higher taxes, some through shared insurance systems, but the result is the same: people don’t have to hesitate before calling a doctor when something’s wrong. It’s not socialism. It’s just a society deciding that health care is part of the common good – like roads, schools, or clean water.

When I spoke recently with journalists from Norway and Sweden, they told me what care looks like where they live.

In Norway, a hospital stay doesn’t come with a payment plan. Education is free, prescriptions are affordable, and families don’t go bankrupt because a child gets sick.

People still work hard – farmers, factory workers, teachers – but they do it knowing one injury or illness won’t destroy everything they’ve built.

They pay more in taxes, but what they get in return is peace of mind. They don’t hesitate before calling the doctor. They don’t lie awake wondering if this month’s paycheck will cover both medicine and the electric bill.

It’s not a perfect system, none are, but it’s one built on the idea that care is a shared responsibility, not a luxury.

Here in America, we’ve built something powerful – some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world. But access to them depends on what’s in your wallet.

Unfortunately, we also end up paying more for worse results by almost every measure: lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, and higher rates of chronic illness than other wealthy nations. In the country with the largest economy in the world, we still treat health care like a privilege to be earned. We’ve built a system where survival comes with fine print, where you can buy a truck on credit more easily than you can see a specialist.

I don’t bring this up as a political argument. This isn’t about right or left, it’s about right or wrong.

It’s about neighbors, parents, co-workers – about the next time you hear someone cough in a quiet room and realize how fragile we all are – how easily health can become debt.

When I think about the future I think about my children and how I want them to inherit something better than this quiet cruelty. I want them to live in a country where care isn’t a privilege you earn but a promise we keep to one another.

Because someday, it won’t just be a headline. It’ll be someone you love sitting in an exam room, staring at a clipboard, doing the math in their head.

Wondering if healing is something they can afford.

We can do better than that.

We have to.

Because in the land of plenty, no one should have to go broke just to stay alive.

Hi there! Welcome to Ed’s Clean Energy & Sustainability Jobs List, where we know climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels such as gasoline, coal, oil, and fossil gas (“natural” gas), and that burning fossil gas in our homes makes us sick.

There are 83 jobs and internships in the full version of the newsletter this week.

Access to jobs that require less than five years experience or that are located outside of the U.S. are and will remain free. There are individual subscriptions ($7/month or $70/year) available as well as career center subscriptions ($300/year). College student? Please ask your career center to sign up for a paid subscription, especially if they pointed you here. Odds are they have not subscribed.

Want to support the jobs list, but can’t swing a subscription? I started an affiliate bookshop on Bookshop.org that will send me a small affiliate bonus if you purchase books using this link (https://bookshop.org/shop/EdsCleanJobs). I also included a selection of books that I’ve enjoyed that address climate change and climate solutions. You can also send me a one-time payment/tip using this link.

What I'm reading this week:

Colorado mandates ambitious emissions cuts for its gas utilities (Alison Takemura, Canary Media).

Cooking with gas gets more expensive as Americans face rising prices into 2026 (Oliver Milman, The Guardian).

Natural gas use for electricity in California falls as solar generation rises (Andrew Iraola, U.S. Energy Information Agency, Today in Energy). The 2025 chart from this article is really interesting because it shows batteries responding to the infamous ‘duck curve’. Not to mention the way solar and batteries are starting to eat fossil gas’s lunch.

A Wildfire Survivors Want to Rebuild All-Electric, but a Utility Is Using Customer Funds to Incentivize Gas Appliances (Hilary Beaumont, Inside Climate News). California residents - the CPUC has an open public comment period on this matter. The article includes a link and details.

Environmental (in)justice articles of the week:

New Analysis Provides More Evidence That Heat Standards Save Lives (Liza Gross, Inside Climate News)

The community has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in Chicago and risks becoming a food desert. Additionally, the area has a 13% unemployment rate, nearly double the Chicago average.

Green Era Campus aims to breathe new life into the community, and Chicago at large, through the transformation of a 9-acre vacant brownfield site into a renewable energy and urban farming campus. The organization envisions creating green energy and jobs, providing fresh produce, offering small business incubation and educational programming on its campus, and bringing community green space to the Auburn Gresham area.

The project uses a unique, closed-loop approach to drive economic development and sustainability initiatives, including tackling the problems of food waste. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, food waste is the largest solid waste stream reaching landfills in the US, with Chicago alone producing 55 million pounds of food waste per month. Green Era has developed an anaerobic digester that will recycle inedible food waste to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) and nutrient-rich compost. The project will provide the compost created by the digester at low cost to farmers throughout Chicago. This compost will also be used on the project’s urban farm, which is expected to grow over 26,000 pounds of produce annually.

“We want to show how closed-loop digester systems benefit the environment as well as the community,” said Jason Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Green Era Sustainability, a partner in Green Era Campus. “Green Era hopes to be at the forefront of what’s next for sustainable, equitable urban development.”

With our experience in low-carbon energy, our lawyers were able to provide pro bono support to Green Era on a range of projects, most notably preparing an RNG offtake agreement that allowed the project to optimize the creation of its anaerobic digester.

Our engagement with Green Era is part of a broader effort to support individuals and organizations advancing sustainability worldwide.

We also assisted Green Era in interconnecting with a nearby natural gas pipeline, where it will inject the RNG created by its anaerobic digester. With this interconnection, Green Era can sell the RNG it generates to create revenue to support its urban food waste recycling and urban farming operations. The interconnection agreement was finalized in December 2023, and Green Era is now able to inject the RNG it produces into the fossil natural gas pipeline system. In further support of the project’s closed-loop system, our lawyers are helping Green Era negotiate a solar power purchase agreement and associated lease. As of April 2025, the self-sustaining anaerobic digester is fully operational.

“By starting from a community-oriented perspective, Green Era is taking a holistic approach to environmental sustainability,” said partner Josh Bledsoe, who oversees the Latham team working with the organization. “Green Era’s approach is truly unique, serving as a model not just for Chicago, but for cities across the United States.”

“Creating a community-centered climate-resilient hub is not only timely as we collectively understand the need for clean and renewable energy, but also the daily need in our neighborhoods for health-affirming food that can be grown by everyone. Most importantly, we hope that through the project our youth see the potential for their participation in green initiatives, as well as career and academic pathways,” said Erika Allen, founder and CEO for Urban Growers Collective, and president of Green ERA Educational NFP.

Following the completion of the anaerobic digester, our lawyers are assisting Green Era with feedstock supply agreements in order for the organization to develop a sustainable and efficient food waste management solution.",https://www.lw.com/assets/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-07 19:02:06.974443

The petition requests that the EPA add microplastics to its unregulated contaminants list, which is a list of emerging contaminants not currently required to be monitored under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.
The rule would allow data to be collected on microplastics and for the development of a monitoring program for drinking water across the country.
Renkoski said the current drinking water treatment systems were not designed for PFAS or for microplastics.
“In the few testings that have been done with drinking water, we are definitely seeing microplastics,” Renkoski said.","Governor Gretchen Whitmer and six other governors have signed a petition urging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to monitor and collect data on microplastics.

The petition requests that the EPA add microplastics to its unregulated contaminants list, which is a list of emerging contaminants not currently required to be monitored under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.

Being added to the list means that microplastics would fall under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR). The rule would allow data to be collected on microplastics and for the development of a monitoring program for drinking water across the country.

The governors said a provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to place microplastics on the monitoring list because the petitionhas the signatures of seven governors. Michigan’s Whitmer joins governors — all Democratic — from New Jersey, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Wisconsin, and Connecticut.

Tami Renkoski, the co-founder of the Michigan Microplastics Coalition, said she was “thrilled” that Governor Whitmer signed the petition. “We appreciate all the work she has done to protect our Great Lakes and our beautiful state of Michigan,” she said.

Renkoski said the current drinking water treatment systems were not designed for PFAS or for microplastics. “So there would need to be some work done to get systems up to speed to remove those contaminants,” she said.

Renkoski said because microplastics are an emerging contaminant, researchers are still working on determining the maximum amount of microplastics people can consume before it becomes dangerous. “In the few testings that have been done with drinking water, we are definitely seeing microplastics,” Renkoski said. “But how much is too much, we don’t know yet.”

Microplastics are pervasive. Renkoski said they’ve been found in all parts of the human body and in fish in the Great Lakes. “It's like we have the faucet and the bathtub turned on, and it's overflowing,” she said. “It's nonstop. We have created so many plastic products, they're everywhere.”

Research on microplastic health and environmental effects is ongoing. Renkoski said they won’t know the extent of the problem until more data is gathered on microplastics.

Daines Pushes for Repeal",Tristan Scott,,,,,https://flatheadbeacon.com/2025/12/07/as-conservation-groups-rally-support-for-roadless-rule-sen-daines-pushes-for-repeal/,"Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., the Roadless Area Conservation Act (RACA) would protect nearly 60 million acres of national forestland.
The legislation would codify the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Rule) as well as the Colorado and Idaho Roadless Rules that collectively protect nearly 60 million acres of roadless national forest land in 39 states, including Montana.
“Senator Daines supports repealing the Roadless Rule,” according to an emailed statement from the spokesperson.
Established under the Clinton administration and enacted in 2001, the Roadless Rule generally prohibits road building and logging in all 58.5 million acres of national forest roadless areas.
Later that year, President Clinton instructed the agency to undertake a rulemaking process to provide long-term administrative protection for roadless areas.","Despite a growing chorus of conservation advocates calling on Montana’s congressional delegates to defend roadless wildlands through permanent protections, a bill to do so seems unlikely to advance without Republican support, including that of U.S. Sen. Steve Daines.

A Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee on which Daines serves held a hearing Dec. 2 to consider a slate of 26 public lands and wildfire bills, among them a measure to enshrine the decades-old Roadless Rule into law. Re-introduced in June by U.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., the Roadless Area Conservation Act (RACA) would protect nearly 60 million acres of national forestland. Although it has failed before, its supporters say this version comes at a pivotal moment as the Trump administration moves to roll back safeguards introduced in 2001.

Hoping to capitalize on the blitz of bipartisan support that last summer helped cleave a public land sale provision out of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act — a moment when Montana’s Republican-led congressional delegation stood in uniform opposition to the sale — conservation groups this week mounted a similar pressure campaign on Daines.

“If Daines chooses to stop RACA while supporting the Roadless Rule rollback, he’ll expose how empty his public-land promises are,” according to a statement from Wild Montana Federal Policy Director Hilary Eisen. The nonprofit environmental group was among a coalition of more than 200 organizations to urge committee leadership to support RACA in a Dec. 2 letter.

The legislation would codify the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Rule) as well as the Colorado and Idaho Roadless Rules that collectively protect nearly 60 million acres of roadless national forest land in 39 states, including Montana.

Daines and his fellow Republican delegates from the Treasure State received plaudits from the conservation community after joining ranks with a bipartisan coalition to hobble the land selloff provision. U.S. House Rep. Ryan Zinke even led the charge against the sale in the House before Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, revived the provision in the Senate, putting all eyes on Daines and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy, who both stood firm and eventually wore Lee into submission.

Further burnishing his conservation credentials, Daines recently joined the bipartisan Senate Stewardship Caucus, pledging to “be [a] good steward of the land we’re blessed to live in.”

“This is his moment to prove he means it,” Eisen said. “The Roadless Area Conservation Act is a common-sense, fiscally responsible measure that protects our roadless wildlands by preventing reckless road-building and unnecessary logging, ensuring that our remote, backcountry areas remain intact for wildlife, recreation, and clean water.”

But if Daines was swayed by the political pressure earlier this year, he’s not bending to any calls for him to reverse his position on the Roadless Rule now, particularly after hailing its repeal as “another huge win for Montana and forest management.”

On Dec. 5, a spokesperson confirmed that Montana’s senior senator has not softened his stance.

“Senator Daines supports repealing the Roadless Rule,” according to an emailed statement from the spokesperson. “This action by the Trump administration is a huge win for Montana and will allow us to better manage our forests and protect our communities from catastrophic wildfires.”

The statement from Daines mirrored testimony that committee members heard Dec. 2 from U.S. Forest Service Acting Associate Chief Chris French who said the Roadless Rule has created “barriers to protecting the communities from wildland fire risk.”

“There’s more than 24 million acres of the wildland urban interface that are either within roadless or within a mile of roadless, of which we are restricted from how we treat those areas other than, let’s say, using prescribed fire access,” French said.

When pressed by Sen. Martin Heinrich, the committee’s ranking Democrat from New Mexico, about the “substantial amounts of those roadless areas being treated for fire prevention,” French clarified that the Roadless Rule doesn’t prohibit treatment, but rather “limits the type of activities that you can do” and makes fuels reduction work cumbersome and more expensive.

“Oftentimes, when you’re doing field production work, the actual value that is coming out of those materials is minimal compared to the actual cost of doing that,” French said. “So, in order for us to do more acres and create broader areas of treatments, we need to do the most efficient treatments that we can, providing access and providing the ability to get in there and do that is the way to make that happen. Otherwise, those costs for doing that work are extremely, extremely expensive.”

In northwest Montana, proponents of the Roadless Rule say that framing it as a barrier to active forest management is a mischaracterization, and that, while its value as a conservation tool is unmatched — in Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, for instance, eliminating the Roadless Rule would remove critical safeguards against logging and roadbuilding across 9 million undeveloped acres — its genesis was born of utility and agency efficiency rather than an advocacy apparatus to obstruct.

Established under the Clinton administration and enacted in 2001, the Roadless Rule generally prohibits road building and logging in all 58.5 million acres of national forest roadless areas. It makes exceptions to access non-federal land inholdings and pre-existing mineral leases, and it allows some logging to reduce fire risk, improve habitat or aid in the recovery of endangered species, including whitebark pine. The primary thrust of the federal rulemaking initiative was geared toward reining in the scale of road-building activities by the Forest Service, which maintains eight times more miles of road than the Interstate Highway System.

The impetus for the Roadless Rule tracks back to 1998, when former U.S. Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck saw the agency’s vast and poorly maintained road system as a major environmental and fiscal problem and proposed a temporary moratorium on road construction in inventoried roadless areas across most of the National Forest System. At the time, the agency’s road maintenance and reconstruction backlog had ballooned to $8.4 billion while it received only 20% of the annual funding needed to maintain the existing road system to current environmental and safety standards.

The agency adopted an 18-month moratorium in February 1999, pending completion of an overall road management policy. Later that year, President Clinton instructed the agency to undertake a rulemaking process to provide long-term administrative protection for roadless areas. Over the next 14 months, the Forest Service conducted an extensive public involvement process that produced 1.7 million comments, with the majority favoring a strong national policy protecting roadless areas.

The Flathead National Forest includes an inventoried roadless area spanning 478,000 acres, mostly flanking the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area along the Swan Range, as well as west of the North Fork Flathead River in the Whitefish Range. In the Kootenai National Forest, about 639,000 roadless acres border the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness.

During the committee hearing on Dec. 2, Sen. Cantwell said the U.S. Forest Service’s support of repealing the Roadless Rule seems counterintuitive given that the agency is still struggling to maintain its sprawling inventory of roads and clear a $5.9 billion maintenance backlog.

“Instead of the Forest Service maintaining the existing system this administration wants to rescind the long-standing roadless rule to potentially build more roads that the Forest Service won’t be able to take care of,” Cantwell said.

According to French, the Roadless Rule “doesn’t compel road construction.”

“The primary driver is that there’s more than 24 million acres that are within our wildland urban interface that we can’t effectively treat right now,” French said.

Reiterating the importance of including the public in policy decisions, Heinrich, the senator from New Mexico, encouraged French to “have a robust public process before making these decisions” to repeal the 24-year-old administrative rule. At the time of the rule’s promulgation, more than 600 public hearings were held across the country and 1.6 million Americans expressed public support.

“You called the Roadless Rule a barrier. Do you know what sportsmen in New Mexico call the roadless areas that are protected in our state?” Heinrich asked French. “They call it elk habitat.”",https://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251116_MORAN_CABIN_160.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 17:59:46.495224

There is a cost when culture war narratives are placed at the center of national security doctrine.
National security analysis becomes less coherent when ideological boundaries define the set of acceptable conclusions.
A national security strategy grounded in the realities of the twenty first century would look different from the one offered in 2025.
The US 2025 national security strategy is the document of an empire in decline, thrashing as it fades.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

A national security strategy is supposed to describe the world as it is and explain how a country intends to navigate the constraints and opportunities in front of it. It is meant to be a map, not a message, and certainly not a mirror held up to a single political identity. The 2025 US national security strategy, released on December 4th, tries to present a unified view of American power but the foundation on which it rests is out of alignment with the physical, economic and geopolitical forces that will shape this century. A strategy built on a foundation of illusions becomes more fragile over time. The gap between the world described in this document and the world visible in the data is so wide that it is doomed to fail.

A good strategy begins with a diagnosis of reality. Richard Rumelt has argued for years that strategy is impossible without a sound understanding of the problem a leader is trying to solve. The current document offers a diagnosis that is framed through cultural and civilizational anxieties rather than observable global trends. Electrification, renewable generation, battery storage, demographic diversification, science driven migration flows, the institutional realignment of middle powers, and the emergence of new industrial supply chains are barely acknowledged. These are the forces reshaping global systems. A national security strategy is supposed to engage with these forces directly. Instead, it adopts a posture rooted in defensive cultural narratives that do not match the underlying physics or economics. This is the point where strategic drift begins.

The strategy attempts to anchor American strength in a vision of energy dominance based on oil, gas and nuclear energy. The world is moving in a different direction. Electric vehicles continue to climb in market share. Battery costs continue to fall on learning curves that have proven durable for two decades. Solar and wind generation are the cheapest sources of new electricity everywhere. Countries that rely on fossil imports are trying to replace them because volatility is expensive and electrified systems offer more control. Electricity as a commodity is becoming more central to every economic sector. High voltage transmission, long duration storage, flexible grids and clean industrial heat are the new strategic assets. Oil and gas exporters can still earn revenue during the transition but their leverage over other states diminishes as electrification spreads. Nuclear energy remains part of the mix but its export pathways are slow and capital heavy. A strategy that claims long term dominance through fossil exports is aiming at a shrinking target while the rest of the world invests in the next system.

The strategy’s focus on energy dominance overlooks the internal contradictions created by trying to satisfy both export driven revenue ambitions and the promise of cheap domestic energy for reshored industry. Higher exports pull U.S. oil and gas prices toward global market levels, which raises costs for industry and households at home. The shale sector adds another constraint. Producers have already exploited many of the highest profit sites, and new wells tend to decline faster and cost more to drill. This means the country is at the plateau of economically extractable oil and gas under current conditions. Maintaining high output becomes more expensive over time. Pursuing dominance through exports will therefore push domestic prices upward even as the underlying resource base becomes harder to develop. The alternative pathway, which relies on the continued expansion of renewables that already deliver low cost power in many regions, receives no attention in the strategy. Renewables appear only indirectly as something to be politically rejected under the label of “Net Zero ideology.” A transition to clean electricity would lower long term energy costs and strengthen economic competitiveness. The current policy direction moves in the opposite direction by tying American energy futures to a resource profile that is losing both cost advantage and structural relevance.

The strategy presents reshoring as a straightforward path to renewed industrial strength, but it does not acknowledge the conditions required for that shift to succeed. Large scale manufacturing investment depends on long term policy and regulatory stability because companies commit capital on multi decade timelines. The current environment, marked by abrupt tariff changes, political turnover and unpredictable administrative actions, increases risk for foreign investors who would otherwise finance new plants in the United States. I haven’t spoken to an investor this year who would commit long-term capital to the United States, leaving investments to speculation. Trump’s erratic policies have raised the price of debt and capital in the country, as money providers require greater returns due to the greater risks. Another overlooked constraint is the loss of industrial expertise after forty five years of offshoring. Many of the factories that left the country took with them skilled engineers, production specialists and operational knowledge that now reside in Asia and parts of Europe. Rebuilding advanced manufacturing capacity requires attracting those skills back into the country, which means welcoming foreign talent rather than restricting it. These conflicts were in sharp display at the battery factory where hundreds of South Korean nationals were arrested by ICE. These realities conflict directly with the strategy’s posture toward global investment and migration. A serious reshoring effort needs stable policy, predictable regulation and access to global expertise. None of these conditions are strengthened by the approach described in the document.

Soft power has always been one of the most durable elements of American influence. Culture, political values, stable institutions, scientific leadership and predictable diplomacy—elements of Joseph Nye’s widely accepted framework on soft power—created a reservoir of attraction that made alliances easier to maintain and agreements easier to negotiate. The current trajectory is rapidly eroding these sources. Tariffs on allies signal unpredictability. Cuts to aid programs signal retreat from global engagement and a key source of goodwill and contacts in recipient nations. Negative rhetoric aimed at partners makes cooperation more difficult. Visa tightening and suspicion of foreign researchers make the academic and scientific ecosystem less attractive. Public diplomacy institutions lose their reach when they are reduced in scope. Soft power takes time to build but it can erode faster than many expect when trust is damaged. The Trump Administration’s of the past year have caused significant and in some cases catastrophic decline in every aspect of US soft power. Instead, pandering to Trump is apparently seen as evidence of the existence of soft power, instead of placation of a dangerous and erratic world leader. A strategy that claims unparalleled soft power while acting in ways that radically undermine it is describing an asset that no longer exists in the same form.

Migration and demographic change receive heavy emphasis in the strategy. These themes appear as threats to national character and security. The data does not support this view. Immigrants in the United States, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely to commit crimes than native born citizens. They contribute to economic dynamism by adding skills and entrepreneurial capacity in regions that need both. Population growth driven by immigration has been an important part of American resilience. Demographic diversification supports innovation because different backgrounds and experiences create new problem solving approaches. Half of the US Fortune 500 were founded by immigrants or their children, and they certainly aren’t all white. Treating migration as a cultural threat rather than a policy challenge does not help the country align resources with real needs. Policies grounded in fear instead of evidence struggle to produce effective outcomes. A strategy that presents immigration as a driver of instability ignores the broad record of contribution that newcomers have made for generations.

The strategy misdiagnoses religious freedom and domestic sources of violence by framing Christianity as a besieged identity rather than recognising the real distribution of risk and harm in the United States. Federal threat assessments during the past decade have consistently identified rising violence against religious minorities, especially Jewish and Muslim communities, alongside extremist movements that draw heavily from Christian identity narratives. Domestic violence trends have been shaped by economic strain, gun access and online radicalisation rather than by any decline in the status of Christianity. By reversing these patterns and presenting the majority faith as the primary victim, the strategy directs attention away from the groups that are actually targeted. This framing is likely to produce policies that strengthen surveillance of minority communities and weaken surveillance of the actual sources of violence in the United States, something exemplified by the pardoning of the insurrectionists from January 6th, many of who are already back in jail for more violent offences after release. It will also encourage political rhetoric that deepens division inside the country rather than addressing the conditions that drive violence. A strategy that begins with a distorted diagnosis will struggle to produce coherent action because it focuses on threats that do not match the evidence.

Alliances are a strategic asset that depends on trust. The past few decades show that economic integration and shared democratic institutions create strong partnerships. The behaviour of a country toward its allies signals whether it can be counted on in difficult times. Aggressive tariff measures, public criticism of allied leaders, sudden shifts in diplomatic positions and inconsistent commitments weaken confidence. Countries respond by hedging. They develop deeper relationships with regional partners. They reduce reliance on American supply chains. They negotiate trade agreements without American involvement. Trust is not a soft concept. It is a material component of national security because it shapes the coalitions that determine global outcomes. A strategy that treats alliances as transactional loses sight of the long term value that stability creates.

There is a cost when culture war narratives are placed at the center of national security doctrine. Strategic clarity depends on a willingness to describe the world accurately. When racialized demographic fears or claims of civilizational decline are folded into official policy documents, the result is a distorted view of threats and opportunities. These narratives discourage cooperation with diverse domestic constituencies and with international partners who do not share the same identity framing. They focus attention on symbolic conflicts instead of structural challenges. They create friction in diplomacy because allies perceive the shift in tone immediately. National security analysis becomes less coherent when ideological boundaries define the set of acceptable conclusions.

A national security strategy grounded in the realities of the twenty first century would look different from the one offered in 2025. It would begin by acknowledging the global electrification trend and the rise of energy systems built around renewables, storage and flexible grids. It would frame climate as an operational risk that must be managed to maintain readiness. It would rebuild trust with allies by offering predictable commitments. It would anchor soft power by strengthening democratic institutions, open science and pluralism. It would treat migration as a policy domain where managed integration supports economic and social resilience. It would invest in clean industrial pathways for steel, cement, chemicals and logistics because these sectors will define competitiveness in the next decades. It would align American interests with the broad shifts already underway rather than resisting them.

The map in the current document does not match the terrain. The world is changing and the drivers of strategic advantage are changing with it. The United States has substantial assets that can support a renewed leadership role. For this to happen, the country needs a strategy that begins with an accurate diagnosis of the world as it stands and the world it is moving toward. This strategy then needs to stand for more than election cycle. The past decade has seen the US incapable of holding to and executing strategy past mid-terms, never mind presidential election cycles. The US 2025 national security strategy is the document of an empire in decline, thrashing as it fades.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_xr01jwxr01jwxr01-800x442.png,N,,2025-12-07 16:59:52.666639

Despite this year’s sharp U-turn in federal energy policy, the renewable energy transition continues to branch out in new directions. One emerging factor is the relatively new area of floating solar. The field has already begun to scale up in some regions around the world, and innovative solar firms are carving out new opportunities here in the US as well.

Floating Solar Scales Up To Beat Fossil Fuels

Back in 2018 the US Department of Energy (such as it was back then) assessed the potential floating solar capacity of the US on reservoirs and other human-made bodies of water. After eliminating thousands of unsuitable locations, they still identified over 24,000 potential sites with the combined potential to provide for about 10% of annual US electricity generation at the time.

The appeal of floating solar lies partly in its ability to make space for renewable energy in land-constrained areas. Whether located on reservoirs and other built infrastructure, or on open water, floating PV arrays can also be moored in place with a minimum of site preparation, avoiding considerable expense for developers (see lots more floating PV background here).

Scaleup is already in evidence in some parts of the world, with the Asian Pacific Region (APAC) being a particular focus of attention. Last year the firm Wood Mackenzie surmised that APAC will account for the fast majority — 57 gigawatts — of an anticipated 77 gigawatts in global solar capacity by 2033.

A study published in the journal Energy & Environmental Science this year affirms the focus on APAC. “Offshore floating photovoltaic (OFPV) systems present a promising opportunity to expand global solar energy capacity, particularly for countries with limited land resources but extensive maritime zones,” the authors note.

The researchers modeled offshore floating solar potential based on economic datasets as well as geographic and climatic data. “The analysis reveals that up to 95% of analyzed offshore regions fall within conditions suitable for current FPV technologies, with Southeast Asia—particularly Indonesia and Malaysia—emerging as optimal early deployment zones due to favorable irradiance, bathymetry, and competitive LCOE,” they concluded, referring to Levelized Cost of Energy, a standard of comparison among different forms of power generation.

More generally, the new study found that in 84% of regions around the world, less than 2% of offshore water surface would be needed to meet current electricity demands.

Who’s Gonna Pay For All This?

The big question, of course, is cost. The floating solar industry has been maturing rapidly, but it is still a relatively new field of endeavor. Costs are expected to drop in the coming years, but even at this stage of the game the technology is competitive, or nearly competitive, with other power generation resources in some regions.

The competitiveness showing was particularly strong in Thailand and Malaysia, where most of the lowest-cost potential surfaced at less than 6 cents per kWh. More broadly, in 53% of the regions studied, the researchers calculated an LCOE below 15 cents per kilowatt-hour.

“As OFPV remains an emerging technology, it is expected that continued research and operational experience will enable optimization across manufacturing, system integration, and deployment, leading to further cost reductions over time,” the researchers concluded.

Meanwhile, Back In The USA

In terms of scale-up, the US has a long way to go. China, of course, has already put down record-breaking stakes in the offshore floating solar industry, having commissioned a 1-gigawatt array off the coast of Shandong Province last year. Meanwhile, the largest existing array in the US sits on a reservoir in New Jersey, clocking in at just 8.9 megawatts.

Still, even at a small scale, floating solar arrays can make a big difference in their host communities.

In New Jersey, for example, the borough of Bernardsville is considering a proposal to float solar panels on the site of a former quarry. As reported by the news organization New Jersey Hills, the project supports the state’s community solar initiative. Electricity ratepayers can voluntarily subscribe to the quarry project and receive a discount estimated at 30%, a significant benefit in today’s environment of skyrocketing energy costs.

NJH reporter Charlie Zavalick also takes note of land use advantages at the site. The quarry sits on private land with no public access and no current recreational use. According to the developer, surrounding communities do not have a view of the site that would be spoiled by the addition of solar panels.

The project could qualify as a community solar project under state law if 51% of its capacity is taken up by subscribers classified as low-income. That’s not a particularly easy benchmark to reach in parts of suburban New Jersey. However, Bernardsville has three affordable housing projects under way and additional projects are in the planning stages, which could help push low-income subscriptions over the goal line.

Floating Solar Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

Keep an eye on New Jersey for more floating solar news. Solar developers in the state dodged a bullet on Election Day this year, when the Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill handily beat her Trump-allied opponent, assuring renewable energy stakeholders of a reliable ally in the Governor’s office for at least the next four years, if not longer.

Meanwhile, the prospective developer of the quarry project, Third Pillar Solar, is also pursuing industrial sites elsewhere around the US. Inactive bodies of water are just one opportunity. In Texas, the company has signed on with the firm Diamond Infrastructure Services to assess its portfolio of reservoirs under management for solar potential.

Based on a preliminary assessment, Third Pillar anticipates building a total of 500 megawatts in floating solar under Diamond’s purview. In addition to earning new revenue from existing sites, the projects are expected to save money for Diamond’s clients by preventing excess water evaporation.

Since everything is bigger in Texas, the state is also on track to host the first large-scale floating PV array in the US, at 391 megawatts. The proposed site is a human-made coastal lake under the jurisdiction of Port Arthur, where it is presumably shielded from interference by the Interior Department and other federal agencies.

Next Steps For Floating Solar

The shade from solar panels can help conserve water in natural bodies of water, too, but researchers point out that the array must be designed to minimize if not eliminate other impacts on the aquatic habitat and the wildlife it supports.

Among the recent studies to that effect, last summer a team of researchers at Cornell University assessed that if just 3.5% of the existing bodies of water in the Northeast were deployed for floating solar, they would generate 25% of the solar energy needs in the region by 2050 — with the additional benefit of conserving land for other purposes.

That 3.5% figure includes bodies of water with significant recreation and biodiversity roles. Weeding them out of the pool of qualified sites, the researchers found that floating solar would only contribute 5% of solar energy needs to the Northeast. Still 5% is a fairly substantial figure in a region strapped for open land, potentially reserving thousands of acres for other uses. The researchers also point out that 5% represents an increase of 194% over the current capacity of land-based solar arrays in the Northeast.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/floating-solar-third-pillar.jpeg,N,,2025-12-07 14:59:11.052218

Flexible Data Centers: A Faster, More Affordable Path to Power | Camus Energy

Data centers can make grids more reliable, resilient, and affordable if integrated well. A new study out this week sheds light on what that entails::

The answer to the question: can flexibility allows data centers to connect faster? A resounding “yes.” Building on existing “connect and manage” models, our results showed that a small amount of local flexibility could enable loads to connect 3-5 years sooner.

Further, bringing a set of onsite power solutions (including load flexibility, onsite battery, and gas generation), when paired with procured capacity from renewable, battery, or VPP resources, can enable sites to entirely offset the additional system costs of adding new loads.

The result is a better grid - one which can support a lot more load, in which energy and capacity prices both remain stable, and in which there are new sources of system flexibility which can increase the overall resilience of the system.

The full study is linked in the Camus post. I highly encourage anyone interested in this area to spend some time with it. It’s one of the best studies I’ve seen on the topic and likely to garner significant attention, akin to the Duke University demand flexibility study done earlier this year.

The study was co-written by Camus Energy. I talked at lengthen about all these topics with Camus CEO Astrid Atkinson just two months ago:

How do you get them online without tripping into a bunch of necessary capital investments to serve that last few percent of hours where their demand needs to be served? Or can you source flexibility out of the system from somewhere else, like residential air conditioning, or something like that?

That’s a question that’s very important to figure out. People have kind of issue-spotted it but we’ve kind of really yet to solve it in any meaningful way.

The markets like Texas are geared toward solving it in more of a free enterprise premise, other markets seem to be struggling a bit.

So much more good stuff in this one. And to hear my more about using distributed flexibility to lower costs and increase grid reliability, listen to my discussion with Travis:

Home upgrades can power job growth | Rewiring America

Picking up on Travis’ point, permanent residential and small business demand reductions from energy efficiency and demand flexibility can lower consumers’ energy bills and create headroom on the grid for data centers. The classic win-win. But the benefits don’t stop there.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vIq0!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1427092-9b71-41fd-8a51-5e26019f7d98_1600x1056.png",N,,2025-12-07 16:59:44.817207

It is the second factory for Viridi, after the one at their headquarters in Buffalo, New York.
The Richmond facility produces electric generators that have the capacity to power home, industrial, and even larger energy intensive needs.
“We’re a green energy company.
“And we’re like, why don’t we open the door to all these different types of energy, not just coal, gas, and oil.","LEGISLATORS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY gathered inside a new battery factory along Richmond’s waterfront this past week to learn about advances in energy storage technology.

Adjacent to the Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park in Richmond is a 40,000-square-foot battery factory for the industrial manufacturer Viridi, which plans to rapidly expand its workforce as it ramps up production on the West Coast.

Richmond Mayor Eduardo Martinez was present at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the facility in April, but returned Wednesday to speak to legislators who had traveled from as far as South Carolina and Ohio to tour the facility.

“The goal is to strengthen our ability to support clean energy and manufacturing and to provide companies with consistent points of context from day one,” said Martinez. “This service ties with a much larger vision for our shorelines. We are reimagining a working waterfront that honors the Rosie legacy while preparing for a cleaner future and the manufacturing industry and support staff.”

The factory opened after receiving a $9 million grant from the California Energy Commission. It is the second factory for Viridi, after the one at their headquarters in Buffalo, New York. The Richmond facility produces electric generators that have the capacity to power home, industrial, and even larger energy intensive needs.

Viridi president Eric Stein said the facility has the capacity to grow the workforce from the current size of 12 employees to a possible 75 within the next few months. He said the demand for batteries and generators, such as the ones they produce, is rapidly growing and the company can capitalize on using automation to meet demand while also adding skilled jobs.

“… We are reimagining a working waterfront that honors the Rosie legacy while preparing for a cleaner future and the manufacturing industry and support staff.”

Mayor Eduardo Martinez

“There’s a lot of automation that we can bring in, not to displace workers, but to actually expand, to build more products here and bring more people,” said Stein. “So one of the great things about our workforce is when we go to automation, we actually uplift the skill set, because we take people who were assembling product and turning screwdrivers and we train them on higher-end automation and robotics.”

Seeing green

Tess Williams, a project manager with Viridi, proudly spoke into a microphone as she walked backwards leading the tour. She said the company’s most popular product, the RPS150, has been used in hospitals, by emergency responders, and even at the Burning Man music festival. According to Williams, the company is making an effort to minimize their carbon footprint in Richmond during production and when their products reach the end of their service lives.

“We’re a green energy company. We’re not just going to throw these things out when we’re done,” said Williams. “Like anything at the end of its life, there are some parts of it that get thrown out, but 90-plus percent of the unit is reusable, recyclable, or goes to that company that can recycle them at that point, and it’s something we take pride in.”

One of the out-of-state legislators who traveled to learn more about the new technology was Ohio State Rep. Tristan Rader, who represents parts of Cleveland and Lakewood. He said it was encouraging to see many other legislators also in attendance as his home state attempts to address energy affordability issues.

“Both Democrats, Republicans are finally getting together saying we have got to deal with this affordability issue,” said Rader. “And we’re like, why don’t we open the door to all these different types of energy, not just coal, gas, and oil. If it’s cheaper then why not try to bring that to people.”",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LNM-20251205-BATTERYFACTORY-01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1130&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-07 14:00:56.937051

The school announced it will receive a $60 million commitment from the Dallas-based O’Donnell Foundation to create a new interdisciplinary energy studies program and a named honors fund. The gift will seed the Energy Science, Innovation and Enterprise curriculum, help recruit faculty across campus, and underwrite scholarships and career advising for selected students. University leaders say the investment ranks among the largest recent gifts to SMU and is aimed at preparing graduates for jobs across North Texas’s energy economy.

New program and honors fund

According to The Dallas Morning News, the donation will launch SMU’s Energy Science, Innovation and Enterprise program and create the O’Donnell Academic Honors Fund, with offerings set to begin in fall 2026. The program is described as interdisciplinary, pulling faculty from SMU’s business, engineering and humanities and sciences schools to teach technical, entrepreneurial and policy skills. The honors fund will provide four years of seed money to recruit faculty and a career counselor, and scholarships for about 20 students in each initial major.

Why Dallas is the focus

Texas still dominates U.S. energy production and jobs, a reality SMU officials say makes the program timely. Data highlighted by the Dallas Fed and federal energy employment reports show the state supplies a huge share of the nation’s wind and fossil fuel output and supports roughly 990,100 energy related jobs. ""Dallas has all of that, and that's why SMU is really the ideal place to locate a program like this,"" Bruce Bullock of SMU’s Maguire Energy Institute told The Dallas Morning News.

SMU’s fundraising backdrop

The donation arrives as SMU builds on a multiyear fundraising surge. SMU reports that its Ignited campaign topped $1.64 billion earlier this year, giving leaders more flexibility to invest in new academic priorities. The university also points to its new R1 research status and a roughly $2.3 billion endowment as factors that will amplify the gift’s effect. SMU notes that the O’Donnell Foundation previously invested in the university, including a $30 million commitment in 2023 that helped expand data science and engineering programs.

Donor profile and regional investments

The O’Donnell Foundation has been a major funder across North Texas education and research for decades, with a stated focus on math, science and the arts. In October the foundation pledged a separate $50 million investment to bolster college success across Dallas County, a package that directed funds to several local institutions including UT Dallas, according to UT Dallas.

SMU leaders say the program and honors fund are meant to attract students seeking careers in energy and to deepen ties between the university and industry across North Texas. Offerings and scholarships are slated to begin in fall 2026, and university officials say they will use the coming months to recruit faculty and finalize curriculum details.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/12/dallas-donor-drops-dollar60-million-on-smu-to-supercharge-energy-honors-hub-4.webp,N,,2025-12-07 13:00:16.485279

The federal tax credit for EV chargers will also come to an end in June 2026.
Under the Biden administration, it was announced that Chicago would receive $14.5 million in federal funds to develop nearly 200 EV charging stations.
To date, 38 communities have enrolled in the programme, which has driven up EV uptake in these areas, compared to other parts of the state.
However, several U.S. states and EV-makers see a bright future in EVs, suggesting that the uptake of electric vehicles will continue to increase, even if at a slower pace.","Since taking office in January, United States President Trump has spoken out against electric vehicles (EVs), signing an executive order to scrap the “EV mandate” (despite there being no such federal mandate). In recent months, federal support for EVs has waned under the Trump administration, resulting in announcements of delays for several EV-makers due to the ongoing sectoral uncertainty. However, some states are doubling down on efforts to expand their EV markets, with heavy investments in charging infrastructure and other initiatives.

Trump’s executive order sought to halt federal support for EVs, including a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers, which was established by law in 2022, as well as government support for EV charging infrastructure, and low-interest loans for automakers looking to develop EV and battery plants. Trump also stated plans to eliminate local regulations from California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington to ban the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035.

In September, the government officially halted tax credits on new and second-hand EVs. However, several carmakers, such as General Motors and Ford, have, so far, maintained their highly competitive pricing plans on EVs, to encourage consumers to make the shift from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric. The federal tax credit for EV chargers will also come to an end in June 2026.

The CEO of the automaker Ford, Jim Farley, said, “I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change,” in reference to the scrapping of the EV tax credits.

Price reductions on EVs are expected to help counter the scrapping of the tax credit on electric cars in the short term; however, the growing uncertainty around EV uptake could drive some automakers to stall new EV production, which could slow the pace of uptake in the coming years.

Some EV makers are still betting big on the rising uptake of EVs in the United States. In August, Ford announced $5 billion in financing for EV production as part of its “new Model T moment”. Ford plans to sell an EV pickup for $30,000, supported by the new investment, which would make its EVs highly competitive with alternative ICE models. Other companies also expect to be able to reduce the prices of EV models in the coming years, as production expands and the cost of manufacturing EVs decreases.

Meanwhile, Hyundai said it planned to maintain its EV investments in the United States. The firm’s CEO, José Muñoz, said that it could shift between producing EVs and ICE vehicles at its Georgia plant, which will allow it to respond to market demand.

General Motors CFO, Paul Jacobson, stated, “We need to let it settle and understand where is that natural (EV) demand going forward and how do we meet that natural demand.” “That’s going to take a little bit of time. We’ll probably have to adjust our footprint a little bit.” Jacobson still expects a longer-term growth in demand for EVs, even without the tax credit, albeit at a slower pace.

At the state level, several U.S. states are doubling down on plans to expand their EV markets even without federal support. Under the Biden administration, it was announced that Chicago would receive $14.5 million in federal funds to develop nearly 200 EV charging stations. However, Trump announced that this investment would not go ahead, as he suspended the Charging and Fuelling Infrastructure grant programme.

Nevertheless, Chicago is continuing with its EV Readiness programme with funding from the Illinois utility ComEd. Illinois aims to roll out 1 million EVs across the state by 2030, a significant rise from the 160,000 registered vehicles at present. It is making sure it stays on track to meet this goal with the launch of its fourth EV Readiness cohort, supporting representatives of 16 municipalities in upgrading their permitting and zoning processes related to EV charging, as well as raising awareness about EVs and state and local incentives.

To date, 38 communities have enrolled in the programme, which has driven up EV uptake in these areas, compared to other parts of the state. Cristina Botero, the senior manager of beneficial electrification for ComEd, explained, “People sometimes think that the dollars are the only reason people are not transitioning to EVs,” said Botero. “But a big part of it is education.""

The Trump administration has attacked the U.S. EV industry on several fronts, scrapping tax credits for consumers, making it more expensive for manufacturers to produce EVs, and halting the rollout of EV charging infrastructure. However, several U.S. states and EV-makers see a bright future in EVs, suggesting that the uptake of electric vehicles will continue to increase, even if at a slower pace.

Environmental groups say it could make it harder to require older coal plants to install sulfur dioxide and particulate controls.
In the final rule, EPA says Texas evaluated the required statutory ""four factors"" and that monitored visibility improvements and prior control programs helped drive the agency’s conclusion.
As detailed on the EPA’s Regional Haze pages, the program allows alternatives to source-specific Best Available Retrofit Technology controls, such as regional trading programs, as long as they achieve comparable results.
Nonprofits including the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association were involved in earlier regional haze litigation and are expected to mount new challenges, as per the Houston Chronicle.","On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency approved Texas’ regional haze plans. This decision allows the state to avoid adding new pollution controls at specific sources. The move affects efforts to reduce haze in national parks like Big Bend and the Guadalupe Mountains. Environmental groups say it could make it harder to require older coal plants to install sulfur dioxide and particulate controls.

What the EPA approved

According to the Federal Register, the Environmental Protection Agency approved portions of Texas’ 2009 and 2021 regional haze State Implementation Plans, along with the state's 2014 five-year progress report, finding that together they satisfy applicable Clean Air Act requirements. The rule is set to take effect on January 5, 2026. The Federal Register entry points to a docket packed with monitoring data, modeling and emissions analyses the agency leaned on in its evaluation. In the final rule, EPA says Texas evaluated the required statutory ""four factors"" and that monitored visibility improvements and prior control programs helped drive the agency’s conclusion.

How the agency justified the move

The EPA argues that long-term emissions reductions and visibility gains in Texas mean the state’s existing plans already reflect the improvements the Regional Haze Rule is supposed to deliver, and that states have leeway to choose how they comply. As detailed on the EPA’s Regional Haze pages, the program allows alternatives to source-specific Best Available Retrofit Technology controls, such as regional trading programs, as long as they achieve comparable results. That policy framework, paired with the technical record in the docket, forms the backbone of the agency’s rationale.

Why activists and some scientists say it matters

Environmental groups describe the action as a rollback that leaves parks and downwind communities less protected than they could be. ""Monitoring shows that the majority of haze comes from coal-burning power plants,"" Sierra Club campaign manager Emma Pabst told the Houston Chronicle, blasting the state strategies as ""do-nothing"" plans that put public health at risk. Local scientists, including Rice University’s Daniel Cohan, have said the regional haze program is one of the few federal tools available to push the largest sources to install proven pollution controls, so how the rule is used matters far beyond postcard views.

Coal’s role and what it means for Texans

State energy data show coal still provides roughly 10% of Texas’ generation capacity, leaving coal units as a meaningful slice of the power mix even as wind and solar surge. The Texas Comptroller’s energy overview notes that coal’s share has fallen over the past decade but continues to matter in parts of the grid. Whether older coal plants face mandatory federal retrofits or only state-level measures will shape how quickly emissions that cloud vistas and affect lungs actually come down.

Legal history and what comes next

The final rule arrives after a long legal arc. The Fifth Circuit previously vacated portions of EPA’s 2016 disapprovals of Texas’ plans, and the agency notes in the Federal Register that any petitions for judicial review of the new rule must be filed by February 3, 2026. The federal docket’s monitoring and emissions analyses are poised to be central exhibits if challengers head back to court. Nonprofits including the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association were involved in earlier regional haze litigation and are expected to mount new challenges, as per the Houston Chronicle.

What to watch

In the near term, look for fresh court filings and a fine-tooth-comb review of the technical documents in the EPA docket that helped justify the rule. For Texans who care about clear park views and neighborhood air quality, the real-world outcome will hinge on whether judges send the agency back to the drawing board or the state’s own regulator, TCEQ, chooses to tighten its approach on its own.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/12/epa-lets-texas-coal-off-the-hook-as-park-views-pay-the-price.webp,N,,2025-12-07 14:01:07.932399

He spent two years working out of his garage without a paycheck, building partnerships with potential financiers, locating suitable projects and negotiating land purchases.

Prior to starting Tallbear Seville, LLC, based out of Manhattan Beach, Calif., Westerman’s solar projects were relatively small scale, piggybacking off of the aforementioned career in building interiors, mainly for tribal casinos. Explorations into solar projects for those casinos, and later friends on the Morongo Band of Mission Indians Reservation in California, led Westerman to begin pursuing bigger opportunities in the space.

By 2013, Westerman’s company landed a power purchasing agreement (PPA) with the San Diego Gas & Electric Co. The PPA sparked enough interest from financiers and partners to get the $52 million project — a 200-acre, 20-megawatt solar farm in Ocotillo Wells, Calif. — built by 2015.

One partner was project co-developer Regenerate Energy, whose founder and CEO Reyad Fazzani also served as Tallbear Energy’s president. Others included financing from partners like Duke Energy, whose subsidiary Deriva Energy now helps maintain the solar farm in question, and manufacturing through fabricator Solar First.

These days, Westerman runs the day-to-day operations, alongside an energy consulting firm called Red Power he started last year. “I think I might be the only guy that jumped from a few homes to 20 megawatts,” he said. “But can a tribe do the same thing? I think so.”

Westerman spoke with Tribal Business News to discuss the process he used to build the Tallbear Seville solar farm, hashing out a power purchasing agreement, and surviving energy funding austerity. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

How did you first get into the solar industry?

I had a company that did the interiors for casinos. We did a lot of work for a lot of major casinos, as well as some minority contracting with big entities like Disney, Universal Studios, Planet Hollywood. We were called the gingerbread guys — we would fabricate everything and then come out, put signage up, column wraps, things like that, and make everything look nice.

At one point a casino approached us about doing some solar work for them, and I thought well it made sense, because our electricians were already trained by their union to do things like that. It made me start looking at what opportunities were out there, and then a friend of mine on the Morongo Band of Mission Indians’ tribal council asked me to look into solar installations for some of their homes.

I started meeting people in the industry, in particular one company out of San Francisco that was doing renewable energy development called Stellar, and after talking to them for a while they eventually said, “Well, why don’t we hire you for some consulting?” That made me really start looking into opportunities in this space, and that’s when the PPA came up.

What pushed you toward that instead of continuing on casino construction?

Solar is one of the most solid long‑term investments you can make, because the panels are warranted for 30 years. Remember now, which technology is dependable for 30 years that you can invest in? There’s not a lot. Which entities have the longest, best credit and history of making money? It’s the utilities.

So once you have a customer that has a 100‑year history of paying their bills and paying for energy, and you have a contract with them, it works out.

How did you build the San Diego solar project? That’s $52 million in 2010 money — it would have been even more today.

Well, I did it like any other developer. You get some good partners. I made the president of my company a very well‑known, experienced energy professional who had been the vice president of BP Renewables internationally. We got the best engineers. We got the best legal.

What role did the power purchasing agreement play in attracting partners to the deal?

It’s an attractive deal where there can be money made and be paid back. That can bring in people who want to participate.

Of course, getting the PPA isn’t like the golden ticket. Once you get it, you’ve got to prove it. PPAs could be the worst thing that ever happened to you, because you agree to deliver energy. They don’t care how you do it. You’re saying, I’m going to deliver 20 megawatts daily, and you’re signing a contract for that.

What kind of partners got involved once the PPA was in place?

One was the largest infrastructure fund out of Japan. That was our first financing partner. So that was construction finance. We get it built, we get it in operation.

Then you’re looking at a long‑term partner. Our first one was a company out of Canada called Kruger Energy that wanted to own some renewable energy in the United States. Then there was a change in the IRS rules, because they’re an international company, so they had to sell.

We ended up with Duke Energy as our partner to deliver the energy and handle operations and maintenance. So I still am the manager of the day‑to‑day operation.

How did you handle connectivity to the grid?

We used the Sunrise Powerlink, which was a power line from San Diego out to East County, a good 80 miles, and that connected us to the grid out there in the desert, and even provided energy into Arizona. When the Sunrise Powerlink came along, there was a tremendous opportunity east of San Diego in the desert there to interconnect, sell energy back the other way, right into the city.

You’re a 51% owner in the deal, which is part of how it came together, since your business is minority owned, is that right?

That was part of it, yeah - we’re part of the Minority Business Development Supplier Council, and that played into our bid.

What kind of challenges did you deal with along the way?

I got grilled by the California Public Utilities Commission when I was accused of people saying I was just being used as a Native for minority certification. So I had to go and get grilled on what I knew about solar. I had to do a lot of that on my own because they wanted to be sure I was independent, that I really owned and operated my own business.

How did that go?

They told me at the end of it that I am, in fact, an expert in solar. I was completely justified in my contract. But I had to prove that — there’s a lot of things you have to prove as a business owner. A lot of it isn’t just handed to you.

What are your thoughts about building projects like this in the federal funding vacuum created by an administrative policy shift back toward fossil fuels?

Investment tax credits are still there, right? The one I used. Not to mention, I don’t want to give away everything, because I do make money as a consultant too. But there’s new market tax credits, there’s low‑income tax credits. There’s still plenty of tax credits that can be applied to solar that Native American tribes can access. You have to package that up.

You’ve talked a lot about partnerships, too.

I’ve always been lucky in my career, honestly, to meet the right people. I didn’t figure all this out by myself and tribes shouldn’t expect to either.

Everybody goes to tribes and says, “Well, you got to do it all on your own, and you got to learn everything and do it all on your own.” No, they didn’t do that with their other power. You didn’t see them running out making little coal‑fired plants and nuclear plants, did you?

Usually the developer, contractor brings that to the table. For anybody to tell tribes, “You can just go do this” — well, they couldn’t build a million-dollar casino on their own. They got the experts. I don’t see it any different than other development businesses.",https://tribalbusinessnews.com/images/2023/TallBear_Serville.jpeg,N,,2025-12-07 11:02:11.972992

One of the units at the Comanche coal-fired plant operated by Xcel Energy near Pueblo can stay open a year longer than planned to fill the gap while the site’s largest facility, the chronically troubled Comanche 3, remains out of commission.

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission agreed Wednesday to extend the life of Comanche 2, which was scheduled to close at the end of this year. Xcel Energy sought to keep the unit running after coal unit Comanche 3, the utility’s largest power generating source, malfunctioned in August.

Xcel has said Comanche 3 could be out of service until June.

While the PUC approved keeping the smaller unit running, members voted to require more frequent reporting by Xcel on the status of the plant and costs. The regulators warned that the company runs the risk of not being authorized to recover what it spends to repair Comanche 3 if alternatives would have been more cost-effective.

Commissioner Tom Plant said he was bothered by the assumption that “whatever it takes to get Unit 3 running is going to be a good strategy.” Plant and other members pointed out that Comanche 3 has experienced problems and numerous outages since opening near Pueblo in 2010.

The unit, originally forecast to run until 2070, is scheduled to close by the end of 2030. The closure is part of efforts by the state and utilities to cut greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.

Some of the parties weighing in on Xcel’s petition to keep Unit 2 open longer urged the PUC to protect the company’s customers from footing the bill to fix the long-ailing Unit 3. The Colorado Energy Office and the Colorado Utility Consumer Advocate office supported Xcel’s petition.

The PUC expressed frustration with not having more information about what it will cost to repair the unit. Members adopted a proposal by the conservation organization Western Resource Advocates to require Xcel to report its progress each month instead of the two reports the company proposed.

“How do you go into a project like this, a multimillion-dollar project, without even a ballpark estimate of what your costs are going to be and with the assumption that it’s just going to be approved and passed onto ratepayers? I just find that mind-boggling,” Plant said.

All three PUC members want Xcel Energy to identify potential costs before the money’s spent, but didn’t require that at this point. Commissioner Megan Gilman said the PUC’s approval of keeping the smaller unit open for the time being isn’t approval of whatever Xcel might spend to fix the larger unit. “I get that a lot of information may not be available just yet,” Gilman said.

But Gilman said the timing of the reports proposed by Xcel, including a June 1 application that could seek additional variances or approval of resources, is difficult. “We’re not even going to get a filing to assess the path forward until they supposedly already fixed it and spent all the money. That is a backward process of what analysis should be done.”

The PUC adopted another recommendation by Western Resource Advocates that would limit the total, combined power generation of the two units if Comanche 3 is repaired and starts operating in 2026.

“We appreciate the approval to extend Comanche 2 through Dec. 31, 2026, as it provides an essential, reliable resource that will be needed throughout 2026, even after Comanche 3 returns to service in the middle of next year,” Xcel spokeswoman Michelle Aguayo said. She said Xcel will wait to see the commission’s written order before responding to the decision’s details. “Maybe now that the Commission has sent a strong message that Xcel risks having to bear the burden of fixing the plant instead of passing the buck to customers, it will find cleaner, cheaper and clearly more reliable alternatives,” Eric Frankowski, executive director of the Western Clean Energy Campaign, said in a statement.

A group that includes the Pueblo County commissioners and the city of Pueblo supports keeping the smaller coal unit open. The group said in a filing with the PUC that Xcel Energy is facing a capacity shortage.

A previous analysis by the PUC staff showed that other coal plants struggled to stay online during the summer. The report highlighted what Xcel called a “code orange” event, meaning there was a realistic possibility of not having enough power to meet the demand for electricity. The utility asked customers to conserve energy Aug. 7 to avoid managed, rotating blackouts.

Xcel, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has proposed replacing the Comanche coal plant with wind and solar power, battery storage and natural gas generation.

It’s a critical part of the new family business, High Altitude Geothermal, which installs geothermal heat pumps that use the Earth’s constant temperature to heat and cool buildings. At stake is not just their livelihood but a century-long family legacy of producing energy in Moffat County.

Like many families here, the Coopers have worked in coal for generations — and in oil before that. That’s ending for Matt Cooper and his son Matthew as one of three coal mines in the area closes in a statewide shift to cleaner energy.

“People have to start looking beyond coal,” said Matt Cooper. “And that can be a multitude of things. Our economy has been so focused on coal and coal-fired power plants. And we need the diversity.”

Many countries and about half of U.S. states are moving away from coal, citing environmental impacts and high costs. Burning coal emits carbon dioxide that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

President Donald Trump has boosted coal as part of his agenda to promote fossil fuels. He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

That’s created uncertainty in places like Craig. As some families like the Coopers plan for the next stage of their careers, others hold out hope Trump will save their plants, mines and high-paying jobs.

Matt and Matthew Cooper work at the Colowyo Mine near Meeker, though active mining has ended and site cleanup begins in January.

The mine employs about 130 workers and supplies Craig Generating Station, a 1,400-megawatt coal-fired plant. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is planning to close Craig’s Unit 1 by year’s end for economic reasons and to meet legal requirements for reducing emissions. The other two units will close in 2028.

Xcel Energy owns coal-fired Hayden Station, about 30 minutes away. It said it doesn’t plan to change retirement dates for Hayden, though it’s extending another coal unit in Pueblo in part due to increased demand for electricity.

The Craig and Hayden plants together employ about 200 people.

Craig residents have always been entrepreneurial and that spirit will get them through this transition, said Kirstie McPherson, board president for the Craig Chamber of Commerce. Still, she said, just about everybody here is connected to coal.

“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said. “When that starts going away, beyond just the individuals that are having the identity crisis, you have an entire culture, an entire community that is also having that same crisis.”

PHASING OUT COAL

Coal has been central to Colorado’s economy since before statehood, but it’s generally the most expensive energy on today’s grid, said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

“We are not going to let this administration drag us backward into an overreliance on expensive fossil fuels,” Polis said in a statement.

Nationwide, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than it was in 2021, costing consumers $6.2 billion more, according to a June analysis from Energy Innovation. The nonpartisan think tank cited significant increases to run aging plants as well as inflation.

Colorado’s six remaining coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close or convert to natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal, by 2031. The state is rapidly adding solar and wind that’s cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants. Renewable energy provides more than 40% of Colorado’s power now and will pass 70% by the end of the decade, according to statewide utility plans.

Nationwide, wind and solar growth has remained strong, producing more electricity than coal in 2025, as of the latest data in October, according to energy think tank Ember.

But some states want to increase or at least maintain coal production. That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.

PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE

The Coopers have gone all-in on geothermal.

“Maybe we’ll never go back to coal,” Matt Cooper said. “We haven’t (gone) back to oil and gas, so we might just be geothermal people for quite some time, maybe generations, and then eventually something else will come along.”

While the Coopers were learning to use their drill in October, Wade Gerber was in downtown Craig distilling grain neutral spirits — used to make gin and vodka — on a day off from the Craig Station power plant. Gerber stepped over his corgis, Ali and Boss, and onto a stepladder to peer into a massive stainless steel pot where he was heating wheat and barley.

Gerber’s spent three decades in coal. When closure plans were announced four years ago, he, his wife Tenniel and their friend McPherson brainstormed business ideas.

“With my background in plumbing and electrical from the plant it’s like, oh yeah, I can handle that part of it,” Gerber said about distilling. “This is the easy part.”

He used Tri-State’s education subsidies for classes in distilling, while other co-workers learned to fix vehicles or repair guns to find new careers. While some plan to leave town, Gerber is opening Bad Alibi Distillery. McPherson and Tenniel Gerber are opening a cocktail bar next door.

Everyone in town hopes Trump will step in to extend the plant’s life, Gerber said. Meanwhile, they’re trying to define a new future for Craig in a nerve-wracking time.

“For me, my products can go elsewhere. I don’t necessarily have to sell it in Craig, there’s that avenue. For someone relying on Craig, it’s even scarier,” he said.

QUESTIONING THE COAL ROLLBACK

Tammy Villard owns a gift shop, Moffat Mercantile, with her husband. After the coal closures were announced, they opened a commercial print shop too, seeing it as a practical choice for when so many high-paying jobs go away.

Villard, who spent a decade at Colowyo as administrative staff, said she doesn’t understand how the state can throw the switch to turn off coal and still have reliable electricity. She wants the state to slow down.

Villard describes herself as a moderate Republican. She said political swings at the federal level — from the green energy push in the last administration to doubling down on fossil fuels in this one — aren’t helpful.

“The pendulum has to come back to the middle,” she said, “and we are so far out to either side that I don’t know how we get back to that middle.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/00/3003b58c-6876-5141-9551-546d5c2e39dc/6932df2eadfc0.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-07 13:00:07.920728

Rather than reducing wildfire and protecting forests, they say the bill is a giveaway to the timber industry that will worsen wildfires and other threats American forests are facing.
“You can’t fix a problem with forests with the same methods that have caused the degradation to begin with.” Why now?
Giving the Feds more freedom to undertake intensive projects will reduce the amount of biomass available to burn and more readily allow for emergency management projects, they say.","A new bill moving through Congress promises a major overhaul in the way federal officials manage public lands in the United States. Lawmakers have framed the Fix Our Forests Act (FOFA), passed by the House of Representatives, as a necessary response to the spate of disastrous wildfires that have burned in the West over the last several years. The bipartisan bill would remove impediments to logging, allowing the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management vastly more latitude to remove what they say is the fuel that drives wildfires.

But critics contend that the bill’s purported solutions are a mirage. Instead of addressing the crisis, this bill would allow federal agencies to push through large management projects indiscriminately, while limiting avenues for public oversight. Though there is broad support for reducing wildfire destruction, some lawmakers and conservationists say FOFA’s effects on public lands would be disastrous. Rather than reducing wildfire and protecting forests, they say the bill is a giveaway to the timber industry that will worsen wildfires and other threats American forests are facing.

“Forests are broken because of the extent of logging that’s happened over the last five or six decades,” said Dominick DellaSala, a biodiversity and climate change scientist with the Conservation Biology Institute who is a critic of the bill. “You can’t fix a problem with forests with the same methods that have caused the degradation to begin with.”

Why now?

The enormity of fire disasters in recent years—including those in Maui, Los Angeles, and Texas—has been impossible to ignore. This is why the bill has garnered broad, bipartisan support, including in the Senate, where the bill passed out of committee but has yet to receive a floor vote. Its cosponsors are Democrats Alex Padilla of California and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, along with Republicans John Curtis of Utah and Tim Sheehy of Montana. FOFA offers provisions that supposedly would help land managers address the fire threat, seemingly oriented around the theory that more actively managing forests—through increased logging—can reduce the potential for large wildfires.

Specific provisions in FOFA allow for this in several ways. These include allowing certain projects to be exempted from the National Environmental Policy Act. Projects under 3,000 acres are typically able to get these exceptions, called “categorical exclusions,” if projects are claimed to pose little environmental risk. But the new law would enable exclusions for projects up to 10,000 acres, which would allow federal authorities to avoid currently required environmental analyses for far more management projects.

If FOFA becomes law, land managers would also be able to log and thin in designated fireshed management areas—fire-prone landscapes up to 250,000 acres—without current levels of environmental review. At the same time, it would give officials leeway to skip Endangered Species Act and National Historic Preservation Act review requirements.

For the public, the bill aims to limit input and reduce transparency by narrowing the timeframe that stakeholders have to challenge newly announced rules. The current allowance of time is six years, but under FOFA, the public would have 150 days, following the announcement of the decision, to mount a challenge.

Failed solutions

Many of the bill’s supporters, such as members of the Congressional Western Caucus, contend that cutting “red tape” is what will make FOFA effective. Giving the Feds more freedom to undertake intensive projects will reduce the amount of biomass available to burn and more readily allow for emergency management projects, they say.

But opponents say that the regulatory burden—already significantly weakened in recent years—is not the cause of worsening wildfires. Rather, they point to abundant data that long-standing patterns of active management are themselves worsening fire risk. This cohort includes DellaSala, who has authored numerous papers on wildfire and testified regularly in Congress on forest health.

He sees at least four components as essential to addressing the wildfire crisis: immediately cutting emissions (including from logging), which exacerbate climate change and make the scale of fires worse; protecting existing natural areas, which he describes as “our best natural climate solution”; focusing on preventing home ignitions by improving home hardening and defensible space in fire-prone areas; and by stopping road construction through wildlands. “Something like 90 percent of all fires nationwide have a human ignition factor built in,” he said. “We can’t stop lightning, but we can reduce the incidence of human-caused fires by having a better transportation management plan, which means closing and obliterating many roads.”

Timothy Ingalsbee, a former wildland firefighter and now wildland fire ecologist, is executive director of Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology. He also emphasizes the harms of road building—often falsely characterized as necessary for effective wildland firefighting—agreeing that FOFA on the whole is a dangerous bill.

He does think that, in isolation, some of FOFA’s provisions around wildland firefighting are important, but he worries about the impacts of the law’s overall approach on firefighter morale. “There is a legitimate need for proactive fire fuels management,” Ingalsbee said, pointing to prescribed burning, Indigenous cultural burning, and community fire preparation. Fire is inevitable and necessary in fire-prone landscapes, he said, and the century-plus-long practice of total fire suppression needs to change. “The exclusion of fire is now coming back to haunt us.”

“A treacherous bill”

Critics of the bill are especially alarmed at what they characterize as a power grab, done under the guise of a wildfire emergency, by which stripped-down and unaccountable agencies can undertake whatever sorts of projects they want.

“In the name of improving conditions in the forests and safety for communities, all of which this bill does not actually accomplish, the bill is going to end up taking out a whole lot of other laws and safeguards that have been in place for decades,” said Zack Porter, executive director of the Vermont-based wildland advocacy organization Standing Trees. “Ecological consequences aside, [FOFA] is a treacherous bill for maintaining the fragile democracy that we have.”

Porter is frustrated that the bill has taken on a bipartisan consensus, with Democrats—including those from eastern states, where wildfire has not traditionally been a major issue—signing on. He is especially incensed that his state’s junior senator, Peter Welch, voted yes in October on moving FOFA out of committee in the Senate, despite a July pledge to vote against the bill.

“Some of the same Democratic lawmakers who have rightly pointed out how the Trump administration is using manufactured emergencies to gain control—how are they not seeing through the ways that this bill does the exact same thing under the guise of the wildfire crisis?” Porter asked.

For Porter, DellaSala, and Ingalsbee, the issue is ultimately bigger than FOFA. It’s the confluence of a range of Trump administration policies that are handing even more control of public lands to industry, limiting public insight, and collectively worsening ecological health through a dramatic intensification of long-standing destructive policies. They point to the Roadless Rule rescission, along with Trump’s Executive Order 14225, titled Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production, as a sort of perfect storm of environmental harm that may lead to vastly more logging in some of the nation’s oldest and wildest forests—all more or less undertaken under the guise of so-called responsible land management.

DellaSala said he sees the same arguments playing out as when he first testified in Congress in the early 1990s—even as, 30 years later, so many protections have already been rolled back.

“It’s been an accumulation of eroding our nation’s protections and forest regulations to the point where, if FOFA gets through, it’s going to be a house-of-cards thing for forests, where the public has very little say in outcomes,” he said. “You’re going to get very simple environmental assessments that look to bypass regulations and push through these destructive projects that are only going to make the problem worse in the long run.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-07 11:02:56.055152

This rapid expansion underscores the success of India’s solar manufacturing journey, driven by strong collaboration between industry stakeholders, State Governments, and the Central Government.","New Delhi : The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has called for a calibrated and well-informed financing approach across the solar manufacturing ecosystem to ensure sustainable and balanced growth of the renewable energy sector. The Ministry also reaffirmed that no advisory has been issued to financial institutions to pause or halt fresh lending to renewable energy (RE) projects.

India continues to strengthen its clean energy footprint, having already achieved 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources—a milestone reached five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement. As of 31 October 2025, the country’s installed non-fossil capacity stands at 259 GW, with 31.2 GW added in the current financial year alone.

In response to reports claiming that MNRE had urged lenders to stop financing RE projects due to concerns over overcapacity, the Ministry issued a clear clarification. MNRE confirmed that no such advisory has been issued to banks or financial institutions regarding lending restrictions on renewable energy power projects or equipment manufacturing facilities.

However, MNRE has shared updated data with the Department of Financial Services and key NBFCs—including PFC, REC, and IREDA—regarding the current domestic manufacturing capacities across the solar PV value chain. This includes solar modules, cells, ingots-wafers, polysilicon, and ancillary components such as solar glass and aluminium frames. The objective is to help institutions make strategic, informed investment decisions and encourage them to diversify lending across upstream and ancillary segments, rather than concentrating mainly on module manufacturing.

The Government of India remains committed to building a self-reliant, globally competitive solar manufacturing ecosystem. Backed by initiatives such as the PLI Scheme for High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules, India’s manufacturing capacity has witnessed remarkable growth—from 2.3 GW in 2014 to nearly 122 GW enlisted in MNRE’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) today.

This rapid expansion underscores the success of India’s solar manufacturing journey, driven by strong collaboration between industry stakeholders, State Governments, and the Central Government. It also reaffirms India’s pledge to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, significantly contributing to global decarbonisation efforts.",https://impressivetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/THE-IMPRESSIVE-TIMES-48.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 15:59:55.442272

Because action on climate is action on biodiversity and land; because action on land is action on climate; because action on chemicals, pollution, and waste is action on nature and on climate.","As geopolitical challenges and tensions escalate globally, one thing is clear: Fragmented politics will not fix a fractured planet.

This is why the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA)—the world’s highest decision-making body on the environment—is so critical to address our shared and emerging environmental threats.

The seventh session of the assembly, taking place at the headquarters of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi, Kenya this month, will bring together ministers, intergovernmental organizations, multilateral environmental agreements, the broader UN system, civil society groups, scientists, activists, and the private sector to shape global environmental policy.

Recent UNEP data show emissions continue to rise as the impacts of global environment and climate challenges are accelerating and growing ever more extreme. We see it in record heatwaves; disappearing ecosystems; and toxins in our air, water, and soil. These are global threats that demand global solutions.

To deliver at the speed and scale required, the United Nations system must act together—with the full family of Multilateral Environmental Agreements coming together to support countries.

Even in turbulent times, environmental multilateralism continues to deliver. Since countries met at UNEA last year, this multilateralism has delivered important progress.

Governments agreed to establish the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste, and Pollution—finally completing the “trifecta” of science bodies alongside the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The BBNJ Agreement on the sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction came into force, a major win for the governance of our oceans.

Importantly, during such a challenging political climate, the Paris Agreement is showing that it is working. However, it is clear we need to move much faster with greater determination. But change is afoot: The global shift to low-emission and climate-resilient development is irreversible. Renewable energy is outcompeting fossil fuels pricewise. Climate smart investments are driving tomorrow’s vibrant economies and societies.

While we must recognize that many were hoping COP30 would include explicit reference to phasing out fossil fuels in the decision text, this was not to be. However, the COP president committed to creating two road maps during his one-year tenure, one to halt and reverse deforestation and another to transition away from fossil fuels—a move that was backed by more than 80 countries during the talks.

These are not small steps—nor are they enough to address the threats we face in full. But they do reinforce that multilateralism can still bring science and policy together to address our global challenges.

Of course, progress is not always straight forward. Since UNEA’s historic resolution in 2022 on a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, negotiations have continued to advance. While we do not yet have a full treaty text agreed, the latest talks in Geneva earlier this year made hard fought progress and countries remain at the table, sustaining momentum toward an agreement that ends plastic pollution once and for all.

This year, under the theme “Advancing sustainable solutions for a resilient planet,” UNEA will build on these wins to set the stage for even greater progress.

The seventh edition of UNEP’s flagship report, the Global Environmental Outlook, will be key to informing how we deliver this future. Released during UNEA, the report will help move us beyond diagnoses of our common challenges to identifying real solutions across five interconnected areas: economics and finance; circularity and waste; environment; energy; and food systems. Drawing on contributions from hundreds of experts worldwide, the Outlook will help countries prioritize the most effective solutions to deliver our global goals.

To deliver at the speed and scale required, the United Nations system must act together—with the full family of Multilateral Environmental Agreements coming together to support countries. UNEP is proud to host 17 conventions and panels that span the environmental spectrum, from toxic chemicals to protection of the ozone layer. Bringing this family of agreements closer together offers opportunities to better align priorities.

This is why UNEA will put a central focus on how these agreements can better work together for accelerated, more targeted support to countries as they implement commitments. Because action on climate is action on biodiversity and land; because action on land is action on climate; because action on chemicals, pollution, and waste is action on nature and on climate.

Inaction now carries a clearer cost than ever. At UNEA-7 in Nairobi—the environmental capital of the world—the “Nairobi Spirit” can convert shared challenges into shared action and, ultimately, shared prosperity on a safe, resilient planet that benefits all.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62288514&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C413%2C0%2C414,N,,2025-12-07 11:03:09.879149

The total market cap of bitcoin miners has collapsed from over $90 billion in mid-October to around $55 billion today, according to Bitcoin Mining Stock (4).","Bitcoin mining — a noisy energy hog

In 2021, China cracked down on cryptocurrencies and banned Bitcoin mining and trading. Since then, the U.S. has taken the title of the world’s biggest Bitcoin mining hub, accounting for about 75% of reported activity, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (2).

In the U.S., the Federal Reserve decides how much money should be minted each year. But cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are decentralized and no specific body or organization controls them.

So how do new bitcoins enter the economy? They’re mined.

If you’re picturing a worker with a pickaxe, replace the worker with a computer and the pickaxe with computing power.

Bitcoin mining plants operate tens of thousands of computers day and night to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to add a transaction “block” to the public bitcoin ledger, which is known as the blockchain. As a reward, they are granted newly minted bitcoins.

The higher the price of Bitcoin, the more incentive to mine, and the price is up over 400% in the last five years.

The total Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million, and there are currently about 19.9 million in circulation today. As the price rose, mining became more profitable, which led to more miners competing to solve blocks and an increase in overall electricity use.

From mid-2022 to mid-2023, the 34 largest mines in the U.S. consumed 32.3 terawatt-hours of electricity, 33% more than Los Angeles and enough for three to six million homes, according to one study published in Nature Communications (3). Worse still, 85% of this power came from fossil fuels.

Most of the mines were in Texas, New York, Georgia, Pennsylvania and North Dakota. Locals have complained about a constant din from the mining rigs, and lawmakers are concerned about how they’re affecting the utility bills and air quality of residents.

Trump’s strategy

Eric Trump has traveled the world talking about American Bitcoin, which he is a stakeholder in along with his older brother, Donald Trump Jr.. On stage at the Consensus conference in Toronto earlier this year, he emphasized that the Trump administration’s pro-fossil-fuel energy policies were going to help crypto mining.

“We believe we have the cheapest energy anywhere in the country, so much of it coming out of West Texas. We have a president of the United States who actually believes in having a proper energy policy … where he wants the cheapest energy of anywhere in the world because that’s going to fuel all the innovation that we’re talking about right now,” he said. “Go try and mine Bitcoin in France. Go try and mine Bitcoin in Scotland … you’re just never going to do it. The energy price is too high.”

Trump has focused on rolling back clean energy regulations to bring energy prices down. He has also attacked the clean energy industry, shutting down projects and claiming it’s the reason for high electricity prices, even though the data undermines that argument.

O’Leary’s ESG bet

O’Leary on the other hand says low-cost sustainable energy, which Bitzero champions, is the future of Bitcoin mining.

Founded in 2021, the Vancouver-based company has four data centers for mining in three countries — Norway, Finland and the U.S. — and, the CEO told Moneywise, they use “100% renewable energy.”

The company said the currently available energy mix at its remote 184-acre North Dakota site includes wind, natural gas and grid sources. Natural gas is considered much cleaner than other fossil fuels like coal, but it isn’t strictly a renewable source unless it’s produced from organic waste. Bitzero hopes to use only renewable energy when the site becomes operational.

This has been the direction the industry has been moving in. A global survey by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance showed that miners’ electricity mix is predominantly sustainable (52.4%), with renewables accounting for 42.6% and nuclear accounting for 9.8%. Natural gas has also replaced coal as the single largest energy source used in Bitcoin mining.

How you can invest

There are many bitcoin mining firms that are publicly-listed in the U.S., like Riot Blockchain (RIOT), IREN (IREN), Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Cipher Mining (CIFR), CleanSpark (CLSK), Bitdeer (BTDR) and TeraWulf (WULF).

When deciding whether or not to invest, it’s important to consider companies’ fundamentals, like costs per coin mined. O’Leary says he looks at power contracts: “What's your power coming in at? It's over 8 cents kWh? No thanks.”

You may also choose for ideological or strategic reasons to look at how they source their energy and if that aligns with your values and expectations of how policies are going to look in the future. For example, IREN claims to use 100% renewable energy at its data centers. Despite its name, CleanSpark runs on “low-carbon power” and not 100% renewable energy.

These companies do remain very vulnerable to the price of bitcoin plummetting. The total market cap of bitcoin miners has collapsed from over $90 billion in mid-October to around $55 billion today, according to Bitcoin Mining Stock (4).

However, they may have the opportunity of repurposing their computing capacity for AI and other uses. JPMorgan analysts recently published a note highlighting the flurry of deals as crypto miners convert to high-performance computing (HPC) power providers.

The investment bank lifted its stock ratings on Cipher Mining and CleanSpark to ""overweight,"" citing the former's recent 410 MW of HPC contracts and the latter's 200 MW of critical-IT potential at its newly acquired 285-MW Texas site, according to The Block (5).

In the Sackett case, the court majority ruled that the waters of the U.S. shouldn’t include wetlands unless they have a direct “continuous surface connection” to another body of water.
While Alsentzer wasn’t happy with the Sackett decision, he argues the new proposed rules curtail federal clean water protections even more.
“Federal law has never said a family farmer can't do what they need to do to support ag on their land,” he said.
“Montana and our ranching community works very hard, is very much a steward of the environment,” she said.","HELENA — The Trump administration is proposing changes to the definition of what bodies of water are considered “the waters of the United States.” While it may seem like an obscure or even irrelevant question, Montana agricultural organizations say it’s not just academic for farmers and ranchers.

The Clean Water Act gives the federal government the authority to address pollution in “waters of the United States.” That means a wide variety of land use activities may require a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency if it’s determined they would affect those waters.

(Watch the video to hear more on the possible impacts of a change to WOTUS.)

Montana Ag: What Waters of the U.S. changes could mean for agriculture

Over the last decade, different federal administrations have tried to establish different standards for when a body of water qualifies as a water of the U.S.

“WOTUS really did put ranchers and agricultural producers in a very difficult position,” said Raylee Honeycutt, executive vice president of the Montana Stockgrowers Association. “It was kind of like a pingpong game: We kept seeing rules changing and going back and forth, expansion, reduction.”

The Stockgrowers and other agricultural groups celebrated in 2023, when the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Sackett v. EPA narrowed the definition of “waters of the U.S.” The Trump administration says its proposed new rules are intended to implement the Sackett decision.

Honeycutt says she’s hopeful these rule changes will bring more stability for agriculture.

“Really what Montana Stockgrowers was asking for – as well as the larger livestock community – was some certainty and clarity in the rules, so that people could continue to plan and make business decisions based off those rules,” she said.

She says one of the major concerns for farmers and ranchers was whether federal regulations extended to “ephemeral” bodies of water – those that don’t have water for the entire year.

“At one point in time, we were talking about puddles of water that had standing water on it being navigable and being under the authority of the EPA,” she said. “So what we're really seeing is some commonsense approach to, when there's water standing because it's rained a lot, that isn't necessarily a body of water that should be regulated by the EPA.”

The EPA says the new definitions would focus enforcement on “relatively permanent” bodies of water. In the Sackett case, the court majority ruled that the waters of the U.S. shouldn’t include wetlands unless they have a direct “continuous surface connection” to another body of water. The new rule would define that by saying a wetland must border a body of water under federal jurisdiction and have surface water at least during a “wet season.”

The agency also says it’s planning to make changes specifically with agricultural producers in mind, including expanding exclusions to limit the number of ditches that would fall under federal jurisdiction and reinstating a specific exemption for groundwater.

Not everyone is happy with what the administration is proposing.

“This narrow interpretation isn't based on science; it's based on essentially a wish list of, ‘How can we do as much as we want everywhere?’” said Guy Alsentzer, executive director of the environmental group Upper Missouri Waterkeeper.

While Alsentzer wasn’t happy with the Sackett decision, he argues the new proposed rules curtail federal clean water protections even more.

“If you care about clean and healthy water, you can't just care about the river – you’ve got to care about all its arteries, which is to say its headwaters and its wetlands,” he said. “This is an unscientific rule.”

He argues development and other actions taken on lands that only have water for part of the year can still have significant downstream impacts.

Alsentzer believes the concerns about how a stricter WOTUS rule would affect farms and ranches are overstated.

“Federal law has never said a family farmer can't do what they need to do to support ag on their land,” he said. “What federal law has said is, the big industrial-scale operators, you've got to take responsibility for your pollution.”

Honeycutt said, regardless of these changes, there are still going to be federal environmental protections in place, as well as protections at the state level.

“Montana and our ranching community works very hard, is very much a steward of the environment,” she said. “We want the world and the earth to be thriving. We are just one component in making that a success.”

Alsentzer said Montana does have state protections, but he questioned whether the state would have sufficient funding to fill the gap if federal oversight is cut back.

The EPA will be accepting public comment on the changes to the WOTUS rule through Jan. 5, 2026. Both Honeycutt and Alsentzer said their groups are encouraging their allies to submit input.

“We're working with our members as well as our national partners to make sure that ranching and the agricultural community is very represented,” said Honeycutt.

“We need to, at minimum, let them know that we care, we're watching and we're upset with the decisions they make,” Alsentzer said. “And then to the extent that they still make a bad decision, then it's incumbent on us to stand up for our rights.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/73f4432/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4240x2226+0+303/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Ff2%2F7a%2Fcb16e1904439b872ce7641d1d02e%2Fdsc03293.JPG,N,,2025-12-07 11:03:19.730899

Expensive natural gas prices hit households with a double whammy Because natural gas is the largest source of U.S. electricity generation, when the fuel gets more expensive, it forces consumers to pay higher electricity bills.
“Natural gas prices tend to be the biggest determinant of power prices,” according to EIA.","When fracking spread across our country in the early 2000s, it ushered in an era of cheap gas and fundamentally changed the American energy landscape. Gas toppled coal to become the dominant source of electricity generation in the country–– and the United States became the world’s largest natural gas producer.

However, we’ve gotten so used to the idea of cheap natural gas that we’re failing to reassess whether that narrative is still true. The data is increasingly telling us it isn’t – we’re now the world’s largest natural gas exporter and natural gas power plants are far more expensive to build – both of which force Americans to pay more for power. That means we risk locking ourselves into expensive decisions with decades-long consequences.

The fracking revolution began nearly 20 years ago—today’s reality is different. If government officials and utility executives still think we’re in the era of cheap natural gas, their decisions will be driven by outdated knowledge, and they won’t be able to fight rising power prices if they invest in the wrong technology.

Natural gas prices face upward pressure on two fronts

Soaring data center electricity demand has sent utilities scrambling to add new sources of electricity to the grid. In places like Virginia, ground-zero for the data center surge and home to roughly 20% of the world’s data centers, the gas industry is shouting from the rooftops that gas is needed to meet this new demand while keeping costs low.

That premise is wrong on multiple levels.

First, it’s essentially impossible to build a new gas-fired power plant by the end of this decade. Gas turbine manufacturers like GE Vernova, Siemens Energy, and Mitsubishi scaled back their production capabilities years ago when new turbine orders were few and far between. As a result, power producers trying to source new turbines face wait times of five to seven years.

Second, much of the workforce that built the surge of gas infrastructure in the 2000s and 2010s has either retired or moved on to other industries, creating a deep workforce shortage. If utilities want to build a new gas plant, it’ll be years before they can get the equipment, and even then, it’s hard to find workers to build it—but we need the power now, not in 2030. That means new gas-fired power plants will be dramatically more expensive this time around.

NextEra CEO John Ketchum says building a new gas-fired power plant today would cost three times as much as the last facility the utility built, back in 2022.

And that’s only half of the equation—once the facility is built, you need fuel to run it. Turns out, that’s drastically more expensive now too.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts natural gas prices will rise 14% in 2026, following a 59% year-over-year increase from 2024 to 2025. EIA attributes rising prices to increased demand stemming from rising liquified natural gas (LNG) exports and flat production capabilities.

“Gas is only going to get more expensive going forward,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s energy program. “You can build more pipelines in Virginia or anywhere else, but that extra natural gas is still going to be competing with folks in Berlin and Beijing for access to the U.S. gas.”

“LNG is tying us more to global markets that pay more than we do for gas,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas, Austin. “That has to put more upward pressure on gas.”

Like any other commodity that’s sold across the world, gas companies seek the highest-priced markets. These companies say American natural gas increases our domestic energy security, but they don’t care about home heating bills, they just want to make the highest possible profit – even if that means selling our gas to countries like China.

And yet, Energy Secretary Chris Wright wants to double LNG exports within five years, and then double them again. LNG exports already increased 25% between 2024 and 2025.

Expensive natural gas prices hit households with a double whammy

Because natural gas is the largest source of U.S. electricity generation, when the fuel gets more expensive, it forces consumers to pay higher electricity bills. In fact, every region of the country has seen electricity prices increase over the last three years.

Wholesale electricity prices spiked 23% in 2025, and EIA predicts they’ll climb another 8.6% in 2026. “Natural gas prices tend to be the biggest determinant of power prices,” according to EIA.

But it’s not just electricity bills that are causing sticker shock—the majority of homes in the U.S. use natural gas to heat them, so as gas prices rise, so too will home heating bills. Indeed, EIA is forecasting that home heating costs will rise next year. Federal Reserve data shows retail gas utility service has risen 11% over the past year, near an all-time high. That means more expensive home heating bills for families this winter, potentially fueling the 8% increase in home heating costs expected this year.

Americans are already struggling to pay their utility bills—1 in 20 households has a utility debt high enough to be sent to a collection agency, and average monthly energy bills have increased 35% since 2022, according to a recent report.

Fortunately, rapidly growing wind, solar, and storage can help keep costs in check and can be deployed quickly to meet growing electricity demand. Wind and solar are the cheapest sources of new electricity, and they’ve gotten exponentially cheaper over the past decade-- 91% of new renewable power projects commissioned last year were more affordable than new fossil fuels, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

And renewables and battery storage are essentially the only new sources of electricity being added to the U.S. grid right now, comprising over 90% of new capacity in 2025 and 2024. The truth is that states with the highest levels of wind and solar generation like Iowa, Oklahoma, and New Mexico have had the lowest utility bill rate increases in America, Energy Innovation research finds.

If policymakers rely on natural gas as a solution for the energy affordability crisis, they will fail to protect American families and businesses from higher energy prices.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6932f71620d81e28e50d703d/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-07 09:00:30.220540

Economic and Environmental Implications

Beyond its economic benefits, the Gorgon Stage 3 project carries significant environmental considerations. Chevron’s proposal was accepted by the offshore environmental regulator in November, following a public comment period. This approval indicates that the project meets the necessary environmental standards and regulations, a critical aspect in today’s energy sector.

The development is not only poised to enhance LNG exports but also to secure long-term gas supplies for local consumption. Western Australia’s 15% gas reservation policy ensures that a portion of the gas produced is allocated for domestic use, supporting local energy needs. This policy is crucial for balancing export opportunities with domestic energy security, a growing concern in many regions worldwide.

What's happening?

As ABC News reported, voters in many states have been expressing their frustration after utility rate hikes. The issue has been especially on voters' minds in key battleground states as Democrats and Republicans debate over affordable electricity.

A survey found that 36% of American adults find their electricity bills to be a major source of stress. As an estimated 80 million Americans are struggling to pay their utility bills, Charles Hua from the consumer advocacy organization PowerLines said: ""It's a life or death and 'eat or heat' type decision that people have to make.""

Why are rising energy bills significant?

Increasingly expensive electricity bills are straining Americans' budgets and forcing them to make difficult decisions that affect their safety and comfort. The high cost of electricity is affecting people's health, and experts anticipate these costs will continue to rise as AI data centers expand.

The issue is also impacting politics, as voters demand relief amid unaffordable price hikes. Politicians must rise to the challenge of addressing their constituents' concerns and work to lower energy costs to affordable levels.

What's being done about high energy costs?

Some companies, such as Georgia Power, have proposed spending billions of dollars to expand their power-generating capacity to meet data center demand. There are discussions underway among lawmakers about whether data centers will have to pay their fair share of the power they use or if taxpayers will bear those costs.

He leads the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu appointed him in 2023 to steer a city famous for ambition and equally famous for smoke. His mandate is simple in writing and complex in practice: protect public health through stronger environmental governance.

His signature has been evidence. Real-time air quality monitors now sit in neighbourhoods across the city. They feed data into dashboards that guide policy. These tools allow his team to move from hunches to measurable trends. Pollution becomes something they can track, map, and confront.

Enforcement gives the science its teeth. Hotels, bakeries, factories, and prayer houses have been sealed for crossing environmental lines. His critics say the actions feel dramatic. Supporters see a consistent message: rules exist for a reason. The visibility of these shutdowns has pulled public attention toward issues once ignored.

Ajayi’s range extends beyond the streets of Lagos. He appears at regional and global forums where climate resilience and the blue economy dominate the agenda. His advocacy time and again circles back to a single idea: research achieves little until it shapes the lives of ordinary people. He argues that environmental justice requires translation, not abstraction.

His career bridges academia, public health, and administration. That combination explains his push for data-driven systems. It also explains projects like the Lagos Carbon Market, which sits at the intersection of climate finance and state-level governance. The idea is bold: create incentives for cleaner practices within Africa’s most commercially active city.

CHINESE CLEANTECH INVESTMENT INTO AUSTRALIA HAS COLLAPSED, PUTTING AT RISK THE COUNTRY’S NET ZERO & INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION GOALS

A new report released today by independent think tank Climate Energy Finance (CEF), Rising Tide: China’s Outbound Cleantech Capital Surge Drives Global Collaboration Toward Net Zero, finds that Chinese firms have committed more than US$180bn of outbound foreign direct investment (OFDI) in cleantech since the start of 2023 – up 80% since CEF’s Green Capital Tsunami report a year ago.

China’s investment into cleantech manufacturing and clean energy infrastructure spanned batteries, battery materials, solar PV, wind, EVs, hydro-electricity and green hydrogen industrial precincts in countries as diverse as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Türkiye, Brazil, Hungary, Spain, France, Portugal, Azerbaijan, Zambia, Egypt, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia.

The sheer scale and depth of Chinese cleantech firms’ green energy statecraft push over the last three years is bringing about a profound shift in the global energy, economic and geopolitical landscape, extending China’s leadership and influence as the US withdraws from the net zero playing field since the re-election of President Trump in 2024, and initiates a trade war.

For China and its partners, investment and technology cooperation on green manufacturing and clean energy infrastructure is a win-win-win. It aligns with delivery of host countries’ net zero targets and green industrialisation priorities, with a focus on building domestic capabilities through learning and technology transfer, as China deploys its cleantech capital and overwhelming global decarbonisation leadership as a diplomatic instrument of its green energy statecraft. And a win in relation to climate.

The picture is different in Australia. Caution continues to define the federal government’s approach to Australia's #1 trade partner, maintaining a chilling effect on investment engagement. Chinese OFDI into Australia has collapsed by 85% since 2018, now making up only 1.5% of the total OFDI from all countries, a decline from the already exceptionally weak 1.87% in 2024. 2024 recorded the third lowest value and number of transactions since 2006 at just US$882m, a fraction of the peak of US$16bn in 2008.

Foreign capital, technology and knowhow are key to achievement of Australia’s decarbonisation goals. Around 70% of investment in Australian clean energy projects comes from overseas. The decline in engagement with China’s capital and expertise puts at risk Australia’s net zero and green re-industrialisation ambitions set out in its Future Made in Australia and Net Zero Plans. The report recommends reforms to enable carefully-managed strategic partnership with the world’s cleantech leader to support Australia’s energy transition, competitiveness and long-term prosperity.

Report lead author Caroline Wang, CEF’s China Analyst said:

“As this report shows, a new geoeconomic order is emerging as the primary engine of the energy transition, China, commits multibillions in foreign cleantech capital investment in renewables and green manufacturing projects. This is accelerating economic and technological integration between emerging economies and China across renewables and green industrial ecosystems. South-South cooperation is increasingly diversified and de-risked amid global trade and geopolitical uncertainties, through a mix of cross-border, public-private finance and project partnerships. At the same time, formalised knowledge sharing and capacity building initiatives such as training and R&D partnerships are rising.

In 2025, US tariffs, unilateralism and regression on renewables have further accelerated the shift in the centre of gravity of global commerce towards China and emerging economies, as countries seek to diversify their economic and political partnerships away from an unstable US and achieve their sustainable development goals.

Australia stands at a critical juncture. Chinese investment in Australia remains at historic lows. A multipolar world – no longer centred on the US, Australia’s traditional security ally – necessitates an urgent overhaul of its economic, foreign investment, and foreign policy settings. This means strategically working with China, or being left behind in the new world order. Australia has an opportunity to selectively partner with global Chinese cleantech firms, which bring not only capital, but world-class technology and expertise in areas of Australia’s national priority, particularly the Net Zero plan and Future Made in Australia plans, and to learn from some of the partnerships referenced in this report.

Not engaging with China’s capital and expertise will delay Australia’s net zero transition, putting at risk its decarbonisation goals and future prosperity in a net-zero global economy.”

Tim Buckley, CEF Director and former MD of global investment bank Citigroup said:

“China leads the world in almost all cleantech research, development and deployment. China leads the world in all cleantech manufacturing supply chains. China leads the world in cleantech domestic deployments and cleantech exports. Now, consistent with the Paris Agreement for economically developed countries to help the Global South deploy zero-emissions domestic energy solutions to overcome their addiction to imported fossil fuels, China leads the world in cleantech OFDI.

It is brilliant to record over US$180bn of OFDI from China since the start of 2023, up from US$100bn just one year earlier, as China develops partnerships and manufacturing capacities around the world to leverage their supply chains, technology leadership, capital and EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) capacities to accelerate cleantech deployments globally.”

Dr Muyi Yang, Senior Energy Analyst at global think tank Ember, said:

“China’s cleantech makers are now looking much more to overseas markets, as demand at home stabilises and the global energy transition speeds up. And that’s where the dilemma kicks in. Almost everyone agrees you can’t hit climate goals without working with China. But once cooperation moves to actually making clean products together, worries about over-reliance and ‘de-risking’ suddenly grow louder. The real challenge isn’t to cut China out, it’s to build more diversified, resilient supply chains that still tap into China’s know-how while helping other countries grow their own clean industries. If they don’t, by the time their local industries finally get going, Chinese companies may have already pulled even further ahead.”

Also see commentary from David Olsson AM, National President of the Australia China Business Council in the Foreword:

“Australia has an opportunity to align economic ambition with geopolitical reality. Preserving our security relationship with the United States should not preclude deeper collaboration with China in areas of shared economic and climate interest. A more nuanced and strategic approach to green energy statecraft – one that attracts investment while safeguarding national security – is essential to building economic resilience, securing our sovereign capabilities, and ensuring our competitiveness in a decarbonising world.”

The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy clarified it has not halted lending to renewable energy projects, despite concerns of oversupply in the solar PV module industry. The ministry aims for informed capital deployment, encouraging financing for upstream manufacturing stages rather than just modules. This comes as India nears its non-fossil fuel capacity target.

The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) on Sunday dismissed reports suggesting that it has asked financial institutions to pause fresh lending to renewable energy projects.

The clarification comes amid concerns of oversupply in India’s solar photovoltaic (PV) module industry and follows earlier communication urging lenders to take a cautious view on financing new, standalone module manufacturing capacity.

India has reached 50% of its installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, five years ahead of its Paris Agreement target. As of 31 October 2025, non-fossil capacity stands at about 259 GW, including 31.2 GW added so far in FY26.

The ministry said that there has been “no advisory to Financial Institutions for stopping lending to either renewable energy power projects or to renewable energy equipment manufacturing facilities.”

It further said that the objective is not to halt financing but to ensure informed capital deployment across the solar manufacturing ecosystem.

Live Events

The MNRE confirmed circulating the status of domestic manufacturing capacities to the Department of Financial Services and institutions such as PFC, REC and IREDA. According to the ministry, this information has been shared so that institutions “adopt a calibrated and well-informed approach while evaluating proposals for financing any manufacturing facility in solar PV manufacturing sector and explore and expand their solar PV manufacturing portfolio to upstream stages like solar cells, ingots-wafers and polysilicon as well as solar module ancillaries like solar glass and aluminium frames, etc. as well, rather than being limited to financing solar PV module manufacturing facilities alone.”

The clarification follows media reports stating that rapid expansion of standalone module units, combined with weakening export demand, could push the domestic market into oversupply.

Over the last three years, several Indian companies scaled up module capacity to target the U.S. market. However, higher U.S. tariffs and increased scrutiny of Indian shipments involving China-origin components have curbed exports, contributing to excess capacity in India.

Industry projections indicate module manufacturing capacity could rise to nearly 200 GW in the next few years, while solar cell capacity could grow to 100 GW—well above India’s near-term installation pace. This comes at a time when new solar project execution has slowed due to muted demand.

“The Government of India is committed to make India self-reliant in solar PV manufacturing and establish the country as a major player in the global value chain,” the ministry said.

It noted that solar module manufacturing capacity has expanded from 2.3 GW in 2014 to around 122 GW enlisted in the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers today—reflecting the cumulative efforts of industry, state governments and central initiatives.

The ministry added that it remains committed to further strengthening the solar manufacturing ecosystem through continued policy support, infrastructure development, and innovation,” and will continue working with stakeholders to ensure the sector remains competitive and future-ready.

The deadline has helped drive a big spike in business for solar installers as buyers rush to qualify for the 30% tax credit before it disappears. But California installers said lengthy utility permitting times could imperil customers’ tax credits if their systems aren’t in place by Dec. 31.

“Clients are concerned about potentially missing the tax credit deadline,” Anthony Del Bene, a manager at Berkeley solar installer A1 Sun, said in an email. “We explained that we would do everything possible to meet this timeframe [but] given the delays we’re seeing, I can’t say I feel completely at ease.”

US homeowners already pay more for solar and wait longer for installation than Australians and Europeans due to a byzantine permitting system, which varies from city to city and utility to utility. Now, with the sun setting on the federal tax credit, delays that prevent solar and battery installations until after Dec. 31 could cost homeowners $10,000 more for a typical project.

Emily Walker, director of insights at Boston-based solar marketplace EnergySage, said permitting has been a barrier in the US long before the current solar stampede. “Installers are working around the clock to meet the rush, but most have stopped promising year-end completion due to limited bandwidth and increasingly long and inconsistent permitting timelines,” she said in an email.

A US Internal Revenue Service spokesperson said that to qualify for the tax credit, homeowners need to complete installation of solar and battery systems by Dec. 31. For those installing both, a finished system often must include the attachment of a device called a meter socket adapter to their utility meter to connect solar and battery components without expensive electrical upgrades.

That creates a particular bottleneck in California, the nation’s largest solar market. Nearly 60% of new residential solar installations in the state include batteries compared to 40% nationally, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and utilities typically install the meter socket adapters.

Solar executives said it can then take up to a month or more for utilities to connect an installed system to the power grid, but that’s no longer a requirement to receive the tax credit.

Kevin Luo, policy and market development manager at industry group California Solar & Storage Association, said the race to go solar before the tax credits expire has only exacerbated longstanding permitting delays at two of the state’s big investor-owned utilities, PG&E Corp. and Southern California Edison.

“They had not prepared sufficiently for that even though they knew it was coming,” he said.

Lengthy municipal permitting times are also making it a gamble for homeowners trying to qualify for federal tax credits. “Many jurisdictions take weeks and sometimes months to approve permits for solar and battery systems, and that has caused significant delays in getting systems installed before the end of the year,” said Jake Hassid, managing partner at Northern California installer Simply Solar.

Bill Russell, a manager at solar installer NRG Clean Power in the Los Angeles area, said it’s taking Southern California Edison six to 10 weeks — four times longer than other utilities — to install meter socket adapters, putting customers’ ability to qualify for the 30% tax credit “in serious jeopardy.”

Southern California Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford said the utility has experienced “significant delays” in installing the devices between September and November due to a jump in applications from homeowners as the tax credit deadline approached. The utility is working to “speed up the process, enabling customers to receive their tax credits,” he said.

PG&E spokesperson Mike Gazda said the time to process meter socket adapter applications and install the devices was nine days in October and November, but several installers said they’re experiencing weeks or a month-long delay.

Barry Cinnamon, chief executive officer of Bay Area installer Cinnamon Energy Systems, said he launched a marketing campaign urging potential customers to “hurry up” after the enactment of the Trump administration’s tax bill in July scuttled tax credits and rebates for renewable energy, heat pumps and electric vehicles. That resulted in record sales, and Cinnamon hired more installers to handle the demand.

To avoid waiting for the utility to install meter socket adapters, he switched to a more expensive gadget called a gateway, which performs the same function but can be deployed by the installer. Otherwise, “we're not going to be able to complete the installation in time now because we will have that delay from the utility,” said Cinnamon.

China is broadcasting to the world that long-term industrial success lies in mastering the supply chain ecosystem, especially for core EV components. The path forward for Malaysia is clear: Proton and Perodua must collaborate to create a globally competitive local component industry through cross-company standardization.

Commonisation isn't new to the automotive industry. The Detroit Big Three achieved dominance in the 1950s and 60s on this very premise, derogatorily called ""badge engineering.""

General Motors, once the world's largest and most valuable company, was the most prolific practitioner.

The Japanese and Germans followed suit, with successful platform-sharing within corporate groups like VAG, Toyota Group and Hyundai-Kia.

But here's the problem: this practice remained limited to companies within the same corporate umbrella. Stellantis, Fiat-Chrysler, and the Renault-Nissan Alliance all attempted broader collaboration, but corporate egos prevented true industry-wide commonization.

At the 2015 Detroit Auto Show, former Fiat Chrysler chairman Sergio Marchionne captured the absurdity perfectly: ""Competition and brand-building means that every manufacturer wants to make its own core components, like, say, four-cylinder engines, leading to ruinous overlap. You are talking about hundreds of millions of duplicative and redundant investments that do not bear any benefit for the consumer.""

Yet to this day, car companies pour billions into building nearly identical engines differentiated only by letter acronyms - engines that 90 per cent of consumers couldn't distinguish if their lives depended on it.

This is where China rewrote the playbook. Chinese carmakers can now develop new models in under two years, while traditional brands still need three years or more.

They didn't discover magic - they took commonisation beyond corporate boundaries.

A June 2025 Wards Auto article captured this transformation through Ramiro Gutierrez, president of ZF North America, who described the stark difference:

""The approach of many legacy customers is 'No, I want my steering system, and my braking system, and my suspension system - and they cannot be the same as this other guy's.'

In China, the same systems can be sold to ten automakers because they realise standardisation will get them to market faster, and differentiating those systems provides no added value to the end user.""

The distinction is crucial: while VAG perfected parts-bin sharing within their empire, Chinese manufacturers embraced component sharing across competing companies and even across industries.

When German giants struggled with software, Chinese automakers simply partnered with smartphone and electronics companies who already had the expertise and operating systems ready to deploy.

In China, directly competing companies routinely use identical standardised modules from the same Tier-1 suppliers, creating a powerful ""ecosystem of scale."" This presents a fundamental divergence from the Western model.

Where Western standardisation remains confined to brands under a single corporate umbrella, China's scope spans multiple competing companies. This provides suppliers with aggregated volume from entire industry segments rather than single OEM groups. R&D costs amortise significantly faster when spread across many automakers, freeing companies to focus innovation on user experience, design, and software rather than proprietary engineering of commodity systems.

Consider CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer. Through their ""Choco-SEB"" swappable battery system, five major Chinese automakers including direct competitors like FAW, Changan, and GAC, all use the same standard battery packs.

Similarly, suppliers like Desay SV and iFLYTEK dominate the digital cockpit market by supplying identical domain controller modules and voice interaction systems to competing car brands.

This model delivers tremendous economic advantages: mega-scale production, rapid R&D amortisation, and aggressive reinvestment in innovation.

It creates a virtuous cycle where costs decrease while technology advances, benefiting the entire ecosystem.

The combined production of Proton and Perodua represents a domestic volume of about 420,000 units annually.

While this market size is not in the league of China, it provides the minimum viable scale necessary to attract major Tier-1 foreign investment, establish a high-tech local manufacturing base, and eventually anchor regional exports into Asean.

Both companies have already identified the same three components for localization. Instead of developing proprietary systems separately, a national standardization strategy could catalyze the birth of a local component industry.

First, both companies must agree on one or two standard battery pack formats, focusing on common physical dimensions and connection points.

Capacity (kWh) and chemistry (LFP vs. NMC) can vary, but standard form factors would create predictable demand for suppliers.

Second, they need to establish specifications for motor classes based on dimensions, power output ranges, mounting points, and core architecture requirements suited to the Malaysian market across different size and price segments.

Third, a common Battery Management System (BMS) platform architecture must be developed that suppliers can build upon, ensuring compatibility and economies of scale.

Ideally, these standards should be developed with other industry players beyond Proton and Perodua - but these two national champions must start the ball rolling.

The Government's Critical Role

Government action is absolutely essential to make this happen. The current EV steering committee provides a starting point - invite all industry players to the table and clearly indicate that the future will include national standards for these three key components.

All local assembly programmes must incorporate these local parts. The government must establish clear timelines and consequences: Standards must be established within three years

This will proceed regardless of individual company participation

Strategic incentives (R&D grants, tax breaks, pioneer status) for suppliers committing to produce standard components in Malaysia

Incentives for Proton and Perodua to offset initial risks in adopting common platforms

The government should also leverage diplomatic and trade relationships to attract global Tier-1 suppliers, ensuring investment packages include substantive technology transfer and local vendor development programmes.

A Golden Opportunity

The EV era offers Malaysia a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform from an assembler into a high-tech manufacturer.

Success won't come from going it alone. By emulating China's proven cross-company standardisation model, Proton and Perodua - with strong government support - can create the economies of scale necessary to birth a local EV component champion.

The question isn't whether Malaysia can afford to pursue this strategy. It's wchether we can afford not to.",,N,,2025-12-07 09:00:27.257736

Mosaic and the EPA have disputed the Center for Biological Diversity’s arguments in the case.","Mosaic urged the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss as “moot” a lawsuit filed by the Center for Biological Diversity challenging the project. The environmental group filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which last year approved the use of phosphogypsum for the pilot project on Mosaic property.

“Mosaic began construction activities the week of August 25, 2025, and began applying phosphogypsum as road base on October 7, 2025,” the company, which intervened in the case on the side of the EPA, said in Friday’s filing.

“It completed all portions of the road that involved phosphogypsum on November 4, 2025. Although Mosaic is still working to complete some ‘control’ sections of the road, those sections do not use any phosphogypsum — they are constructed from common road materials. Mosaic and University of Florida scientists and engineers will also test and monitor the road base as described in the (EPA) approval.”

Mosaic attorneys added, “This action (lawsuit) is now moot because construction of the phosphogypsum portions of the pilot road project is complete. The court should accordingly dismiss the (Center for Biological Diversity) petition for review.”

The Center for Biological Diversity filed the challenge in February, about two months after the EPA approved the project at Mosaic’s New Wales facility. The issue of using phosphogypsum in road-building has long been controversial, as opponents have pointed to potential cancer risks from the substance, which is typically stored in huge stacks, known as “gypstacks.”

In challenging the project, the Center for Biological Diversity has contended, in part, that a 1992 federal rule bars using phosphogypsum in road projects. It has cited concerns about radon emissions and potential air and groundwater pollution.

The EPA said in a court filing this year that the project was limited to a 3,200-foot road. Mosaic — a major player in the phosphate industry — used phosphogypsum from a stack on the New Wales property for the project, according to a declaration of a company official attached to the company’s filing Friday.

Mosaic and the EPA have disputed the Center for Biological Diversity’s arguments in the case.

“At bottom, EPA approved a site-specific project presenting total risks that are at least an order of magnitude less than placement of phosphogypsum in a stack,” EPA attorneys wrote in a September brief.

Mosaic said in a separate September brief that the Center for Biological Diversity’s “real concern is that the pilot will serve as a gateway to broader beneficial use of phosphogypsum in road base.”

Phosphogypsum includes radium, which decays to form radon gas. Radium and radon can cause cancer, and the giant stacks are used to try to limit public exposure to radon emissions, according to information on the EPA’s website.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df93f4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/949x498+0+67/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffd%2Fff%2Fc1fbea4f4d399febca3338680270%2Fnew-wales-phosphate-plant.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 06:00:02.881382

“Do you want to breathe? Do you want to drink water? Then save the Aravallis,” one of the many posters they held up read.

On December 3, Congress leader and chair of the Congress Parliamentary Party Sonia Gandhi cited the example of the Aravallis, detailing why India needed “a new deal for the environment”. “The Modi Government has now nearly signed a death warrant for these hills, already denuded by illegal mining,” she wrote in The Hindu.

On December 5, an online petition initiated by the citizen collectives People For Aravallis and Save Sariska said that the Supreme Court had immersed the ancient hill range into an “existential crisis” after its judgment on November 20. Among the five main demands that the online petition asks citizens to make is that India’s apex court recall its recent judgment – one, that they say, will endanger the Aravallis greatly. The petition, signed by citizen signatories, will be sent to around 30 officials and authorities including the Supreme Court of India.

What is this judgment, how is it endangering the Aravallis now, why are citizens galvanising into action for the hill range, and how bad is this ‘death warrant’ that Gandhi spoke about?

The Wire breaks it down for you.

What are the Aravallis?

The Aravallis are a long stretch of low-and mid-elevation hills (ranging from ) in northwest India.

The hill range contains a diverse variety of habitats. These include dry deciduous forests, such as those found in the Sariska Tiger Reserve which is home to India’s national animal; tropical thorn forests such as those that dominate in the Delhi Ridge right next door to the national capital; and wetlands like the Sambhar Lake near Jaipur, Rajasthan (formed due to a natural depression in the Aravalli hill range), which supports tens of thousands of local and migratory birds.

The Aravallis are also one of the oldest fold-mountain systems of the world: according to some estimates such as this one, it was formed in the Pre-Cambrian era which dates back to about 3-4 billion years ago. This makes it much older than the adjacent Himalayas (though home to the world’s tallest peak, this mountain range is only about 40-50 million years old).

The hill range provides a host of ecosystem services across its 700-km length. These include regulatory services which play a key role in maintaining climate, carbon sequestration, air and water quality, preventing soil erosion and more.

The Aravallis are also home to many sacred groves, or lands protected by local communities for their spiritual and cultural significance. In 2023, for instance, scientists identified a staggering 89 such small and big sacred sites in Udaipur district in the Rajasthan Aravallis alone.

“The Aravalli range, which runs from Gujarat through Rajasthan and till Haryana, has long played a significant role in Indian geography and history,” Gandhi wrote in an article for The Hindu on December 5. “It has served as a barrier to the spread of desertification from the Thar Desert to the Gangetic Plains, guarded Rajasthan's proudest forts such as Chittorgarh and Ranthambore, and served as the cradle of spirituality for communities across northwest India.”

Clearly, the Aravallis are important for not just wildlife and biodiversity, but people too.

A hill range already under threat

The Aravallis face a number of threats. Illegal mining is a prime concern. A book chapter in 2021 identified “illegal and rampant mining”, as well as unorganised urbanisation, over-exploitation of natural resources, introduction and spread of invasive species, disposal of untreated sewage and solid waste and deforestation as major threats.

The Delhi government itself identifies illegal mining, along with the construction of buildings, roads and housing, conversion of forest land into parks (such as this plan by the Haryana government), garbage dumping, and the introduction of invasive species (such as Prosopis juliflora or the vilayati babool tree) as some of the chief threats that the Delhi Ridge (which is part of the Aravallis in the union territory) experiences today.

One of the reasons why mining is such a huge threat across most of the hill range is that there has always been ambiguity in the definition of what constitutes a forest – and is therefore liable to be protected under Indian law – in many parts of the Aravallis. In Haryana for instance, the Aravallis are called gair mumkin pahar (or ‘uncultivable hilly areas’).

However, conservationists have been fighting long battles to ensure that these open forests, hillocks and grasslands are still protected, and illegal mining operations shut down. For instance, in July this year, the district of Nuh in Haryana got a dedicated ‘mining unit’ to prevent illegal mining; the local administration also closed down four roads allegedly constructed by illegal miners in the district and wrongly regularised, The Tribune reported.

Why are citizens demanding its protection now?

On November 20, the Supreme Court accepted a new definition of the Aravalli hill ranges that the Union Environment Ministry proposed: that only hills above 100 meters above the local terrain be considered as the ‘Aravalli Hills and Ranges’.

“Those hills and ranges comprising rocks of the Aravalli Supergroup and Delhi Supergroup, which originated during the Palacoproerozoid to Mesoproterozoic, having a relief higher than 100 meters (+5 Meters) above the surrounding terrain, may be defined as 'Aravalli Hills and Ranges’,” the court order read.

The new definition treats a landform as part of the Aravalli landscape only if it has at least 100 metres of elevation above the local relief (including the landform’s slopes and adjacent areas), the Jhatkaa signature petition that went online on December 5 noted. This is highly unusual: the elevations of physical and geographical features are usually expressed in metres above mean sea level – and are not dependent on the terrain around them. However, the report of the committee that looked into this that was accessed by The Wire justified this by noting that the use of elevation alone as a “sole criterion cannot suffice the purpose as taking the average elevation for defining Aravalli Hills and Ranges will lead to inclusion and exclusion error for selection of Aravalli Hills and Ranges in the four States”.

But here’s the problem: by this new definition, at least 90% of the Aravallis will no longer be protected legally.

According to a report by the Indian Express, internal documents of the Forest Survey of India (FSI) showed that only 1,048 of 12,081 Aravalli Hills 20 metres or higher and spread across 15 districts in Rajasthan, are 100 metres or more in height. This means that just about 8.7% of the Aravallis in Rajasthan will be protected by this definition. Rajasthan has the highest area under the Aravallis across all states. The news report also quoted an official of the Union Environment ministry as saying that the FSI had cautioned that the 100 metre cut-off “would protect only a few guard posts while surrendering the fences below”. Losing lower hills will likely expose vast areas to sand and dust particles blowing from the Thar desert to the Indo-Gangetic plains and endanger the livelihood of farmers and health of people, including those living in Delhi-NCR, the Indian Express quoted the unnamed official as saying.

“The acceptance of the uniform definition of the Aravalli hills by the SC bench is extremely regressive,” Neelam Ahluwalia, Founder Member, People for Aravallis, told The Wire.

“How can a 3 billion-year-old ecosystem which is India’s ecological, geological and cultural heritage be so narrowly defined to facilitate mining and commercial exploitation? India’s oldest mountain range is bleeding as a result of licensed and illegal mining and real estate development with hill after hill across Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat being razed to the ground. Aravallis require strict protection, not illogical and senseless definitions to exclude the majority of the areas from legal protection,” she said.

National security cited again

The new definition of the Aravallis has been adopted to enable mining in the area for reasons including “national security”, documents show.

After an order by the Supreme Court in May 2024, the Union Environment Ministry had constituted a Committee to develop a uniform definition of the Aravalli hills and ranges. While the Committee, after several meetings, agreed that “the presence of vegetation over the Aravalli slopes acts as a value-added protective layer”, arrests soil erosion, regulates local microclimate, and preserves biodiversity. The Committee also added that the hill range contains “precious and strategic minerals” such as gold, tungsten and lead. This offers “substantial potential for future exploration”, an additional affidavit on behalf of the Union Environment Ministry said.

The hills also contain “significant potential” for critical minerals such as graphite, lithium and other rare earth elements – “all of which are of growing strategic relevance for energy transition, high-technology manufacturing, and national security”.

“In this context, the Committee was of the considered opinion that while the ecological and environmental integrity of the Aravalli Hills and Ranges must remain the foremost priority, it is equally necessary to evolve framework that enables systematic, scientific, and environmentally sustainable exploitation of critical, strategic, and atomic minerals located within the region. Such a balanced approach would ensure that the country's strategic and developmental interests are not compromised, while upholding the objectives of conservation and ecological restoration.”

This is yet another instance wherein the Union Environment Ministry has cited national security and strategic interests to accelerate developmental activities. The ministry has used this very argument in the case of the slew of infrastructure projects planned in the Great Nicobar island in the Andaman and Nicobar island complex against which several sections of society including ecologists and activists have raised numerous concerns about.

A death knell for the Aravallis

The new re-definition of the Aravallis is disastrous for the hill range chiefly because of the impacts on people, biodiversity and the ecosystem due to the opening of vast tracts of the Aravallis to mining, environmentalists have said.

Even with existing levels of mining which is already “extensive”, all that local villagers are left with are just “bare hills, dust, rubble and diseases,” said activist Kailash Mina who has been leading grassroot struggles against illegal mining in the Aravallis.

“The uniform definition of the Aravalli hills accepted by the Supreme Court will lead to more destruction in the range and more negative impact on the communities dependent on the Aravallis for their sustenance. Agricultural productivity which has declined across the Aravalli belt in South Haryana and Rajasthan as a result of unavailability of water due to excessive mining and with a layer of dust from the stone crushers covering the crops will be more negatively impacted with more than 90% of the hills across the range not qualifying as Aravalli hills and being opened up for mining,” he added.

The mining that ensues will also have ramifications for human health – not just for local communities living in the vicinity and within the hill range, but even for people living in urban areas including the national capital of New Delhi. Mining in the Aravallis will release more dust and pollution into the air, and this will worsen the already poor air quality in the national capital because Delhi sits right on the edge of the hill range.

Medical practitioners have already noted how the current air quality in Delhi is disastrous for health, even affecting children negatively.

“How can we destroy more than 90% of [the Aravallis], with just one stroke? As a doctor I see more and more patients who are suffering the consequences of living in high levels of pollution,” Dr. Sharda Yadav, a medical doctor and resident of Gurgaon who participated in the Aravalli Bachao protest on November 30, said.

Yadav, who specialises in dental surgery, told The Wire that she now sees higher incidences of patients coming in with respiratory issues such as asthma and bronchitis as part of their broader, medical systemic history.

“Allergic elements present in polluted air cause coughing, sneezing and suffocation leading to mouth breathing. Chronic mouth breathing can lead to a variety of dental problems, including bad breath, gum disease and tooth decay primarily because it causes a dry mouth and affects oral hygiene,” Yadav said.

Ecological and environmental impacts

The Aravallis are already witnessing degradation due to mining, encroachment and urbanisation.

“Losing more hills and forests to mining will shrink habitat of wildlife and increase man-animal conflict; intensify desertification; worsen dust pollution, water scarcity and extreme weather events; negatively impact food and water security for millions of people living in North West India,” Ahluwalia told The Wire.

Trees and their canopy cover in the Aravalli hills preserve humidity in the atmosphere, moderates the wind velocity and helps regulate rainfall patterns, ecologist Pia Sethi said in a statement.

“The loss of vegetation cover with the opening up of smaller Aravalli hills for mining as they are not considered as Aravallis anymore can impact local rainfall patterns and temperature, leading to increased heat stress throughout the Aravalli belt in North West India,” she commented.

Groundwater recharge will also be affected, said water conservationist Rajendra Singh, famously called “The Waterman of India”. The Magsaysay award winner stressed that many districts in the Aravallis are already highly water-stressed.

“The Aravalli region acts as a critical water recharge zone,” he said. “The highly fractured and weathered rocks with their natural cracks allow water to percolate and recharge the groundwater. Calculations reveal an immense potential of 2 million litres of ground water recharge per hectare of the Aravalli landscape. Aquifers lying beneath the Aravallis are interconnected and any disturbance or alterations in the pattern due to breaking of hills due to mining can significantly alter the groundwater table and its purity.”

'Scrap definition, recall judgment'

The letter put together by the People For Aravallis and Save Sariska which is to be sent to 30 officials and government authorities including the Supreme Court demands that the government scrap the new, uniform definition of the Aravallis.

It also demands that the Supreme Court order dated November 20 that accepts this new definition of the Aravallis be recalled, “as the decision risks irreversible damage to North West India’s only barrier against desertification, critical water recharge zones, pollution sinks, wildlife habitats and public health”.

It urges the government to declare the Aravallis across Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi as a ‘Critical Ecological Zone’ because of the suite of crucial ecosystem services that the range provides for millions of people living in northwest India.

Another demand is that all mining and stone crushing activities near human habitation, agricultural fields, water bodies, wildlife sensitive zones in the Aravallis be stopped, and alternative building materials be developed so that mining is no longer a threat for the hill range.",https://m.thewire.in/sortd-service/imaginary/v22-01/jpg/large/high?url=dGhld2lyZS1pbi1wcm9kLXNvcnRkL21lZGlhZjcwNTlmZjAtZDMyZi0xMWYwLWE1ZjMtZTU1ZmUzOTdjMGFmLmpwZw==,N,,2025-12-07 11:03:15.114373

Reporting supported with a grant from The Water Desk at the University of Colorado Boulder.

NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico—Silvia Fernández Gallardo Boone leaned over a stream of water rushing through a concrete chute at the city’s wastewater treatment plant.

“Smell it!” she said, beaming.

Odorless, treated wastewater flowed into the Coyote Arroyo, or creek, then the Rio Grande. Mere months earlier, more than 12 million gallons of raw sewage were leaking every day into the river and groundwater in Nuevo Laredo. After repairs to the treatment plant, to Fernández Gallardo’s delight, the flow of untreated wastewater has been significantly reduced.

“Being on the border, we really live our lives on both sides of the river,” Fernández Gallardo said, looking out at the treatment plant. “We all have a stake in taking care of the river.”

When Carmen Lilia Canturosas was elected mayor of Nuevo Laredo in 2021, deferred maintenance had debilitated the plant. To make matters worse, broken sewer lines were leaking wastewater onto city streets. Canturosas, re-elected in 2024, threw her support behind overhauling Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater and sewer system.

Fernández Gallardo, an architect by training, was appointed general manager of the Potable Water and Sanitation Commission (Comisión de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado), known by its Spanish acronym COMAPA. In 2023, COMAPA broke ground on an $80 million project, backed by U.S. and Mexican institutions, to repair the failing wastewater treatment plant and damaged sewer lines. The North American Development Bank (NADBank) issued the largest grant for wastewater improvements in its 30-year history.

Shared waterways like the Rio Grande have been sites of cooperation between the two countries, but also points of contention. Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater overhaul is the latest bet that the U.S. and Mexico can work together to improve water quality and the environment.

But the project is reaching fruition as tensions mount between the U.S. and Mexico under the second Trump presidency. Mexico once again has fallen short on its treaty commitment to share Rio Grande water with the United States. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariff demands have cast a shadow over trade hubs like Laredo-Nuevo Laredo.

Far from the policy disputes of Washington, D.C., officials like Fernández Gallardo are still counting on binational collaboration to yield tangible benefits for local residents.

“Rehabilitating the Rio Bravo doesn’t just mean improving local environmental conditions,” she wrote in a statement to Inside Climate News, using the Mexican name for the river. “It also represents an opportunity to move toward shared water security between Mexico and the United States.”

Monitoring Water Quality

The day before Fernández Gallardo toured the plant, Martin Castro and Tom Vaughan were on the other side of the border, knee deep in the Rio Grande. Four Border Patrol officers peered out from an outcropping above the river and asked what they were doing.

Castro, watershed science director at the Rio Grande International Study Center, and Vaughan, a center co-founder and emeritus biology professor at Texas A&M International University in Laredo, calmly explained that they were taking water quality samples. A few minutes later, the officers left.

The pair were collecting samples to contribute to an extensive database on the river’s water quality, as they do every month.

On that late October day, Border Patrol and National Guard troops far outnumbered fishermen and other recreational visitors to the Rio Grande. It’s not only the law enforcement presence that makes environmental protection on the Rio Grande unique.

As an international river, the Rio Grande was initially excluded from the Texas Clean Rivers Program. The collaborative effort monitors and protects the state’s water resources. Vaughan was among those who advocated in the 1990s for the Rio Grande to be included.

The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), a federal agency that enforces the border and water agreements, eventually took over water quality monitoring on the river. IBWC data from the Rio Grande now feeds into the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s Clean Rivers Program.

For more than 1,200 miles, the Rio Grande snakes between Texas and Mexico, crossing remote deserts and urban areas before reaching its delta at the Gulf of Mexico. IBWC partners with organizations like the Rio Grande study center to collect water samples at 119 stations. Monitoring at eight stations in El Paso was suspended in 2023 because of border security installations. IBWC spokesperson Frank Fisher said sampling has been re-established at all but three sites.

Castro and Vaughan collected samples to send to a certified laboratory. They record other measurements themselves, such as turbidity using a Secchi disk.

“Upriver, I would swim in it,” Vaughan said, referring to the Rio Grande upstream of the bend in the river that wraps around Laredo. “If I was really thirsty, I might drink it.”

But he explained that sewage downstream of the city makes the water unsafe for swimming or other contact recreation. This part of the Rio Grande below the Amistad Reservoir, known as segment 2304, exceeds Texas standards for bacteria.

In this stretch of the river, the highest readings for E. coli, the indicator for bacteria, are downstream of Laredo and the wastewater discharges from Nuevo Laredo, according to IBWC’s 2024 Rio Grande summary report. At the Pipeline Crossing and El Cenizo sites, E. coli readings were 240,000 parts per 100 milliliters. That is nearly 2,000 times the state’s water quality standard of 126 parts.

The IBWC report warns of “serious health risks” and that the water is unsuitable for recreational activities or consumption. The report attributes the high bacteria levels to wastewater infrastructure allowing sewage to enter the river.

IBWC’s Fisher said bacteria levels are elevated in other parts of the river including in the urban areas of El Paso/Ciudad Juárez, Del Rio/Ciudad Acuña, Eagle Pass/Piedras Negras, and in Hidalgo County.

“TCEQ is committed to advancing collaboration among federal, state, and binational partners to improve water quality and resilience in the border region,” said Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesperson Victoria Cann.

Cann referenced the Lower Rio Grande Water Quality Initiative as one example of the agency’s efforts to improve water management. The initiative aims to “restore, protect and improve” water quality on the Lower Rio Grande downstream of Falcon Reservoir. The group recently completed an 18-month binational salinity study, according to Cann.

Cleaning Up the Rio Grande

It’s one thing to collect data on the river’s water quality. It’s another to act on that data. For decades, the U.S. and Mexico have debated how to improve the environment and sanitation along their nearly 2,000-mile border.

The 1944 water treaty between the two countries entrusted border sanitation issues to the IBWC. As new problems cropped up—like sewage flowing downhill from Mexico into the U.S.— new agreements, known as minutes, were added to the treaty. In 1989, the U.S. and Mexico partnered to build a wastewater treatment plant in Nuevo Laredo.

After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was adopted in 1994, Nuevo Laredo and other border cities grew rapidly. Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater treatment plant opened in 1996. Binational wastewater treatment plants were also built in Tijuana, Baja California and Nogales, Arizona.

In a side agreement to NAFTA, the two countries created the NADBank, a binational development bank to fund infrastructure on the border.

Nuevo Laredo’s population has almost doubled since 1994, to nearly half a million people. Laredo, with about 260,000 people, is now the busiest land port for international trade in the United States.

But ongoing maintenance of wastewater infrastructure became a sticking point. By the time NAFTA was renegotiated in 2020—and renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement—border wastewater treatment plants were in urgent need of repairs. Sewage flowing from Tijuana into Southern California became an international dispute.

Colorado State University emeritus political scientist Stephen Mumme, an expert on U.S.-Mexico relations, partially attributes maintenance problems to the “constant churn” in Mexican politics, in which local administrations change every three years.

Mexican cities also struggle to finance long-term infrastructure projects and collect monthly bills from ratepayers. Sanitation competes with other urgent public works in border cities buckling under rapid growth.

“The capacity to engage in the type of financing and planning that is often taken for granted in American cities is not yet fully realized in Mexican cities, even in border cities,” Mumme said.

Jesús Frausto Ortega, coordinator of the water management graduate program at Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Monterrey, Mexico, said that previous efforts to stop the flow of sewage in Nuevo Laredo were like paving over a pothole.

“You could fix one part, but there was no holistic solution,” said Frausto Ortega, who previously worked in Nuevo Laredo.

He said Mexican cities often lack political will to invest in sanitation infrastructure.

“Traditionally, officials don’t invest in projects that are underground,” he said. “[That’s because] the public doesn’t see the project and we don’t have reliable accountability mechanisms.”

COMAPA’s Fernández Gallardo said she heard this sentiment from other public officials.

“Why would you want to invest in sewer lines?” she remembers them asking. “That’s like burying money.”

Binational Investment

Fernández Gallardo and Canturosas, the mayor, persisted. They found support among U.S. officials, including then U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar and then IBWC Commissioner Maria-Elena Giner. NADBank provided an initial $650,000 grant to develop plans for the wastewater treatment plant and collapsed sewer lines.

Support started to pour in. NADBank committed $22 million from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Border Environment Infrastructure Fund. Mexican agencies, including COMAPA, committed another $53 million. The IBWC pitched in $2 million, and a commercial loan of $6 million rounded out the budget.

IBWC’s Fisher said the agency’s contribution came “as part of a long-standing practice to share the cost of extraordinary maintenance.” He said the funds were used to purchase six aerators needed for the biological process at the plant.

NADBank Managing Director John Beckham said that the significant commitments from both countries set the effort apart.

“Those are unique features of this project that are replicable,” he said. “We’re proud of it. We think it’s something that can help us in other parts of the river.”

Fernández Gallardo estimated in late October that the wastewater treatment plant’s rehabilitation was 80 percent complete. She said that sewage was still being discharged at 10 locations in the city, down from 27.

“You’re investing in a public good,” she said. “These are projects that you don’t see, but you feel the difference in the city.”

Fernández Gallardo acknowledged that COMAPA must prevent deferred maintenance from once again hobbling the plant. She said that going forward, 4 percent of funds from water bills will be designated for maintenance.

“[We have to] ensure that these plants can be maintained over time …,” Beckham said. “To avoid cycles of every 25 years where we have to lay out $80 million.”

Martin Castro of the Rio Grande International Study Center said the upgrades are a “meaningful milestone.”

“They underscore how urgently the river needs sustained infrastructure investment,” he said. “Continued investment and binational cooperation are essential to protect water quality for both communities.”

A Changing Political—and Environmental—Climate

While Nuevo Laredo is making strides, extreme drought and climate change are testing the fragile balance on the binational river. The Rio Grande provides drinking water for over 6 million people in the United States and Mexico. Farmers from Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico rely on it to irrigate their crops.

But experts warn that current water consumption levels cannot be sustained. The Amistad Reservoir, upstream of Laredo, hit historic lows during July 2024. Climate change will further reduce the river’s flow.

A November 2025 study led by the World Wildlife Fund found that 52 percent of water consumption in the Rio Grande Basin is unsustainable, causing depletion of reservoirs, aquifers and river flows. American Rivers named the Lower Rio Grande the fifth most endangered river in the United States this year.

The Rio Grande is the only source of water for Nuevo Laredo and Laredo. But sometimes the river drops so low that the pumps at the water treatment plant struggle to draw in water, Fernández Gallardo said. She touted COMAPA’s purple pipe program, which diverts treated wastewater for outdoor irrigation and industrial use, but said more must be done to conserve and re-use water.

“Without the river, we don’t have the two Laredos,” she said.

Fernández Gallardo said she would like Nuevo Laredo to directly re-use treated wastewater for domestic supply, known as direct potable reuse.

“Treated wastewater is the only water resource whose supply will always go up as the population increases,” she wrote in a statement. “[Direct reuse] would redefine the future of water on the border.”

Another Rio Grande city, El Paso, is rolling out this technology. But Fernández Gallardo knows the municipal administration’s time to execute projects is running out.

Escalating tensions between the United States and Mexico are felt locally. While Mexico increased Rio Grande water deliveries to the United States in the past year, the Trump administration has threatened Mexico with additional tariffs and even sanctions if the nation does not deliver more to Texas. Meanwhile, Mexican officials have attributed the shortfall to the ongoing drought.

The Trump administration quickly replaced several of the U.S. officials essential to the Nuevo Laredo project, including Salazar, the ambassador, and Giner, the well-liked IBWC commissioner.

The Trump administration is also moving forward with plans for a border wall through Laredo, which local organizations, including the Rio Grande International Study Center, oppose.

Water quality woes on the Rio Grande have attracted little national attention. But EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has pressured Mexico to stop the sewage flows from Tijuana. The EPA has struck agreements with Mexico to accelerate the timeline to repair the Tijuana treatment plant.

A State Department spokesperson said that the U.S. and Mexico have “launched a new era of cooperation characterized by swift and decisive actions.”

“No other bilateral relationship has a greater effect on the daily lives of the American people and President Trump and his cabinet are committed to improving the welfare, health, and prosperity of our border communities,” the spokesperson said.

The EPA also funds NADBank’s grants for wastewater infrastructure on the border. Congress has not passed a full federal budget for 2026. Nonetheless, the spending bills for environment and natural resource agencies that passed through committee maintained support for the EPA’s border wastewater programs. The Senate bill would appropriate $36 million and the House bill $45 million for border wastewater projects, comparable to recent years.

CSU’s Mumme said that the Trump administration’s increasing hostility toward Mexico could backfire.

“Trump is used to bullying his way. But that only goes so far,” he said. “Mexico does have leverage.”

Mumme said the history of cooperation shows that the U.S. and Mexico can achieve common goals, on issues from wastewater to water scarcity.

“There’s no substitute to cooperating and finding mutually beneficial solutions,” he said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rio-Grande-3w.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 06:00:05.798831

The Ground Under It Is Already Shifting.,"Rambo Talabong, Anika Jane Beamer",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07122025/new-jersey-energy-grid-plan/,"“The Energy Master Plan is a statutorily required report to chart out New Jersey’s energy future,” said Eric Miller, who leads the Governor’s Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy.
Under the plan, New Jersey is betting heavily on utility-scale solar and battery storage.
Offshore wind “was a big piece of trying to get to 100 percent clean electricity by 2035,” Felder said.
A Guide, Not a Mandate For all its detail, the Energy Master Plan is not binding.
Potosnak’s group is backing a lame-duck bill that would incorporate the state’s 2035 goal of 100 percent clean energy—currently in place from a 2023 Murphy executive order—into state law.","In the waning days of Governor Phil Murphy’s tenure, state officials unveiled an updated Energy Master Plan that calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 and steep reductions in climate pollution by midcentury. Since 2019, the state has used the first version of the plan as the backbone of its climate strategy, promising reliable, affordable and clean power.

The blueprint lands at a moment when delivering on all three goals is increasingly in doubt.

While a second Trump administration rolls back federal clean-energy support, PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator that serves New Jersey and a dozen other states, struggles to manage surging electricity demand from artificial-intelligence data centers.

“The Energy Master Plan is a statutorily required report to chart out New Jersey’s energy future,” said Eric Miller, who leads the Governor’s Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy. While not binding, it is the state’s official roadmap to attain its climate goals.

Miller’s office and the state Board of Public Utilities developed the plan with public input and help from outside consultants.

Under the plan, New Jersey is betting heavily on utility-scale solar and battery storage. State modeling envisions total solar capacity climbing to about 22 gigawatts by 2050 which is four times today’s roughly 5 gigawatts of installed solar. On paper, it would be enough to supply nearly all of the state’s current households over a year. To get there, the plan assumes adding about 750 megawatts of new solar each year from 2026, roughly double the pace of solar construction in 2024.

The plan’s release follows a governor’s race in which energy costs dominated, and voters chose U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat who campaigned on preserving Murphy-era climate targets, over Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican who argued for a slower transition.

“Voters sent a clear message that clean energy is the most cost-effective path forward and the smartest long-term investment,” said Ed Potosnak, head of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters and a local council member in Franklin Township.

A Grid Tested By Data Centers

The plan lands as New Jersey enters what Miller calls the “load growth era.”

For roughly two decades, electricity demand in PJM’s footprint, which stretches from New Jersey to Illinois, was flat or falling as aging power plants retired and efficiency improved. That trend has flipped because of data centers.

“What we saw in 2024 into ’25, and I think what we’re going to see for the next 15 years, is a scenario where demand on the electric grid is growing,” Miller said.

For years, New Jersey spent billions subsidizing hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles and thousands of buildings to electrify. Now, Miller said, “some of the techniques for greenhouse gas reductions are going to have to kind of meet the moment,” by taking a more proactive role in engaging with PJM, or by filling in the dearth in clean energy incentives caused by the Trump administration.

The recent PJM capacity auctions have added billions of dollars in costs for customers across the region. This showed up as a 20 percent jump in summer electricity bills in New Jersey this year, which became a hot campaign issue during its recent gubernatorial race.

“The wholesale price of electricity is determined by PJM and federal policy, and then also the price of natural gas,” said Frank Felder, an energy economist who has advised regulators. “New Jersey can’t do much about that.”

Participating in a fast-track rulemaking process that PJM initiated to address data center-driven demand, outgoing governor Murphy joined other governors in proposing that data center developers bring their own power generators in exchange for quicker permit processing.

PJM seeks to decide which proposals to pursue this month and file them with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by the end of the year.

Federal Headwinds and Stalled Offshore Wind

Layered on top of PJM’s turmoil are decisions coming from Washington.

Experts repeatedly pointed to President Trump’s second-term moves to strip away clean-energy tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act and to impose new tariffs on imported solar panels and wind equipment. They say those steps have raised costs and driven off developers.

Potosnak called it “Trump’s clean energy ban” and said the administration’s opposition to offshore wind “derailed the best chance we had to get massive amounts of offshore wind going that would have begun lowering our utility rates this year.” Several major Atlantic projects, including those planned off New Jersey’s coast, have been canceled or delayed.

Offshore wind “was a big piece of trying to get to 100 percent clean electricity by 2035,” Felder said. With new contracts unlikely for several years, he warned New Jersey could be “back at basically square one” by the end of the decade.

Even so, Felder and others urged caution against writing off renewables entirely. Robert Mieth, a Rutgers University researcher who studies power systems, noted that offshore wind is well established in Europe and that, with or without U.S. manufacturing, “there will be access to competitive and affordable renewable technology from other countries.”

In the meantime, state officials point to progress in areas they can influence more directly.

Miller noted that New Jersey has gone from roughly 20,000 plug-in vehicles in 2018 to about 270,000 today, after lawmakers set clear targets and funded incentives and chargers.

The state’s “nation-leading solar program,” he said, is “primarily state-incentivized, primarily state-funded,” and can keep expanding—albeit slower now—even as federal tax credits expire.

“The cheapest energy is the energy you don’t have to make,” Potosnak said, citing efficiency programs, rooftop and warehouse solar and batteries on parking lots that “drive down utility costs for families and businesses” while cutting pollution.

A Guide, Not a Mandate

For all its detail, the Energy Master Plan is not binding.

“The Energy Master Plan does not have the force of law,” Miller said. It has been “very informative,” he added, but “it is not a legal requirement that we follow it exactly.”

Gov.-elect Sherrill will determine how closely New Jersey hews to the map. Neither she nor her opponent had any role in shaping the modeling, Miller said, and the plan was not written with a particular “political future” in mind. Instead, Miller said, the Murphy administration hopes the incoming governor will treat it as “a very useful modeling exercise” or a guide.

Advocates are already trying to lock some of those targets into a statute. Potosnak’s group is backing a lame-duck bill that would incorporate the state’s 2035 goal of 100 percent clean energy—currently in place from a 2023 Murphy executive order—into state law.

If it passes, he said, it would give residents and environmental groups the right to sue if future administrations fall short and send a signal to investors that New Jersey’s direction will not change with every election.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2150017008.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 06:00:23.504659

For future EV buyers, the rollback removes one of the biggest forces pushing automakers to build affordable electric models.
Here in Connecticut, where we import every gallon of fuel we burn, a slowdown in EV adoption is more than an environmental setback.
You may find new gas-powered cars will be cheaper, but the cost of driving them will go up in (exhaust) smoke.","Don’t look now, but the Trump White House is changing the cost of your driving commute.

Maybe you missed this news, perhaps disturbed (yet unsurprised) by our President’s daily tirades… attacking Somalis as “garbage” one day, pardoning a convicted drug smuggler the next or his continued threats of invading Venezuela. How easily we miss the closer-to-home news by getting distracted by these “bright, shiny objects.”

We all know that Connecticut drivers must cope with some of the highest gas prices, longest commutes, and oldest highways in the Northeast. Now Washington has decided to dramatically weaken fuel-economy standards for new cars, cutting the 2031 target from roughly 50 mpg to about 34. This threatens to make things worse for everyone, especially current and future electric-vehicle owners.

On the surface, the rollback is pitched by the White House as a win for “affordable cars,” claiming that these relaxed miles-per-gallon rules will shave maybe $900 off the cost of a new gas-powered SUV. But for Connecticut commuters who routinely log 12,000–15,000 miles a year, those savings will evaporate quickly: cars that burn more fuel cost more to operate, and in a pricey state like ours, the pump always gets paid.

But the bigger, less obvious impact of the mileage rules will be on electric-vehicle drivers– the very people who bought into the promise of lower operating costs, cleaner air, and a modernized transportation system.

According to the Connecticut Division of Motor Vehicles, there are 2.7 million cars and trucks in our small state. But only about 60,000 of them are EVs.

For those current EV owners, the MPG rollback creates more uncertainty… beyond just finding a charging station. EV resale values depend on strong future demand. So when Washington signals that gasoline-powered cars will stay dominant longer, that EV market may sputter. Fewer people will shop for EVs, fewer choose them, and used EV prices will likely soften.

Federal tax incentives (up to $7,500) for new EV buyers already expired this fall but some Connecticut rebates continue… for now.

Then there’s the EV charging network — or, more accurately, the charging network we were promised. Federal programs launched with great fanfare in 2021 pledged 500,000 publicly available chargers nationwide. But fewer than 400 federally funded chargers have actually been built under the $7.5 billion program.

In Connecticut, fast-charging deserts for thirsty EVs persist across Litchfield County, the Quiet Corner, and shoreline towns east of New Haven. Even Fairfield County’s charging stations, while more plentiful, are frequently congested or out of service.

For future EV buyers, the rollback removes one of the biggest forces pushing automakers to build affordable electric models. Without strict fuel-economy rules, carmakers can meet federal requirements by selling profitable gas-powered SUVs rather than investing in lower-cost EVs that would appeal to everyday drivers. The result? Slower arrival of mid-priced EVs, the very models that would make ‘going electric’ a realistic choice for middle-class families in these tight times.

Remember four years ago when Elon Musk promised us a Tesla for $25,000? In fact the new entry-level models now cost about $37,000 or more.

Here in Connecticut, where we import every gallon of fuel we burn, a slowdown in EV adoption is more than an environmental setback. It’s an economic one. More money will leave the state for out-of-region fuel suppliers. And an unreliable, underbuilt charging network threatens to stall our transportation future.

The real bottom line? You may find new gas-powered cars will be cheaper, but the cost of driving them will go up in (exhaust) smoke.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tesla-charging.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 08:59:32.332482

This commitment is supported through a comprehensive set of initiatives, including the PLI Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules and measures to provide a level playing field for the Indian manufacturers. The catalytic effect of these interventions has resulted in an expansion in solar module manufacturing capacity, from just 2.3 GW in 2014 to around 122 GW enlisted in MNRE’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) today.

This expansion underscores the success of India's solar PV manufacturing story through the collective efforts of the industry, various state governments and the Government of India, while also reinforcing India’s commitment to achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and contributing meaningfully to global decarbonization efforts. MNRE remains committed to further strengthening the solar manufacturing ecosystem through continued policy support, infrastructure development, and innovation. The Ministry will continue engaging with stakeholders to ensure India’s solar journey remains inclusive, competitive, and future-ready, the official statement said.

But in rich countries that have built infrastructure, natural gas has displaced coal as the biggest source of electricity.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright spoke to the National Petroleum Council on Dec. 3 at its presentation of two studies offering solutions for increasing energy production and electricity reliability. These are excerpts from his remarks:

I always say to people — I can say without a doubt — energy is the most important industry in the world by far, because every other industry wouldn’t be remotely close to what it is today without energy. Affordable, reliable, secure energy literally makes the world go ’round, allowing us to live long, healthy, opportunity-rich lives.

So, I’ve been frustrated most of my career to see politics — and not just looking at math and numbers — seep into energy, leading to tremendous destruction to the quality of life.

We spent 25 years not growing our electricity production very much, maybe 1 percent a year. Does that sound American? One percent a year growth in energy and electricity? And it’s electricity that’s going to drive artificial intelligence. Americans are frustrated with the rise in electricity prices. They went up a lot, but they shouldn’t have.

We have an increase in electricity prices because of political decisions, policy decisions. It was a choice, not an unfortunate event or scarcity problem. Political choices drove the price of electricity up.

Wood was the biggest source of energy on the planet throughout all of human history, until about 1900. We had coal as the largest source of energy for several decades, probably through World War II. And then coal was passed by oil, and oil has been the largest source of energy in the United States — and globally — for many decades.

Today, oil and natural gas are about 72 percent of total U.S. primary energy, the highest percentage ever. And yet nobody wants to go study petroleum engineering because they’re going away, ‘they’re going out of business.’

I’m like, ‘They’re at a record high in quantity and in market share, and both are growing. So maybe they’re not going away.’

The National Petroleum Council matters. Oil and natural gas, together with coal, are what power the world.

I love coal. It’s the largest source of global electricity since we started collecting data around 1900.

But in rich countries that have built infrastructure, natural gas has displaced coal as the biggest source of electricity. So oil and natural gas — the petroleum industry — matters massively. We need it to build smart infrastructure and have smart policies and deliver these products as efficiently as you can, which impacts the economic opportunities for Americans.

We got into some ruts by not having open, honest conversations about environmental issues in oil and gas and infrastructure.

My goal, the Trump administration’s goal, is to be open, transparent and discuss all of these trade-offs. To discuss these things so we can have a more rational view.

We don’t want to deindustrialize the United States. We don’t want AI, like the other energy-intensive industries, to go overseas. We don’t want to keep exporting job opportunities for Americans. We actually want to grow opportunity and prosperity right here.

Despite the strong recent performance of the overall energy sector, the report warns of deepening skilled labour shortages.
According to the IEA’s Energy Employment Survey, the main barriers preventing people from entering energy-related training include costs, foregone wages and limited awareness of available programmes.
Reskilling within the energy sector itself is also essential.","Strong investment in energy infrastructure drove a 2.2 per cent rise in energy jobs last year, nearly double the rate of employment growth for the wider global economy, according to a new International Energy Agency (IEA) report, which highlights the dynamic trends across the sector as well as bottlenecks for skilled labour in key areas.

The World Energy Employment 2025 report released finds that global energy sector employment reached 76 million people worldwide in 2024, up more than 5 million from 2019.

The sector has contributed 2.4 per cent of all net jobs created across the global economy over the past five years.

The power sector is leading the way on job creation, accounting for three-quarters of recent employment growth, and is now the largest employer in energy, overtaking fuel supply.

Solar PV is a key driver of growth, complemented by rapid expansions in hiring in nuclear power, grids and storage.

Increasing electrification of other sectors of the economy is also reshaping employment trends, with jobs in EV manufacturing and batteries surging by nearly 800 000 in 2024.

Fossil fuel employment remained resilient in 2024.

Coal jobs rebounded in India, China and Indonesia, pushing employment in the coal industry 8 per cent above its 2019 levels despite steep declines in advanced economies.

The oil and gas industry has also regained most of the jobs lost in 2020, although low prices and economic uncertainties have triggered job cuts in 2025.

Based on early data, energy employment growth is expected to moderate to 1.3 per cent in 2025, reflecting persistently tight labour markets and heightened trade and geopolitical tensions that are making some firms more cautious about hiring.

Despite the strong recent performance of the overall energy sector, the report warns of deepening skilled labour shortages.

Out of 700 energy-related companies, unions and training institutions participating in the IEA’s Energy Employment Survey, more than half of them reported critical hiring bottlenecks that threaten to slow the building of energy infrastructure, delay projects and raise system costs.

“Energy has been one of the strongest and most consistent engines of job creation in the global economy during a period marked by significant uncertainties,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “But this momentum cannot be taken for granted. The world’s ability to build the energy infrastructure it needs depends on having enough skilled workers in place. Governments, industry and training institutions must come together to close the labour and skills gap. Left unaddressed, these shortages could slow progress, raise costs and weaken energy security.”

Applied technical roles such as electricians, pipefitters, line workers, plant operators and nuclear engineers are in especially short supply.

These occupations alone have added 2.5 million positions since 2019 and now represent over half of the entire global energy workforce, more than double their share of total employment in the broader economy.

An ageing workforce is intensifying the pressure, with 2.4 energy workers in advanced economies nearing retirement for every new entrant under 25.

Nuclear- and grid-related professions face some of the steepest demographic challenges, with retirements outnumbering new entrants by ratios of 1.7 and 1.4 to 1 respectively.

At the same time, the supply of newly qualified workers is not keeping pace with the sector’s needs. To prevent the skills gap from widening further by 2030, the number of new qualified entrants into the energy sector globally would need to rise by 40 per cent.

The report shows that this would require an additional $2.6 billion per year of investment globally, representing less than 0.1 per cent of spending on education worldwide.

Policy measures can make a major difference.

According to the IEA’s Energy Employment Survey, the main barriers preventing people from entering energy-related training include costs, foregone wages and limited awareness of available programmes.

India's renewable energy sector continues its robust expansion, with non-fossil fuel sources now accounting for half of the nation's total power generation capacity, a milestone reached five years earlier than initially projected under commitments made during the Paris Agreement.

Current figures through the end of October 2025 show approximately 259 gigawatts of installed capacity from clean energy sources, including a substantial addition of 31.2 GW during the first seven months of this fiscal year.

Recent media coverage suggested that the ministry had instructed financial institutions to suspend funding for renewable projects due to concerns about excessive production capacity.

The ministry has categorically denied these claims.

What the ministry has done, according to official statements, is provide detailed information to financial oversight bodies and major lending institutions, including Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, about current manufacturing capabilities throughout the solar photovoltaic supply chain.

This information encompasses production capacity data for solar panels, cells, silicon wafers, polysilicon materials, and supporting components such as specialised glass and aluminum framing. The goal is to encourage lenders to take a more comprehensive view when assessing funding applications for solar manufacturing plants.

The ministry is urging financial institutions to broaden their investment perspective beyond conventional solar panel assembly operations to include earlier stages of production and component manufacturing.

India's solar manufacturing sector has experienced remarkable transformation, with panel production capacity surging from a modest 2.3 GW in 2014 to approximately 122 GW currently listed under the ministry's official registry of approved manufacturers and products.

Centre in its statement reaffirmed its dedication to establishing India as a significant force in the worldwide solar manufacturing landscape while working toward the ambitious target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by the decade's end.

Ministry officials indicated they will maintain ongoing dialogue with industry participants to ensure the sector remains dynamic, inclusive, and prepared for future challenges.",https://static.businessworld.in/1589948103_kbF4A7_2020_05_20T041000Z_1_LYNXMPEG4J072_RTROPTP_4_IEA_RENEWABLES.JPG,N,,2025-12-07 02:58:27.213631

Despite this year’s abrupt U-turn in federal energy policy, US innovators are still front and center in the global decarbonization race. That includes the somewhat unglamorous but carbon-heavy field of concrete, where a research team at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts has introduced a bio-inspired concrete alternative that sequesters carbon during the production process, achieving true carbon-negative status.

Concrete Has A Carbon Problem, Bigly

The research team calculates that their new alternative building material sequesters 6.1 kilograms of carbon per cubic meter during the production process. In contrast, conventional concrete emits roughly 330 kilograms of carbon during production.

Getting to -6 from +330 is quite an achievement, considering the carbon intensity of conventional concrete. Part of the challenge involves reducing the high heat required to transform limestone into the “clinker” that forms the basis of traditional cement, which is the glue that holds gravel and other concrete aggregates together.

Another significant challenge is to replace the limestone itself. A sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate fossils, limestone releases a copious amount of carbon dioxide when heated. The US Geological Survey estimates that limestone accounts for almost 66% of the carbon emissions attributed to cement production.

“While most people realize that cars, planes, and power plants contribute to climate change, there’s another major source of greenhouse gases that’s often overlooked. It’s all around us –perhaps even right where you are as you read this. It’s concrete, and the cement used to make it,” USGS elaborated in a think piece last year (see lots more concrete background here).

The Long Road To The Superbricks Of The Future

The roster of solutions to concrete’s carbon problem has been growing into the bio-based space. In a new study published in the journal Matter, the WPI research team notes that one area of focus involves deploying microbes to precipitate calcium carbonate, with bamboo, mycelium, fungi, and bacteria-based materials also among the other alternatives. However, the researchers also note that cost, complexity, engineering issues, and the potential for negative environmental impacts are limiting factors for bio-inspired cement alternatives.

The WPI team itself encountered a significant roadblock in an earlier work, in which they described a bio-inspired process for growing minerals on a polymer scaffold. They introduced trace amounts of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzed water and carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid. The carbonic acid then interacted with calcium to produce calcite, which attached itself to the scaffold.

“The material exhibits a compressive strength of 12 MPa and a degree of self-healing capability,” the researchers reported, with MPa being shorthand for megapascal, a valuation of the compressive strength of a concrete mix. By that measure, 12 MPa is pretty good for a first effort. It comes within shouting distance of the minimum MPa for some uses, though the American Cement Association notes that high-strength concrete typically has a strength of at least 55 MPa.

The WPI team also took note of a more substantial issue, stating that the strength of their new material “decreases significantly under humid conditions,” which they describe as a “universal problem for biologically inspired construction materials that use hydrophilic polymers as scaffolds.”

“Although incorporating biomaterials reduces carbon emissions, these products are not water resistant and require a protective layer,” they emphasize.

The Hydrophobic Solution

If you caught that thing about hydrophilic, so did the WPI team. In the new work, they took a different tack. Under the title, “Durable, high-strength carbon-negative enzymatic structural materials via a capillary suspension technique,” they describe how they deployed sand to form a hydrophobic scaffold upon which calcium carbonate crystals can grow.

“We present a strong, cost-effective, carbon-negative building material, named enzymatic structural material (ESM), that integrates enzymatically formed CaCO3 crystals into a hydrochar scaffold via capillary suspension,” they explain.

“This enables versatile fabrication, rapid molding into various structures within hours, and scalability for mass production, bypassing the 28-day curing required for conventional concrete,” the researchers add. In addition to the carbon sequestration benefit, they also cite recycling and repairability as an additional plus in the sustainability column, helping to reduce construction waste and extend the lifespan of a project.

While not hitting the high-strength mark for conventional concrete, the research team achieved a respectable compressive strength of 25.8 MPa, making ESM suitable for roof decks and wall bricks among other applications.

WPI also emphasizes that ESM takes only hours to cure, compared to the four-week timetable typical of most concrete mixtures, helping to accelerate housing construction and post-disaster rebuilding efforts.

“Because ESM is produced with low energy and renewable biological inputs, it also aligns with global goals for carbon-neutral infrastructure and circular manufacturing,” ESM points out.

US Innovators Keep On Innovating

Don’t get too excited just yet. The road from the laboratory to the shelves of your local hardware store is a long one. The WPI team plans to focus their next steps on parsing out the ecological efficiency of their ESM formula, while improving its performance and laying the groundwork for scaled-up production.

In the meantime, various near-term carbon cutting solutions are emerging on the market. One example from the CleanTechnica archive is the Massachusetts startup Sublime Systems. The company’s low carbon “Sublime Cement” is beginning to catch on among construction industry stakeholders in the US, with Microsoft being one high-profile example.

When last heard from, the American Cement Association (a rebrand of the Portland Cement Association earlier this year) also continues to hold the torch for global leadership in the decarbonization movement. “The association has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to set a global standard for innovation and create a sustainable future,” ACA says of its “Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality.” Released in May of 2024, the Roadmap provides space for carbon capture and sequestration, but the overall emphasis is on next-generation solutions that deploy low-carbon feedstocks and renewable energy at the production end. ACA also counts energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy at the building design and construction end towards its 2050 carbon neutral goal.

So much for last year’s effort. This year has been a different story. In May, the US Department of Energy clawed back carbon capture grants for cement producers, among other industries, leading ACA President and CEO Mike Ireland to call the action “a missed opportunity for both America’s cement manufacturers and this administration.”

Nevertheless, the ACA moved forward with a decarbonization agenda for its third annual Sustainability Summit in August. “While 2025 has brought landmark changes in Washington that directly affect cement companies, the industry’s top goal of decarbonization remains the same,” Ireland declared in a preview of the event. The Summit also highlighted alternative kiln fuels and low-carbon cement blends along with a commitment to continue investing in carbon capture systems despite the federal funding cuts.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/carbon-negative-building-material-WPI.png,N,,2025-12-07 09:58:03.729027

The investment in GFCL EV Products Limited marks a turning point for India’s ambitions to control its own EV supply chain rather than relying on imports from China and other nations.

The World Bank Group’s private-sector arm announced the deal on Dec. 5, targeting a new plant in Jolva, near Bharuch in Gujarat. The facility will produce critical lithium-ion battery components under one roof, including electrolyte salts, cathode materials and specialized binders that go into every electric vehicle battery.

This represents IFC’s first investment in a battery materials company in India, signaling confidence that the country can compete in the high-value chemistry that makes electric vehicles possible. For a nation racing to electrify its transportation sector, the deal couldn’t come at a better time.

What makes this facility different

Unlike typical manufacturing plants that focus on one component, GFCL EV’s facility will handle multiple stages of battery production in a single location. The plant will produce lithium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte salt, custom electrolyte formulations, lithium iron phosphate cathode materials and PVDF/PTFE binders. These materials together account for more than half the cost of a lithium iron phosphate battery cell.

The parent company, Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited, already operates as one of India’s largest producers of fluoropolymers and specialty chemicals. With three manufacturing units in Gujarat and a captive fluorspar mine in Morocco, GFL brings decades of chemistry expertise to the battery materials business. The company deployed about 1,125 crore rupees (approximately $135 million) in capital expenditures during fiscal year 2024-25, with more than half dedicated to EV-related projects.

Racing to meet surging demand

India’s electric vehicle market is exploding. Industry forecasts show lithium battery demand will skyrocket from about 4 gigawatt-hours in 2023 to nearly 139 gigawatt-hours by 2035, driven primarily by compact passenger vehicles and small SUVs. The government’s Production Linked Incentive scheme for battery storage aims to create massive manufacturing capacity with an overall budget of 18,100 crore rupees (about $2.2 billion).

The challenge isn’t just building enough batteries but ensuring India isn’t simply assembling components made elsewhere. Cathode materials and electrolyte salts represent the highest import dependence, with China currently dominating global production. Industry estimates suggest cathode materials alone can account for 29% to 51% of a lithium-ion battery’s total price, depending on chemistry and metal prices.

Why IFC is betting big

The investment fits IFC’s broader strategy of backing projects that deliver climate benefits, create high-skill jobs and strengthen supply chain resilience. By supporting domestic battery materials production, IFC aims to reduce India’s dependence on imported components while enabling the country’s transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.

IFC has already invested heavily in India’s EV ecosystem, including a $20 million equity stake in Transvolt Mobility, its first global investment in an EV fleet platform. The organization has also supported two- and three-wheeler manufacturers, last-mile logistics operators and charging infrastructure providers. Moving upstream into battery materials represents the next logical step in building a complete domestic EV supply chain.

Navigating choppy waters

The investment comes during turbulent times for global battery markets. Lithium hydroxide prices have plummeted nearly 90% from their 2022 peaks, while battery pack prices fell about 20% in 2024 to a record low of $115 per kilowatt-hour. Overcapacity in global cathode and materials markets could squeeze profit margins and intensify competition from established players in China and South Korea.

Technology shifts also pose challenges. While GFCL EV focuses on lithium iron phosphate chemistry, which has become mainstream for mass-market EVs due to safety and cost advantages, automakers are exploring alternative chemistries including manganese-rich variants and even sodium-ion batteries. GFL’s expertise in fluorine-based materials across multiple battery types should provide some protection against single-chemistry risk.

A blueprint for Indian manufacturing

If successful, the GFCL EV facility could serve as a model for how traditional chemical companies can pivot into high-value energy transition materials. The project blends decades of process knowledge with emerging demand from the electric vehicle revolution. For India, owning the chemistry inside battery cells matters as much as assembling the cells themselves.

The partnership between a global development financier and an established Indian chemical manufacturer demonstrates that India’s battery story is moving beyond assembly plants toward the more strategic business of controlling critical materials. Whether this gamble pays off will depend on execution, market conditions and the country’s ability to compete with deeply entrenched Asian manufacturers who have spent years perfecting these processes.

Nuclear Energy: Korea in the U.S. SMR market On Aug. 25, shortly after President Lee Jae Myung took office, the first Korea-U.S. summit took place.
For these reasons, the United States sought support from foreign nations, and Korea was one country chosen to support the United States as their relationship improved.
As Seoul works to strengthen its longstanding alliance with Washington, Korea is encountering a new set of opportunities in the expanding U.S. nuclear energy sector.
Moreover, continued investment in nuclear energy contributes to national energy security and offers a low-carbon alternative that aligns with long-term environmental and climate goals.","The U.S. push to revive its nuclear industry is opening lucrative doors for Korean companies — and posing difficult questions for Seoul about how closely to align its economic and climate ambitions with Washington’s energy agenda.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s energy agenda to center energy supplies on projects like the nuclear power plants and the Alaska liquefied natural gas (LNG) project has created both opportunities for economic growth for Korea but also raised concerns over Korea’s dependency on U.S. priorities.

Trump’s firm determination for fossil fuels has been demonstrated time and time again, beginning from his infamous statement, “Drill, baby, drill,” during his inaugural address, and re-exemplified by the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement in January 2025.

On Oct. 29, Korea and the United States finalized the logistics for tariff agreements in essential industries, easing tensions over trade and Korea’s role in the energy supply of the United States.

After the Korea-U.S. summit, Seoul's presidential aide, Kim Yong-beom, announced that the ""reciprocal"" tariffs will be reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent, signaling a shift in the two countries’ approach to trade and investment.

The finalized tariff negotiations offered preferential treatment for imported components critical to the energy supply of the United States, such as the nuclear and oil sectors, reflecting Trump's strategic focus on traditional energy sources. This agreement is due to the fact that the United States does not have the capability to independently develop its own full energy supply. Under this framework, Korea is gaining strategic and economic benefits by having increased exports with reduced tariffs, though questions remain about whether these advantages outweigh the financial support required by the United States.

Nuclear Energy: Korea in the U.S. SMR market

On Aug. 25, shortly after President Lee Jae Myung took office, the first Korea-U.S. summit took place.

In the Korea-U.S. Business Roundtable, Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy concluded 11 memorandums of understanding in five fields including shipbuilding, nuclear plants, airlines and LNG. The nuclear power plant factor is both a positive and a negative for Korea.

Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and Doosan Enerbility cooperated with X-Energy and Amazon Web Services on future planning for small modular reactor (SMR) design, construction, operation, supply chain development, investment and market expansion. With that, KHNP was incorporated into nuclear power plant and uranium enrichment plant construction in the United States.

After the Three Mile Island accident occurred outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1979, due to a lack of a proper cooling facility, the United States paused its insistence on the supply of skilled manpower, thus collapsing the nuclear industry environment. Civic concern about radioactive waste disposal and its high cost problem followed after multiple accidents.

For these reasons, the United States sought support from foreign nations, and Korea was one country chosen to support the United States as their relationship improved.

""This phenomenon implies how urgent the United States is in its recovery of the nuclear industry,” claimed Kim Ji-young from the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute.

As Seoul works to strengthen its longstanding alliance with Washington, Korea is encountering a new set of opportunities in the expanding U.S. nuclear energy sector. Recent partnerships signal a broader opening for Korea to take part in the design, construction and supply chain development of SMRs.

The global SMR market is expected to grow substantially in the coming decades, supported by Korea’s 10th Electricity Plan, which targets six new reactors by 2033 and nuclear energy accounting for 34.6 percent of national electricity. Korea aims to increase nuclear generating capacity from 24.7 gigawatt-electrical in 2022 to 28.9 gigawatt electrical in 2030 and 31.7 gigawatt electrical in 2036, while also planning to export 10 nuclear units by 2030 and advance the development of Korean SMRs, according to the World Nuclear Association.

This expansion strengthens Korea’s economic position by enhancing its global role as a supplier of advanced nuclear components, supporting domestic industry growth, creating high-skilled jobs and promoting expertise in reactor construction, operation and supply chain development. Moreover, continued investment in nuclear energy contributes to national energy security and offers a low-carbon alternative that aligns with long-term environmental and climate goals.

But the benefits come with notable challenges.

Korea’s increased involvement in U.S. strategic-sector initiatives stems from a $350 billion investment package linked to the Korea-U.S. trade deal, which allocates $200 billion for U.S.-selected strategic industries, including advanced energy and nuclear technology, and $150 billion for shipbuilding cooperation, according to Reuters.

A Korean report noted, “Mid‑ to long‑term, critics warn that Korea’s nuclear ecosystem could be structurally subordinated to Westinghouse […] even for SMRs, Korea may have to submit to a U.S. firm’s technology verification.”

Some experts point out that while cooperation strengthens diplomatic ties, it may temporarily slow Korea’s ability to diversify its domestic energy innovation efforts.

Pressuring investment: In the pipeline of Trump’s ‘Alaska LNG’ project

Trump’s ambitious construction of an 800-mile-long pipeline in Alaska that encompasses regions from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet — a project known as Alaska LNG — is the ultimate fruit of his plans for the advancement of U.S. power in the energy industry.

Mike Dunleavy, the Republican governor of Alaska, describes the project as a “step in the right direction for Alaska and American energy dominance,” supporting Trump’s cancellation of the 2024 Rule on Alaska Petroleum Reserve on Nov. 23.

But who will enable his vision for U.S. oil industry expansion?

Trump is turning to Asian countries for the answer, with Korea as one of the prime sources for concentrated investment.

“We have the greatest amount of energy in the world and we're dealing with South Korea, as you know, in Alaska,” Trump declared at the Korea-U.S. summit on Aug. 25. “We're going to be making a deal, a joint venture with South Korea. Japan is also very strongly involved.""

Despite Trump’s confidence in Korea’s inclination to collaborate, no realistically operational discussion took place during the summit, according to chief presidential secretary Kim.

On this topic, Shin Hyun-don, a professor of the energy resources department at Inha University, concludes in hindsight that the contract between the United States and the Korea Gas Corp. (Kogas) signed in August was an effective means of circumventing seemingly compulsory Alaska investment, which can be highly risky considering its technical and economic uncertainty.

The long-term purchase contract requires Kogas to buy 3.3 million tons of U.S. LNG per year across a decade.

“The current government deserves a passing score as [the contract] created a valid justification to not participate in the Alaska LNG project,” Shin remarked.

Further regarding this settlement, optimists view this agreement in a commercially beneficial light in that while crude oil from the Middle East entails a 3 percent tariff, the agreement with the United States would be under the two nations' FTA, indicating duty-free shipments despite the relatively long distance.

“Crude oil from the United States is more economical depending on the circumstances,” an official said.

Yet, domestic industries are expressing concerns about the inevitability of a widespread reconstruction of oil facilities for the accommodation of U.S. crude oil in national factories, which would require a prodigious amount of funds — $2 billion to $3 billion worth of structure reformation to be exact, the Korea National Oil Corporation revealed.

This would be especially unfavorable considering Korea’s current economic state. The Lee government’s midterm financial plan is predicted to add up to more than 109 trillion won ($74 billion) in new debt each year, according to Park Sung-hoon, the chief spokesperson of the People Power Party.

The aftermath for the energy industry

“Both leaders welcome Korean investments in various sectors to advance economic and national security interests, including but not limited to shipbuilding, energy, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, and artificial intelligence/quantum computing,” said the White House after the Korea-U.S. summit, held prior to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang, on Oct. 29, alluding for more potential interactions between the two countries in multiple sectors of the manufacturing industry.

Trump’s endeavor to develop the energy industry in the United States became apparent on May 23 after signing four executive orders to recalibrate the U.S. nuclear industry and discussing rapid cooperation on Alaska LNG supplying East Asian countries.

The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute claimed in July that the Trump administration's actions, such as signing executive orders on nuclear energy, are “desperate acts on rejuvenating the U.S. nuclear energy industry.”

U.S. Secretary of Energy Christopher Allen Wright also said on Sept. 25 that the construction of LNG pipelines in Alaska will be “started within the next 12 months.”

Such a rapid execution to renovate and empower an industry was reflected in affairs with Korea.

In the first summit, private companies such as Trifigura and Total Energies were contracted for future exports of LNG to Korea, and companies like Centrus and Fermi America decided to cooperate on establishing a nuclear facility complex in Texas.

There was also an agreement between two defense-wise allied nations to approve the construction of nuclear-powered submarines operated by Korea.

Further collaborations in developing nonrenewable energy sources and applications brought a warning from the Embassy of China in Korea to “ exercise caution when proceeding [with introducing nuclear submarines].”

As the summit came to a conclusion and overall investment logistics were finalized, a variety of comments came from the Korean political sphere.

Democratic Party leader Jung Chung-rae said the overall investment was “the greatest negotiation and greatest achievement that will forever shine in the history of Korean diplomacy.”

The People Power Party claimed that the execution of the conference was only made “how the Americans wanted,” expressing criticism toward the terms.

The commerce industry expressed relief at the decision to disperse investment sectors, with the Peterson Institute for International Economics rating it as a “wise decision in minimizing foreign market instability” and the New York Times reviewing it as “overall less burdensome.”

The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions criticized the Korea-U.S. summit for the decision to accept investments to facilitate energy, goods and technology and exports to the United States, saying, “The burden will ultimately fall on workers and the public.”

With the final terms made for large-scale investments, it comes down to either a revival or rehabilitation of Korea-U.S. economic affairs and projects deemed prosperous for energy production under the Trump administration. With “Lee's strategy of flattery” clearly working, the BBC said, now Korea must wait to see whether or not the trick brings a beneficial impact.

The event, focused on sustainable transformation across Central and Eastern Europe, brought together stakeholders from business, government, academia, and civil society.

One of the central messages of the event was clear: Bulgaria needs a comprehensive, forward-looking national energy strategy that balances environmental targets with energy security, social impact, and industrial competitiveness.

“Time is of the essence,” said energy entrepreneur Hristo Kovachki, who participated in the roundtable discussion titled “Bulgaria’s New Energy Strategy.” “Drafting a clear strategy must not be delayed – but we need to approach it wisely, without dismantling our existing infrastructure prematurely.”

The Role of Coal and Alternative Fuels

With the EU pushing for deep decarbonization across its member states, many countries are facing tough decisions about the future of coal. Bulgaria, where coal continues to play a role in the energy mix, is under pressure to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy sources.

However, Kovachki pushed back against the idea of sudden coal plant closures, arguing that transitional fuels and new technologies must be integrated into the process. He pointed to biowaste and natural gas as viable alternatives.

“Bulgaria generates over 10 million tons of biowaste annually,” Kovachki noted. “This is a resource we can use sustainably, especially in power plants that are currently coal-dependent.”

He also described natural gas as the fuel of the transition, highlighting its flexibility and lower emissions compared to coal. According to Kovachki, such alternatives offer a more stable and realistic path toward reducing emissions without causing energy insecurity or economic disruption.

Institutional Support and Strategic Planning

A recurring theme in Kovachki’s comments was the need for state support, especially for private energy companies navigating the complexities of the energy transition. He emphasized that private operators cannot carry the burden of transition alone and called for government involvement in coordinating investments and regulatory reforms.

“The state should be more involved in ensuring a successful transition for its coal power plants, who still produce the majority of the country’s baseload power after NPP Kozloduy,” he said.

This point resonated with others at the forum, including Alexander Zagorov, secretary of the Podkrepa Labour Confederation, who warned that political pressure and unclear messaging around the future of coal were hindering constructive dialogue between businesses and trade unions.

“The attacks on the coal industry are making meaningful engagement very difficult,” Zagorov said. “With the right strategy, we can avoid conflict and work together.”

EU Ambitions and Local Realities

Panelists agreed that while the EU’s decarbonization targets are important, translating them into local policy will require careful adaptation to Bulgaria’s specific economic and social context. Professor Hristo Vasilev, an energy expert, summarized the panel’s sentiment by urging cross-sectoral cooperation.

“Capable people from various sectors must come together to lead Bulgaria’s energy sector toward decarbonization, while minimizing the social impact,” he said.

The forum also highlighted Bulgaria’s critical energy infrastructure and potential for innovation. Kovachki’s previously stated views on extracting rare earth elements from coal and mining byproducts – an idea supported by several international experts – fit within the EU’s broader push for strategic resource independence and circular economy practices.

Next Steps: From Dialogue to Policy

The event concluded with a shared sense that Bulgaria must move from discussion to action. Representatives from Bulgartransgaz, the Electricity System Operator, and other institutions echoed the need for a unified national plan that can attract investment, maintain energy reliability, and guide decarbonization efforts.

As the country continues to modernize its energy sector under the European Green Deal framework, the formulation of a balanced, data-driven, and inclusive national energy strategy remains a top priority.

The success of Bulgaria’s green transition, participants agreed, will depend not only on technology or funding – but on cooperation across political, business, and social lines.",https://www.eyeonannapolis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-11-e1764958076224.jpeg,N,,2025-12-07 05:59:48.429167

A litany of energy companies around the world has, in recent months, expressed new ambitions to expand production across the entire midstream sector, marking a new era of possibilities as the new year approaches. One such company that has ambitious projects ready for the new year is Targa Resources. The firm recently announced the plan to construct what will become its flagship “Speedway” pipeline, connecting its Permian Basin operations to a facility in Mont Belvieu.

Targa to expand its Permian pipeline, as well as new gas and NGL facilities

Targa Resources, one of the largest energy operators in the United States, recently announced an astonishing plan to build a new 500-mile ‘Speedway’ pipeline that will connect the company’s substantial operations in the Permian Basin to a gas and NGL processing facility in Mont Belvieu. The company has also expressed its intention to build a new gas processing plant that will continue to serve its US customer base.

The Permian Basin has become the backbone of the American gas and oil sector, attracting some of the largest and most profitable energy companies in the world, while keeping a close eye on any new potential customers aiming to cash in on the boom of natural energy resources production in the United States. This new expansion development plan comes amid calls by the international energy community to diversify domestic and regional energy production.

The US energy boom has been led by a new directive set in motion by Donald Trump

The US energy market has seen substantial increases in natural energy resources such as gas and oil, led by the ever-enigmatic Donald Trump. Trump announced on his first day in office for his second term that he would institute new measures to revive the oil and gas sector in the US, following a wave of renewable energy permitting under the previous administration.

Targa’s new ‘Speedway’ pipeline will become the belle of the US energy ball

Targa recently announced its plan to construct a ‘Speedway’ Pipeline that will span approximately 500 miles from its Permian basin operations all the way down to its processing facility in Texas. The new 1 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids pipeline will transport NGLs from Targa’s existing assets in the Permian and any potential future plant additions to its fractionation and storage complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas.

The new 30-inch diameter pipeline and associated infrastructure will build on the company’s already impressive energy operations in the United States. With construction underway, Targa has stated it expects the Speedway pipeline to be fully operational by 2027 at an estimated cost of roughly $1.6 billion. To accommodate an expected growth of operations in the near future, Targa will also move forward with the construction of its Yeti plant.

The Yeti plant will be a 275 million cubic feet per day gas processing facility, marking the continued growth of the Permian operations and the US energy market overall. The Permian has seen several exceedingly large energy companies outline pipeline expansion plans in recent months.

The US energy market is set to welcome the new year in style and abundance

The opulence of the American revival of its energy sector has been a sight to behold. As new and pioneering projects are being planned, the US energy sector has not looked this promising for a very long time indeed. Take, for example, the plan recently unveiled by Transwestern Pipeline to open a bidding season for Energy Transfer’s Desert Southwest expansion. If the current expansion of the American energy market continues, the world will have no choice but to turn to the US to meet any increases in energy demand.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Depositphotos_1845607_XL-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 00:57:39.784244

V Environmental Protection Agency: Implications for Public Health Policy and Practice.” Public Health Reports, vol.","Since assuming office, the Trump Administration has made it blatantly clear that expediting the extraction and deployment of fossil fuels through legal measures is one of their priorities. On his Inauguration Day, Trump delivered EO 14154 Unleashing American Energy to redirect domestic energy development exclusively towards the oil and gas industry. Since then, he has pursued a hostile reversal of policies outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act. In May of 2025, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed complaints against the states of New York and Vermont over their climate superfund laws and preemptively sued Michigan and Hawaii to prevent them from taking legal measures against oil companies. [1, 2] These states have cited tort laws, which allow parties to remedy their injuries through lawsuits, to recover damages associated with climate change. Tort-based claims are similarly found in three dozen other pending lawsuits in which state and local governments have sued major fossil fuel companies for inflicting harm upon people or property. [3] The DOJ, however, alleges that the Clean Air Act, a federal law that regulates air emissions, preempts state efforts to address and mitigate climate change. Citing Trump’s EO Protecting American Energy from State Overreach, the DOJ also argued that state-led energy regulation impinges on the executive branch’s foreign affairs powers. Other legal groups have sought long-term avenues to suppress climate cases. In a letter to the DOJ in June of 2025, 16 Republican state attorneys general requested that the administration enact protections for the fossil fuel industry modeled after a 2005 law that protects gun manufacturers from litigation when their guns are utilized for criminal purposes. [4]

If Big Oil is granted a legal shield, the courthouse doors would shut for Americans seeking accountability for the role corporations played in contributing to extreme weather damage. Such an action would establish a precedent of prioritizing corporate interests over community well-being and would shift the fiscal consequences of climate change onto taxpayers. Additionally, fossil fuel immunity claims should be considered illegitimate attempts to constitutionalize an economic interest and violate states’ regulatory power to impose environmental standards. Previous environmental cases have substantiated the lack of federal prerogative and accountability in climate action, and precedent has determined states’ constitutional power to enshrine environmental rights.

States that have filed lawsuits against energy and fossil fuel companies usually follow a consistent pattern of citing violations of state tort law, signifying their proper venue in state and local courts, and undermining the soundness of federal measures that intervene in fossil fuel regulation. In County of San Mateo v. Chevron Corp., the Ninth Circuit affirmed a district order remanding to state court claims brought by California local governments against fossil fuel companies, finding that “the companies did not establish prerequisites for the Grable exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule for cases that raise a substantial federal issue.” [5] The Ninth Circuit held that such cases were not subject to federal jurisdiction because they did not raise concerns relevant to federal law. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit held that “the Clean Air Act did not completely preempt the plaintiffs’ state-law claims” and that the plaintiffs’ injuries were considered “too attenuated and remote” to be governed by federal law applicable to federal enclaves. [6] The plaintiffs' complaints remained a state law complaint on the grounds that the Clean Air Act (CAA) fails to address all claims related to air pollution.

The decision on the Clean Air Act’s preemption power is particularly notable, as current lawsuits pursued by the DOJ call upon the CAA to prove state climate action inessential. Additionally, the court panel rejected the energy companies’ argument that the plaintiffs’ claims should be heard in federal court under 28 U.S. Code § 1331, also known as the federal question jurisdiction, simply because the alleged harm happened on federal land under exclusive federal control. The general federal question jurisdictional statute grants federal district courts original subject matter jurisdiction over ""all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.” [7] In this instance, the federal government’s tangential stake in the case — having dominion over the land in which the violations occurred — proved insufficient in employing this statute. Such a determination demonstrates that fossil fuel infrastructure operated on federal land is not exempt from civil liability, and even more so, that the harms these facilities produce can still be cited under state law.

Corporations, like Chevron, host a portion of their oil extraction operations on federal land, and thus, it is notable that while operating in these areas, no immunity is being granted. Ultimately, the empirical favorability of state court climate litigation undermines the plausibility of federal directives on fossil fuel immunity. However, with the overruling of Chevron in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, redirecting the interpretation of federal statute from agencies to the court, the judicial system has assumed novel importance within the climate fight. Power has been further invested in the courts to issue sound rulings on environmental policy, subverting the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the federal government’s reliance on it to supplement state regulation. [8]

In cases where the EPA does have ruling authority, modern environmental jurisprudence increasingly recognizes the right of states and their sovereignty to hold federal agencies accountable for regulatory neglect in the face of environmental degradation. Although Massachusetts v. EPA is largely recognized for declaring greenhouse gases pollutants, the landmark ruling also reinforced states' legal standing to sue federal agencies over subpar environmental regulations. In this case, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that Massachusetts, due to its ""stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests"" as a state, had standing to sue the EPA over potential damage caused to its territory by global warming, along with the legal right to seek redress for agency inaction. [9] Massachusetts specifically cited injuries to its land and health, which paved the way for administrative recognition of environmental harms. The majority decision concluded that Massachusetts had a legal right to seek relief given that the Commonwealth met all three conditions: (1) a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent, (2) the injury that is traceable to the act of the defendant (the EPA in this case), and (3) evidence that favorable action by the EPA would help repair the injury. [10]

In the wake of lawsuits against Big Oil, the question of whether judicial decisions can adequately ameliorate climate injuries has been contested. In May 2025, Our Children’s Trust, a nonprofit public interest law firm, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging their executive orders that accelerate the deployment of fossil fuels in Lighthiser v. Trump. In October, a federal district court in Montana dismissed the case. According to the court, the plaintiffs were incapable of surmounting the ‘final, dispositive hurdle’ that the relief would be outside the court’s power to grant. The court acknowledged that the plaintiffs had proven sufficient injury, but argued that the issue of alleviating climate change was too broad and failed to meet the requirements of redressability. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the agency put forth a similar argument claiming that its power to regulate global climate change was insufficient to provide relief. Here, however, the majority reached a different conclusion than that of Montana’s federal district court. Majority leader Justice Stevens stated that ‘incremental agency action over time may produce cumulative effects and that for standing to be present, the state would not have to show that any single action would remedy its problems.” Stevens further argued that “the EPA's regulation of greenhouse gases would have a significant effect because of the enormous amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the U.S. transportation sector.” [11] Thus, the failure of Lighthiser v. Trump in seeking redress and holding fossil fuel companies accountable does not disprove the prospect of such action, as Massachusetts v. EPA validated the utility of regulatory standards in remedying climate injuries and proved that they can be traceable to an entity.

In holding fossil fuel companies accountable, the application of the Public Trust Doctrine (PTD) presents a potential avenue for asserting states’ role in environmental protection. The doctrine derives from the Roman ""jus publicum"" principle of common ownership of natural resources: “By the law of nature these things are common to mankind—the air, running water, the sea, and consequently the shores of the sea.” [12] In the U.S.’s recognition of the public trust doctrine, state governments rightfully serve as trustees of resources, though its application has traditionally been exclusive to that of waterways. The PTD has been constitutionalized by several states, including Hawaii, which enshrines that “all public natural resources are held in trust by the State for the benefit of the people” and explicitly defines resources to include “land, water, air, minerals, and energy sources.” [13] In Hawaii’s complaint against BP, Shell, and Exxon, the state alleges that it has a constitutional obligation to uphold this protection and cites eight causes of action in its complaint, among them negligence and “harm to public trust resources.” [14] Formerly employed to settle disputes over access to waterways, the doctrine has now imposed affirmative duties upon states to protect resources, as evidenced in various state constitutions. [15]

Similarly, Pennsylvania’s constitution guarantees a “right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment,” and provides that “as trustee of these resources, [Pennsylvania] shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.” [16] As public-trust-based litigation becomes increasingly prevalent in state efforts to address climate change, courts must clarify their function. Hawaii’s invocation of its constitutionalized PTD in litigation against major oil companies emphasizes the doctrine’s contemporary expansion and undermines claims that fossil fuel entities enjoy protection from state-led environmental litigation.

Trump’s Executive Orders raise pressing concerns about the future of the fossil fuel industry and the extent of state autonomy in regulating and preserving these industries within their borders. Understanding how past legal actions have justified state countermeasures against federal expansion of fossil fuels is essential in today’s era of energy polarization. Efforts to immunize fossil fuel corporations place corporate interests above community well-being — a tension reflected in the growing incorporation of the public trust doctrine into state constitutions. This doctrine has been invoked in legal battles to defend states’ rights to safeguard their natural resources and land from oil and gas expansion. Moreover, climate cases are increasingly being remanded to state courts, underscoring the limits of federal authority in establishing doctrines that confer “rights” upon fossil fuel industries. The disparities between landmark cases such as Massachusetts v. EPA and Lighthiser v. Trump reveal that holding entities accountable for regulatory failures is possible, particularly when public health violations are at stake. As organizations and communities seek representation and redress for the harms caused by fossil fuels, these corporations must remain subject to rigorous public scrutiny and accountability.

Michigan Advance

EV sales are in the tank. So what happens next?

Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since federal tax credits ended on Sept. 30.

In November, EVs accounted for 5.3 percent of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales, a share that was less than half the record high in September, according to an estimate published last week by S&P Global Mobility.

The numbers were especially ugly on Tuesday when several automakers released their November figures. Ford said that unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49 percent compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59 percent. I could go on.

But most industry analysts are not sounding an alarm. This is because the decline in sales was expected the moment in July that President Donald Trump signed the legislation that canceled the credit, which was up to $7,500 per vehicle. The law led to months of chaos, during which many consumers accelerated their purchasing decisions to qualify for the credit, contributing to the collapse that followed.

One of the main questions going forward is how long it will take for the market to return to some kind of normalcy. The most common answer I’m seeing is that the current shakeout will likely last well into 2026.

After that, we’ll get to the more important question: What happens next? To help figure this out, I spoke with Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, a research nonprofit with offices around the globe. ✂️

The takeaway is that, yes, this is a setback, but ICE cars are not going to win.

North Dakota Monitor

Natural gas operator fined for environmental violation at North Dakota reservation

The operator of natural gas production facilities on the Fort Berthold Reservation was ordered Friday to pay a $500,000 fine and do 500 hours of community service for an environmental violation.

Targa Badlands LLC pleaded guilty earlier this year in U.S. District Court in North Dakota to a violation of the Clean Air Act that affected the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation.

Targa, which operates six natural gas compressor stations on Fort Berthold, failed to install required hazardous air pollutant monitoring systems, federal prosecutors say in court records.

The violation occurred between 2018 and 2022 on the Johnson Compressor Station near Mandaree. Natural gas gathering pipelines include compressor stations that boost pressure before the gas reaches a natural gas processing plant.

The combustion engines on the compressor station produce hazardous air pollutants such as benzene and formaldehyde, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan O’Konek said during the plea hearing, according to a transcript.

The plea agreement indicates Targa self-reported the violation and promptly corrected it by installing monitoring equipment. The company has since taken steps to improve environmental compliance, federal prosecutors said. The attorney for Targa did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. ✂️

Included only because I’m a sucker for ND news. The issue was found and reported by the company itself. They are a repeat offender, but I’ll look at the positive that there is someone internally looking for issues. Hopefully, they’ll develop better internal processes to stop this from happening again.

Georgia hashes out plan to let data centers build their own clean energy

Big companies have spent years pushing Georgia to let them find and pay for new clean energy to add to the grid, in the hopes that they could then get data centers and other power-hungry facilities online faster.

Now, that concept is tantalizingly close to becoming a reality, with regulators, utility Georgia Power, and others hammering out the details of a program that could be finalized sometime next year. If approved, the framework could not only benefit companies but also reduce the need for a massive buildout of gas-fired plants that Georgia Power is planning to satiate the artificial intelligence boom.

Today, utilities are responsible for bringing the vast majority of new power projects online in the state. But over the past two years, the Clean Energy Buyers Association has negotiated to secure a commitment from Georgia Power that ​“will, for the first time, allow commercial and industrial customers to bring clean energy projects to the utility’s system,” said Katie Southworth, the deputy director for market and policy innovation in the South and Southeast at the trade group, which includes major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. ✂️

Because it made me smile:

✂️ But as it stands, CEBA sees ​“the approved CIR framework as a meaningful step toward the ​‘bring-your-own clean energy’ model,” Southworth said — a model that goes by the catchy acronym BYONCE in clean-energy social media circles. ✂️

It looks like there are still technical kinks to iron out and not all regions of the country are managed in a way to easily facilitate this, but I like the idea.

Idaho Capital Sun

Idaho Congressman Fulcher introduces bill extending private, short-term health care coverage

Idaho Republican Congressman Russ Fulcher is hoping to expand the use of private, short-term health insurance.

Fulcher on Thursday announced the introduction of the Removing Insurance Gaps for Health Treatment (RIGHT) Act of 2025, which would extend the maximum allowance for short-term health plans from four months to up to three years.

Short-term, limited-duration insurance, known as STLDI, are private insurance plans designed to cover temporary gaps in health coverage. The plans are sometimes less expensive than plans offered through state health insurance marketplace plans, but do not always cover as many services and are not subject to the same consumer protection regulations as those compliant with the Affordable Care Act.

“Four months is far too short a limit, posing undue stress and uncertainty on Americans who would otherwise be left without coverage,” Fulcher said in a press release. “My bill, the RIGHT Act, expands STLDI plans to a full year, with the option to renew for up to three years. This is a practical, no-cost approach that offers families more choice, control, and flexibility to select the healthcare options that work best for them.” ✂️

He’s a U.S. rep. Couldn’t he just sign the discharge petition and extend ACA subsidies?

Maine Morning Star

Federal court rejects state effort to weaken agreement protecting disabled children’s rights

A federal court last week rejected a joint attempt by Maine and the U.S. Department of Justice to weaken a previous agreement that required the state to improve services so that children with disabilities no longer had to be separated from their families.

In a statement Friday, a coalition of rights organizations said the ruling “preserves essential protections that ensure children with behavioral-health needs will receive integrated, community-based services rather than face unnecessary institutionalization.”

The settlement agreement stemmed from a September 2024 lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice that alleged the state was failing to meet the needs of students that require behavioral health services and violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by separating them from their homes and communities by institutionalizing them or sending them to juvenile detention centers.

Two months later, the lawsuit was dismissed after the state agreed to implement a robust accountability system with reporting requirements, community outreach and the establishment of an independent watchdog, who would oversee data on state services. Under that initial agreement, the state committed to increasing the availability of community-based behavioral health services through the Maine Department of Health and Human Services so that children would no longer have to be separated from their families. ✂️

Once again, the courts step up to do the right thing.

Maryland Matters

Redistricting supporters outnumber opponents at Maryland meeting

Supporters of mid-decade redistricting in Maryland showed up in force for a virtual meeting of a state advisory commission Friday, calling on state leaders to redo congressional maps to oppose President Donald Trump (R).

It was the third hearing of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission and the third different outcome: Redistricting opponents dominated the first hearing and the second was nearly evenly split. Redistricting proponents dominated Friday’s meeting, thanks to a slew of climate and civil rights advocates, union leaders, a few retired federal employees and even a high school student.

Also joining the chorus was Bobby LaPin, the Maryland social media personality who has announced his intention to run against Senate President Bill Ferguson (D- Baltimore City), a commission member who opposes mid-cycle redistricting.

The commission will meet at least once more, on Dec. 12, to hear public comment.

The redistricting saga began with Trump urging Republican-led states to redistrict for partisan gain before the 2026 elections, to pick up GOP seats in Congress. Red states that have passed new maps so far include Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina. Democrats in California and Virginia have fired back with maps of their own. ✂️

Arizona’s Congresswoman Grijalva says she was pepper sprayed during Tucson ICE raid

Arizona’s U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva was involved in a clash with federal agents during a protest of immigration raids in west Tucson Friday, during which she claims she was hit with pepper spray.

According to a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency partnered with the Internal Revenue Service to carry out as many as 16 warrants in southern Arizona in a “years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations.” In videos posted to social media by community advocates, several masked federal agents in tactical gear can be seen near the westside location of popular Mexican seafood and grill restaurant Taco Giro.

The raids prompted a protest and federal agents deployed tear gas and pepper spray against the crowd. The Arizona Daily Star reported that multiple employees who live near the west Tucson restaurant were detained. At least one protester was among those taken into custody by federal agents. AZ Family reported that Taco Giro locations in north Tucson, Casa Grande and Vail were also targeted. ICE spokesman Fernando Burgos-Ortiz confirmed to the Arizona Mirror that multiple people were arrested, but didn’t clarify how many or confirm claims that agents had pepper-sprayed a sitting U.S. Congresswoman.

Tricia McLaughlin, the spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, dismissed Grijalva’s account. McLaughlin accused Grijalva of hindering the work of federal agents and appeared to question Grijalva’s claim that she was pepper-sprayed by highlighting her lack of visible physical reaction in the video. ✂️

Oregon Capital Chronicle

Portland’s DA balked at charging federal agents under Oregon law. Then AG Rayfield stepped in

The top local prosecutor in the Portland area is cautioning against “unreasonable expectations” for his ability to charge federal agents using state law, after signing onto a statement last week warning the Trump administration that its officers could be held accountable for excessive force.

The district attorneys in Oregon’s three most populated counties and Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield stood in unison last week when they signed onto a letter warning the Trump administration that they were monitoring reports of excessive force by federal agents with the goal of potentially bringing charges forward should the issue persist. Rayfield, alongside Multnomah County District Attorney Nathan Vasquez, Washington County District Attorney Kevin Barton and Clackamas County District Attorney John Wentworth, requested cooperation from the federal government in Oregon’s investigations.

The attorneys pointed to instances of disproportionate use of force through tear gas and nonlethal munitions by agents with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during protests outside the Portland waterfront Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility. They also referred to federal agents from an unmarked van in October holding teenagers at gunpoint by a Hillsboro Dutch Bros coffee stand and the November arrest of a 17-year-old U.S. citizen during his lunch off-grounds from McMinnville High School. ✂️

Events

1790 - The U.S. Congress moves from NY City to Philadelphia.

1825 - President Adams recommends establishing a national observatory.

1849 - Harriet Tubman makes her final escape from slavery.

1865 - Georgia ratifies the 13th Amendment and abolishes slavery.

WineRev:

1865 Washington DC The 13th Amendment to Constitution, abolishing slavery, had passed both branches of Congress back in January (the center of a fine movie ‘Lincoln’ starting Daniel Day Lewis). Now it needed to be ratified by ¾ of the states. Since the Lincoln Administration did not consider secession legal, legally those 11 Southern states were still part of the Union (so instead of needing 15 ratifications from the 20 states that remained loyal, the Amendment needed 25 out of the 31 total.) OTOH Lee surrendered back in April, Jeff Davis was arrested in May, there was no fighting going on, and in the various Southern states the Union Army is watching over the brand new and re-constituted state governments. (And former Confederates were not allowed to vote or be part of any elected office. If they got mad about this, they could complain to any armed Union soldier or officer on occupation duty in their town…..) On this day the government of Georgia ratifies the Amendment, making ¾, making it part of the Constitution.

1877 - Thomas Edison records voices for the first time at the offices of Scientific American.

1884 - The Washington Monument in D.C. is completed.

Will he tear it down or just rename it?

1922 - Power is transmitted over the first electric power line in NY.

1923 - President Coolidge becomes the first Presidential to address the country on the radio.

WineRev:

1923 Washington DC Marconi and Tesla had gotten the world signaling by radio at the turn of the century. In the fading days of World War I scientists and engineers figured out how to add voices, sounds, even music to the dots and dashes (Morse code) that had been used earlier. Transmitters went up and receivers were designed and sold. In 1920 KDKA in Pittsburgh became the first US commercial radio station to go on the air. Their first broadcast told of the results of the 1920

Presidential Election (Harding the winner.) In the summer of 1923 President Harding died in office and Calvin Coolidge became President.

On this day Mr. Coolidge became the first President ever to speak live on radioto a national audience from the White House.(They connected other stations by telephone lines to the same broadcast so it could be widely heard. They called the connection a ‘network’….a technical term worth remembering. 😊)

1933 - Judge John M. Woolsey rules that James Joyce's novel Ulysses is not obscene (United States v. One Book Called Ulysses).

1947 - The Everglades National Park (FL) is dedicated by President Truman.

WineRev:

1947Florida National Parks were invented by President Grant back in 1872 when he invented the world’s first one called ‘Yellowstone.’ Other mountains, seacoasts, canyons have been designated National Parks (and administered by the Park Service and the Dept. of the Interior.) On this day President Truman (shrewd enough to go to Florida in December!) dedicates a most unusual ecosystem as a protected National Park: The Everglades.

1961 - Ernie Davis becomes the first Black to win the Heisman Trophy.

St. Nicholas Day

St. Nicholas Day on December 6 celebrates of course carries some connection to Christmas and Santa Claus, but there is much more to this holiday and St. Nicholas than that. Although St. Nicholas partially inspired the Christmas and Santa Claus that we all know and love, St. Nicholas actually derives from a different kind of tale. Let’s learn about St. Nicholas and what this day is truly about.

WineRev:

343 (Three digit date!) Death date of Nicolas, Bishop of Myra (now Demre), Eastern Roman Empire (now Turkey) (The Church remembers saints on their death day, looking death in the eye and proclaiming “this one we will remember despite you, so the good they did will live on in memory and for inspiration.”)

Almost nothing known about Nicolas from surviving records; earliest mentions are from over 200 years later. Many miracles already attributed to him and he had a legendary for reputation for generosity and gift-giving (in secret; by tradition he left gifts for the poor in the middle of the night, and anonymously.)

Most famously remembered for rescuing three sisters from being sold into prostitution by dropping a bag of gold coins down their chimney on three consecutive nights so their father had a dowry for each of them and could marry them off. (Notice any parallels with some other guy: chimney…..gifts……coming by night? Some story pieces have been around a LONG time.) The real Good St. Nick!

To Quote Girsaol

Tomorrow is St. Nicholas’ Day, the patron saint of children who is not known for having anything to do with sardines.

St. Nicholas and I have something in common! I have nothing to do with sardines, either!

National Miners Day

Despite federal efforts to ensure safe working conditions for miners, they have one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs you can imagine. To recognize their efforts, Congress has declared December 6 National Miners Day. Why? Our entire economy depends on them. On this holiday, we should all take a moment to think about the many ways that miners play a role in our daily lives. Mined materials contribute to things like roads, houses, cars and computers. We wouldn’t be able to get much done without their hard work.

I applaud all of the work that miners have done for us.

===

NATIONAL GAZPACHO DAY

National Gazpacho Day, on December 6th, recognizes a flavorful soup that cooks serve cold. This typically tomato-based vegetable soup originated in the southern Spanish region of Andalucia. Gazpacho is widely consumed in Spanish cuisine, usually during the summer months.

I question the wisdom of making this day at a point of the year when many of us want soup served hot, but I’m not the “national day” Gazpacho.

===

Mitten Tree Day

On December 6th, Mitten Tree Day celebrates the gift of warmth. It’s a day to collect mittens, hang them on a Christmas tree, and then hand them out to those in need.

Those who live in cold climates understand the necessity of mittens. This winter clothing item is essential for keeping the hands warm while outdoors. Unfortunately, however, there are many children around the world who are without adequate winter clothing, which includes mittens.

It’s a national day I can get behind.

===

Put On Your Own Shoes Day

Sounds simple enough – and surely plenty of us do it every day, unless you really feel like braving the walk to work in your socks – but it seems this day might be more to do with shoes themselves and a way of encouraging children to put on and tie their own shoes.

Not just for children…

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-12-06 23:44:50+00:00,techxplore.com,Georgia Power says it needs a huge increase in power capacity to meet data center demand,Jeff Amy,,,,,https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-georgia-power-huge-capacity-center.html,"Josh Stein cited concerns about data centers as one reason for opposing a 15% rate increase sought by Duke Energy for two utilities.
80% of new capacity for data centers Georgia Power, with 2.8 million customers, projects the largest percentage increase in electricity demand over the next five years of any region but Texas.
The utility says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity—enough to power 4 million Georgia homes—saying 80% of that would power data centers.
That's in addition to the 3,000 megawatts the commission approved in 2024 after an unusual mid-cycle request by Georgia Power.
But if Georgia Power overbuilds and there are no data centers to pay, other customers could shoulder those costs.","With data centers flooding into Georgia, utility regulators face a big decision: Should they let Georgia Power Co. spend more than $15 billion to increase its electricity capacity by 50% over the next six years to serve computer complexes? Or could the utility overbuild and stick other ratepayers with the bill?

It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence. The largest subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co., Georgia Power said in testimony filed last month that the build-out will boost the state's economy and ""allow Georgia to contribute to the nation's focus on the global importance of artificial intelligence and the digital economy.""

""Given the number of companies interested in doing business in Georgia and the amount of customer load with signed contracts or in advanced discussions, it is important to continue moving forward with support for this great growth opportunity,"" company officials said in testimony.

But electricity bills have emerged as a potent political issue in Georgia and nationwide, with grassroots opposition to data centers partly based on fears that other customers will subsidize the power demands of technology behemoths.

""I think what's happening in Georgia is in some sense a perfect microcosm of what's happening nationwide,"" said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonprofit group that seeks to increase public involvement in utility regulation. ""You're seeing electricity demand grow at the fastest rate in decades, and you're seeing electricity prices rise at the fastest rate in decades.""

A growing political issue

Electricity costs were a key issue in last month's elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, both data center hot spots. On Tuesday in North Carolina, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein cited concerns about data centers as one reason for opposing a 15% rate increase sought by Duke Energy for two utilities.

In Georgia, the five elected Republicans on the Public Service Commission will decide on Georgia Power's proposal weeks after voters delivered a stinging rebuke to GOP leadership, ousting two incumbent Republicans on the panel in favor of Democrats by overwhelming margins. Those two Democrats won in campaigns that centered on six Georgia Power rate increases commissioners have allowed in recent years, even though the company agreed to a three-year rate freeze in July.

After hearings next week, commissioners are scheduled to take a final vote Dec. 19. The two new Democrats won't take office until January and current commissioners denied a request by opponents to postpone the decision until then.

Brionte McCorkle of Georgia Conservation Voters, a group that advocates for carbon-free energy and supported the Democrats, fears the vote will be one last gift from the all-Republican commission to Georgia Power.

""It would be a slap in the face for the commission to rush through this proposal, and give the power company everything it wants,"" said McCorkle ""It's just not listening to what the people have said loud and clear.""

80% of new capacity for data centers

Georgia Power, with 2.8 million customers, projects the largest percentage increase in electricity demand over the next five years of any region but Texas. That's according to an analysis by power consultant Grid Strategies of forecasts filed with federal officials. The utility says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity—enough to power 4 million Georgia homes—saying 80% of that would power data centers. That's in addition to the 3,000 megawatts the commission approved in 2024 after an unusual mid-cycle request by Georgia Power.

Whether the forecast is accurate and who will pay the bill if data center customers don't materialize is at the heart of the decision. Commissioners in January adopted rules meant to make sure data centers pay the costs of building new power plants and transmission lines they need. But if Georgia Power overbuilds and there are no data centers to pay, other customers could shoulder those costs.

""The whole argument is premised on the idea that if we get all these new customers, then we can take costs and spread it out over more people and therefore put downward pressure on prices,"" Hua said. ""Well, if you don't actually end up getting all those customers and you built all this new infrastructure, then you could see a scenario where you actually drive bills through the roof even more.""

The ultimate potential costs are unknown because Georgia Power's estimates are partially a trade secret that the company won't release. For example, the $15 billion price tag only covers construction costs for 80% of the current 10,000 megawatt request, and it doesn't include any of the borrowing costs, which customers must also pay. The price of the 3,000 megawatts approved in 2024 remains entirely secret. Because of the rate freeze, ultimate costs won't become clear until 2028, the next time commissioners set electricity rates.

Will customers pay?

Public Service Commission staff members who have analyzed the request say Georgia Power will need $3.4 billion a year in additional revenue by 2031, which could equal out to $20 a month for a residential customer. The company replied that such a claim is ""flatly incorrect.""

""These customers pay upfront the full costs of serving them, commit to long-term contracts, and provide financial guarantees,"" said spokesperson Matthew Kent. ""That means residential and small business customers are protected from cost increases tied to these projects.""

Staff members recommended that the commission allow Georgia Power to build capacity for new large customers only after they have signed contracts starting with 3,100 megawatts of capacity and up to 7,400 megawatts total for contracts signed by March 16. That recommendation would also allow the commission to avoid approving contracts for some new multibillion-dollar natural gas-fired power plants. Costs for such construction have risen sharply, partly because equipment manufacturers are having trouble meeting demand.

The company reacted sharply against that recommendation, saying ""it would significantly inhibit"" its ability to sign up new data centers, hurt economic development, and reduce the opportunity to lower rates.

The company and staff could negotiate a settlement before the Dec. 19 vote. McCorkle said any outcome should focus on protecting customers.

""What we don't want is a form of corporate welfare, where individual citizens are paying for the benefit of big mega corporations like Meta and Amazon,"" she said.

They create opportunities, attract investment, generate new high-quality jobs, and strengthen energy security, while consolidating Greece’s geostrategic position.
Indeed, energy security today is inseparable from national security.
Their presence enhances stability, confirms Greece’s credibility, and creates a broader shield of energy protection.
By investing in the hydrocarbons sector, Greece increases its energy security while remaining fully prepared.","“The emerging regional architecture of energy security, prosperity and stability runs through Greece,” Environment and Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou said in an interview with Kathimerini during his recent trip to Washington.

He highlighted that the presence of two major American energy companies in Greece provides a broader shield of energy security. He also sent a clear message to Turkey. Unless it embraces the US-promoted model of cooperation – abandoning the casus belli and the “gray zones theory” – it will not be able to participate in this new regional framework.

In recent months, Greece has achieved a significant geostrategic upgrade through its energy agreements with the United States. How can this momentum be sustained or even strengthened?

The agreements signed in Athens in November offer undeniable, multifaceted benefits, economic, energy-related, and geostrategic. They create opportunities, attract investment, generate new high-quality jobs, and strengthen energy security, while consolidating Greece’s geostrategic position. To fully realize these gains, it is essential that the agreements are implemented immediately, with continuous engagement, commitment to the objectives, and strict adherence to timelines. The Vertical Corridor is already operational, allowing the supply of US LNG to Ukraine. Just a few days ago, my US counterpart and I established a working group tasked with implementing the strategic objectives of the Vertical Corridor; its first meeting is scheduled for December 10. These initiatives form part of a broader architecture that enhances Greece’s regional role. The Vertical Corridor – connecting some 100 million people – the 3+1 framework linking Greece, Cyprus, Israel and the US, and the IMEC corridor together aim to create a unified pathway for regional development and stability stretching from India to Ukraine. Greece sits at the heart of this chain, acting as a key hub where energy routes, infrastructure, pipelines, ports, rail and road networks intersect, shaping a new regional architecture.

This new regional architecture strongly reflects the Trump doctrine, which firmly links energy to national security. Does Athens feel more secure within this model?

Indeed, energy security today is inseparable from national security. By strengthening the former, Greece naturally bolsters the latter. The conclusion of the Chevron-Helleniq Energy agreement and the first offshore drilling in 40 years – planned by the ExxonMobil-Energean-Helleniq Energy consortium – mark a new era in which the world’s two largest publicly listed energy companies are actively operating on Greek territory. Their presence enhances stability, confirms Greece’s credibility, and creates a broader shield of energy protection. However, as important as this energy shield is, it cannot replace Greece’s responsibility to continuously strengthen its national deterrent capabilities and leverage emerging European defense supply chains, especially amid global upheavals and Turkey’s ongoing casus belli. By investing in the hydrocarbons sector, Greece increases its energy security while remaining fully prepared.

Since the US considers regional stability and reduced tensions crucial for the success of its energy companies’ projects, does this affect Greece’s approach to Turkey?

This new architecture can only thrive in an environment of stability, genuine cooperation and clear prospects. We want it to serve as a paradigm shift for the region – one that eliminates extremes and threats. It is therefore up to Turkey to follow this model of cooperation, leaving behind the casus belli and the “gray zones theory.” Otherwise, Turkey will be unable to participate in this new reality. This vision of regional development highlights the need for a positive, realistic agenda based on commercial cooperation and respect for international law. Our planning prioritizes synergies grounded in international commercial norms rather than tensions or zero-sum thinking. Moreover, in recent months, Greece- – without reacting to Turkey’s provocations – has advanced the institutionalization of maritime spatial planning and marine parks, as well as agreements with the Chevron-Helleniq Energy consortium for offshore blocks south of Crete and the Peloponnese, exercising its sovereign rights in the sector.

Since you mentioned the 3+1, how valuable was the recent meeting in Athens and what foundations has it set for the future?

The recent meeting – held for the first time at the ministerial level – was particularly successful, marking an upgrade of the format. Established in 2019 through the US East Med Act, the 3+1 mechanism includes funding for the creation of the Eastern Mediterranean Energy Center, a goal toward which we are working systematically. Such a permanent cooperation hub will enhance strategic dialogue, build expertise, and solidify the energy partnership among member-states. At the same time, the 3+1 can serve as the link between the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the Vertical Corridor, creating a unified architecture of energy security and development across the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. The next 3+1 meeting is scheduled for April 2026 in Washington.

With regard to IMEC, can Greece be confident it has established its place if and when the corridor becomes a reality?

From the outset, Greece treated IMEC as a strategic opportunity and acted methodically to secure its participation, without adopting an adversarial approach toward other European countries. This approach was reinforced through careful government planning, successive meetings between Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – both in Athens in August 2023 and in India in February 2024 – and by promoting Greece as a key connectivity hub. Today, Greece has strengthened its role as an alternative gateway to the corridor. Combined with the Vertical Corridor and the 3+1, Greece is establishing its position in this emerging regional architecture.

Where does the electricity interconnection project stand? Sources in Washington suggest that if the three countries decide to break the deadlock, the US would provide support if needed.

As both the Greek prime minister and the president of Cyprus have announced, it has been decided to update the technical and financial data of the Greece-Cyprus electricity interconnection. During my visit to the US, interest in participating in the project was confirmed by American institutions – whether government-linked or purely private. For Greece, this project has never been purely economic. It carries strategic significance, ending Cyprus’s energy isolation and fitting within a broader vision connecting Greece, Cyprus, and Israel – and further linking Israel, the Arab world and India – transforming our geographic and energy links into a genuine corridor of stability and development.",https://www.ekathimerini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Papastavrou-960x600.jpg?v=1765016606,N,,2025-12-07 05:59:58.927156

Now, Ford’s next EVs will be vastly different, as its CEO is clear about the future and believes adapting to the historic shift is the best way to survive. Discover what lies ahead for Ford in the future, and how it plans to adapt with its EVs.

Ford’s CEO is clear about the future

Several factors play a key role in choosing the type of car a person drives. In the U.S., being ‘carbon-conscious’ has become a significant trend, as thousands have embraced a greener lifestyle and thus, greener cars as well. While many may miss the great roar of an internal combustion engine (ICE), electric-powered vehicles (EVs) have become increasingly popular.

Beyond savings on fuel and maintenance costs, government incentives have also increased the popularity of EVs in the U.S. market. However, since the end of a particular tax credit incentive, what will the future hold for the EV market? While some may be uncertain, Ford’s CEO is clear about the future, and has even hinted that the next EVs will be vastly different to adapt to the ‘historic shift.’

Next EVs will be vastly different to adapt to the ‘historic shift’

The popular $7,500 tax credit incentive has been cut as a result of the Trump Administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The U.S. market saw a significant increase in the sales of EVs before the incentive came to an end, but what happens next?

According to Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, the EV industry will still be vibrant, but much smaller than they initially thought. At the Detroit conference, Farley stated that “partial electrification” cars, or rather hybrids, would be easier for customers to embrace, highlighting a ‘historic shift’. Farley continued that they learned their lesson the hard way by overestimating the EV market, adding:

“Customers are not interested in the $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast, they’re efficient, you don’t go to the gas station, but they’re expensive.”

This is what the future of Ford may look like

Thanks to the federal reforms, all automakers, including Ford, will have to figure out what to do with their EV capacity and battery plants. According to Farley:

“We’re going to have to find a place; what we do with all the batter plants. And we’ll fill them. But it will be more stress because we had a four-year predictable policy. Now the policy changes. It means Ford, our construction companies, and we all have to make adjustments. And it’s going to be good for the country, I believe. But it will be one more stress on the supply side.”

For now, customers can most likely expect Ford to focus on EVs that will be much smaller and better suited to urban and suburban lifestyles with shorter commutes. Prices for these EVs will be lower, as their batteries will be significantly smaller. However, Farley added that hybrids, E-Revs, and EV plug-ins are the future (and Ford’s savior), as America is already “falling in love.”

Ford currently has few hybrid options to choose from. Currently, we can choose between the Maverick and the Escape when it comes to standard hybrids, with the Escape also available as a plug-in hybrid. However, the Escape production is coming to an end in 2026, meaning Ford’s only saviors will be the Maverick and the F-150. Only time will tell how soon Ford launches a new hybrid model. Perhaps Sweden’s new shocking hybrid model will serve as a source of inspiration in the future.

In late October, Hochul made it clear that she was having second thoughts about the building mandate, too.
They argued that under federal law, the state does not have the power to ban fossil fuel appliances.
They would need to convince the district court judge to block a law that was passed through the democratic process and that he himself had just upheld.
The plaintiffs argued that they would: Propane gas companies, for example, could lose much of their new business, and union plumbers and pipefitters could lose jobs.","When New York abruptly backed down this month from its plans to implement a nation-leading ban on gas in new buildings, some legal observers had questions. Lawmakers passed the All-Electric Buildings Act, which requires most new buildings to have only electric appliances, in 2023 as a step toward reducing pollution from the state’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and advancing New York’s legally mandated emissions targets. It was set to take effect in January.

Delaying the law’s implementation past then would cause the state “irreparable harm,” lawyers argued in an October 1 brief. They’d spent two years successfully defending the law against industry opponents.

But the law is now on hold — with the state’s signoff. After Governor Kathy Hochul’s administration agreed, a federal judge finalized a deal last week that will likely suspend New York’s gas ban for at least a year and potentially two or more.

The state’s sudden retreat came after a series of actions from Hochul this year walking back the state’s climate commitments: shelving a promised carbon pricing program and vowing to fight a court ruling to revive it; signing off on a thrice-rejected underwater gas pipeline after talks with President Donald Trump; and granting permits to a gas-powered cryptocurrency mining facility that regulators had long said violated the state’s climate law.

In late October, Hochul made it clear that she was having second thoughts about the building mandate, too.

“On the electric building issue, I’m looking for an all of the above approach,” she told reporters in Rochester at the time. “I’m going to look at this with a very realistic approach and do what I can, because my number one focus is affordability right now.”

Republicans and upstate Democrats had been pressuring Hochul to press pause on the electric buildings law, and industry opponents of the law were still trying to persuade a judge to block it, but the state was holding its ground in court. Then, on November 12, New York’s lawyers filed an agreement with the law’s opponents to delay implementation until four months after a federal appeals court and even the US Supreme Court weigh in. The judge’s signoff made it legally binding — notably, delaying enforcement until after next year’s gubernatorial election.

Hochul’s office is now framing the court deal as a pragmatic step that will help uphold the law in the long term.

“The Governor remains committed to the all-electric-buildings law and believes this action will help the State defend it, as well as reduce regulatory uncertainty for developers during this period of litigation,” said spokesperson Ken Lovett in a statement.

Some legal experts are skeptical.

“The state’s move, while it was done under the cover of litigation, was 100 percent a political move,” said Amy Turner, director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.

If the governor had sought to put the electric buildings mandate on hold through executive action, climate groups almost certainly would have sued. With the court agreement, Turner said, “they found a way to do it that makes it seem like their hands were tied.”

Here’s a closer look at what New York argued in court in early October — and why its recent backtracking is raising eyebrows among some legal observers.

1. Plaintiffs would need to meet a really high legal bar to put the law on hold.

The saga started when a coalition of gas and construction industry interests, including building trades unions, sued New York state in the federal Northern District over the freshly passed electric buildings law in 2023. They argued that under federal law, the state does not have the power to ban fossil fuel appliances.

Judge Glenn Suddaby ruled in favor of the state this July and dismissed the case, but the plaintiffs went back to him in September, pleading for him to suspend the law anyway while they appealed the ruling. They argued that they had a strong case, citing a federal appeals court in California that had overturned Berkeley’s first-in-the-nation gas ban on the basis of the same federal law.

It was not unusual for the New York plaintiffs to seek such an injunction, said Daniel Carpenter-Gold, an attorney at the Public Health Law Center who has been tracking the case. “But it’s also very difficult to win,” he said.

In their October 1 brief, New York’s lawyers stressed just how high of a bar the plaintiffs would have to meet to secure an injunction at this stage — particularly since it was the first time in the two-year case that they’d asked the judge to take such a step.

They would need to convince the district court judge to block a law that was passed through the democratic process and that he himself had just upheld. To do so, they would need to show both that they had a good chance of winning at the appellate level, and that they would face “irreparable harm” if the law were allowed to proceed.

“Plaintiffs fail to satisfy any of these requirements,” the state’s lawyers argued.

2. New York state couldn’t block the law even if it wanted to.

The state went a step further in its October 1 filing, arguing that it couldn’t suspend the law even if it wanted to. The Code Council had already finalized the new building code, the culmination of a lengthy process that takes place every five years and is meant to take into account new laws like the All-Electric Buildings Act that are passed in the interim.

Once the new code is published, it’s up to local code enforcement officials — not the state — to enforce it. In other words, New York’s lawyers argued, it was too late for a court to force the state to block it.

3. Delaying implementation would cause the state “irreparable harm.”

The final issue at stake in the recent court exchange was which side would suffer “irreparable harm” if their opponents prevailed. The plaintiffs argued that they would: Propane gas companies, for example, could lose much of their new business, and union plumbers and pipefitters could lose jobs.

The state countered that it would, because new fossil fuel buildings constructed while the law is on hold would last for decades to come, irreversibly setting back the state’s efforts to meet its legally binding climate targets.

As the political battle over building electrification heated up in early November, there was no sign that Judge Suddaby was wavering on his decision.

On November 3, the plaintiffs said they would move the case to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals if he didn’t file an injunction within a week. He didn’t.

“The state has a strong case,” said Carpenter-Gold, of the Public Health Law Center. There was “nothing that I could see that would have indicated that their position had weakened in any way,” he said. So he was surprised when New York’s lawyers suddenly conceded the plaintiffs’ demand.

The deal suspends the law for at least a year: until the appeals court rules on it, which could easily take six months; while the plaintiffs potentially appeal to the US Supreme Court, which could add several months more, even if the high court declines to take up the case; and for another four months either way.

Climate hawks are furious at the Hochul administration’s decision. After it was first reported, lawmakers and advocates lined up to demand that the governor reverse course. That would be hard for her to do. Now that the judge has signed off on the November 12 deal, the state is under court order to keep the law on ice. The New York Department of State issued a notice late last week that the all-electric section of the building code is on pause.

It’s not yet clear whether the notice fully satisfies the court order, or whether the code council will take further action to codify the delay. Climate advocates are planning to rally outside its next meeting, on December 5, either way.",https://i0.wp.com/www.adirondackexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Electric-Buildings.webp?fit=1640%2C1092&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-06 17:59:50.711969

An estimated 9.2 million lead service lines currently deliver drinking water to homes, businesses, schools, and unsuspecting citizens throughout the United States. Lead water lines pose an extremely high public safety issue. This has been a known fact for many years, and concern was raised again recently when the U.S. EPA released data showing that approximately 9.2 million water lines still need to be replaced.

There has been an abundance of funding available for cities and counties to address this public health issue, so it is disheartening to realize that millions of lead water lines are still delivering water to citizens.

The federal government allocated $15 billion in funding in 2021 to address lead pipe water issues. And recently, the Environmental Defense Fund announced that more than 250 utilities have active lead-service-line replacement programs underway. While progress is being made, questions remain about why more public entities are moving slowly and how long the federal funding support will remain in place.

Since the funding framework for supporting water projects, specifically lead water pipe replacement projects, is currently under review, several states are aggressively urging the Trump Administration to continue the financial funding support for projects to mitigate this public safety issue.

In the meantime, many upcoming lead water line replacement projects will be launched in 2025. These will be large and critically important initiatives. The following future contracting opportunities are examples of what can be expected in 2026.

City leaders in Detroit, Michigan, will soon launch a $140 million project for a large-scale and citywide water infrastructure improvement initiative as aging water mains lead service lines are replaced. The project’s scope will include two primary water main replacement packages covering more than 25 miles of distribution pipelines. It will also include five dedicated lead service line replacement projects to remove and replace thousands of residential service connections from the water main. The work will include street restoration, new valves and hydrants, and system pressure improvements to enhance long-term performance. Approximately $20 million has been allocated for each component of work. Construction is expected to begin in July 2026 and continue until July 2028.

Officials at the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) will launch a $114 million systemwide initiative designed to identify and replace lead service lines across its regional water network. The multi-year program will begin with an extensive inventory and field inspection process to locate and classify the materials used for more than 600,000 customer service lines. As strange as it may sound, more than half of the lines are made of unknown materials. The total number of lines to be replaced will be determined by inventory findings, but projections are that thousands of lead or unknown material service connections will require replacements.

Current estimates indicate that the inspection and data collection efforts will continue through 2026, with design and early engineering to ramp up in late 2026 and possibly continue into early 2027. Construction procurements will begin as soon as possible after all other phases are completed.

New York City's lead service line replacement program will launch with a $72 million city-led expansion that will initially target specific neighborhoods in the Bronx before moving on to the Queens and Brooklyn areas. The program, announced in October 2025 and partially funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will standardize design, outreach, and compliance across boroughs while expediting the replacement of lead service lines for public health protections.

Some noteworthy components of this work will include uniform design packages, resident outreach programs, coordination of utility and street restoration work, block-by-block mapping, and an inventory of service line materials. Delivery will occur in phases over several years. Currently, the project is in the design stage and construction solicitation documents will be released as design standards and packaging are finalized in 2026. Phased neighborhood work packages will be released beginning in 2026, and more bidding opportunities will follow.

City leaders in Shorewood, Wisconsin, will also launch a project to replace lead infested service lines and aging water mains at a cost of approximately $44 million. The village’s goal is to eliminate all public and private sector lead service lines, but that will take many years. This initial effort will kick start the program. The capital investment that was required to support this water infrastructure project comes from local, state, and federal sources, including an allocation from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Shorewood maintains more than 30 miles of water main lines, and most were installed before 1940. Officials estimate that more than 90% of homes are connected by lead service lines. All the new replacement lines will be copper. Design work is underway, and the selection of a contracting firm will precede the planned construction which is slated to begin in 2026. Three additional similar phases of work are scheduled for 2027 when 160 lead service lines and two water mains are ready for updating.

As America enters 2026, the nation stands at a crossroads: the scale of the remaining work is enormous, but the momentum appears to be very strong. With federal funding under review and many states pushing for continued support, the next few years will determine whether the country can finally eliminate this long-recognized hazard. What is clear is that every mile of pipe replaced represents a step toward safer communities, healthier families, and a modernized water system in America worthy of public trust.",https://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/135e576e/135e576e-98f5-4435-b33c-0aaf00dbf16d/leadpipeinground_getty_2211014580.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 00:57:36.182079

The mobile battery energy storage system, known as MBESS, is a potential replacement for use of portable diesel generators.
“Advancing energy storage technology is essential to accelerating the clean energy transition,” said New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll.
The mobile energy storage system being investigated, Viridi’s RSP150, is an 8.5-foot trailer-mounted, lithium-ion unit that can provide 30kW of power for approximately five hours.
“This mobile battery storage system demonstration and collaboration offers a better understanding of this emerging technology and its potential impact in real-world conditions,” said Haresh Kamath, director of energy storage and cross-cutting technologies at EPRI.","The New York Power Authority (NYPA) is collaborating with Cornell University and the Electric Power Research Institute to demonstrate use of a quieter and no-emission mobile battery to power campus events.

The mobile battery energy storage system, known as MBESS, is a potential replacement for use of portable diesel generators.

""Use of new technologies like the MBESS unit is evidence of New York’s commitment to transition to a clean energy economy and to pursue new energy storage options that will help strengthen the state’s electric system, ensuring its reliability and resilience,"" NYPA said.

“Advancing energy storage technology is essential to accelerating the clean energy transition,” said New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll. “The success of the new mobile battery storage system at Cornell highlights NYPA’s commitment to innovation and to piloting new technologies that can be scaled to drive New York’s energy future.”

The newly designed MBESS unit debuted in November at Cornell’s Ithaca campus to validate the system’s ability to provide temporary power during various large outdoor events.

The unit will be evaluated for its contribution to energy resilience and emergency response efforts. Cornell used the MBESS system Nov. 20 at the “Charging Forward: Cornell’s Mobile Battery Demonstration.”

Mobile battery energy storage systems have emerged in recent years as a versatile option to provide a clean and quiet alternative to portable diesel fuel generation power at off-grid locations. Unlike stationary storage systems, MBESS can be deployed to remote or temporary sites, providing temporary power under various applications such as grid support, emergency backup, and remote power supply.

Cornell’s system, manufactured by Viridi, employs Viridi’s proprietary lithium-ion battery technology, reducing potential fire risk, and is being explored as a quieter option, a flexible emergency power source, and a new standard for providing on-site power at locations where power is limited or non-existent.

For Cornell, this project builds on the university’s long-standing commitment to sustainability and carbon neutrality. The mobile battery will contribute to Cornell’s living laboratory for sustainable innovation, which seeks to simultaneously improve university facilities while demonstrating scalable sustainability solutions for the general public.

“Cornell is proud to collaborate with NYPA and EPRI on this exciting demonstration of mobile battery energy storage,” said Juliet Parsons, associate director of Operations and Logistics at Cornell University. “The MBESS project supports Cornell’s campus-wide commitment to carbon neutrality while offering a cleaner, quieter, and more efficient power solution for major events like commencement, reunion, and other campus-wide gatherings. By reducing our reliance on diesel generators, we’re improving both the sustainability and quality of event support, while also contributing to the university’s role as a living laboratory for scalable clean energy innovation.”

When not in use, Cornell’s MBESS will be parked at a charging center where it is connected to the grid. When the MBESS is required to provide temporary power to an event or during an emergency, it is disconnected from the grid and transported to a site where it can be used as standalone power source for up to five hours.

This transportable characteristic is particularly valuable during an emergency event such as a storm where quick response and adaptability are crucial, NYPA noted.

The MBESS will be used to provide power during outdoor campus events such as convocation, graduation, reunion and homecoming. The unit could generate power to light up large tents, give catering trucks a place to plug in, power an inflatable large screen at movie nights, amongst other activities.

The MBESS will avoid the need for polluting generators that normally would have to be gassed up several times during the run of outdoor events.

The mobile energy storage system being investigated, Viridi’s RSP150, is an 8.5-foot trailer-mounted, lithium-ion unit that can provide 30kW of power for approximately five hours. The unit will be deployed to various sites as needed, primarily for large-scale events that require reliable power without sole reliance on portable diesel generators.

NYPA funded the project and engaged Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and the Facilities and Campus Services Office to host the demonstration and oversaw the installation of charging infrastructure and site acceptance testing.

Under the research and development project, NYPA and EPRI researchers will document the process and procedures of acquiring and deploying the MBESS to expand the industry’s understanding of the technology’s readiness and characteristics.

Cornell faculty and students will examine how the technology can help reduce the environmental footprint of large universities in a cost-effective manner. Advancing MBESS has the potential to provide societal benefit by increasing the flexibility, reliability and resiliency of clean energy use.

“This mobile battery storage system demonstration and collaboration offers a better understanding of this emerging technology and its potential impact in real-world conditions,” said Haresh Kamath, director of energy storage and cross-cutting technologies at EPRI. “The insights gained here can help inform broader industry adoption of flexible technologies, supporting a more reliable and resilient energy future.”

Business cycles are inevitable, but the U.S. economy has a structural framework conducive to long-term expansion.","In the wake of tariffs, immigration crackdowns, geopolitical disruptions, and heightened uncertainty, the pace of U.S. job growth has slowed significantly in recent months and has been trending at a pace well below historical patterns. In addition, performance across industries has recently been notably uneven. While current challenges are clearly affecting near-term expansion, looking out over a few decades, we are still seeing signs of solid potential.

One factor influencing U.S. growth at present is the performance of other countries. Leading global economic analysts are generally projecting moderate growth over the next few years, which is a welcomed signal. However, significant downside risks could affect not only the immediate situation, but also the long-term outlook. One factor which could reduce future gains is the potential for decreased supply chain efficiencies, whether from trade tensions due to policy decisions or ongoing international conflicts.

Another concern is the high cost of energy, which is curtailing growth (as well as quality of life) in numerous countries. Prices are negatively affecting expansion in Europe and other areas, and overall inflation remains an issue. While comparatively low energy prices in the U.S. are making manufactured goods more competitive abroad, there are offsetting downside risks arising from stagnant conditions in other major economies. Fiscal challenges are also increasingly problematic, with many countries facing difficult decisions related to rising debt service, growing entitlements (such as pensions for aging populations), and pressing infrastructure requirements.

Simultaneously, there is potential for technology (especially AI) to reshape international patterns by reducing costs, opening markets, and enabling smaller players. However, optimizing these benefits depends on, among other things, efforts to assure access for emerging countries and stable and predictable trade rules.

Over the long-term horizon, the effects of underlying demographic patterns will further affect overall prospects. As with many nations, U.S. birthrates are falling significantly, and virtually all population gains stem from in-migration. AI is potentially a major factor in dealing with the lack of growth in the numbers of people in prime working age ranges (at least temporarily), but for many essential occupations, hands-on work is essential. The need for sensible immigration policies is clear, as is the need for efforts to encourage labor force participation and productivity.

Even with the current challenges, our analysis of the outlook for the U.S. economy indicates moderate growth, with real gross domestic product expanding at a 2.48% annual rate and a gain of some 79.6 million jobs over the next 30 years. The pace will depend in part on how effectively current issues are dealt with, but the fundamental structure of the national economy remains sound.

Climate change is any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer.

There are a wide variety of factors that influence climate change. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, some of them include reflectivity of the sun’s energy, changes in the earth’s orbit and rotation, volcanic activity, and greenhouse gas emissions.

What Are Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions?

View the City of Lakewood's annual GHG reports.

Greenhouse gases (GHG) in our atmosphere absorb radiant energy from the sun causing the atmosphere to warm and making it suitable for life. Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, add more greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane to the atmosphere. This enhances the greenhouse effect, trapping more heat and causing global temperatures to rise.

Image Description:

Solar energy travels to the Earth at sunlight.

Sunlight hits the Earth and is absorbed, heating the planet.

GHGs in the atmosphere prevent some of the heat from escaping, warming the Earth over time. Continued use of fossil fuels increases the Greenhouse Effect to dangerous levels.

Beginning with the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s, human civilization has increasingly emitted CO2 and other GHGs into the atmosphere. Current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased by 40% from historic levels, corresponding to rising global temperatures. Since 1880, the global annual average temperature has increased by 1.8°F, according to data from the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC). Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Consensus from the world's leading climate scientists estimate that temperatures will increase between 6.7 and 8.4°F by the end of the century. GHG emissions increase and changes to the climate carry the risks of severe and sometimes irreversible impacts to our natural and human systems. In Lakewood, drought, reduced snowpack, strained water supply, disaster recovery costs and other impacts are already influencing municipal operations and household economies.

Tracking GHG Emissions

Lakewood Community Sustainability, Climate, and Zero Waste division works to do our part in reducing GHG emissions and adapting to a changing climate system in order to ensure a resilient future. We measure communitywide emissions through GHG emission inventories. These help us understand where emissions come from and what might be driving their growth is the first step toward reducing our contribution to global GHG emissions.

Lakewood annually reports its GHG emissions and efforts to reduce emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). In 2018, Lakewood joined 43 other cities around the world on the CDP Cities A List, for its leadership in environmental action.

A similar study by conservation group Western Watersheds Project found a steep decline in environmental reviews on grazing land managed by the Forest Service.
When agency staff aren’t monitoring the land, cattle can graze where they’re not supposed to, or in greater numbers or for longer periods than permitted.
Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.
But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.","This story was originally published by ProPublica and co-published with High Country News.

Once every 10 years, ranchers must renew the permits that allow their cattle, sheep and other livestock to graze on the West’s public domain. These renewals are the government’s best opportunity to address how those livestock are harming the environment.

The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service, the federal agencies that manage the majority of public lands, are required by law to review each permit before deciding whether to place additional conditions on it or — in rare cases — to deny its renewal.

But in 2014, Congress mandated that the agencies automatically renew permits for another decade if they are unable to complete the reviews. This exemption has dramatically reduced scrutiny of grazing’s impact on public lands.

In 2013, the BLM approved grazing on 47% of its land open to livestock without an environmental review, a ProPublica and High Country News analysis of agency data showed. (The status of about another 10% of BLM land was unclear that year.) A decade later, the BLM authorized grazing on roughly 75% of its acreage without review, the analysis found.

A similar study by conservation group Western Watersheds Project found a steep decline in environmental reviews on grazing land managed by the Forest Service.

This diminishing oversight has coincided with a sharp drop in the number of federal staff who complete the reviews. These staffers also conduct land health assessments of large parcels to help inform whether permits in the area need changes to protect natural resources.

The BLM’s rangeland management staff shrank 39% between 2020 and 2024, according to Office of Personnel Management data. President Donald Trump’s administration is further hamstringing the BLM — about 1 in 10 rangeland staff members left the agency between last November’s election and June, according to agency records.

When agency staff aren’t monitoring the land, cattle can graze where they’re not supposed to, or in greater numbers or for longer periods than permitted. Such overgrazing can spread invasive plants by dispersing seeds and disturbing the soil, pushing out native species and worsening wildfire risk. When herds strip vegetation near creeks and streams, silt flows into the waterways, wiping out fish nurseries. And, without adequate staff to amend permits, agencies lose the chance to reduce the number of animals on an allotment — and the climate-warming methane they emit.

Once a permit is renewed, with or without a review, it becomes more difficult to rectify such harms for another decade.

Ten current and former BLM rangeland management employees said in interviews that they felt pressure to go easy on ranchers. This included downplaying environmental harm in permit reviews and land health assessments, according to BLM staffers who worked in rangeland management. Several spoke on condition of anonymity because they still work for the government.

“Sometimes the truth was spoken, but, more often than not, it was not the truth,” one BLM employee said of agency oversight.

In a statement, an agency spokesperson said, “The BLM is committed to transparency, sound science, and public participation as it administers grazing permits and considers updates to grazing regulations.”

In a shift, the Trump administration placed the approval process for all the BLM’s contracts and agreements of value in the hands of political appointees rather than career civil servants. In recent months, officials cut funding for an app that assists ranchers in collecting soil and vegetation data for use in permitting, for contractors who manage the data that informs grazing permits, for New Mexico farmers growing seeds used in restoration projects and for soil research in the Southwest, according to BLM records obtained by ProPublica and High Country News.

“Does not believe this action is needed to meet the administration priorities,” the cancellations read.

The Forest Service did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said in a statement, “Ranching is often a multi-generation practice that serves to keep working landscapes intact, while also preserving open space, and benefiting recreation, wildlife, and watersheds.”

To gauge the effects of this shrinking oversight, ProPublica and High Country News toured parcels of federal grazing land, called allotments, in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Nevada, finding evidence of either unpermitted grazing or habitat degraded by livestock in each state. In Arizona alone, reporters witnessed such issues in two national conservation areas, a national monument and a national forest.

On an allotment within Las Cienegas National Conservation Area, an expanse of desert grasslands and forested streams southeast of Tucson, the BLM lets up to 1,500 head of cattle graze across roughly 35,000 acres. These permits were recently reauthorized until 2035 using the exemption that allows environmental reviews to be skipped.

During a visit in late April, a grove of hearty cottonwoods stood against the afternoon sun, casting cool shadows over a narrow creek. This stretch of green sustains birds, frogs, snakes and ocelots. It’s also designated under federal law as critical habitat for five threatened or endangered species. Cattle are not allowed in the creekbed, but a thin barbed-wire fence meant to stop the animals lay crumpled in the dirt.

A native leopard frog broke the hot afternoon stillness as it leapt from the creek’s bank. Its launching pad was the hardened mud imprint of a cow hoof, and it landed with a plop in water fouled by cow feces and the partially submerged bones of a cow corpse. A half-dozen cattle crashed through the creek and up the steep embankment, tearing up plants that protected the soil from erosion and sending silt billowing into the water.

“Looks like a sewer,” Chris Bugbee, a wildlife ecologist with the environmental group the Center for Biological Diversity, remarked as he took in the destruction. “This one hurts. There is no excuse.”

A 2024 BLM land health assessment listed the grazing allotment as “ALL STANDARDS MET.” In April, a camouflaged trail camera bearing the agency’s insignia was pointed toward the creek. (ProPublica and High Country News submitted a public records request for images on the camera’s memory card in May, but the BLM has yet to fulfill the request.)

No ranchers paid to graze their livestock in this allotment last year, according to BLM data, so it is unclear who owned the cattle. The Arizona Cattle Growers’ Association, which represents ranchers in the state, did not respond to requests for comment.

Over the past eight years, Bugbee and his team have annually surveyed grazing impacts on the banks of streams and rivers in the Southwest that are designated as critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act. Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.

The industry maintains that the presence of livestock benefits many ecosystems, pointing to studies that have found, for example, that grazing can increase soil’s ability to hold carbon dioxide that would otherwise contribute to climate change. Other research suggests that, when managed properly, grazing can improve the health of habitat enough to support a more diverse mix of species.

Grazing also reduces vegetation that could fuel wildfires. Frank Shirts Jr., owner of the largest sheep operation on Forest Service land, said that sheep eat invasive weeds and brush, creating firebreaks. “These animals are fantastic,” he said.

Retta Bruegger, a range ecologist at Colorado State University, said that some ecosystems, especially those that receive more precipitation, can withstand more intense grazing without permanently damaging the land. In regions where plants evolved over many years alongside large grazers like cattle, livestock can “provide a very important ecosystem function.”

“We should be asking, ‘Are there individual producers who need to be doing a better job?’ instead of asking, ‘Should there be grazing or no grazing?’” said Bruegger, who supports balancing the industry’s needs with the land’s.

But answering those questions, she said, would require adequate staff to monitor the land.

Rubber stamping

After a century of intense grazing wore down public lands, a court ruled in 1974 that grazing permits were subject to environmental reviews, and Congress passed a law two years later mandating them every decade.

For years, a backlog of permit reviews grew, as federal land management agencies lacked the staff to inspect all their territory — 240 million acres across BLM and Forest Service jurisdictions. Around 2000, Congress began giving temporary approval for regulators to skip reviews. Western Republicans, with the livestock industry’s support, pushed to enshrine the concept in law. The idea ultimately received bipartisan approval in December 2014, after being slipped into a must-pass defense spending bill.

Some conservationists now call it simply “the loophole.”

Many in the livestock industry lambaste the lack of reviews. When permits are automatically renewed, the law does not allow the terms to change, so ranchers are prevented from updating their grazing practices.

“It just locks people into grazing the same place, the same time, year after year,” said Chris Jasmine, manager of biodiversity and rangelands for Nevada Gold Mines, which owns 11 ranches in northern Nevada.

To help inform permit renewals, teams of BLM experts — rangeland specialists, hydrologists, botanists, soil scientists and wildlife biologists — assess the health of grazing allotments.

When the process is working as intended, these assessments are considered in permit reviews. But the current lack of staff has left large swaths of land without scrutiny.

All told, the BLM oversees 155 million acres of public lands available for grazing. But the agency has no record of completing land health assessments for more than 35 million acres, nearly a quarter of its total.

Where the BLM has conducted such assessments, it found grazing had degraded at least 38 million acres, an area about half the size of New Mexico. And close to two-thirds of the land it listed as being in good shape had not been checked in more than a decade, the analysis found.

The situation, though, is even worse than those numbers indicate, as the agency has often skipped permit reviews on land in poor condition. Even if the BLM had previously found the environment to be in bad shape, Congress’ 2014 law still dictated automatic renewal. Of the acreage the agency had previously found to be degraded due to livestock, 82% was reauthorized for grazing without a review, according to ProPublica and High Country News’ analysis.

Several BLM employees said agency higher-ups instruct staff to study land that’s in better condition while avoiding allotments that are in worse shape or more controversial. Environmental groups such as the Western Watersheds Project as well as local stockmen’s associations are quick to litigate changes to permits. Automatic renewals avoid these drawn-out public fights. “We were just using a bureaucratic loophole,” one staffer said. “We were allowing ongoing degradation of habitat.”

“This can’t be the future of public lands,” Bugbee, with the Center for Biological Diversity, said of parcels degraded by cattle, likening the land to a “mowed lawn.”

Agency staff pointed to myriad reasons why the environment is suffering.

For example, after a wildfire, the BLM aims to keep livestock off the land for two years to allow the ecosystem to recover. But ranchers often negotiate an earlier return to the public pastures where their livestock graze, said Steve Ellis, who spent his career with the BLM and Forest Service, rising to high-level positions in both.

“There was always pressure to get back on,” Ellis said. “That’s not a new thing. It’s just part of working for the bureau.”

The government’s support for ranchers can add to the damage. Land management agencies sometimes seed invasive grasses, which can benefit livestock, although those plants can drive out species that are native to the local ecosystem. And state and federal agencies kill predators such as wolves and cougars — also integral to a healthy balance of species — to protect ranchers’ economic interests.

Some staff members also question the agency’s oversight.

BLM employees said that in some permit reviews and land health assessments, rank-and-file staff noted the presence of threatened and endangered species, which would have triggered tighter environmental controls, only for agency managers to delete that information from their reports.

One current BLM staffer called the reviews “rubber stamping” and said higher-ranking staff who controlled the text of reports “wouldn’t let me stick anything into the official documentation that acknowledged things were in poor shape.”

Another complicating factor, according to BLM staff, is that ranchers are often invited to participate in fieldwork to gauge whether they are overgrazing. The results, employees said, were watered-down reviews and assessments.

The industry, though, is critical of the assessment process for other reasons. Erin Spaur, executive vice president of the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association, said it’s an inflexible “one-size-fits-all approach” that doesn’t sufficiently account for differences in ecosystems.

“There are huge cultural problems within the agency,” said Dennis Willis, who spent more than three decades with the BLM, including managing rangeland, adding that “there’s a real fear of dealing with grazing problems.”

Flexibility and collaboration

Some ranchers acknowledge the environmental impacts of their industry. But they say that more flexibility — not stricter oversight — would make them better stewards of the land.

Jasmine, with Nevada Gold Mines, contends that ranching can be done without denuding the West. A sixth-generation Nevadan, he oversees the mining company’s ranching operations, which run about 5,000 head of cattle.

On a sunny July day near Carlin, Nevada, Jasmine walked through chest-high vegetation to show off the recovery of Maggie Creek, a tributary to the Humboldt River that flows through a checkerboard of public and private lands. Photographs from the 1980s show barren ground around the shallow creek. When ranchers changed how they rotated their herds in the 1990s to give the streambed more rest, the land bounced back, Jasmine said, as a chorus of chirping birds punctuated his story. He credited a BLM biologist with initiating many of the projects that helped revive Maggie Creek.

“It’s a renewable resource. That grass that they’re eating right now will come back next year and the year after that if managed properly,” he said. “It’s about not eating the same plants in the same place year after year after year.”

Jasmine touted the company’s goal of protecting locally important species, its sage grouse restoration projects and its partnership with the BLM, which targeted grazing to remove unwanted vegetation and create a firebreak.

But Nevada Gold Mines — a joint venture between two companies with a combined value of around $150 billion — operates in a different economic reality than most ranchers and can afford to keep cattle off the land long enough for it to recover.

Smaller ranchers face slim profit margins, making it attractive to heavily graze federal lands, where the cost is much lower than on state or private land.

For years, some politicians and environmental groups have proposed protecting degraded or sensitive habitats by paying ranchers to retire their permits, making the areas off limits to grazing and preserving the land as wildlife habitat. Ranchers have occasionally taken these offers. But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.

In October, U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, introduced a bill to further voluntary retirement, calling it “a pragmatic solution that supports local economies, protects biodiversity, and saves taxpayer dollars by reducing the cost of administering grazing programs.”

Louis Wertz, a spokesperson for the Western Landowners Alliance, said that the conservation-minded ranchers who make up his group want to both stay in business and “live in a place that is vibrant, full of life, provides clean water, has clean air.” But when it comes to food production, he added, “the expectations we have of both being environmentally harmless and healthy and cheap are untenable. Over the last 150 years in the United States, we have chosen cheapness at the expense of environmental quality.”

Like Jasmine, Wertz said that understaffing at the BLM and Forest Service deprives ranchers of an opportunity to change how they manage their herds, even when they want to.

“It is important that there be accountability for producers on the landscape,” Wertz said, but there should also be “flexibility so producers can be economically successful and so they can do what is right for the landscape.”",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/250429_HCN_6990_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:00:47.498644

Natural gas usage must diminish over time, so that renewable clean electricity comprises the dominant energy source, not the subordinate one.
This situation has created a market that is heavily tilted in favor of fossil fuels, a serious disadvantage for clean energy generation and storage.
This is not a free market, and creates mismatched choices for consumers who desire lower cost clean energy.
We must open the doors to more opportunities for clean electricity, storage and resilient systems installations across our communities.","The good people of Connecticut do deserve clean affordable electricity. The recent commentary is correct in saying that demand for energy is not going away. In fact, it is increasing with the prevalence of data centers and growth within our cities. Natural gas is touted as reliable, on-demand energy. This is true. But it is also a fossil fuel that produces (with increased use) greater amounts of greenhouse gases, which accelerates climate change, impacts our health and environment, and slows the transition to a truly clean energy future.

So, to recognize the simple truth that if our society wants a clean and cost-effective electricity, we must move towards clean energy sources. These include solar, wind, geo-exchange and use of battery storage, heat pumps, passive construction and other innovations. Electricity generation in Connecticut is sourced from natural gas: 60.7%. Nuclear, 33.9%, renewables, 4.3%; according to the Energy Information Administration. Renewables are just a footnote. Natural gas usage must diminish over time, so that renewable clean electricity comprises the dominant energy source, not the subordinate one.

Fossil fuels for the great majority of our energy history have been more heavily subsidized than renewables. They have received approximately nine times more subsidies than renewables. Starting in about 2016 subsidies for renewables began to increase annually towards those levels of fossil fuels. With the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 subsidies for renewables increases significantly. Those, however, are being dismantled by the current administration.

In the 2025 spending bill, the administration added nearly $40 billion in new federal subsidies for fossil fuels over the next decade. This is on top of the pre-existing $30.8 billion annual subsidies for fossil fuels. Additionally, the fossil fuel industry benefits from increasingly lax regulations on pollution from natural gas and other fossil fuels, freeing them up from responsibility from the negative health and environmental impacts to our citizens. Not having to pay for these impacts is called “implicit subsidies” and total an estimated $62 billion annually. This situation has created a market that is heavily tilted in favor of fossil fuels, a serious disadvantage for clean energy generation and storage. This is not a free market, and creates mismatched choices for consumers who desire lower cost clean energy. The decades of large subsidies for fossil fuels helped build out necessary infrastructure, a situation not wholly available to the renewable clean electricity sector because of historic subsidies.

Due to these disparities in subsidies, many have promoted fair market pricing of carbon emissions (a carbon tax) on fossil fuels, and pairing that with a cash-back for citizens to receive those collected funds to offset pricing fluctuations during the transition towards clean electricity. According to The Wall Street Journal, 3,649 economists support pricing carbon.

The argument for using natural gas because it “provides crucial backup to intermittent resources” is a false leader. Currently natural gas is the dominant fuel for electricity generation, not a backup fuel. Promoting more natural gas impedes innovation to generation and storage systems that can address spikes in demand. ISO New England notes that behind-the-meter solar has helped manage peak energy needs, especially during summer heat waves. Therefore, rather than spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new natural gas infrastructure and power plants, the money would be better spent modernizing the grid with clean electricity generation systems. Natural gas is not more flexible than clean renewables when paired with battery storage and other innovations. Stepping back to natural gas is a step backward for our energy systems.

The Department of Energy notes that 67% of natural gas pumped from the ground in the U.S. is from fracked resources, of which there are over one million wells. Fracking impacts water quality in aquifers and utilizes chemical mixtures containing carcinogenic compounds impacting the environment and human health. Reducing exposure from these practices and pollutants is a sound environmental move.

Legislation is critical in balancing state and national energy policies. For Connecticut, Public Act No. 25-125 states "" ... state agencies shall have the goal of only utilizing zero-carbon generating electricity by 2030.” It also says, “The state shall reduce the level of emissions of greenhouse gas ... not later than January 1, 2030, to a level at least forty-five per cent below the level emitted in 2001.” And by January 1, 2050, Connecticut must – by law – provide an eighty per cent reduction in GHGs compared to 2001. Connecticut will not achieve these mandated goals if we expand the use of natural gas and other fossil fuels, and in doing so will break the law.

None of our energy sources is “the enemy."" It is about using our technological advancements to bring lower cost and clean electricity to Connecticut. Three generations ago, natural gas was pegged as a “bridge fuel."" That bridge is now being extended to unfair lengths, and future generations will ask why we didn’t fix this now rather than put the burden upon them. Renewable systems offer greater energy security, more jobs, long-term affordability and a healthier environment for people. We must open the doors to more opportunities for clean electricity, storage and resilient systems installations across our communities.",http://d3gouztkx1c1lh.cloudfront.net/360_TheDay_Live/0/0/0/0/766/789/766789_original,N,,2025-12-06 14:01:09.468702

The continent is considering combining clean hydrogen production with synthetic fuels to power heavy transport. For this mission, turquoise hydrogen is all the more essential. This is a form of low-carbon hydrogen that gets produced without any CO₂ emissions.

Where does methanol come into the equation?

The fact that turquoise hydrogen exists is not what Europe is most interested in. For European developers, the best part is the ability to use this clean hydrogen to produce 150,000 tonnes of methanol per year, which is a core fuel for the decarbonization era. This fuel will be of utmost importance in the shipping industry.

The reason why hydrogen will be used to produce methanol is that hydrogen is rather difficult to transport and store. Methanol, on the other hand, is a liquid that is compatible with existing storage tanks, making it far easier to ship. Another exciting feature is that e-methanol is one of the most promising marine fuels. E-methanol is basically methanol produced using low-carbon hydrogen and captured CO₂.

A British-based project at the forefront of the turquoise hydrogen endeavor

Hilroc, the British-based company, is taking the lead in terms of getting Europe to produce methanol from turquoise hydrogen. The firm will build a turquoise hydrogen facility in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, that is integrated with the energy-from-waste plant that is being developed by Agile Energy. In turn, a 150,000-tonnes-per-year e-methanol plant will be constructed.

This integration model will process about 200,000 tonnes of municipal and industrial waste each year. The whole idea is not to release carbon into the atmosphere but to amalgamate the captured carbon with Hiroc’s turquoise hydrogen to ensure that a circular carbon system is created. In this way, low-carbon methanol is produced, and this methanol fully resonates with Europe’s net-zero emissions ambition.

Thermal Plasma Electrolysis (TPE) will be relied upon to split methane to yield hydrogen and solid carbon. Thermal Plasma Electrolysis aligns with the UK’s Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard.

What Europe hopes for when it comes to methanol production?

In Europe, there is a strong demand for methanol as it is seen as the most lucrative replacement for diesel in the maritime industry. Europe has high hopes of producing at least 150,000 tons at the Scottish site, making the site one of the largest e-methanol facilities in Europe.

The advantage of methanol is rather apparent since it is easy to store and blend. Another advantage of this project is that waste will be used as feedstock, and thus, CO₂ emissions will be captured for synthetic fuel production. In the process, the facility will reduce landfill pressure while displacing fossil fuels that are commonly used in the marine industry. Europe is set on its mission to get rid of CO₂ emissions completely and has already answered the question, what to do with Earth’s CO₂. The continent has decided to bury it with 10 million tons disappearing. The continent has recently discovered that carbon capture is the missing piece that may have been the answer we all have been looking for.

Europe is geared for a clean fuel future

This Inverurie project will be rather valuable for Europe’s renewable energy future, and it will signify a huge turning point should all go well with the plans for the hydrogen to methanol value chain. Turquoise hydrogen has the potential to unlock long-term decarbonization. The truth is that 150,000 tons is only the start of a clean fuel future for Europe. With Europe going green at a desperate speed, we can only anticipate what will come next.

Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since federal tax credits ended on Sept. 30.

In November, EVs accounted for 5.3 percent of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales, a share that was less than half the record high in September, according to an estimate published last week by S&P Global Mobility.

The numbers were especially ugly on Tuesday when several automakers released their November figures. Ford said that unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49 percent compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59 percent. I could go on.

But most industry analysts are not sounding an alarm. This is because the decline in sales was expected the moment in July that President Donald Trump signed the legislation that canceled the credit, which was up to $7,500 per vehicle. The law led to months of chaos, during which many consumers accelerated their purchasing decisions to qualify for the credit, contributing to the collapse that followed.

One of the main questions going forward is how long it will take for the market to return to some kind of normalcy. The most common answer I’m seeing is that the current shakeout will likely last well into 2026.

After that, we’ll get to the more important question: What happens next? To help figure this out, I spoke with Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, a research nonprofit with offices around the globe.

Researchers use different methods to calculate the total cost of ownership, making this a challenging metric to agree on. (Car and Driver published an overview this summer of the factors to watch.)

But there is little debate that the costs of EVs will continue to decrease, even with cuts to subsidies.

Automakers, who think in decade-plus time horizons, can see the way things are going. Each company is making strategic choices about how much to maintain gasoline and hybrid vehicle lineups, even as they know electric drivetrains will dominate the long-term future.

“We think this transition is inevitable, and the automakers that can [best navigate] this transition are the ones that are likely to win the race,” Slowik said. “They stand to win big, both at home, in terms of their domestic manufacturing volumes, and their sales shares relative to other automakers, but then also abroad.”

ICCT is a useful resource for understanding this moment. For starters, check out a Nov. 17 blog post that offers data-backed commentary on U.S. policy.

Any attempt to make predictions carries risk. If you’d asked me a year ago, I would not have guessed that Trump would be able to pass a repeal of the EV tax credits.

The credits largely benefited U.S.-based companies such as Tesla, Ford and General Motors, helping them gain a competitive edge over models assembled in other countries that were not eligible.

It didn’t make sense to remove the tax credits—and do so with such suddenness—except for the odd political reality of this year and the way the debate in Congress was dominated by fiscal hardliners.

But the push and pull of adding or subtracting subsidies will ultimately matter less than larger factors, such as the long-term decline in battery costs and the increase in battery efficiency.

In the meantime, the rough sales numbers are going to continue. Let’s reconvene next year at this time and we’ll have a better sense of what the recovery looks like.

The HVAC industry says furnaces can last up to 30 years, but the average is 15 to 20 years before the system fails. And that never happens on a sunny spring day.

Before it does, it might be useful to have a plan on what to replace it with, taking into account cost, performance and environmental impact.

Which costs more to buy: a gas or electric furnace?

About 24% of homes in North Carolina use natural gas for heating, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

If yours is one, you already have the gas line and connection, which means your up-front cost to install a new gas furnace would be lower compared to someone who doesn’t have that infrastructure.

A gas furnace itself can cost $3,000 to $8,000, according to industry estimates, which can be as much as twice the purchase price of an electric furnace.

Is a gas or electric furnace cheaper to run?

Operating costs typically run lower for gas furnaces because gas, at the moment, is less expensive than electricity when used for heating. Gas prices do fluctuate and Duke Energy currently has a request for an electric rate hike on the table.

The nonpartisan but pro-natural-gas-industry group Consumer Energy Alliance says operating costs for gas appliances are significantly lower than electric heating sources.

Technologies for both gas and electric heat likely have improved since your system was installed, and depending on efficiency upgrades, it may be worth replacing your unit even before it dies.

The Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill has truncated generous tax credits designed to encourage homeowners to invest in more efficient heat pumps, water heaters and other energy-saving devices. Those credits include up to $2,000 on qualified heat pumps, which can both heat and cool a home, but they’re now set to expire Dec. 31, 2025.

Is a gas or electric furnace better for the environment?

Manufacturing oversupply scenarios present systemic risks that extend beyond simple capacity-demand imbalances. In renewable energy sectors experiencing rapid expansion, the convergence of policy-driven scaling, international trade tensions, and infrastructure constraints creates complex vulnerability patterns that challenge traditional market stabilisation mechanisms. These dynamics become particularly pronounced when domestic industrial development objectives intersect with global competitive pressures and technological dependencies, as demonstrated by India's solar buildout oversupply warning.

The emergence of manufacturing capacity bubbles in strategic industries reflects deeper structural challenges in coordinating industrial policy with market fundamentals. When government incentive programmes successfully mobilise private capital without corresponding demand coordination mechanisms, the resulting oversupply can threaten the long-term viability of the very industries these policies aim to develop.

How India's Solar Buildout Oversupply Warning Exposes Manufacturing Strategy Gaps

India's photovoltaic manufacturing sector demonstrates how rapid scaling can create structural imbalances that threaten industry sustainability. The Production-Linked Incentive framework has generated manufacturing capabilities exceeding 100 GW annually, while domestic consumption patterns suggest absorption capacity closer to 35-40 GW per year. This threefold capacity surplus represents one of the most significant oversupply situations in global renewable energy manufacturing.

Furthermore, the development has broader implications for the global energy transition minerals supply chain, as manufacturing oversupply in one region can disrupt pricing and investment patterns across international markets.

Manufacturing Capacity Expansion Dynamics

The PLI scheme's success in mobilising industrial investment has created a complex web of manufacturing facilities across multiple value chain segments. Module assembly capabilities have expanded most rapidly, with over 15 GW of operational capacity established within 24 months of policy implementation. Cell manufacturing has grown more gradually, reaching approximately 8 GW of capacity, while upstream wafer and ingot production remains limited at under 3 GW.

Key Manufacturing Metrics:

Total awarded PLI capacity: 45+ GW across all production stages

Operational module assembly: 15+ GW as of late 2024

Cell production capacity: 8 GW operational

Ingot-wafer capacity: Under 3 GW operational

Projected 2025 total capacity: 100+ GW annually

This capacity distribution reveals the challenges of building integrated domestic supply chains. Most manufacturers have focused on final assembly operations, which require lower capital investment and technical expertise compared to upstream silicon processing. However, this approach perpetuates dependence on imported cells and wafers, creating vulnerability to supply chain disruptions and trade policy changes.

Inventory Accumulation Patterns

Industry inventory levels have reached critical thresholds that indicate fundamental demand-supply misalignment. Excess inventory has grown from approximately 10 GW in early 2024 to over 20 GW by year-end, with projections suggesting continued accumulation through 2025. This inventory buildup represents significant working capital constraints for manufacturers and potential price deflation pressures.

The inventory crisis reflects multiple factors beyond simple overcapacity. Installation project delays due to grid infrastructure constraints, land acquisition challenges, and financing bottlenecks have reduced actual solar deployment below planned levels. Additionally, quality certification requirements and performance testing delays have slowed the conversion of manufacturing output into deployed capacity.

What Financial and Trade Pressures Are Reshaping Market Dynamics

Export Market Deterioration

International market access has become increasingly constrained for Indian solar manufacturers. The United States, previously a major destination for Indian solar exports, has implemented comprehensive trade measures targeting modules suspected of containing Chinese-origin components. These measures include both tariff barriers and supply chain verification requirements that have effectively reduced export competitiveness.

Trade Impact Analysis:

U.S. tariff rates: 50% on modules with Chinese components

Export volume decline: Over 50% in first half of 2025

Alternative market development: Limited progress in Southeast Asia and Africa

Supply chain verification costs: 2-3% of module value

The tariff impact analysis shows these trade restrictions extend beyond direct tariff costs. Supply chain documentation and verification requirements have created administrative burdens that small and medium manufacturers struggle to manage. Larger manufacturers with integrated operations face different challenges, as vertical integration requirements conflict with cost optimisation strategies that rely on global component sourcing.

Cost Competitiveness Challenges

Manufacturing cost structures remain a fundamental barrier to sustainable market development. Indian-assembled modules using imported cells carry cost premiums of approximately 3-5 cents per watt compared to direct Chinese imports. Fully integrated Indian manufacturing shows even larger cost disadvantages, with premiums potentially exceeding 10 cents per watt in some market segments.

Cost Structure Breakdown:

Raw material costs: 60-65% of total manufacturing cost

Labour and overhead: 15-20% of total cost

Capital equipment amortisation: 10-15% of total cost

Working capital financing: 5-8% of total cost

These cost disadvantages stem from multiple sources. Scale efficiencies remain limited compared to Chinese manufacturers operating gigawatt-scale facilities. Technology licensing costs add additional burdens, as most advanced cell technologies require royalty payments to international patent holders. Energy costs, while declining, remain higher than in major manufacturing centres like China and Vietnam.

Banking Sector Risk Assessment

Financial institutions have begun implementing enhanced due diligence for solar manufacturing loan applications. The Ministry of Finance has reportedly issued guidance recommending careful evaluation of standalone manufacturing projects that lack vertical integration or established off-take agreements. This represents the first formal acknowledgement of oversupply risks at the policy level.

Financial Risk Indicators:

Debt service coverage ratios below 1.2x

Export revenue concentration exceeding 60% in single markets

Working capital cycles extending beyond 120 days

Dependence on PLI incentives for positive margins

Why Vertical Integration Becomes Strategic Priority

Government Policy Recalibration

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has shifted policy emphasis toward supporting integrated manufacturing facilities capable of producing components across multiple value chain stages. This policy evolution reflects recognition that standalone assembly operations provide limited strategic value and remain vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.

Priority support now focuses on facilities demonstrating capabilities in polysilicon production, wafer manufacturing, cell fabrication, and module assembly. This integrated approach aims to reduce import dependence while creating more resilient domestic production networks. However, the capital requirements for truly integrated facilities exceed $1 billion per gigawatt of capacity.

This shift aligns with India's lithium supply strategy, which emphasises building comprehensive supply chains for critical materials rather than relying on single-stage processing operations.

Supply Chain Security Versus Economic Efficiency

The strategic trade-offs between supply chain security and economic efficiency have become central to policy debates. Achieving meaningful import substitution requires accepting higher production costs and consumer prices in exchange for reduced dependence on Chinese supply chains. This trade-off becomes particularly challenging when global solar prices continue declining due to Chinese oversupply.

Strategic Integration Benefits:

Reduced import dependence from 85% to under 30%

Enhanced supply chain resilience during trade disruptions

Technology transfer and domestic innovation capabilities

Employment creation across skill levels

Economic Integration Costs:

Capital requirements 3-4x higher than assembly operations

Operating cost premiums of 15-25% over Chinese alternatives

Extended payback periods requiring patient capital

Technical risks in scaling advanced manufacturing processes

How Grid Infrastructure Constraints Compound Oversupply Issues

Generation Capacity Versus Grid Absorption

India's power grid faces mounting challenges absorbing rapidly expanding solar generation capacity. Several states have experienced grid curtailment events where solar power plants are required to reduce output due to transmission constraints or grid stability concerns. These curtailment incidents threaten project economics and potentially slow future solar deployment growth.

Grid Integration Challenges:

Transmission capacity constraints in high-solar regions

Grid balancing requirements during peak generation periods

Frequency stability challenges during cloud cover transitions

Regional demand-supply mismatches requiring enhanced transmission

The duck curve phenomenon, where solar generation peaks at midday but demand peaks occur during morning and evening periods, requires substantial grid infrastructure investments. Energy storage systems, advanced forecasting capabilities, and flexible generation resources become essential for maintaining grid stability as solar penetration increases.

Infrastructure Investment Requirements

Grid modernisation needs extend far beyond simple transmission capacity expansion. Advanced grid management systems capable of handling variable renewable generation require sophisticated control technologies and real-time monitoring capabilities. These systems must coordinate multiple generation sources while maintaining frequency and voltage stability across the network.

Infrastructure Investment Priorities:

Category Investment Need Timeline Transmission Lines $15-20 billion 2025-2030 Grid Storage $8-12 billion 2025-2028 Control Systems $3-5 billion 2025-2027 Distribution Upgrades $10-15 billion 2025-2032

Energy storage requirements alone represent massive capital demands. Battery storage systems capable of providing 4-6 hours of backup during peak demand periods require investments of $200-300 per kWh of capacity. At projected solar deployment scales, total storage needs could exceed 50 GWh by 2030.

What Strategic Scenarios Could Reshape Industry Structure

Market Consolidation Pathway

Oversupply pressures create conditions favouring industry consolidation, where financially stronger manufacturers acquire distressed assets at reduced valuations. This consolidation process could ultimately create more efficient and competitive domestic manufacturing capabilities, though the transition period involves significant financial losses for early investors.

Historical precedent from Chinese solar manufacturing suggests consolidation phases typically eliminate 60-70% of initial market participants over 3-5 year periods. Surviving manufacturers benefit from improved economies of scale and reduced competitive pressures, but the consolidation process requires substantial working capital to weather extended periods of negative cash flow.

Consolidation Indicators:

Module prices declining 20-30% annually

Manufacturer margin compression below 5%

Working capital cycles extending beyond 150 days

Debt restructuring requests from 30%+ of industry participants

Export Diversification Strategy

Alternative export markets in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America offer potential absorption capacity for Indian solar manufacturing output. However, market development in these regions requires different competitive strategies, including adapted product specifications, local partnership development, and patient market development investments.

Southeast Asian markets, particularly Vietnam, Thailand, and Philippines, show strong solar deployment growth but prefer established technology providers with proven track records. African markets offer longer-term potential but require development financing solutions and local capacity building investments. Latin American markets show price sensitivity that challenges Indian cost structures.

Export Market Potential Analysis:

Region Annual Market Size Growth Rate Competitive Position Southeast Asia 8-12 GW 15-20% Moderate barriers Africa 3-5 GW 25-30% Low competition Latin America 6-10 GW 12-18% High price sensitivity Middle East 4-8 GW 10-15% Quality requirements

Policy Intervention Scenarios

Government intervention through enhanced domestic demand creation, strategic export financing, or capacity rationalisation programmes could help stabilise market conditions. Demand support measures might include accelerated auction schedules, rooftop solar incentives, or industrial captive power requirements mandating domestic content.

Export financing mechanisms could include concessional credit facilities, export credit guarantees, or bilateral trade agreements that provide preferential access to emerging markets. Capacity rationalisation might involve production quotas, minimum efficiency standards, or consolidation incentives that encourage voluntary market exits.

How Market Participants Should Navigate Transition Risks

Investment Risk Assessment Framework

Investors require sophisticated risk assessment capabilities to distinguish viable manufacturers from those facing fundamental viability challenges. Financial metrics alone prove insufficient, as PLI incentives can mask underlying cost structure problems for extended periods.

High-Risk Characteristics:

Standalone module assembly without upstream integration

Export revenue concentration exceeding 70% in restricted markets

Operating margins dependent on PLI incentives for profitability

Debt service coverage ratios below 1.1x during peak production periods

Lower-Risk Investment Profiles:

Vertical integration spanning at least three value chain stages

Domestic market focus with established utility relationships

Cost structures within 10-15% of Chinese benchmarks

Technology partnerships providing ongoing innovation access

Strategic Response Options

Manufacturers face difficult strategic choices regarding capacity utilisation, market positioning, and technology development. Capacity reduction decisions require careful timing to avoid stranded asset losses while maintaining market position for eventual recovery. Market repositioning toward higher-value applications or specialised technologies offers differentiation opportunities but requires substantial R&D investments.

Manufacturer Strategy Matrix:

Market Position Recommended Actions Success Probability Integrated Players Maintain capacity, focus on cost reduction Moderate-High Assembly Focus Seek partnerships or consolidation Low-Moderate Technology Leaders Develop premium segments Moderate Export Dependent Diversify markets rapidly Low

Technology development becomes increasingly important as commodity manufacturing margins compress. Manufacturers investing in next-generation cell technologies, specialised applications like agrivoltaics, or energy storage integration may achieve differentiation that supports premium pricing. However, these strategies require sustained R&D spending during periods of cash flow pressure.

Policy Response Recommendations

Effective policy responses require coordination across multiple government agencies to address manufacturing oversupply while supporting broader renewable energy deployment objectives. Manufacturing policy should prioritise integrated facilities over standalone capacity additions, while demand policy should accelerate grid infrastructure development and energy storage deployment.

Policy Coordination Framework:

Manufacturing incentives linked to domestic content utilisation

Grid investment acceleration through infrastructure bonds

Export credit facilities for alternative market development

Technology development support for next-generation applications

Financial sector guidance should establish clear risk assessment standards that prevent speculative capacity additions while supporting viable manufacturing operations. This requires sophisticated evaluation criteria that consider long-term competitiveness rather than short-term PLI eligibility.

What Long-Term Implications Shape India's Energy Transition

Balancing Industrial Development With Market Sustainability

India's solar buildout oversupply warning represents a critical test of industrial policy effectiveness in emerging economies pursuing renewable energy manufacturing capabilities. The challenge lies in maintaining momentum toward energy security and manufacturing development objectives while preventing boom-bust cycles that threaten long-term industry viability.

Successful navigation of this transition requires accepting short-term capacity adjustments and financial losses in exchange for sustainable long-term industry development. This process involves difficult political choices, as capacity rationalisation affects employment and regional development objectives that motivated initial policy support.

In addition, developments like India's lithium refinery initiatives demonstrate the interconnected nature of clean energy supply chains, where oversupply in one segment can affect investment decisions across related industries.

Global Supply Chain Implications

Despite current challenges, India's solar manufacturing development positions the country as a potential alternative to China-dominated global supply chains. Success in managing the current oversupply crisis could establish India as a major participant in the global clean energy economy, supporting both domestic energy security and international climate objectives.

The strategic value of alternative supply chains extends beyond economic considerations to include energy security and geopolitical resilience. European and American markets increasingly seek supply chain diversification options that reduce dependence on single-country sources, creating opportunities for Indian manufacturers that achieve cost competitiveness.

Moreover, trade war market effects continue to reshape global manufacturing strategies, potentially creating long-term advantages for Indian manufacturers who successfully navigate the current transition period.

Technology Development Pathways

Long-term success requires progression from assembly operations toward higher-value manufacturing and technology development capabilities. This evolution demands sustained investments in R&D, workforce development, and technology partnerships that enable participation in next-generation solar technologies.

Technology Advancement Priorities:

Next-generation cell efficiency improvements (25%+ efficiency targets)

Specialised applications including floating solar and agrivoltaics

Energy storage integration and smart solar solutions

Manufacturing automation and quality control systems

The current crisis creates opportunities for strategic technology partnerships with international leaders seeking manufacturing diversification. According to industry analysis, these partnerships could accelerate Indian capabilities while providing technology transfer that supports long-term competitiveness.

Furthermore, India's solar buildout oversupply warning serves as a crucial inflection point for the global renewable energy industry, demonstrating how rapid policy-driven scaling must be balanced with market fundamentals to ensure sustainable growth in critical clean energy technologies.

Additionally, analysis from France's industrial lithium development prospects provides valuable context for understanding the broader implications of the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project initiative.","The Strategic Imperative Behind EU Battery Material Sovereignty

Battery manufacturing across Europe currently relies almost entirely on lithium sourced from nations thousands of miles away. This dependency creates vulnerability in supply chains that power everything from electric vehicles to renewable energy storage systems. As global competition intensifies for critical minerals, European policymakers are crafting frameworks that could fundamentally alter how lithium flows through international markets. The Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project represents a pivotal development in this evolving landscape.

The continent's approach to mineral security extends beyond simple trade policies. It represents a comprehensive strategy to establish domestic production capabilities that can withstand geopolitical disruptions while maintaining competitive pricing structures. Understanding how these evolving policies will reshape investment patterns and extraction technologies provides crucial insight into the future of European industrial competitiveness.

European content requirements for lithium represent a graduated approach to reducing import dependency. The proposed framework calls for 20% of lithium used in electric vehicle batteries to originate from EU sources by 2031, with this requirement escalating to 40% by 2036. This timeline provides manufacturers with sufficient lead time to establish supply relationships while giving domestic projects clear market incentives.

The economic rationale behind these thresholds reflects careful analysis of production capacity constraints and capital deployment timelines. Industrial leaders suggest that mandatory content requirements would create ""marginal impact"" on vehicle pricing, though specific cost analyses remain proprietary. This positions regulatory certainty as a prerequisite for attracting the multi-billion euro investments required to establish European lithium production.

Current global lithium trade patterns show Europe sourcing virtually all battery-grade materials from Australia, Chile, and Chinese processing facilities. The Critical Raw Materials Act designates lithium as both a ""critical raw material"" and ""strategic raw material,"" establishing the legal foundation for content mandates similar to those used in automotive manufacturing under trade agreements like USMCA.

Economic Impact Assessment on European Vehicle Manufacturing

The financial implications of domestic content requirements extend beyond simple material costs. European automakers must balance supply chain security against production economics, particularly as lithium prices experience significant volatility. Manufacturing executives emphasize that regulatory frameworks providing long-term certainty enable more accurate capital allocation decisions than volatile spot market pricing.

Industry analysis suggests that lithium hydroxide, the preferred battery-grade material, commands premium pricing over lithium carbonate due to superior chemical purity requirements. European projects targeting hydroxide production position themselves to capture these price premiums while meeting stringent battery chemistry specifications demanded by automotive manufacturers.

The competitive positioning against Asian battery suppliers involves complex calculations beyond raw material costs. European operations must account for higher labour costs, environmental compliance requirements, and novel extraction technologies. However, proximity to vehicle manufacturing facilities reduces transportation costs and supply chain complexity, creating offsetting economic advantages.

What Makes European Lithium Projects Economically Viable Under New Regulations?

Investment Framework Analysis for Multi-Billion Euro Projects

European lithium development requires unprecedented capital commitments for the continent's mineral sector. Imerys' French project represents a €1.8 billion investment targeting integrated mining and refining operations, while Vulcan Energy Resources secured A$3.9 billion financing for its German geothermal extraction facility. These investment scales demonstrate institutional confidence in European lithium demand despite current market oversupply conditions.

The capital intensity of European projects exceeds established operations in Australia and Chile due to several factors. Furthermore, novel extraction methodologies require advanced engineering solutions, while stringent environmental compliance frameworks mandate additional infrastructure. Additionally, higher regional labour and construction costs compare unfavourably to established mining jurisdictions, necessitating integration with renewable energy systems for sustainable production profiles.

Risk assessment models for these investments incorporate regulatory certainty as a fundamental variable. Alessandro Dazza of Imerys emphasised that ""investors need a clear framework"" to commit capital at this scale, suggesting that the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project may paradoxically reduce financial risk by guaranteeing future demand.

Production Economics and Market Positioning

Target production specifications reveal the scale of European ambitions. The Imerys French operation aims to produce 34,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide annually, sufficient to support battery manufacturing for approximately 700,000 electric vehicles per year. This capacity represents a significant portion of European EV production targets while maintaining flexibility for export markets.

Lithium hydroxide production offers strategic advantages over lithium carbonate for battery applications. The hydroxide form provides superior thermal stability and chemical purity required for high-performance lithium-ion cells. This technical differentiation typically commands 15-25% price premiums over carbonate equivalents, improving project economics despite higher production costs.

Financial structuring approaches vary significantly across European projects. Imerys pursues minority stake sales to share development risks, while Vulcan Energy leverages public market financing through ASX listing. These diverse capital structures reflect different risk tolerance levels and strategic partnerships with automotive manufacturers or battery producers.

How Do Permitting Delays Impact European Critical Mineral Independence?

Regulatory Timeline Challenges

Administrative bottlenecks present material risks to European lithium independence timelines. However, mining permitting challenges continue to create significant obstacles for domestic producers. Imerys delayed commercial production from 2028 to 2030 due to ""longer-than-expected permitting processes,"" creating a two-year gap in planned domestic supply availability.

The regulatory complexity involves multiple approval layers including environmental impact assessments requiring comprehensive ecological studies. Furthermore, social licensing processes incorporate community consultation frameworks, while multi-jurisdictional approvals span mining, energy, and environmental agencies. Additionally, heritage site evaluations become particularly relevant in densely populated European regions.

Permitting delays compound other project risks, including commodity price volatility and demand uncertainty. Sibanye Stillwater continues assessing commissioning timing for its Finnish project due to weak lithium pricing, demonstrating how regulatory and market factors create compound development obstacles.

Strategic Implications of Production Delays

The 2027-2030 supply gap represents a strategic vulnerability period for European automakers. During this window, manufacturers must rely on existing import channels while domestic capacity remains under development. This dependency persists precisely when global lithium demand is projected to accelerate due to expanding EV adoption across multiple continents.

Alternative sourcing strategies during project development phases include long-term supply contracts with established Australian and Chilean producers. In addition, strategic inventory management helps buffer against supply disruptions, while technology partnerships with Asian battery manufacturers maintain diverse supply bases. Furthermore, recycling capacity expansion reduces primary lithium requirements.

Current regulatory uncertainty affects both demand-side and supply-side planning. Germany's efforts to modify EU combustion engine phase-out policies beyond 2035 create additional complexity for long-term demand forecasting, influencing both project development timelines and financing decisions.

What Role Do Geothermal and Sustainable Extraction Methods Play?

Technology Integration in European Lithium Operations

Geothermal-powered lithium extraction represents a uniquely European approach to mineral development. Vulcan Energy's Upper Rhine Valley project integrates geothermal energy production with lithium extraction, creating dual revenue streams while minimising carbon emissions. This technological integration addresses European sustainability requirements while potentially reducing operational costs through renewable energy self-sufficiency.

The geothermal extraction process offers several advantages over conventional mining. For instance, it eliminates mining waste through direct brine processing while reducing physical footprint compared to open-pit operations. Moreover, integration with existing energy infrastructure in geothermal regions provides lower environmental impact through minimal surface disruption.

Technical specifications for geothermal lithium extraction involve accessing high-temperature reservoir brines (200-250°C) containing dissolved lithium concentrations. The Rhine Graben geological structure provides optimal conditions for this extraction methodology, with established geothermal infrastructure reducing capital requirements.

Sustainability as a Competitive Advantage

European lithium projects increasingly position environmental compliance as strategic differentiation rather than regulatory burden. Vulcan Energy's A$3.9 billion financing success signals institutional investor validation of geothermal-powered extraction models, suggesting that sustainability profiles directly influence capital availability and pricing.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment criteria have become fundamental considerations for mineral project financing. European projects benefit from renewable energy integration reducing carbon footprint calculations. Additionally, advanced environmental monitoring exceeds global industry standards, while community engagement frameworks address social licensing requirements. Furthermore, transparent governance structures meet institutional investor standards.

The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) standard compliance requirements for European projects establish operational benchmarks that differentiate regional production from global competitors. These standards create barriers to entry while potentially commanding premium pricing for sustainably produced materials.

How Will Market Dynamics Affect European Lithium Project Viability?

Current Market Imbalance Analysis

Global lithium markets currently exhibit significant oversupply conditions, creating challenging conditions for new project development. However, long-term demand projections indicate that ""all known projects today will not be able to cover future EV demand,"" according to industry executives. This apparent contradiction reflects timing mismatches between current production capacity and projected consumption growth.

Price volatility impacts project development decisions across all stages. Exploration budgets contract during low-price environments, while construction financing becomes more expensive due to commodity price uncertainty. Consequently, commercial production timing shifts based on economic viability thresholds, and strategic investor participation varies with market sentiment cycles.

The current supply-demand imbalance primarily reflects slower-than-expected EV adoption in certain markets, production acceleration in Australia and Chile, and inventory building during previous high-price periods. However, underlying demand fundamentals remain supportive due to expanding battery manufacturing capacity and renewable energy storage requirements.

Competition from Established Producing Regions

European lithium projects must compete against established operations with significant cost advantages. Australian spodumene mining benefits from large-scale open-pit operations and established processing infrastructure. Similarly, Chilean brine operations leverage natural evaporation processes reducing energy requirements, while Chinese processing facilities offer integrated supply chain advantages.

Cost competitiveness challenges for European operations include several factors. Labour costs remain 2-3x higher than developing markets, requiring automation and productivity enhancement as mitigation. Furthermore, energy costs involve variable renewable pricing, necessitating renewable energy integration strategies. Additionally, stringent environmental compliance requirements demand technology differentiation and premium positioning.

Strategic value considerations extend beyond pure cost optimisation. Supply chain security, reduced transportation costs, and regulatory alignment create competitive advantages that offset higher production costs for European automotive manufacturers seeking supply chain resilience. These advantages become increasingly valuable as energy transition minerals gain strategic importance.

What Are the Broader Implications for EU Industrial Policy?

Critical Raw Materials Act Implementation

The proposed lithium content requirements integrate with the EU's broader Critical Raw Materials Act framework, creating comprehensive mineral security policies. This legislation establishes strategic objectives for domestic production capacity, recycling infrastructure development, and international partnership frameworks across multiple critical materials beyond lithium.

Cross-sector applications extend beyond automotive manufacturing to include defence industry applications requiring secure supply chains for specialised battery systems. Moreover, renewable energy storage supports grid stabilisation and energy transition goals, while industrial equipment uses lithium-ion systems for manufacturing automation. Additionally, consumer electronics manufactured within European technology hubs benefit from secure supply chains.

Implementation timelines coordinate multiple policy instruments, including green technology investment incentives, research and development funding, and trade policy adjustments affecting critical mineral imports. This comprehensive approach demonstrates European commitment to strategic autonomy in critical technology supply chains, building upon lithium industry innovations from other regions.

Geopolitical Considerations in Resource Security

European lithium independence initiatives respond to evolving geopolitical dynamics, particularly regarding China's dominant position in lithium processing and battery manufacturing. While China controls approximately 60% of global lithium refining capacity, European policies aim to establish alternative supply chains reducing strategic dependency.

Alliance building strategies include partnership frameworks with democratic lithium-producing nations like Australia and Canada. Furthermore, technology sharing agreements facilitate sustainable extraction methodologies, while joint venture structures combine European capital with international resource bases. Additionally, multilateral institutions coordinate critical mineral security across allied nations.

Trade policy implications involve balancing content requirements with World Trade Organisation compliance and existing free trade agreements. European policymakers must ensure that domestic content mandates do not trigger trade disputes while achieving strategic autonomy objectives, particularly as lithium brine market insights inform global supply chain strategies.

Investment and Partnership Strategies for European Lithium Development

Minority Stake Sales and Capital Structure

European lithium projects increasingly rely on sophisticated capital structures distributing development risks across multiple investor categories. Imerys pursues ""advanced"" discussions for minority stake sales, demonstrating strategic approaches to project financing that balance control retention with capital requirements and risk sharing.

Strategic investor identification involves several categories including automotive manufacturers seeking supply chain integration and security. Additionally, battery producers require feedstock quality assurance and delivery reliability, while sovereign wealth funds focus on strategic resource investments. Furthermore, infrastructure funds are attracted to long-term, utility-like cash flow profiles.

Risk-sharing mechanisms in capital-intensive mineral development include staged investment commitments, milestone-based funding releases, and commodity price hedging arrangements. These structures protect investors from development delays while providing projects with committed capital throughout construction phases.

Multi-Project Portfolio Approach

Geographic diversification across European jurisdictions spreads regulatory and geological risks while maximising policy support. Imerys operates projects in both France and Cornwall, while other companies develop operations across Germany, Finland, and additional European regions.

Technology diversification strategies encompass conventional hard-rock mining in established geological formations. Moreover, geothermal brine extraction operates in suitable geographical regions, while recycling facility development enables secondary lithium recovery. Additionally, research and development partnerships advance next-generation extraction technologies.

Timeline staggering enables companies to apply lessons learned from initial projects to subsequent developments while maintaining continuous project pipeline advancement. This approach reduces concentrated development risks while building operational expertise across diverse technical challenges, benefiting from recent battery recycling breakthrough innovations.

Reshaping Global Lithium Markets Through Regional Content Requirements

Long-term Market Structure Evolution

European content requirements will likely accelerate similar policies in other regions, creating fragmented global lithium trade patterns prioritising supply chain security over pure economic optimisation. This shift represents a fundamental change from globalised commodity markets toward regionalised supply chain structures.

Anticipated changes include regional processing hubs developing closer to consumption centres. Furthermore, premium pricing emerges for domestically produced materials meeting content requirements, while technology transfer acceleration occurs as companies establish local operations. Additionally, investment patterns shift toward strategic rather than purely economic considerations.

Regional supply chain development acceleration extends beyond lithium to encompass entire battery material supply chains, including nickel processing, cobalt refining, and battery cell manufacturing. This integrated approach creates comprehensive domestic capabilities rather than isolated material production.

Success Metrics for European Lithium Independence

Measuring European lithium policy effectiveness requires tracking multiple performance indicators beyond simple production volumes. Market share evolution in European EV battery supply chains provides the most direct measure of content requirement success, while cost competitiveness achievement determines long-term sustainability without ongoing subsidisation.

Key performance benchmarks include EU production capacity targeting 50,000+ tonnes LCE by 2030 and 120,000+ tonnes LCE by 2035. Consequently, content requirement achievement aims for 20% compliance by 2030 and 35% by 2035. Moreover, cost competitiveness goals involve achieving less than 120% of import costs by 2030 and less than 110% by 2035.

Timeline achievement versus actual capacity development will ultimately determine whether European lithium independence represents successful industrial policy or requires adjustment to balance strategic objectives with economic realities. The 2027-2030 period represents the critical testing phase for these ambitious policy frameworks.

Innovation incentives created by content requirements extend beyond immediate lithium production to encompass advanced extraction technologies, recycling capabilities, and battery chemistry improvements that reduce primary material requirements. These secondary effects may prove more valuable than direct production capacity in achieving long-term strategic autonomy objectives. The success of the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project will serve as a crucial benchmark for measuring the effectiveness of these comprehensive policy initiatives.

For further insights into European lithium market developments, Imerys' strategic project recognition by the European Union highlights the significance of domestic content requirements. Additionally, analysis from France's industrial lithium development prospects provides valuable context for understanding the broader implications of the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project initiative.

Maybe increasing to 50% of new car sales by 2035, he said, but 100% is a dream deferred.
Up to 90% of China’s small car sales already are electric, and green tech there is booming.
But Republican consultant Mike Murphy last year polled Americans on electric cars and found that most of the divide isn’t pragmatic.
The car sales story this fall in King County and around some parts of the state is tantalizing.","When President Trump proposed rolling back fuel-efficiency standards on cars this past week, he did it with his usual panache, calling electric cars “a green new scam.”

The idea of mandating a gradual shift to EVs is “insane,” he said.

But was it really going to be so far-fetched to get rid of gas cars?

It sure looks like the green dream may have been closer than previously thought, according to the latest data from Washington state about new cars hitting the road.

I say “could have been” because the federal government now seems hellbent to keep Americans guzzling oil until long after the last glacier is melted.

But first, a remarkable data point.

In October, 37% of the new cars sold in King County were battery-powered electrics (this includes plug-in hybrids) — in other words, cars that can be plugged in. This smashed the record for one-month adoption of green cars.

An additional 20% sold were hybrids. That means the old-style type of cars — those with solely internal combustion engines — made up only 43% of the new cars registered for the month in King County.

Statewide, 26% of new cars sold and then registered in October were EVs, and 20% gas-electric hybrids. So across the entire state, gas-only cars declined to just 54% of new car sales in October, according to state Department of Licensing registration data.

“It’s a temporary peak, unfortunately, but it also shows how far we’ve come,” says Matthew Metz.

Metz is a retired Seattle torts lawyer who took up the cause of banning new gas cars 10 years ago. He was called “moonbatty,” a “commie,” and so on. He reported to me back in 2017 that when the idea of phasing out gas cars first made the news, “99.9% of the reaction was negative.”

“People will get over it,” he predicted then.

The political system and the oil industry of course didn’t get over it. But Metz was right that large swaths of the population did.

Consider that in 2017, electric cars made up just 2% of new car sales in this state, with hybrids only 5%. Internal combustion engines had a monopoly-level hold on the market, at 93% of all new cars hitting the roads.

Advertising

Fast-forward eight years. The state’s largest county just crossed a tipping point where fewer than half the cars sold here in August, September and October combined were gas-combustion only. Who would have bet on that in 2017?

“When we started on this, EVs had a stigma,” Metz said. “There were very few electric cars available. There were no chargers. The charge times were three times longer. There’s still a ton of work to do, but the stigma is in the past.”

The surge in sales this fall was in part because buyers were scrambling to take advantage of expiring federal tax credits. Republicans have killed those off, as Trump gleefully noted this past week when he lowered the auto industry’s fuel mileage standards.

“Today, we’re taking one more step to kill the green new scam, as part of the greatest scam, probably,” Trump said.

Metz founded a group, called Coltura, to try to wean both Washington and the nation completely off of gas. So he’s a crazy optimist. But he sounded a bit resigned about the future.

Since Trump returned to office, he and congressional Republicans have sought to cancel the ability of California and other states to set their own car standards. It means the push in Washington state to try to shift new car sales all the way up to 100% EV by 2035 has effectively been scotched (though the Trump action is being challenged in court.)

Metz shared industry data showing that sales of some makes of electric cars have plunged in November, since the tax credits expired.

He now predicts that with the government hostility, momentum for EVs will slow. Maybe increasing to 50% of new car sales by 2035, he said, but 100% is a dream deferred.

“Unless they want to turn us into Cuba, with only the old model gas cars and trucks driving around, then it’s inevitable that the market is going to keep moving ahead in some way with EVs,” he said. “But it is back to the drawing board.”

I kid you not, the day after Metz made this crack about turning us into Cuba, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had this to say about the fuel standards rollback:

“This rule will actually allow you to bring back the 1970s station wagon,” Duffy said. “Maybe a little wood paneling on the side. We can bring back choice to consumers.”

Make America like the ’70s again! Up to 90% of China’s small car sales already are electric, and green tech there is booming. Meanwhile our leaders are nostalgically fantasizing about road trips at 10 mpg.

There are some obvious drawbacks to EVs. They’re expensive to buy and still too inconvenient to fill with juice (especially for those in apartments or without driveways). But Republican consultant Mike Murphy last year polled Americans on electric cars and found that most of the divide isn’t pragmatic.

“It’s tribal,” Murphy wrote. “In our modern politics any friend of my enemy must be my enemy too. If Joe Biden is for EVs, we must be against them.”

I asked Metz for his take.

“I think Republicans are just pro-oil,” he said. “They want to keep the oil economy going for as long as they can, and that’s pretty much it.”

It’s like that 2006 documentary “Who Killed the Electric Car?” in which the oil powers sabotage a prototype EV to save their golden goose. On rerun in 2025.

So what will become of the green dream to end gas? The car sales story this fall in King County and around some parts of the state is tantalizing. A third of cars that just sold in King County have no engine in them at all — an inconceivable statistic only a few years ago.

Will this be looked back on as the first proof of a new age dawning? Or as a fad?

I guess if we see the station wagon making a comeback, we’ll have our answer.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12052025_TZR_Electric_Vehicle_Charging-2024_tzr_123.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-12-06 11:02:09.430683

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me.

Before I delve into today’s show I want to acknowledge that the news cycle is a shit show right now in the EV world. And that means a lot of today’s show will delve into politics and yeah, it’s going to be tough going. I don’t want to sugar coat this – politics matters – and those who say it doesn’t come from a place of privilege they’re not willing to acknowledge. So please, don’t blame us for covering political stories that are relevant to the EV world.

And we start with one such story – namely that the U.S. Government has officially published plans to slash fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks.

Standing with the CEOs of Ford and Stellantis, President Trump ripped into previous standard set by President Biden, calling them illegal and blaming them for the high cost of cars (even though I and many watching will blame unwanted in-car tech). Slashing nearly a third off the twenty-thirty-one target of fifty- point four miles per gallon, the new target is thirty-four point five miles per gallon – less than automakers managed fleet wide last year. We’re already seeing automakers push away from EVs toward more heavily polluting engines – like V-8s – even when their portfolios include more efficient, cheaper engines and drivetrains. And that only signals bad things ahead for everyone. But maybe there’s hope for one thing: kei cars. President Trump says he wants them to be allowed in the U.S., after seeing them on his trip to Japan. And given we’re now ruled by Presidential whim in the U.S…. Well… yah.

That Presidential whim – and continued attacks on EVs have seen what all of us predicted come to pass: a meteoric drop in EV sales during November.

Ford, which has indefinitely paused all F150 Lightning production – reported a sixty point eight percent drop in EV sales during November, replaced by a surge in gas-guzzling SUV sales. Meanwhile, Honda’s Prologue EV sales dropped eighty-six percent, despite large cash-on-hood incentives for buyers. At the time of filming, GM hasn’t published its November figures, but they’re not expected to be good. Hyundai and Kia also had a terrible November, with sales drops of more than one half for both brands. Meanwhile, pretty much every automaker recorded increases in hybrid sales.

We’re off to the UK now, where in addition to trying to legally erase and ban people like me from actually existing outside of their homes, the UK government is doing its best to mimic the USA.

Its just-released budget confirmed that while the government will be extending EV incentives until twenty-thirty, it also wants to tax EV and plug-in hybrid owners three pence per mile. Granted, the budget does include commitments to address the cost of EV charging, and to work on making it easier to install charging for people without off-street parking – but the data from November sales is already very dour. While EV sales in November were up one point five percent on the same period last year, with EVs now accounting for twenty-six point four percent of the new car market, the growth rate of EV adoption is the lowest it’s been in three years.

Luckily though, not every country in the world is making EVs the problem, and in Norway, we’ve got further demonstration of how amazing EV incentives can be to adoption rates.

This week, figures from November show that EVs accounted for more than ninety-seven point six percent of all new vehicles registered in the country. – but thanks to a rise in competitive pricing deals, Norway set new records for car registrations for the year, with just shy of twenty-thousand vehicles hitting the roads. That’s nearly double the number of cars sold in October. And while the Norwegian government had toyed with the idea of rolling back its VAT exemption on EV from twenty twenty-seven, a compromise reached this week will keep VAT exemption for EVs until twenty twenty-eight, with a new user limit of one hundred and fifty-thousand kroner in twenty twenty-seven, half of what it will be next year.

As some governments around the world sour on an all-electric future, we’re starting to see automakers take advantage of the situation and push back plans to go all -electric.

This week, reporting from Bloomberg suggests BMW, which has maintained it wants an electrified future – is now considering reintroducing its range-extended EV architecture for future models. The report claims that BMW is examining the reintroduction of REx – Range-Extending Engines – for its X5 and 7-Series models in China. It’s worth noting that the reporting is referring to engines connected to a generator that will provide electricity to an EV drivetrain when the car’sbatteries are empty, rather than traditional plug-in hybrid setups where the engine can drive the wheels in some situations. BMW has not refuted nor confirmed the reporting, stating that it is continually refining its plans based on customer and market trends.

Aptera has officially published its newest video update this week showing off its Validation Vehicle Assembly line for the first time.

The company – which is working to bring its three-wheeled solar electric car to market – is still very much using a pretty manual production process at this time, but what makes this line different from what went before is the extensive use of specialized assembly jigs to speed up component installation onto the pre-assembled bodies – complete with battery packs that Aptera’s battery partner CTNS is now building on site. This is the first time CTNS has build battery modules at Aptera’s facility, lowering build costs and lead times. With validation assembly under way – the company says it’s continuing its final testing a pace, and says that its combined cycle testing – high speed, stop and go, and urban – are quote ‘encouraging’. It’s hoping to engage in final regulatory testing soon. Watch this space.

Hyundai’s EV sales may have taken a hit last month in the U.S., but that hasn’t stopped its luxury arm, Genesis, from showing off its newest, highest-performance EV yet: the GV60 Magma.

Revealed in France this week, the model is a new upper-end variant of the GV60, with redesigned front body components and an all-wheel-drive system that rockets from zero to two hundred kilometers per hour (that’s zero to one hundred twenty-five miles per hour) in ten point nine seconds. A head-up display is standard, and the seats are wrapped in a suede-like material called Chamude. Official range figures for most markets aren’t out yet, but this is clearly a car built to go fast and think about range second. For the curious, it somehow keeps the mighty orb… because it wouldn’t be a GV60 without it.

Genesis also revealed its newest concept, the Magma GT, hinting at the brand’s future direction.

While some markets have yet to experience BYD’s EVs thanks to protectionist policies wrapped up as cybersecurity concerns, BYD has just celebrated a new milestone for its BYD Dolphin: 1 Million Global Sales.

On sale in its home market since twenty twenty-one and welcomed to Europe in twenty twenty-three, the Dolphin EV — not to be confused with its smaller sibling, the Seagull (or Dolphin Surf in Europe) — celebrated its half-millionth model late twenty twenty-three after twenty-five months in production – and the one millionth model hasn’t taken a long time to arrive after. With a choice of forty-five point one two kilowatt-hour or sixty point four-eight kilowatt-hour battery packs, the Dolphin holds its own in the already-crowded C-Segment in Europe, fighting off far more stablished brands, like Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in the EV space.

Over the past few years, we’ve seen plenty of developments made in the sector of wireless inductive charging for EVs – both in the passenger car and light-duty segment.

This week however, researchers at Purdue University carried out the first successful real-world test of a dynamic high-power inductive charging system fitted to a class-eight electric big rig on a quarter-mile stretch of US Highway 52 and US Highway 231 in West Lafayette Indiana. Using a specially-modified electric tractor built by Cummins, the system successfully transmitted one hundred and ninety kilowatts from the road to the truck while it was traveling along at sixty-five miles per hour (or about one hundred and four kilometers per hour). While the press release doesn’t go into details, my back-of-the-napkin calculations suggest that’s more than enough to cover all — or at least a significant portion — of the energy requirements for a fully loaded Class 8 big rig, if this system were extended over a meaningful distance.

And finally for this segment, some good news. While the U.S. White House continues its war on renewables, data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shows that renewables are still ascendent in the Energy Generation Landscape.

Its latest report, published this week, shows that of the new generation capacity added to the U.S. electrical grid from January through until the End of September, and astonishing eighty-eight percent came from renewables. In fact, for twenty-five months straight, Solar has dominated new solar generating capacity – and I should note here that FERC only tracks grid-scale solar, not domestic solar. Today, nearly one third of all U.S. electricity generation comes from grid-scale renewable projects, with domestic solar pushing it well over that figure. If things continue, solar will become the second-largest source of U.S. Grid Generation, second only to natural gas.

Our final two stories are next, but first, a word from you.

For over fifteen years—ten in the U.S.—I and the TE team have been bringing you news on cleaner, greener, safer, smarter, and more equitable transportation and energy. We’re not backed by corporations, and we don’t have huge production budgets. Our tiny team—three full-time and one part-time member—works hard every week to bring you well-researched, honest content.

When we started, YouTube ad revenue paid the bills. These days, like most independent creators, ad revenue has dropped sharply. Worse, YouTube often sidelines diverse voices, overlooks minority creators, and prioritizes clickbait and AI fluff over real content. We wouldn’t exist without your support at Patreon.com/TransportEvolved.

I hate doing this, but here it is: just this week, a $4,200 annual E&O insurance bill arrived. Even though it’s yearly, it hits like a monthly expense—on top of team salaries, health insurance, retirement plans, and keeping the lights on. Health insurance alone has gone up forty percent this year. We keep a tight rein on our finances and have buffers, but right now, we’re treading water rather than growing—and costs are going up. I even fund part of the channel from my partner’s income, and that’s not sustainable. In an ideal world, we wouldn’t have to ask for your support… but here we are. It’s better than putting everything behind a paywall, which I am most certainly and vehemently against.

To keep producing videos—and to keep this channel alive—we need a budget boost. Even a thousand dollars a month—less than ten percent of what it costs to run this channel, which itself is about ten percent of the budget of much larger channels—would make a huge difference and let us sleep easier at night.

Even a single dollar helps. We’ve added new Patreon tiers for every budget, so if you already support us, thank you—it keeps this show alive.

And now… it’s time for those last two stories. Both of them from the UK.

Apparently, Brits like tea. A lot. And, as someone who is part British, I can attest that yes, I do indeed like a cup of tea to keep me going in the afternoon. Although in the morning, I’m all about Coffee.

But this week, Stellantis brand Vauxhall – which is basically the UK twin to Opel – took its UK roots and ran with it, announcing its new elect-ric-it-tea van. It’s a very obvious pun on electricity and consists of a Vauxhall Vivaro electric van that features a fully-kitted out kitchen behind its central sliding door. The company cites lots of research stating that most tradespeople say they’d prefer to stop and have a cup of tea in the afternoon that they themselves had made, and decided to make this advertising campaign around it. Now, it’s a neat, fun little concept, complete with sink, coffee, tea, fresh milk, and even some chocolate digestives (or maybe hobnobs). But there’s one flaw: I don’t know a single tradesperson with a van – electric or otherwise – that has room inside for all their gear and a fully-fitted kitchen. A smarter option? An electric kettle plugged into an on-board V2L system.

And finally,

If you’re an EV driver and you have any experience of public charging, you might know that when you plug in to a fast charger, the cable is locked in position by your car for your – and its safety.

When the charging session ends, the cable is supposed to release, but sometimes – if the charging session fails or there’s an error in the car the lock doesn’t release, causing panic and frustration. Most EVs today come with a hidden release cable that allow you to safely disconnect, but most owners don’t know about it. And, apparently, that’s led many people in the UK to call 999 – the UK equivalent of 911 – for assistance. This week, the London metropolitan police got so fed up with the number of calls from hapless EV owners asking for assistance that it had to issue a public statement reminding people that having your car stuck on a charging station is – and never should be – an emergency services call. Sure, if there’s a fire that’s different, but my advice is to learn where your EVs’ emergency release cable is. Most (but not all) have them.

And on that note, we’re done for today’s show.

But first, a huge thank you to the Electric Vehicle Association for sponsoring today’s show. The EVA has been advocating for electric vehicles since nineteen sixty-seven and remains firmly committed to a cleaner, greener future for all.

And in closing, some important words:

You are valid. You are loved. You belong. You have a purpose.

This week has seen more marginalization, more hate, and more othering of people in our lives and our communities. More bans, more threatened deportations and worse. And while the person in charge doesn’t already represent a nation or even the majority of people in it, it can be hard to want to carry on carrying on. But in order to change history – we need resistance – and intentionality.

Engage in Tactical Frivolity. Don’t surrender to fear, hate, or misinformation. That’s as true in Portland, Oregon, as it is anywhere power and greed seek to crush the will of ordinary people. Don’t buy into division and cruelty. Empathy is a skill we must practice daily to preserve our shared humanity. Just like humor, it’s an act of radical resistance.

But everyone needs time out. Unplug, get outside, dive into a good book, go gardening, or do a run, and recharge. Care for yourself and your loved ones now, so you can return ready to fight for decency, community, justice, and a better world. Let your light shine — in or outside an inflatable frog costume.

Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. Don’t let hate or ignorance win. As always, keep evolving!",https://www.transportevolved.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ten_560_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 11:02:14.509849

Even so, the efforts of Brazilian climate leadership deserve attention and recognition.
By shifting the debate to a dedicated forum with technical and political focus, the coalition creates space to build operational consensus, finance transition guarantees and design social and labor protections.
This parallel path is a necessary complement to global negotiations on the planet’s foremost climate agenda: ending the use of fossil fuels.
Civil society demanded ambition, integrity of information and climate justice — reinforcing that serious policy must articulate science, human rights and broad social participation.","The holding of the 30th UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém made history for two complementary reasons: it was the first climate conference hosted in the Amazon, and it put forests, Indigenous peoples and civil society back at the center of climate negotiations. Bringing together 195 countries and culminating in the unanimous adoption of 29 decisions, the conference showed that, despite geopolitical contradictions and obstacles, there is still room for collective progress.

The key points of Belém were the “joint decision,” the shifting positions of the European Union, the objections of large oil-producing countries and the enormous efforts of Brazilian diplomatic coordination to deliver on implementation of the Paris Agreement. In parallel with the diplomatic conference, Belém welcomed a vigorous presence of civil society, a powerful expression of its commitment to social justice in the fight against climate change.

The decision to join forces: strategy, scope and limits

In the context of the climate negotiations, the Brazilian presidency of the COP created the Mutirão — a “joint decision” strategy to untangle sensitive issues and stitch together a single package of decisions that included finance, adaptation, just transition, trade, gender and technology. At the end of the conference, this package resulted in the approval of 29 documents that sought to advance on multiple fronts without leaving behind urgent demands from the Global South.

Among the financial measures approved, concrete allocations of $135 million to the Adaptation Fund and $300 million to adapt the health sector to climate impacts stand out. The presidency also proposed reformulating climate finance reporting, linking it to the New Collective Quantified Goal for Climate Finance (NCQG), seeking greater transparency between “provided” and “mobilized” resources.

On the other hand, financial ambition fell short of what was necessary: the task-force proposal foresees tripling adaptation financing by 2035 compared with 2025, but without a clearly defined base value. This gap reflects the historical difficulty of the multilateral system in translating political commitment into measurable financial flows — a challenge that, according to climate finance experts, is reflected in the current adaptation finance gap, estimated at around $340 billion. This amount is forecast to reach $1.35 trillion by 2035.

No binding target was delivered to finance adaptation, and the multilateral ambition to mobilize trillions for clean infrastructure remains without clear accountability mechanisms. The recognition that historical goals have not been met gained space in the final text, but without new and effective structures that guarantee the flow of resources where they are most urgent.

Among other points in the task-force decision, advances were made on information integrity and the fight against climate disinformation — essential to confronting denialism, including disinformation promoted by parts of the fossil-fuel industry. There were also developments on carbon markets and discussions on high-integrity rules — a necessary subject for robust accounting of carbon credits, which remains controversial given cases of fraud and technical errors worldwide.

The EU’s position: defensive pragmatism

The European Union played a decisive role in the final design of the “joint decision”. European officials adopted a pragmatic stance: supporting the negotiated package as long as it did not include provisions they considered unfeasible or unsupported, especially those related to the energy transition. In negotiations, European representatives conditioned their greater willingness to finance adaptation on the inclusion — from their point of view — of balanced measures in the energy transition.

This stance produced two key effects: (1) the EU helped ensure approval of the package, avoiding a total impasse; (2) at the same time, its bargaining limited the financial ambition of the final text, contributing to less binding wording on goals and responsibilities. Observers interpreted this strategy as a balance between pro-climate rhetoric and cautious practice — especially relevant after the United States’s direct absence, which altered traditional leadership dynamics.

Objections from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, India and Russia: blocking the fossil roadmap

One of the most sensitive points in the Belém negotiations was the so‑called “roadmap” for moving away from an economy dependent on fossil fuels — an explicit priority of the Brazilian presidency. Although the initiative gained important political support, especially from the Global South and activist leaders, it did not make it into the final texts due to a lack of consensus. Fossil-fuel-producing countries (notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), as well as major emitters such as China and India, and to a lesser extent, Russia, and even Japan, raised firm objections.

These objections ranged from practical issues (timing, socioeconomic impacts and energy security) to geopolitical positions defending industrial and revenue interests. For many of these countries, formal commitments to abandon fossil fuels would entail high political and economic costs, requiring guarantees of finance, technology transfer and just treatment for workers and communities. This bloc managed to bar inclusion of the roadmap in the joint decision, relegating it to a parallel initiative — albeit one that faces growing political pressure.

Brazilian diplomatic leadership: sewing consensus and maintaining the agenda

Brazil, as COP30 president, worked intensively to transform the mutirão effort into a political reality. The presidency’s strategy combined multilateral diplomacy (bilateral and multilateral negotiations), global visibility — placing the Amazon at the center of discussions — and bridge-building among groups of countries. The presidency proposed the creation of an international just-transition mechanism, with a draft to be presented by June 2026 and contributions open until March 15, 2026, aiming to establish an instrument to organize finance, technical cooperation and capacity building.

This action produced results: 122 countries presented new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) during COP30, and a package of decisions elevated just transition as an institutional priority. However, the Brazilian effort coexists with internal contradictions — part of the government promoted a roadmap for renewables even as the state authorized oil exploration auctions at the mouth of the Amazon, renewed contracts for gas and coal thermal plants through 2040, and faced a Congress about to review vetoes and make environmental licensing more flexible.

These internal tensions erode the policy coherence needed to transform international commitments into robust domestic policies. Even so, the efforts of Brazilian climate leadership deserve attention and recognition.

Colombia–Netherlands initiative: a promising path to the end of fossil fuels

Facing the impasse on including the energy transition roadmap, Colombia and the Netherlands launched a joint initiative to organize the first international conference on “Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels” in April 2026. This initiative deserves attention and applause for inaugurating an alternative strategic path to the unanimity-based system of UN climate conferences. It points to a promising mobilization of more than 80 countries to address the transition from coal, oil and gas to renewable energies, in parallel with COP processes.

By shifting the debate to a dedicated forum with technical and political focus, the coalition creates space to build operational consensus, finance transition guarantees and design social and labor protections. This parallel path is a necessary complement to global negotiations on the planet’s foremost climate agenda: ending the use of fossil fuels.

Civil society, Indigenous peoples and the pulse of climate democracy

Belém experienced one of the highest levels of civil society participation in COP history after three years of conferences in less receptive environments for public demonstrations. At COP30, more than 3,000 Indigenous people engaged inside and outside the negotiations, defending territorial rights among many demands; hundreds of parallel events addressed themes related to the Amazon’s socioenvironmental values and standing-forest bioeconomy. The streets were filled with a march estimated at 70,000 people — a clear popular demonstration for global climate action. Science was prominent: a scientific pavilion brought climate scientists into direct contact with the COP presidency.

Civil society demanded ambition, integrity of information and climate justice — reinforcing that serious policy must articulate science, human rights and broad social participation. The launch of the Tropical Forests Forever Fund (TFFF), which raised nearly $7 billion, was welcomed by some sectors; others criticized its governance and reliance on private funds, reflecting the debate on financing forest protection without offloading public responsibility.

The end of deforestation by 2030 is an imperative for Brazil to reach its NDC. Efforts have been made to decrease present deforestation to reasonable levels, which will continue in the coming years. Nevertheless, the TFFF figures and other funding sources suggest that they are below the zero-deforestation ambition needs.

The event also exposed shortcomings in COP infrastructure: thermal discomfort in the Amazon heat and humidity, and a small fire that was quickly controlled but interrupted use of some spaces for an afternoon and led to a few hospital visits without major consequences.

What lies ahead

At the slow pace of consensus-based diplomacy, attention now turns to COP31 in Turkey, with Australia chairing negotiations. Key points to watch for a minimally positive meeting include guaranteed and meaningful inclusion of civil society; a real commitment by hosts to halt approval of new coal projects; concrete progress on adaptation finance with numerical targets; operationalization of the just-transition mechanism; and consolidation of technical processes that make the fossil-fuel roadmap a negotiable agenda rather than mere rhetoric. A Pre-COP in the Pacific, responding to the needs of island states threatened by sea-level rise, and the selection of a negotiation president with the capacity to unite interests will be decisive.

COP30 in Belém renewed the political agenda by placing the Amazon at the heart of negotiations and by structuring a joint package of decisions that seeks to reconcile justice, adaptation and transition. At the same time, it made clear that without binding financial commitments, consistent social inclusion and domestic policy coherence, progress will be slow.

The Colombia–Netherlands initiative for a conference dedicated to ending fossil fuels is a promising beacon: it offers a technical-political forum to translate political pressure from Belém into concrete measures. If Brazilian diplomacy and global coalitions can convert the “joint decisions” momentum into operational instruments and real finance, COP30 may be remembered as the starting point of a historic turning point — led, above all, by the civil society that occupied Belém and demonstrated that the world wants, and can, accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.

Geopolitical conflicts and multilateral fissures persist, but Brazilian leadership at this COP advanced agendas despite contradictions. The resistance of oil-producing countries and the absence of the United States shaped resistance to consensus-based diplomatic agreements. Still, Belém sent a strong signal from civil society and a considerable coalition of countries willing to pursue the end of fossil fuels — a positive and promising outcome for a polarized world dominated by the capital of the old fossil economy.

He has led the development of an optimised end-to-end supply chain, delivering value to customers and implementing intelligent supply chain strategies.","Global manufacturing solutions provider Jabil is expanding its partnership with metal parts manufacturer Inno to enhance the production of battery energy storage system (BESS) enclosures.

The move could strengthen the supply chain for a technology that is fundamental to the worldwide transition toward renewable energy.

Their collaboration includes a joint investment in a 15,000-square-metre facility in Rayong, Thailand, which is expected to begin prototyping in late 2026.

Bolstering the BESS value chain

Battery energy storage is crucial for creating a more flexible and resilient energy system. As renewable generation from sources like wind and solar expands, BESS technology fulfils a critical function. It allows for the storage of energy when it is plentiful and its release to the grid during periods of peak demand, or when generation is low stabilising the system and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

The partnership between Jabil and Inno – a subsidiary of Shanghai Xinpeng Industry Co. (XP) – builds on a relationship that dates back to 2014. The new facility in Rayong will focus specifically on manufacturing BESS metal enclosures. These components can represent a large portion of overall system costs because of raw material expenses and complex welding requirements.

Traditionally, manufacturers have sourced these enclosures from China before shipping them for final integration in markets closer to the end user. This expanded partnership could enable Jabil to offer a comprehensive lifecycle solution for BESS customers. The process includes sheet metal processing structural section fabrication welding and coating all from a single cost-effective location.

The site’s position just 25km from Laem Chabang, Thailand’s largest port, provides strategic access to global shipping lanes. By localising these manufacturing processes the collaboration could help simplify sourcing and reduce the carbon footprint associated with long-distance transportation.

Building supply chain resilience

Diversifying the supply chain for renewable energy components is becoming increasingly important. Geopolitical uncertainty and tariffs have highlighted the risks of relying on a single region for critical parts. The new Thailand facility offers an alternative manufacturing hub, helping to create a more robust and resilient supply network for the energy sector.

""For over a decade,"" says Brent Tompkins, SVP, Global Business Units, Renewables and Energy Infrastructure, ""our team has helped energy storage leaders design and integrate technologies like battery management systems power electronics and high-level assemblies into their BESS solutions.

""Our customers are increasingly looking to diversify their supply chain in the face of tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty. We're excited to offer this critical industry a vertically integrated solution that meets their needs from enclosure production to final integration and fulfilment while simplifying sourcing and reducing risk.""

Supporting a sustainable energy future

The collaboration is positioned to support the increasing global demand for clean energy. This includes providing the necessary infrastructure to power energy-intensive sectors such as artificial intelligence in a more sustainable way. By improving the accessibility and affordability of BESS technology, the partnership could play a role in accelerating the adoption of renewable power worldwide.

According to Jeffrey Shen, CEO of XP, the joint effort will accelerate Inno’s expansion within the energy storage market.

""Our collaboration with Jabil will accelerate Inno's growth in the energy storage market, bringing the potential of renewable power to more communities around the world, especially in support of the growing energy demand of AI infrastructures globally,"" Jeffrey explains.

""Together we can provide customers with increased supply chain resiliency at a competitive price point.""

As the electrification of transport, buildings and industry continues to gain momentum a reliable supply of energy storage solutions is essential for meeting climate goals and achieving a decarbonised global economy.

IFC’s First Battery Materials Investment in India

This marks IFC’s first direct investment into a battery-materials manufacturing company in India, underlining growing international confidence in the country’s clean-mobility transition. The funding is being made through compulsorily convertible instruments, which will eventually be converted into equity in GFCL EV Products.

IFC’s participation not only provides capital but also enhances the project’s global credibility, helping attract future international financing and partnerships.

GFL’s Vision to Build a World-Class Battery Materials Platform

Gujarat Fluorochemicals, part of the INOXGFL Group, is rapidly emerging as a key player in India’s advanced materials and battery ecosystem. Through its subsidiary, GFCL EV Products, the company is working towards building a large-scale, integrated battery-materials platform capable of serving both domestic and global markets.

The company aims to cover a significant portion of the battery bill of materials (BoM) required for lithium-ion battery manufacturing—positioning India as a serious global competitor in the battery supply chain.

Boost to India’s EV Manufacturing and Clean Energy Ambitions

The new battery-materials facility is expected to:

Accelerate EV production across two-wheelers, three-wheelers, cars and commercial vehicles

Support the fast-growing energy-storage sector for renewable integration

Generate high-value manufacturing jobs

Encourage further foreign investments into India’s EV supply chain

Strengthen India’s position as a future global hub for battery materials and advanced chemistry manufacturing

As EV adoption surges across India, access to domestically sourced battery materials will be critical to ensuring sustainable, cost-competitive, and scalable growth.

Outlook: A Foundational Step for India’s EV Supply Chain

With global battery supply chains facing geopolitical risks and raw-material constraints, the IFC-backed GFL project represents a foundational investment in India’s energy security and clean-mobility future. As domestic EV demand continues to rise and gigafactory investments expand, integrated battery-materials manufacturing will become a cornerstone of India’s next phase of industrial growth.

Summary

Electricity as a Weapon: The Russia-Ukraine war marks the first major conflict where control of electricity infrastructure is central to military strategy and peace negotiations.

Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant: Never before has a power plant been part of a peace deal—Russia’s demand for half the output is unprecedented.

Grid Vulnerability: Both Ukraine and Russia are targeting each other’s power grids and energy facilities, with over 1,300 strikes reported against Ukraine’s sector alone.

Energy & Society: Disabling a nation’s electric grid cripples hospitals, emergency services, water, manufacturing, and the ability to wage war.

Rising U.S. Utility Rates: Electricity prices are spiking nationwide, driven by flat supply, soaring demand from AI data centers, and costly policies favoring wind, solar, and batteries.

Land Use Conflicts: Rapid expansion of high-voltage transmission lines, data centers, and renewable projects faces growing local opposition and regulatory hurdles.

Natural Gas Dominance: Despite hopes for nuclear, the U.S. is set to meet surging demand with new natural gas plants, not rapid nuclear deployment.

Labor & Supply Chain Shortages: Construction of new energy infrastructure is being slowed by skilled labor shortages and dependence on critical minerals from abroad.

Political Impact: Electricity affordability is emerging as a top issue for 2025 elections, crossing partisan lines and fueling debates about technology, energy policy, and the future of American industry.

Commodities & the Future: The drive to reshape the U.S. grid, reindustrialize, and support tech growth hinges on access to commodities like copper, uranium, and rare earths.

Transcript

Jim Puplava:

Well, if you've been following the news, you know the President is trying to meet with Putin and bring about a peace agreement for the Ukraine war. But one of the big stories about that war is electricity. You haven't heard about it. Joining me on the program is Robert Bryce. Robert, you recently wrote an article called ""Electricity War,"" and I'm just reading here from the opening: more than any conflict in history, the Russia-Ukraine war has been about electricity. So let's talk about that because I hadn't heard that anywhere until I read your piece.

Robert Bryce:

Well, thanks. You know, I've been following the power business for a while. My latest book is A Question of Power: Electricity and the Wealth of Nations. I've done two documentaries on this. This is the world's most important form of energy. And it's clear that when you look at how this war has gone on, electricity has been front and center. I think one of the key points—and what spurred me to write this article, Jim—was that in the 28-point peace proposal or plan that Trump put forward, one of the tenets was that the Russians would get half the output of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. This is unprecedented. In the spoils of war, there has never been a power plant included in any peace deal—this is the very first time. And I think it's the ninth largest nuclear power plant in the world. So clearly, the Russians want this as one of their objectives. And the Trump administration is essentially saying, ""Well, yeah, sure, if that's what you want, we'll give you half the output."" But then you consider the number of attacks—missile attacks, etc.—on nuclear power plants, transformers, and so on, and it's clear this is, in fact, an electricity war.

Jim Puplava:

So when you look at this—and this isn't the first time—you talked about, in the first Gulf War, the U.S.-led bombing campaign nearly destroyed Saddam Hussein's electricity infrastructure. If you take out electricity, just think about the world we live in: you turn on the lights, you have refrigerators, your iPad, iPod, whatever it is. Our society runs on electricity. You take out electricity, what happens?

Robert Bryce:

Well, electricity—the electric grid—is the mother network. It's the network upon which all of our critical societal systems depend: hospitals, water, wastewater, emergency services, communications—all depend on the grid. So it's no surprise that in the Korean War, Vietnam War, and then in the Iraq wars, the electric infrastructure was a prime target for the U.S. military. Now we've seen—I'm just remembering my numbers here—in January, a Ukrainian official claimed Russian forces had launched nearly 1,300 strikes on Ukraine's energy sector, including more than 800 electric substations, distribution and power lines, more than 250 strikes on energy generation facilities, and 30 on gas facilities. Then add in the attacks the Ukrainians have launched on Russian facilities, and again, this is unprecedented—it's never happened at this scale before.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, one of the negotiating items—and Trump didn't do it—but the Ukrainians wanted long-range missiles so they could go farther and damage Russia's energy infrastructure. In your article, you talk about how, if you destroy your adversary's grid, you weaken their entire society, including their ability to wage war.

Robert Bryce:

Well, sure. If you have a nuclear—or any kind of—manufacturing plant to make munitions, missiles, tanks, jeeps, automobiles, bullets, rifles, you need power. If you ruin a country's electric grid, you not only make the overwhelming majority of people in the country miserable, you destroy their ability to manufacture the tools of war. But I think it's also important to remember—here we are in December, Jim, and winter is coming to Ukraine. This was a big threat before: the ability of Ukrainians to keep their power grid up during the depths of winter. Putin has shown no interest in declaring peace or any kind of peace deal, in my view, and I think he'd be happy to just continue the war, continue degrading Ukraine's infrastructure, and force ordinary Ukrainians through another fierce winter. This is a way to wage war. As I ended the piece, Putin now has the ability to weaponize winter, and that sure looks like what he wants to do.

Jim Puplava:

Well, just look at what happened to Europe when he invaded Ukraine. In the case of Germany, where they shut down their nuclear power plants, their gas plants, or their coal plants, they were left stranded and vulnerable to Russian blackmail, essentially.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. And remember the Zaporizhzhia plant, which I mentioned before—it has about 5,700 megawatts of generation capacity. As I said, it's the ninth largest nuclear plant in the world. That was one of the first objectives of the Russian invasion. They captured that plant within about two or three weeks—or, I'm sorry, it was just eight days after Putin launched the invasion. So this has been a strategic goal of the Russians from the very beginning: to capture key parts of the Ukrainian power grid.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah. I just wonder, if Trump can't get Putin to the table to negotiate peace, if he just gives the Ukrainians long-range missiles, that would escalate the war, but it could get more serious.

Robert Bryce:

Well, exactly. And this has been something—remember, this is a multi-level game at hand here, Jim. So yes, the U.S. could give the Ukrainians long-range missiles, but is Putin just going to see that as an act of war by the Americans, that they're using the Ukrainians now fully as a proxy to attack Russia? Further, we still need the Russians for other reasons. Yes, we've embargoed their oil exports—note, we haven't embargoed their uranium exports. Why? Because still today, about 20% of the nuclear fuel used in the U.S. reactor fleet comes from Russia. So, you know, the possibility of declaring all-out war against Russia is there. I was talking to a relative over the holidays; he said, ""Well, we just haven't pressured the Russians enough."" And I'm thinking, ""Well, the Russians have a lot of cards here too."" NATO—we could talk about NATO, we could talk about a whole lot of other things, but are we really serious about declaring full-scale war on the Russians over Ukraine? I don't think we are. And, you know, do I want my sons—I have two of them—to go to Ukraine to fight the Russians? No. Hell no.

Jim Puplava:

No. It's interesting because we're finding out—like we did with COVID—about supply chain difficulties, where you couldn't get stuff. I mean, I can't think of anything I get from Amazon or something I buy that doesn't say ""Made in China.""

Robert Bryce:

Yeah.

Jim Puplava:

As for rare earths, Russia has a number of key minerals, including uranium. So it really leaves us vulnerable. Now that we're on the topic of electricity, I'd like to transition to probably one of the hottest topics coming up in next year's election, which is affordability. And right at the top of that, Robert, is electricity prices. It was on the ballot in New Jersey—New Jersey utility prices are up 26%. It was on the ballot in Virginia, where most of the world's data centers are located. What we're seeing is politicians and the media blaming three groups: tech companies with their AI data centers, utilities, and then the catch-all—Trump.

Robert Bryce:

Sure.

Jim Puplava:

So let's talk about what is driving these utility costs. We've had discussions in the past—probably for the first time in multiple decades, various utilities are becoming more like growth stocks because of the energy demands for electricity.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. And isn't it interesting, Jim, you know, you're an investment guy. For years, the utility sector was viewed as this sleepy part of the business—what you buy for widows and orphans and grandmas; you buy the utility stocks and collect the dividends. Now stocks like Vistra and Constellation have far outperformed the S&P 500 because of the profits they stand to make as independent power producers. Why is that? It's because of this massive increase in demand for power. As you know, Jim, electric demand in the U.S. for the last 20 years has essentially been flat, growing at less than 1% a year. And now, all of a sudden, we're looking at 2, 3, 4% per year growth. The EPRI—the Electric Power Research Institute—is estimating AI is going to need another 50 gigawatts of new generation capacity by 2030. So suddenly, the power business is ""sexy."" And as you point out, in various states across the country, rates are skyrocketing. Why is that? Well, these states, they've been drinking the Kool-Aid on wind, solar, and batteries, and now the bill is coming due. They're finding out they don't have enough power to meet demand. Further, because of AI and data centers, they're trying to build a lot of high-voltage transmission. And what happens in electricity and plumbing—poop rolls downhill. The ratepayers are getting stuck with the bill.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah. Let's talk about wind and solar. I live in California, the land of fruits and nuts, and we're a prime example. We've got the highest gasoline prices in the country, the highest tax rates, but also the highest utility prices. That's because in California, we've shut down two nuclear power plants—one's been postponed from shutting down, but we shut down one; we shut down our coal-fired plants, and we built these wind farms and solar panel farms. It produces intermittent power, and we don't have the battery backup to make that consistent.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. And you can't build gas pipelines either. All of these things combined, Jim, are driving up California's power prices. Further, this is just a teaser for what's to come because the utilities in California are still facing net zero mandates. They're going to try to build a lot more wind and solar. They want to push a lot more high-voltage transmission. All of this is incredibly expensive. Just on the transmission side alone, we're talking tens of billions of dollars in additional costs—if those lines can even be built. That's the other part of this: land use conflicts over high-voltage transmission. You mentioned Virginia—whole sections of the state are opposing high-voltage transmission projects proposed to serve data centers. Local folks are saying, ""Look, we don't want these big projects, these power lines coming over our neighborhood. We don't get any benefit from them."" Again, another example of how energy policy and land use policy are interconnected.

Jim Puplava:

You know, it's amazing because we live in this technological society. I just think of all the things I have to charge at night: my iWatch, my iPhone, my iPad, my iMac—all these devices that use electricity, which make our lives convenient and give us what we want. But the other side of that, Robert, is our use of the Internet and AI. We're on e-commerce—think of all that. It requires data centers to house the information we're using. So there seems to be a disconnect between the life I live and what's necessary to produce that life.

Robert Bryce:

Well, it's funny as you say that, Jim. Well, first, on the iWatch—you make a good living; you can afford a good mechanical watch. Maybe you don't have to get a Rolex, but spring for a nice watch! You're too old for those digital things. But you're right, you know, there's this attitude of ""well, I don't want it here, put it somewhere else."" I don't like the term NIMBY—I think it's a slur. Everyone, everywhere cares about their neighborhood. But as you were saying that, it reminds me of the old maxim in the trash business: everybody wants their trash picked up, but nobody wants it put down. That applies, I think, to data centers. The concerns of local communities are real and valid. These data centers—they're big boxes, they're noisy, they draw tremendous amounts of power; nobody lives there, they change the character of neighborhoods, and they're massive power draws. That's why in Ireland, around Dublin, you can't build data centers—there's a prohibition. In New Mexico, new radical rules dramatically reduce where data centers can locate. So this is happening in a lot of places.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, we recently interviewed Mark Mills, and he was talking about the amount of electricity and land space. Have you seen the amount of land these buildings occupy? I mean, it's like a miniature city—are they that huge?

Robert Bryce:

Well, interesting you bring that up—my wife Lauren and I just drove back from Denver, and yesterday we went through Abilene and stopped by the Stargate project, OpenAI's data center that's going up there, Jim. It's about two square miles—1,100 acres, so 640 acres per square mile. So more than one and a half square miles. I've been to a county fair and a goat rope; I've seen a few construction sites, but I don't know that I've seen one this big, with that much dirt being moved. You can see it on Google Maps. We drove along one road on just one side of it—it was a full mile. The number of contractors, the cranes—it was truly staggering. If built as Sam Altman says, and that's a big ""if,"" it'll be 5 gigawatts—that's 5,000 megawatts. For comparison, I live in Austin, Texas. Austin Energy, our municipally owned utility, has 4,000 megawatts of installed capacity.

Jim Puplava:

And that's for the whole city.

Robert Bryce:

That's for the whole city of over a million people. So one data center—this big AI project OpenAI is pushing—will use more power than the entire city of Austin. It's just truly staggering in scale.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, I don't think utilities were ready for this kind of demand. Plus, we have an aging infrastructure. And on top of AI, Robert, we also have this reindustrialization. I can't turn on a financial channel each week without seeing another company—this week Eli Lilly—building a $5 billion manufacturing plant. So it's not just AI centers, it's the manufacturing we're trying to bring back and build factories. That's going to take electricity and power. It's enormous.

Robert Bryce:

It is. And as you point out, this whole push has caught the utility sector flat-footed. Also, in terms of capital allocation—you're a numbers guy, a money guy—I just did these calculations. If you look at the big five tech companies—Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Apple—their combined market capitalization is around $15 trillion. The combined market cap of 108 U.S. utilities (all electric, gas, water utilities—the biggest in the U.S.) is about $1.6 trillion. Just the big five tech companies are worth $15 trillion and they're demanding massive amounts of power. So it's a mismatch in capital availability, a mismatch in market strength. The big tech companies—there's a queue for gas-fired turbines. How much does it cost to jump the queue? They'll jump the queue. The scale of these buildouts and the amounts of money involved are truly unprecedented.

Jim Puplava:

You know, I just wonder, Robert, if they can even produce this, because we're looking at natural gas for power in the next five years—that's what we see. And then after that, maybe nuclear. If they could accelerate these small nuclear power plants—so you build a data center out in Timbuktu, away from any residential area, and then pop in a small nuclear power plant. It seems that would be a solution, but you've got to get through the regulatory red tape and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. I like how you put that—""pop one in,"" like it's a car battery or something. Easy to say, Jim. I'm adamantly pro-nuclear and have been saying the same thing for 15 years: natural gas to nuclear. But it's clear—and I've lectured on this; I'm going to be in Orlando next week talking about this very thing. The caption for my presentation is ""AI, Gas, and the Grid."" There is simply no way nuclear is going to provide any sizable amount of new power to the AI/data center race. It's all going to be gas. Why? Because we can't deploy new nuclear fast enough. I think we'll be lucky to deploy 10 gigawatts of new nuclear by 2035. We'll probably build 100 gigawatts of new gas by then. So it's a gas story. AI is a gas story—full stop.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, we're invested in natural gas and pipelines for that very reason. Because I know the way Washington works—the red tape and bureaucracy you have to go through. And not only that, Robert, it's like we're finding with technology—we can't make this high-tech stuff without rare earth minerals, and you can't run nuclear power plants without uranium, and we're dependent on foreigners for a lot of this.

Robert Bryce:

Well, you're right. I've written a lot about China, supply chains, and rare earths. You're absolutely right—copper is a strategic element. But don't forget the rare earths are also critical for nuclear: samarium, gadolinium, europium, dysprosium—several are required by the nuclear sector. None of this happens in a vacuum. Just back to the SMR story—I published a piece a few days ago about the collapse in share prices of several pure-play SMR companies: Oklo, NuScale, Terrestrial, and Nano Nuclear in November. Mr. Market has been looking at those companies and saying, ""I'm not sure I buy this story,"" because they're all many years away from commercial deployment and even further from profitability. They'll have to raise billions in new capital, and at NuScale for one, they're massively diluting existing shareholders. I'm hopeful for SMRs, but I wouldn't bet against the incumbent companies like GE Vernova and BWX Technologies—they have big balance sheets, lots of experience in manufacturing, they're not startups, and they know what they're doing when it comes to building reactors.

Jim Puplava:

Oh, absolutely. So how do you think this plays out? Next year is a key congressional election, and the number one issue on the ballot is going to be affordability. With affordability, they're really talking about electricity. If we're talking about rising food costs, I can make some substitutes—maybe buy fresh food instead of packaged, or go to a lower cut of beef. I've noticed in our supermarket they've got lower cuts of beef, which are cheaper. Costco cleared out a good portion of their beef section and is featuring seafood, which is cheaper. But with electricity, you can't substitute. You either turn on the lights or you don't. So how do you think this plays out? It's shaping up to be the number one issue in the election next year.

Robert Bryce:

It is interesting, Jim, and it could be one of those rare issues where Democrats and Republicans align. It's a populist issue. For instance, Josh Hawley—a Republican in Missouri—railed against the Grain Belt Express high-voltage transmission line and got it killed. In Virginia, as you pointed out, candidates ran against data centers, saying they'll make them pay their fair share. That's Democrats running against big tech—and nobody likes big tech. So how this shakes out will be really interesting in November. Republicans may be on the defensive because Trump has had the big tech bros in the Oval Office and at the inauguration. Does he really want to stand next to Zuckerberg and Bezos as they build these data centers, or will he flip the script and say he's for consumers now? To be clear, we can't blame all the electricity price rises on data centers and big tech, but they're an easy target. This is about land use, affordability, local neighborhood issues—and these cross partisan lines.

Jim Puplava:

You know, this is the problem with the media today. It's easy, when there's a particular problem, to find somebody to blame it on—""Okay, it's the tech guys, that's why this is going on."" It's a lot more complex, as you talk about in your article and others have discussed: the green transition, more wind and solar, distant transmission lines, distribution rates, and so on. It's more complex, but if you can find someone to blame, it makes the story simple—""Ah, okay, it's the tech guys.""

Robert Bryce:

Well, I take your point. I'll add that what I fear—and I think my fear is well-founded—is that the big investor-owned utilities are only focused on their massive capital expenditure programs for the next few years: funding new high-voltage transmission, funding new generation. While they may not be able to say this is all for data centers, to them it doesn't matter. I've watched this for a long time. What do the big utilities care about? Getting as much of their expenditures into the rate base as possible. So far, public utility commissions have said, ""Sure, no problem."" We've seen that here in Texas, with Oncor proposing a 765kV line running from east to west out to the Permian Basin. The demand is in the Permian. Why build a power line across the state? Makes no sense—unless you're a utility that wants a rate base and an $80 billion project. Then it makes a lot of sense.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah. So this is going to play out. It's going to be the number one issue. It's funny—as you mentioned, we started out thinking about utilities. Me, being in the investment business, if I had someone older, conservative, wanted income, I'd put them in utilities: bread and butter, safe, not volatile. It's a whole different ballgame today with utilities.

Robert Bryce:

Oh, absolutely. It's interesting to take a step back and look at the utility sector and what's happening in commodities. I haven't checked the natural gas price today, but this cold spell has hit—sent gas prices up, I think it's over $5, the Henry Hub spot price. Remember, just two years ago, the average price for natural gas in the U.S. was $2.20. We're now more than double that. Then add in what we're seeing in the copper market, uranium, rare earths, all of these technologies require digging stuff out of the ground—and a lot of stuff. That's going to be a pinch point. I'll just add one other quick point: it's also about labor, Jim. This is another macro theme we've talked about before. You can talk about building all the data centers in the world, but you have to have skilled labor—men and some women willing to be there in the mud, cold, dark, and rain. The supply of those workers is very tight right now.

Jim Puplava:

Oh, it's incredible. I just added onto my house—putting in a hyperbaric chamber. I had an electrician out for three 20-amp circuits to power this, six hours a day: $1,500. If I had kids today thinking about college, I'd say go to trade school. You can become an electrician and in a couple of years you're making six figures. Here's an interesting thing I'll throw—

Robert Bryce:

And you happily paid that $1,500 too, didn't you? It wasn't a big expense for you, but to get it done right, you paid that. That's what we're seeing. I was at a conference a few weeks ago—a man who runs a lot of linemen, journeyman linemen. He's seeing other companies poaching his people, paying as much as $500 per day per diem to work in remote areas. The wage war to capture these skilled laborers is another big inflationary part of the economy that doesn't get much attention.

Jim Puplava:

Well, and this is something you're seeing—what's rather interesting, I'm looking at this from maybe a 40,000-foot level—but if you look at the '70s and '80s, we outsourced manufacturing, so we got the rust belt, blue-collar workers lost their jobs. Now, with AI, it's white-collar jobs being lost. The Wall Street Journal recently said it'll be the worst job market for graduating seniors next year. I can't turn on or pick up a newspaper without seeing some company laying off workers—Amazon, 40,000, because of AI. So to me, we don't have enough electricians, welders, plumbers, carpenters. Life is looking good for a blue-collar worker or tradesman over the next decade.

Robert Bryce:

Auto mechanics—I'll add that in. That's another key issue. There was also one—yes, using Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the Economic Policy and Innovation Center came out with a report last month. Since 1995, the participation rate in the labor force of men aged 16 to 24 has dropped from 71% to 55%, along with all the other social pathologies associated with increased loneliness, time online, and disengagement from social groups. The decline in labor force connection promises more social and economic problems. It's not just the folks our age—the people in their dotage, right? The workforce of the future is shrinking, and the men who should be starting their careers are dropping out of the workforce. That's very worrisome.

Jim Puplava:

It's an incredible time. We're going through probably one of the biggest transitions. I don't think we've fully grasped what's happening: reshoring, supply chain shortages we're trying to correct. We're scrambling to catch up for policy mistakes, in my opinion, made three or four decades ago.

Robert Bryce:

It is. It's funny you say that because I ask people about this a lot—is it more uncertain now? I have the sense, as you do, that we're in conflict with China—some of that self-imposed, right? Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs. I won't say we're at the brink of war with Russia, but we're in conflict. We have a president who one day goes this way, the next day the other. We're shooting supposed drug smugglers in the water—wait a minute! The level of uncertainty, economically, with massive debt in the U.S., where we're paying more for our debt than for national defense, upheaval in commodity markets, layoffs in oil, tech, and retail—it's an incredible amount of uncertainty. I wish I knew what was going to happen next, but I'm just trying to be defensive, be smart, and plan to keep working because I'm too young to retire—what else would I do?

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, it's amazing. We certainly live in interesting times. We shifted, Robert, probably three or four years ago—I'm now a little over 30% in commodities for clients: oil, gas, gold, silver, uranium, all these things. All this stuff we're trying to do—reshoring, the grid, energy—it takes raw materials. The government even came out and declared copper a strategic material. Silver is now a strategic material. We want to make all this stuff, but to do that—especially if you're bringing back manufacturing—you need commodities. You need stuff to make stuff.

Robert Bryce:

You're right. Let me see—I'm just looking at the Henry Hub price today. The front month price for January delivery is $5.31. What a massive jump. Of course, it's winter and prices always go up, but we've also seen the massive run-up in copper. Copper has been fairly flat for a while, but now, with the problems at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, copper's at $5.37 per pound—that's up 35% for the year. Silver's up over 100%. Gold's up 60%. Platinum's up 84%. It truly is a remarkable time. Even despite the run-up in gas prices, U.S. natural gas is still about half the cost of Europe or Asia. The key for the U.S. is to keep energy and power cheap, abundant, and reliable. That's the key to maintaining the U.S. advantage over the rest of the world.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, was on this week talking about how, if it weren't for the energy coming out now with the Trump administration taking off regulations, what he's trying to do and what other tech companies are trying to do wouldn't be possible. It's impossible.

Robert Bryce:

It's—AI is a power play. It's a play for watts. There was an interesting article the other day about Nvidia's chipsets: their power density, their power demand, keeps going up. It's a little counterintuitive to me, Jim, because my fifth book was Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper. The history of the computer age has been just that—smaller, faster, lighter, denser, cheaper—since ENIAC. The power demand went down, and the computing power went up. But now, with large language models and the rest, even with the increased efficiency of chips, the data demand and computational power demand have grown so fast that the power sector can't keep up with the compute sector.

Jim Puplava:

I've watched this over three or four decades. Right now, it's sort of the NIMBY idea: we don't want data centers; big tech are the bad people; utilities are also bad. Maybe we'll go against them or see what politicians try to do. Then we'll start having energy shortages, blackouts, because we don't have enough energy. Then the pendulum swings in the opposite direction.

Robert Bryce:

It may well be, but I think the land use conflicts are not going away. What still beggars belief is how—now, I have plenty of criticisms of the Trump administration, plenty—but on the energy front, I think they've been absolutely right on pretty much everything. What we haven't seen, Jim, is a similar move in Europe. Instead, the Brits, Germans, the EU—Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission—just yesterday or the day before said, ""We're moving toward energy independence."" I thought, ""You are so blind, you don't know what you're talking about,"" because they continue to think they're going to solve energy problems with wind, solar, and batteries. Just since January 1 in England, Ireland, and Scotland, there have been, I think, 65 rejections of wind and solar projects. So the idea that they're going to run on wind and solar—you can't build it. Local communities all over the British Isles are saying, ""Take this stuff and put it somewhere else.""

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, it's amazing. You keep talking about this land use thing—it's not only just the land use for wind farms and solar, but now you throw in data centers. And let's not forget, if you're going to build something like a Taiwan Semiconductor plant in Phoenix or Intel or Apple, those plants take massive amounts of land. We want to bring back all these factories, but you can't just go in the middle of a city, tear down buildings, and put up a two-square-mile manufacturing plant.

Robert Bryce:

That's certainly true. I mentioned I was in Abilene just yesterday, and this Stargate project is located northwest of Abilene. It's just a big area with cattle grazing and mesquite and huisache—so there's plenty of land in Texas, but that's not necessarily the case in Virginia, Data Center Alley near Dulles Airport. That's very land-constrained. The theme we're seeing with data centers is that the latest numbers show that some of the biggest installations are going where the gas is. I mentioned Abilene—almost spitting distance from the Permian Basin. In that part of Texas, natural gas is super cheap and abundant. Same in the Haynesville—Entergy is building a big gas-fired plant in Louisiana for Facebook. In Ohio, over the Utica, Facebook is building more capacity. In Pennsylvania, near the Marcellus, a lot of data centers are going in there. The hyperscalers—the big tech companies—are putting data centers where the gas is because that's their only way to get the power they need. It's a gas-to-power play.

Jim Puplava:

All right, well, Robert, as we close, any parting thoughts? Do you think Putin settles with Trump and the Ukrainians on this?

Robert Bryce:

Well, he hasn't settled yet. We've been looking at this same deal for two, three weeks now. I don't know. I wish he would, Jim. I hope and pray there's some settlement, but I don't see what—Trump's motivation is clear: he wants to see an end to this and call himself the peacemaker. But what's Putin's motivation to quit? I think he has a lot of incentives to keep the war going. I hope I'm wrong, but as he hasn't quit now, what incentives have changed that would make him do something different? From everything I hear—and it's only that—the Russian economy is doing fine. The longer the war goes, the more Putin is fine with that. As brutal as that is, I don't wish it to be true, but that's what it appears.

Jim Puplava:

Well, it's amazing because if he's successful in Ukraine, he's also been poking around in Europe. It's like resurrecting the old Soviet empire.

Robert Bryce:

It's a dangerous time. It's delicate to figure out the right way forward. I pray for peace, but I'm trying to be as sober about this as everything else. I want a good outcome, but again, this is just one of many uncertainties in a world that seems as fraught and dangerous as any time in my adult life.

Jim Puplava:

Hopefully, we can bring the country together on things, because at least in my lifetime, I've never seen the country as divided as it is today. You'd probably have to go back to the Civil War to see this much division.

Robert Bryce:

That's a good point. I don't know that that's true—I guess Ken Burns has a line, he's been talking lately, he has a new documentary coming out, and he said, ""The country has always been divided. What's different now?"" I think that's probably true. But the vitriol is what's been hard, and unfortunately, the Trump administration has fanned the flames of some of that. The midterms are going to be interesting. I'm curious to see who's going to run in '28—who the Democrats will put up. It's clear Gavin Newsom is running. But who's going to prevail on the Republican side? Economics and affordability, particularly on energy, as you've talked about, will be front and center.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, well, it looks like, at least from what I'm following, it could be Newsom and AOC. Among the candidates, Newsom seems to be at the top right now.

Robert Bryce:

He has the money, he's from a big state with a lot of electoral votes. He says he hasn't decided—he's decided. But he's from California, and as you say, the land of fruits and nuts. I think Republicans will say, ""Do you really want a California-style regime nationally with all these insane climate policies?"" They can point to his record on housing, a lot of things—he's vulnerable on his own record. There's no doubt the Democratic Party has moved further left and is now really the party of AOC, but Newsom—don't count him out. He's movie-star handsome, very good on the stump, but it's going to be a battle royale on the Republican side.

Jim Puplava:

Well, we live in interesting times. I'm just glad I own hard assets for my clients and we own some growth utilities. It's a different market. That's one of the things I've seen in the market over the years—every decade brings a different kind of cycle, stocks that drive it. Right now, I see the drive in commodity-type stocks. But anyway, as always, it's a pleasure having you on the program. I read your article, ""The Electricity War,"" and I hadn't heard anyone talk about that. So I wanted to have you on. You're my electricity man, my expert buddy.

Robert Bryce:

That's very kind, thanks. Don't forget robertbryce.substack.com.

Jim Puplava:

Hey Robert, tell them about your two documentary films—they're excellent. If you really want to understand electricity and what's going on, people should go watch them. They're very interesting and well done.

Robert Bryce:

Thank you. I've actually made a couple of mini-documentaries—""mini docs""—with my daughter Mary. One is ""Shrinking Fission"" on SMRs, about seven minutes. We also made one earlier this year called ""Sunblock: The Global Fight to Save Farmland from Big Solar."" I also did a feature-length documentary in 2019 with Tyson Culver called ""Juice: How Electricity Explains the World""—that's at juicethemovie.com. Then we did a five-part docuseries called ""Juice: Power, Politics, and the Grid."" Each segment's about 20 minutes, available at juicetheseries.com. All are free on YouTube. I'm easy to find—just search Robert Bryce on YouTube or Google. Thank you. I'm very proud of all the documentaries we've done—I'm very lucky to do what I do. It's my purpose and my passion, and I love to talk about this stuff.

Jim Puplava:

Well, you're very good at it, so I appreciate you coming on the program. Happy holidays, Merry Christmas, and a prosperous new year.

Robert Bryce:

Awesome. Thanks, Jim.

Article content

This revelation, emerging from life-cycle and supply chain audits, exposes the false claim behind Ottawa’s more than $50 billion experiment. A Volvo study found that manufacturing an EV generates 70 per cent more emissions than building a comparable conventional vehicle because battery production is energy-intensive and often powered by coal in countries such as China. Depending on the electricity grid, it can take years or never for an EV to offset that initial carbon debt.

Prime Minister Mark Carney paused the federal electric vehicle (EV) mandate for 2026 due to public pressure and corporate failures while keeping the 2030 and 2035 targets. The mandate requires 20 per cent of new vehicles sold in 2026 to be zero-emission, rising to 60 per cent in 2030 and 100 per cent in 2035. Carney inherited this policy crisis but is reluctant to abandon it.

Industry failures and Trump tariffs forced Ottawa’s hand. Northvolt received $240 million in federal subsidies for a Quebec battery plant before filing for bankruptcy. Lion Electric burned through $100 million before announcing layoffs. Arrival, a U.K.-based electric van and bus manufacturer, collapsed entirely. Stellantis and LG Energy Solution extracted $15 billion for Windsor. Volkswagen secured $13 billion for St. Thomas.

The federal government committed more than $50 billion in subsidies and tax credits to prop up Canada’s EV industry. Ottawa defended these payouts as necessary to match the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which offers major incentives for EV and battery manufacturing. That is twice Manitoba’s annual operating budget. Every Manitoban could have had a two-year tax holiday with the public money Ottawa wasted on EVs.

Even with incentives, EVs reached only 15 per cent of new vehicle sales in 2024, far short of the mandated levels for 2026 and 2030. When federal subsidies ended in January 2025, sales collapsed to nine per cent, revealing the true level of consumer demand. Dealer lots overflowed with unsold inventory. EV sales also slowed in the U.S. and Europe in 2024, showing that cooling demand is a broader trend.

As economist Friedrich Hayek observed, “The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.” Politicians and bureaucrats cannot know what millions of Canadians know about their own needs. When federal ministers mandate which vehicles Canadians must buy and which companies deserve billions, they substitute the judgment of a few hundred officials for the collective wisdom of an entire market.

Bureaucrats draft regulations that determine the vehicles Canadians must purchase years from now, as if they can predict technology and consumer preferences better than markets.

Green ideology provided perfect cover. Invoke a climate emergency and fiscal responsibility vanishes. Question more than $50 billion in subsidies and you are labelled a climate denier. Point out the environmental costs of battery production, and you are accused of spreading misinformation.

History repeatedly teaches that central planning always fails. Soviet five-year plans, Venezuela’s resource nationalization and Britain’s industrial policy failures all show the same pattern. Every attempt to run economies from political offices ends in misallocation, waste and outcomes opposite to those promised. Concentrated political power cannot ever match the intelligence of free markets responding to real prices and constraints.

Markets collect information that no central planner can access. Prices signal scarcity and value. Profits and losses reward accuracy and punish error. When governments override these mechanisms with mandates and subsidies, they impair the information system that enables rational economic decisions.

The EV mandate forced a technological shift and failed. Billions in subsidies went to failing companies. Taxpayers absorbed losses while corporations walked away. Workers lost their jobs.

Canada needs a full repeal of the EV mandate and a retreat from PMO planners directing market decisions. The law must be struck, not paused. The contrived 2030 and 2035 targets must be abandoned.

Markets, not cabinet ministers, must determine what technologies Canadians choose.

The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history. Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns. This poses many risks to all forms of life, according to the United Nations Climate Action.

Here are some benefits of fighting climate change from various sources, including Yale Climate Connections.

The benefits of fighting climate change

Cleaner air leads to fewer pollution-related illnesses, which means less money spent on medical treatments and fewer hospital admissions.

Reducing emissions helps prevent crop losses, which can save billions of dollars annually and enhance food security.

Transitioning to clean energy means investment in building new infrastructure like solar, wind farms, and manufacturing clean vehicles, creating demand for skilled jobs like engineers, electricians, and construction workers.

In most parts of the world, new renewable energy projects are already the most affordable source of power.

Energy efficiency upgrades in homes and buildings can lead to substantial reductions in energy bills for households.

Investing in clean energy can decouple economies from the volatile price swings and geopolitical shocks of the global fossil fuel market.

Here are some ways climate change impacts daily life from various sources, including the Environmental Defense Fund.

Higher grocery prices due to crop failures.

Increased energy bills from heatwaves.

Infrastructure damage from floods.

Health risks include heat stress and respiratory issues.

Inaction on climate change exposes economies to massive costs from extreme weather events, infrastructure damage, and agricultural losses, according to the World Resources Institute. The global economic benefits from avoided damages and short-term improvements could increase globally by up to 3% by 2050.

By reducing emissions, climate action lessens the frequency and intensity of these costly disruptions.

Taking climate action in the United States can save at least $4 billion by the end of the century on road maintenance alone, according to Yale Climate Connections.

At a hearing before the Pennsylvania House Committee on Energy, several witnesses cautioned against the bill’s renewable mandate.
Josh Shapiro should drop his own attempts to tax reliable energy sources and force renewable energy on consumers.
Or are we truly going to work toward Pennsylvania energy dominance?","In July, nearly two dozen companies gathered in Pittsburgh, along with President Donald Trump and other leaders, to announce investments in data centers and needed energy infrastructure. Totaling more than $90 billion, the expenditures would equal nearly ten percent of Pennsylvania’s gross domestic product, inducing a headline that described the prospect as “truly mind-blowing.”

Since then, some have begun erecting regulatory obstacles to this development. Presented as consumer protections, many are more likely to be economy killers — and “mind-blowing” for would-be reformers of 164,000 regulations already dampening Pennsylvania’s business climate.

Consider a six-bill package introduced by seven Democrat members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives “to encourage the responsible development of A.I. data centers addressing water and energy use, emergency preparedness,” and more.

Pennsylvania has power plants, steel mills, factories, coal mines, and acres of warehouses–all of which deal with a host of regulations to address these same issues. One bill would impose energy-efficiency standards on data centers when there is no more powerful incentive for prudent use of resources than the profit motive.

Why are lawmakers specifically targeting these information processors?

“This is an attempt to throttle new data centers to prevent more natural gas from being used to power them,” writes Jim Willis, publisher of Marcellus Drilling News. “‘Responsible development’ is code for no development.”

A seventh House bill, titled the “Data Center Act,” would require the eponymous facilities to get at least 25 percent of their energy from so-called renewable sources, defined as wind, solar, biomass, and hydroelectric.

Such market meddling has contributed to rising electricity prices and a more fragile power grid by giving preferential treatment to expensive and unreliable energy sources–particularly wind and solar. Moreover, misguided policies have shortened or ended operations for more practical technologies, such as coal- and natural gas-fired power plants.

At a hearing before the Pennsylvania House Committee on Energy, several witnesses cautioned against the bill’s renewable mandate. They included Stephen DeFrank, chairman of the state Public Utility Commission; Joe Bowring, an independent market monitor with PJM Interconnection; Dr. Amy Brinton, director of government affairs with the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry; Rob Bair, president of the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council; and Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy with the Data Center Coalition.

State Rep. Mike Armanini, one of at least two Republican committee members opposing the mandate, noted that a 2019 proposal by then-Gov. Tom Wolf to impose a tax on fossil fuels had discouraged investment in natural gas plants. He also said that another House committee “would kill the natural gas industry” with a proposal to establish a gas-well setback of nearly a mile.

State Rep. Rob Matzie, a Democrat and the bill’s prime sponsor, agreed that avoiding overregulation was important. But Matzie insisted that policymakers should “promulgate some regulations early from a temporary perspective, and then move forward.”

Perhaps Matzie is testing political winds with the mandate provision. However, once enacted, most regulations are about as “temporary” as the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Enacted two decades ago, the state’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act (AEPS) cost electricity customers more than $700 million in 2024 in compliance costs alone. Meanwhile, the wind and solar energy it subsidizes remains unreliable and too expensive to survive in a free market.

In Arizona, regulators have voted unanimously to begin repealing that state’s version of AEPS, reports the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Rating states based on various policies, ALEC ranks Arizona near the top nationally, at second and sixth for economic performance and economic outlook, respectively. On the other hand, Pennsylvania’s rankings are a pathetic 44th and 36th.

Noting Arizona’s economic success, ALEC partially credits the state’s “infrastructure capacity to support resource-intensive industries,” such as data centers that “require dependable, uninterrupted sources of baseload electricity to stay operational.”

If there is to be legislation on data centers, a proposal by state Sen. Camera Bartolotta offers a more viable solution. Barlotta’s bill would expedite permits for projects that meet or exceed federal standards.

Better still would be fulfilling the promise of broad permitting reform in a recent budget agreement. And while budget negotiations ended the threatened implementation of Wolf’s 2019 tax on fossil fuels, Gov. Josh Shapiro should drop his own attempts to tax reliable energy sources and force renewable energy on consumers.

As Rep. Armanini put it: “What are we going to do with Pennsylvania? Are we going to overregulate it and not let [the energy] industry grow? Or are we truly going to work toward Pennsylvania energy dominance? … We need to get into the game of being competitive.”

A competitive Pennsylvania is not out of reach. Thankfully, regulatory reform found its way into the newly minted state budget, suggesting the push for commonsense regulation is quickly gaining momentum in Harrisburg.

In eight years, energy storage went from a tiny player to one of the largest sources of new power on the U.S. grid.
Experts say that lessons learned there can help other regions deploy battery storage onto their grids, including the Midwest and East Coast, which are buckling under the weight of new data center construction.
Sizable Energy is working on a novel way to store power in flexible reservoirs that float in the open ocean.
And, Cache Energy has developed inexpensive pellets of calcium hydroxide that could store energy for months with minimal losses.","Nearly a decade ago, when the energy storage market was in its infancy, an industry organization set a dreamy goal: By the end of 2025, the U.S. would deploy 35 gigawatts of batteries connected to the grid.

So how’d the storage industry do? In the third quarter, 4.7 gigawatts of batteries were installed. In sum, more than 40 gigawatts have been deployed, and the year isn’t over, Canary Media reported. In eight years, energy storage went from a tiny player to one of the largest sources of new power on the U.S. grid.

What’s more, that’s nearly half of all new renewable power deployed on the grid for July through September, and this year, renewables have been the leading source of all new capacity, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Much of the new storage capacity has been deployed in Arizona, California, and Texas, states where the grid has been strained in recent years. Experts say that lessons learned there can help other regions deploy battery storage onto their grids, including the Midwest and East Coast, which are buckling under the weight of new data center construction.

Startups have been taking note.

Redwood Materials, which was co-founded by Tesla alumnus JB Straubel, in June added a new business line focused on repurposing used EV batteries for grid-scale storage. The company noticed two overlapping trends: The batteries that were arriving at its recycling facilities still had plenty of life left in them, and meanwhile, the battery storage industry was growing in leaps and bounds.

By 2028, Redwood plans to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours’ worth of battery storage. Investors have voiced their approval, investing another $350 million in the company to propel the new business line.

Another startup, Base Power, has taken a slightly different tack, leasing batteries to homeowners and aggregating them to serve as a large virtual power plant. The Austin-based startup raised $1 billion in October to help build a battery factory and fuel its expansion beyond Texas. The company has deployed more than 100 megawatt-hours of batteries in Texas.

While lithium-ion batteries have dominated new installations, other startups are pursuing other technologies that could lower storage costs significantly.

Sizable Energy is working on a novel way to store power in flexible reservoirs that float in the open ocean. Fourth Power is using blocks of carbon to store heat at super-high temperatures, and it’s looking to deploy them in 2028 at a cost that’s lower than lithium-ion batteries or peaking natural gas power plants. XL Batteries is deploying its flow-battery technology at petrochemical storage sites, allowing it to store hundreds of megawatt-hours using existing infrastructure. And, Cache Energy has developed inexpensive pellets of calcium hydroxide that could store energy for months with minimal losses.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Modular_Data_Center_2.jpg?resize=1200,675",N,,2025-12-06 11:03:52.258535

Pacific Gas & Electric, which owns the Diablo Canyon Power Plant, needs approval from the Coastal Commission to keep it running after it was scheduled to shut down this year. It’s one of the last permits needed to stay open after lawmakers approved it to continue operating until 2030.

Although situated 325 miles north of San Diego on the Central Coast, what happens within the plant’s concrete domes has implications for the Southern California metropolitan area, too.

Ahead of next week’s meeting, I wanted to get a better understanding of Diablo Canyon’s importance, the decades-long controversy that surrounds it, and what its continued operation means for ratepayers in San Diego.

Why Lawmakers Are Talking About the Plant Now

Diablo Canyon is a 40-year-old power plant in Avila Beach that generates about 9 percent of the state’s total energy. Its towering concrete cylinders and highlighter-green control room simulator are a snapshot in time, largely unchanged from when the plant began operating. Plans to phase it out in 2025 commenced nearly a decade ago.

Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2022 authorized the plant to stay open past its scheduled closure this year after heat-related blackouts the year prior sparked concerns over the reliability of California’s power grid.

Lawmakers pushed through a $1.4 billion state loan to keep it open, against the wishes of some Democrats skeptical of continuing to include nuclear power in the state’s portfolio of clean energy.

The Plant Remains Controversial Despite Growing Popularity of Nuclear Energy

The plant has been marred by controversy since it began operating off the San Luis Obispo coast in 1985. Advocacy groups such as Mothers for Peace have scrutinized its two nuclear reactors for decades over concerns about its waste, which remains radioactive for centuries.

Critics also point to the 2.5 billions of gallons of sea water it pulls in from the Pacific Ocean each day to cool its systems, its damage to marine life, and crisscrossing earthquake fault lines near its reactors as other dangers.

PG&E has maintained the plant is safe to operate and produces little carbon pollution, something proponents of nuclear energy and policymakers have largely embraced as the need for energy continues to grow statewide and nuclear reactors become a more attractive option.

Costs to Keep the PG&E Plant Open Are Hitting Ratepayers’ Pocketbooks, Including in San Diego

How the operators will afford to keep the plant running has been a questionever since lawmakers approved the $1.4 billion loan to keep it open for the next five years, which was to be paid back through federal loans and, if those didn’t fully materialize, profits generated from 2029 to 2030.

As much as $588 million is unlikely to come in, due to insufficient federal funding and projected profits, a report by CalMatters found.

Last year, the California Public Utilities Commission approved $722 million in ratepayer funds to go toward the plant’s operating costs this year. Those rate hikes were spread across customers of all the major investor-owned companies for the first time in history, including Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, because its power helps offset costs for all customers, PG&E said at the time.

That meant SDG&E customers paid $2 a month on average this year to help fund the plant, according to reporting from the San Francisco Chronicle.

The legislation to keep Diablo Canyon open, SB 846, allowed PG&E to do this because it’s seen as an asset to everyone in the state. PG&E has forecast it will cost SDG&E customers $12.6 million in 2026.

This is in addition to rising electricity bills for Californians, which are already among the highest in the country.

Nuclear energy critics and consumer advocates say that burdening ratepayers to fund Diablo Canyon and its environmental impacts are reasons to demand certain conservation requirements from the company to move forward with the permitting process.

The Coastal Commission Is Requiring PG&E to Conserve Land Around the Plant to Keep Operating

Last month, commission staff recommended that 1,100 of the 12,000 acres owned by the company at the site be set aside for conservation and public access to compensate for the estimated 2.5 billion larval fish the plant damages each year.

They also recommended increasing the acreage amount from 1,100 to 3,300 if the plant is approved to operate past 2030, which PG&E is seeking to do with federal regulators.

Commissioners took issue with the staff’s recommendation, wanting more concessions from the company to conserve a larger portion of the Diablo Canyon lands before giving the OK.

This is what the Dec. 11 hearing will be about, and commissioners are expected to approve the permit.

Sen. John Laird and Assemblymember Dawn Addis, both Democrats, wrote a letter to the commission ahead of its November meeting urging them to require PG&E to conserve more land because there was no guarantee that the state would allow the plant to continue running past 2030.

“We are not attempting to reject this permit application to extend Diablo Canyon’s operation until 2030,” Laird said in a statement after the November meeting. “The issue before the commission is rather how much of the Diablo Canyon lands to protect.”

In a 49-45 vote, the Senate passed a resolution overturning a 2024 Interior Department plan that would have limited oil and gas lease sales to about 400,000 acres within the 1.56-million-acre Arctic Wildlife Refuge. One Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, voted with Democrats to oppose the resolution. The legislation is now on the president’s desk awaiting signature.

Federal lease sales in Alaska will now revert to a framework developed in 2020 by the Trump administration that had opened most of the Coastal Plain to oil and gas development. In October, the Interior Department said it would move to restore lease sales to the entire Coastal Plain as part of Trump’s U.S. energy dominance agenda.

The president’s One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in July, includes provisions mandating six oil and gas lease sales in the Cook Inlet Planning Area in Alaska’s federal waters between 2026 and 2032, compared to two auctions covering the same area during the Biden administration.

Alaska’s all-Republican congressional delegation introduced and cosponsored the legislation. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said after the vote that a return to “balanced management” on the Coastal Plain will support U.S. energy independence.

Kristen Moreland, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, a group formed in 1988 by Alaska Natives opposed to oil drilling on the Coastal Plain, said the Senate vote ignored local concerns. The group has said the Coastal Plain is a critical habitat for Porcupine caribou.

“This action from DC ignores years of consultation and communication with our Gwich’in communities that rely on this landscape for not only our subsistence and survival, but also our culture and spiritual health and well-being,” Moreland said on the group’s website. “We stand united in our opposition to any oil and gas development in the Arctic Refuge and will continue to fight this effort from the Trump administration and decision-makers who ignore our voices.”

Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law organization, also said the vote prioritizes energy production over wildlife protections.

Groups supporting the push to open the Refuge to energy production include Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, whose members include leaders living in the North Slope region; Kaktovik Iñupiat Corp, the village corporation for Kaktovik, the only community located within the coastal plain; and North Slope Borough, a local government organization in Alaska that supports resource development to fund essential services like schools, infrastructure and emergency services.

As mandated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Congress in 2017, the first-ever lease sale of tracts in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge occurred on Jan. 6, 2021.

Seven of the nine bids accepted at the 2021 auction went to the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state-owned corporation, but those leases were canceled by the Biden administration in September 2023.

Chase. The failure, according to a press release, could lead to increased hazardous air pollutants being released into the environment.

The penalties the company faces include three years of probation, 500 hours of community service to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara (MHA) Nation, and payment of a $500,000 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) Clean Air Act violation fine.

Targa Badlands LLC had pleaded guilty to the offense earlier this year.

According to the press release, Targa Badlands LLC was also responsible for self-identifying, self-reporting, and correcting the failure.

“Today’s sentence underscores the importance of enforcing our environmental laws, which protect the land, water, and communities,” said US Attorney Chase. “At the same time, we recognize that Targa Badlands LLC took responsibility for its actions and self-reported the violation. Natural gas production is vital to our state’s economy, and it must be done responsibly. This case demonstrates that we can support strong energy production while holding companies accountable when they fall short of their legal obligations.”

Under NESHAP, Targa Badlands LLC was required to timely install continuous parameter monitoring systems on two engines in the Johnson Compressor Station, located in Dunn County. Targa Badlands LLC operated the Station between 2018 and 2022. Continuous parameter monitoring systems monitor and collect data on temperature and pressure for engine operations to ensure the catalyst is being utilized properly, thereby ensuring that the engine does not produce excess emissions.

The 2025 case against Targa Badlands LLC followed two earlier occasions in which the company had agreed to pay civil penalties to the United States for separate NESHAP violations pertaining to natural gas compressor stations operated by the company on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, according to a press statement.

And ultimately, by elevating issues such as technology transfer in Belém, Brazil flexed its influence as a middle power on the world stage.
The climate conference in the jungle made clear that the global energy transition is moving forward without the White House.","At the Polycrisis, we’ve been charting the shifting relationship between climate policy and geopolitics. We have been especially interested in two shifts. The first is the mainstream recognition that action on climate means meaningful action on development goals. The second is the emerging understanding that climate is about industrialization. Until recently, multilateral climate politics have been based on transfers of money and technology from industrialized to less developed countries, and on stable relations between the US and China. This has been upended. What will take its place?

Previous editions of the Polycrisis have spotlit the way that money is sloshing out of poor countries and into the coffers of rich ones. We’ve also focused on the “new nonalignment,” where large, capable and regionally powerful countries like Brazil are setting agendas for the entire world. Elsewhere we have looked at China’s new role as the leader of future technology. For this edition, we asked Rio-based journalist Catherine Osborn, who writes the weekly Latin America brief at Foreign Policy, to assess the UN Climate Conference in Brazil.

This is an updated version of an article that first appeared in Foreign Policy.

Last month, the humid Amazonian rainforest city of Belém, Brazil was alive with all the usual signs of a United Nations climate summit except one: a US negotiating team. Tens of thousands of participants from more than 190 countries and dozens of Indigenous groups staged two weeks of meetings, protests, and negotiations during this year’s summit, known as COP30. Though no US diplomats were present, a handful of conference-goers weaved through the crowds with white-and-green “Make Science Great Again” hats. California Governor Gavin Newsom made a defiant appearance.

This year’s conference was the first since Donald Trump returned to the White House and triggered the United States’ second exit from the 2015 Paris Agreement. This time, Trump had gone beyond withdrawing from international climate diplomacy and was actively working to undermine it. Sanctions threats in October against envoys from countries on the verge of reaching a landmark deal to limit global shipping pollution succeeded in blocking the agreement.

The threat of potential US sabotage hung over Belém as countries negotiated if and how they would speed up climate action. Trump’s pressure offered potential political cover to delegations that were already dragging their feet on climate issues for any number of reasons. Saudi Arabia, for example, had moved in lockstep with the United States to torpedo the shipping pollution deal.

Against this adverse political backdrop, a key pillar of Brazil’s approach to COP30 was what some climate strategists have called “coalitions of the doing.” Rather than waiting for absolute consensus among UN member states, Brazil tried to move in smaller groups to push action forward and emphasize how climate action can lead to economic development. By conventional metrics of COP summits, this one yielded incremental progress rather than any big breakthrough—showing the UN climate regime is surviving, but only barely.

Forest fund

Since their inception in the 1990s, UN climate conferences have aimed to compile an annual set of decisions that require the unanimous consent of more than 190 countries, plus the European Union. These yearly agreements have famously committed countries to work toward limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, an agreement reached in Paris in 2015, and to transition away from fossil fuels, agreed upon in Dubai in 2023.

But many targets set at past conferences have not been met. As a result—and given geopolitical headwinds—Brazilian officials said that Belém should focus more on implementing existing goals than on setting new unanimous targets.

To address unmet climate pledges, Brazilian officials focused extra energy on countries that are eager to engage. This is a growing trend at COP summits: Because the unanimous agreements can be vague and cautious, in recent years, countries have united in smaller groups to set more ambitious targets. These include pledges to end deforestation and reduce heat-trapping methane emissions by 30 percent (compared to 2020 levels) by the end of this decade.

For COP30, Brasília helped craft a plan for a new investment fund to protect tropical forests that had received at least $6.7 billion in pledges by the end of November. Brazil and the United Kingdom announced a program to help seven countries track and reduce so-called super pollutants such as methane. And Brazil rallied at least sixteen countries and the EU to join a group devoted to collaborating on carbon markets.

With the forest fund, Brazil overcame a potential obstacle from the United States. The fund’s technical supervision is due to be carried out by the World Bank, where Washington is the largest shareholder. Earlier this year, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for the bank to deprioritize some of its climate-related work. If the United States wanted to block the bank’s participation in the forest fund, it likely could have.

“The World Bank is a multilateral institution, and many of its members emphatically supported the idea,” senior Brazilian Finance Ministry official Rafael Dubeux said. The project’s backers carefully emphasized that it was focused on forests rather than climate change more broadly. The fund got the green light.

The Brazilian summit hosts also emphasized the economic dividends of climate action. They are far from alone in this approach. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in July that countries clinging to fossil fuels are “missing the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century.” Finnish President Alexander Stubb echoed this language in Belém, calling climate investments a “growth and prosperity plan.”

Globally, investments in clean energy this year are on track to be double those in fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. But the trend is uneven across the world. China dominates global production of green technologies such as solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines, far outpacing the United States. Although the adoption of these products is speeding decarbonization across the developing world, without transfer of the underlying technologies, countries might miss the opportunity to develop green industries at home.

Labor organizers in Brazil are worried about importing green technologies rather than building them domestically, said Deyvid Bacelar, the general coordinator at the Brazilian Unified Federation of Oil Workers. Though some oil workers might one day get clean energy jobs due to decarbonization, Bacelar pointed to union research that found that in jobs such as installing imported solar panels, “the pay is lower, and the benefits are worse.”

Though Brazil is rich in many of the raw ingredients for the energy transition, that does not guarantee decent work, Bacelar warned: “We hope the government works so there are green industries in Brazil with well-paying jobs, instead of our country’s role being only selling raw materials.”

At COP30, Brazil called for green dividends to be shared among countries. Several top officials in the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva administration had already crafted national policies to try to address these concerns. (Lula is a former union leader.) Furthermore, the state government of Bahia, home to a BYD plant, secured commitments from the Chinese automotive giant to build a local research center, use Brazilian components in its vehicles, and train local workers—using the prospect of access to the large Brazilian market to bargain for a higher-value slice of China’s massive green overseas investments.

Until now, green industrialization has been less prominent in the COP agenda. Lula highlighted the importance of technology transfers in speeches ahead of the Belém conference. And on its fifth day, Brazil and a dozen other countries including Indonesia, Germany, South Africa, South Korea, and the United Kingdom pledged to create a secretariat for cooperation on green industrialization, saying in a joint declaration that the process must “address, rather than deepen global inequalities.”

The declaration also pledged to work to align countries’ standards about which goods count as low carbon. That can benefit both developed and developing countries, said Linda Kalcher, the executive director at European climate consultancy Strategic Perspectives: “Not only does it help the Europeans import material that meets their standard, it also helps them diversify away from one single supplier. … Most importantly, it builds value chains in other countries.”

Roadmaps?

Confirming climate advocates’ pre-conference worries about the bleak state of multilateralism—and climate cooperation in particular—COP30’s negotiated decision included only limited steps forward, with much of the noteworthy news occurring on the sidelines.

One of the main accomplishments in the summit decision was a commitment for countries to triple the amount of money globally available for climate adaptation by 2035. A decision on this topic was broadly expected, and had been seen as an indicator of whether the UN climate regime as enshrined in the Paris Agreement—cooperation by 190+ countries—was still producing results.

Climate adaptation funding often goes to projects without a quick and straightforward financial profit. These include sea walls to prevent flooding and irrigation systems to help farmers cope with droughts. “The private sector will not spend a lot of money on [climate] adaptation, full stop,” Kalcher said. That’s why years of UN talks have formalized the requirement for governments, especially in richer countries, to help pay. If climate diplomacy is reduced merely to small-group coalitions of the doing, poor countries may be left stranded.

On other topics, and for more ambitious countries, the COP30 decision fell short. In a surprise move, Lula at the start of the conference called for economic roadmaps away from fossil fuel dependence after years of reluctance to endorse the idea. Including this concept in the summit decision would advance a vague 2023 COP outcome on the need for countries to transition away from fossil fuels. Lula’s comments prompted a frantic push to codify the topic, which won support from more than eighty countries but ultimately failed.

While the US absence in Belém offered other actors the chance to show leadership—be they China, the European Union, or Brazil itself—some veteran climate hands came away from the summit with a feeling that “the wheels came off,” in the words of former UN climate boss Yvo de Boer.

For others, the conference was simply a sign of the difficult geopolitical times. And many countries vowed to work outside the summit to keep advancing topics discussed there. Brazil pledged to publish ideas for roadmaps away from fossil fuels over the course of the next year, and Colombia and the Netherlands announced they will host a conference on the topic in April.

The debate on roadmaps is moving forward much like the debate on equitable green industrialization: through a coalition of the doing rather than via a unanimous decision. And ultimately, by elevating issues such as technology transfer in Belém, Brazil flexed its influence as a middle power on the world stage.

In September, energy prices overall were 2.8 percent higher than they were a year ago.
As of September, electricity prices are up 5.1 percent compared to a year ago, but in some places, the gain is much starker.
He added that seeing relatively low gas prices may in fact add to the anger that some are feeling about electric prices.
Experts have pointed to additional factors in high electricity prices, including expensive upgrades to the grid needed because of storm damage.","Gasoline prices are down while electric and natural gas costs are up, turning the issue of energy affordability into a political Rorschach test.

Democrats are lambasting the White House for high power bills, while President Trump and his allies tout low prices at the pump.

“Energy — gasoline — we’re now at about $2.50 a gallon. We’re going to be, I think, at $2 a gallon. We could even crack that at some point,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting this week.

In recent days, the national average price of gasoline has dipped below $3 per gallon, standing at $2.98 on Friday, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA).

“Our prices now for energy, for gasoline, are really low,” Trump added.

Meanwhile, multiple Democrats have decried rising electricity prices in the past few weeks.

“Everyone needs to be screaming about this. Energy costs are up 11% under Trump and families are getting their power shut off,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said in a post on X this week. “This winter that will be deadly. We need to take action now.”

Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Christopher Knittel said there’s some truth to what each side is saying.

“They can both be right that electricity prices are certainly growing at much faster than the rate of inflation. Oil prices have fallen somewhat,” Knittel said.

He noted that what the ultimate impact on consumers will depend on how much gasoline they use compared to how much electricity, “and that varies a lot by household.”

Nationwide, energy prices have risen at a comparable pace to inflation over the last year, but there’s wide variance across both location and the type of energy.

In September, energy prices overall were 2.8 percent higher than they were a year ago. This gain is slightly smaller than inflation overall, which rose by 3 percent over the last year.

Gasoline prices are down compared to a year ago. Friday’s price was down slightly from a year prior, when the national average was $3.03 per gallon. However, this is much lower than prices were a few years ago, at the height of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the economic re-opening after the COVID-19 vaccine. In 2022, the national average gasoline price reached just over $5 per gallon.

Presidential policy really only has limited influence over gas prices, as gasoline is traded globally and in the U.S. is only produced by private companies, not the government.

As of September, electricity prices are up 5.1 percent compared to a year ago, but in some places, the gain is much starker.

In New Jersey, for example, where power prices have become a major political issue, residential electric prices in September were 21 percent higher than they were the year before. In Washington, D.C., they were up 31 percent.

Meanwhile, the price of piped gas used in utilities has grown even more sharply, up 11.7 percent in September over the year before.

“U.S. gas production is not keeping up with increases in U.S. gas demand, and most of that U.S. gas demand is coming from LNG exports,” said Ira Joseph, senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, referring to liquified natural gas.

Joseph added that cold temperatures at the start of this year also contributed to the issue.

Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said that rising electricity prices are stretching already thin budgets for many families.

“Low- and moderate-income families live on very tight budgets … and they notice prices that go up,” Wolfe told The Hill.

“They talk about food, they talk about housing, but now they’re talking about electric bills as well. That’s new. I think it’s because the bills have gone up so rapidly,” he said.

He added that seeing relatively low gas prices may in fact add to the anger that some are feeling about electric prices.

“Many people think energy is energy….and I think that they’re aware of the gasoline prices becoming more affordable. Why isn’t their electric bill becoming more affordable?” he said.

Specifically, Wolfe said that one source of this frustration is the rise of power-hungry data centers.

He said people will ask: “‘Why aren’t they paying their share? Why are we paying for data centers?’ I think that’s what the political issue is becoming.”

Data centers are just one piece of the puzzle. Experts have pointed to additional factors in high electricity prices, including expensive upgrades to the grid needed because of storm damage.

According to EPRI, an energy research and development institute, gasoline is the largest energy cost for the average American household, making up an average of $2,930 in expenditures per household in 2024.

That’s compared to $1,850 for electricity, according to the organization, which receives some funding from the electric utility industry, as well as the federal government.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s overall impact on energy prices remains to be seen — as some of his actions are expected to raise prices while others are expected to lower them.

The president’s efforts to cut climate and pollution regulations on the power sector are expected to bring costs down. However, his efforts to ax subsidies for renewable energy are expected to raise them.

“On the exporting of natural gas…as this administration incentivizes more exports, that’s going to take supply away from U.S. households, and that’s going to tend to increase natural gas prices. That’s basic supply and demand,” said Knittel, the MIT professor.

“Getting rid of the subsidies on renewables is going to put upward pressure on electricity prices, so that’s going to be counterbalanced by their reduced environmental regulations on existing … fossil fuel plants. So we don’t quite know yet what the net effect of both of those are, but their policies are pushing in different directions on electricity,” he added.

But, Knittel continued, the Trump administration is not to blame for high electric prices, at least not yet.

“Electricity prices have been going up for the past two decades, so we can’t blame a year’s worth of Trump policies for what we’ve seen,” he said.

The issue is part of a broader struggle between Democrats and Republicans to convince voters that they are the better party for the economy.

During his recent Cabinet meeting, Trump slammed Democrats’ use of the word “affordability” as a “con job.”

“There’s this fake narrative that the Democrats talk about ‘affordability.’ They just say the word. It doesn’t mean anything to anybody,” he said, arguing that he inherited a significant amount of inflation.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/GasolinePrices_Frazin_AP_DavidZalubowski.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-06 08:58:20.962506

In truth, I do not believe we need nuclear power, because there is now a cheaper and safer option.
Today, the battery that is destined to be a global game changer is the sodium ion battery.
Consider these benefits: Sodium batteries maintain efficiency in cold temperatures far better than current lithium ion or lithium iron batteries.
The Chinese company CATL offers the Naxtra sodium ion battery, which performs with high efficiency at temperatures of minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.","Last year, The Daily Star published a commentary on my observations of climate change over a span of several decades. Now that another year has passed, I’d like to update that column and offer some new thoughts.

In my prior commentary, titled “Observing Local Climate Change for 36 Years,” from the Sept. 14, 2024 edition of The Star, I warned that we were in a new climate regime, where the meaning of a “200-year storm” or a “500-year storm” was largely obsolete, because there is no longer any true reference for the climate conditions we are now experiencing. I also warned that we were likely to see local weather events beyond our imagining. Since that column, we have dodged a local weather disaster on the scale of the floods of 2006 and 2011, but we have seen catastrophic events around the country, notably the terrible flooding in western North Carolina from hurricane Helene, the wildfires in metro Los Angeles, and the Texas hill country flood.

More recently, Hurricane Melissa became one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic basin, and possibly the most powerful, as it made landfall on the southern coast of Jamaica on Oct. 28. I say possibly because the crisp, near perfect circularity of the storm’s eyewall exceeded the capacity of the NOAA satellite algorithm to measure the storm’s intensity.

These events are happening with a frequency that was unimaginable only a few years ago. This non-linear acceleration will continue as long as we pump fossil fuel emissions into the atmosphere. Sadly, on a global scale, that is exactly what we’re doing. When I posted my prior column, the CO2 reading in parts per million at the Mona Loa Observatory for May 2024 was 427 parts per million. This May, the reading was 430.58 ppm — the greatest yearly increase in the history of record keeping. (In March of 1958, when George Keeling made his first measurement at Mona Loa, the CO2 in the atmosphere was 313 ppm.)

In my commentary last year, I made an appeal for us to set aside our NIMBY reflex and support local renewable development, both solar and wind. I also endorsed nuclear power as the best base load complement to renewables and cited Nobel Laureate Burton Richter’s assessment that wind and solar could provide 90% of the national grid, with nuclear supplying 10% to cover the problem of intermittency. I still believe nuclear is a safe complement to renewable power, but I have changed my thinking on its necessity. In truth, I do not believe we need nuclear power, because there is now a cheaper and safer option.

That option is batteries — not the lithium ion currently used in most electric vehicles, or the second-generation lithium iron used in back-up for homes and businesses. Today, the battery that is destined to be a global game changer is the sodium ion battery.

Sodium ion batteries have been around for at least a decade, but recent technical breakthroughs have transformed them into a power source that is truly wonderous. Consider these benefits:

Sodium batteries maintain efficiency in cold temperatures far better than current lithium ion or lithium iron batteries. This makes them ideally suited for winters in places like Upstate New York. The Chinese company CATL offers the Naxtra sodium ion battery, which performs with high efficiency at temperatures of minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

Because of their energy density, sodium batteries are comparable to lithium for battery energy storage, but are cheaper and safer. BYD, another Chinese company, offers the MC Cube-T sodium battery that provides 6.4 MWh of storage. That’s 64,000 watts of power! This unit fits into a 20-foot shipping container and is much cheaper than lithium batteries. What’s more, it performs better than lithium at both cold and hot temperature extremes, making it ideal for baseload storage for grids serving cities or even states.

Sodium batteries are available at much lower cost because the materials to make them are abundant and cheap. Another plus for sodium is the fact that they do not require bottleneck materials like lithium or cobalt, and no phosphorous — an element that is almost exclusively mined in one state in north Africa.

Sodium batteries are truly transformative in their potential to help the world decarbonize. Their significant lower cost, wider temperature range and faster recharge will accelerate trends that are already established. In cars, sodium will deliver EV range on parity with any gas-powered vehicles, with recharge in minutes. Internal combustion engines will make no sense when the EV alternative is cheaper, more reliable, lasts for hundreds of thousands of miles and maintains peak efficiency at temperatures of -40 F to +158 F. In a relatively short time, large trucks and even ships will be powered by sodium technology. It is happening in China already.

While great for transportation, sodium is equally transformative for base load storage. With cheap, compact, high efficiency battery units, homes and businesses, as well as towns and cities, can have dependable back-up power. When these batteries are linked with wind and solar generation, it is possible to have self-sufficient power indefinitely.

Climate heating is a serious concern. But renewable technology is advancing rapidly, including more affordable PVC panels, larger wind turbines and new battery innovations like sodium and next-generation designs. All that is needed now is the political will to deploy.",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-06 12:03:21.149847
