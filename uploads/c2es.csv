The agenda reflects the administration’s objective of rolling back US Environmental Protection Agency rules the administration perceives as burdensome to industry, hindering economic growth, and stifling innovation and competition, but it also introduces new proposed regulations, identifies ongoing environmental regulatory efforts, and retains some Biden-era proposals.

The proposed actions of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda) are broad, touching upon areas of climate, air, water, and chemicals (including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)) under nearly all major environmental statutory and permitting regimes. These actions are expected to have significant and far-reaching impacts on the nation’s environmental regulatory landscape and on regulated communities. Several notable aspects of the agenda are discussed herein.

CLIMATE AND AIR REGULATIONS

Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding

EPA expects to issue a final rule in September to repeal the 2009 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) endangerment finding, the landmark Obama-era finding that the combined atmospheric concentrations of six greenhouse gases constitute ""air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare.” The endangerment finding has been foundational to EPA’s regulatory approach to GHGs, acting as the legal basis for EPA’s regulation of GHGs, and directly influenced climate-related policy and litigation.

The proposed rule to repeal the endangerment finding was first published in July 2025, with the public comment period closing on September 22, 2025. The Unified Agenda reflects EPA’s objective to finalize that rulemaking this month.

Greenhouse Gas Reporting

The White House is actively reviewing proposals to reduce annual greenhouse gas reporting requirements for various industrial sectors, including power plants, oil refineries, coal mines, and manufacturers of petrochemicals, cement, glass, iron and steel. The reporting rule for non-oil-and-gas sectors is currently under review by the White House, and a final rule is anticipated in November 2025.

Emissions Standards

EPA announced a slew of planned national emission standards-related deregulatory actions, from compliance deadline extensions to relaxed emissions standards, that will impact a number of sectors and industries, including oil and gas, waste management, manufacturing, agriculture, chemicals, tire and rubber manufacturing, and commercial sterilization sectors, among others.

Relaxed rules affecting the oil and gas sector from the previous administration—including regulations for methane and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the oil and gas sector, revisions to the GHG Reporting Program Subpart W, and the Waste Emissions Charge in the Inflation Reduction Act—appear in the Unified Agenda. The Unified Agenda further includes intended air toxics emissions standards rollbacks for ethylene oxide (EtO), mercury, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride.

Cross-State Emissions

EPA intends to replace the now-defunct Biden-era 2023 “Good Neighbor” plan, which aimed to limit smog-forming emissions that cross state lines under the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards, with a new two-step process. The “Good Neighbor” program intended to require 23 states to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from power plants and other industrial sources to help downwind states achieve air quality standards for ozone. The Trump EPA believes that the 2023 rule impermissibly expanded federal rules to states and sectors “beyond the program’s traditional focus and led to the rejection of nearly all State Implementation Plans.”

EPA will also replace a stricter annual soot standard issued under the Biden administration. A final version of the relaxed standard is expected in February 2026, with a proposed rule expected in the fall.

WATER RULES

EPA identified sweeping rollbacks of various Biden-era Clean Water Act (CWA) rules that will impact a wide array of industries, including coal-fired power generators, steel mills, copper smelters, lime manufacturers, and bulk gasoline terminals.

Coal Power Plant Rules

EPA plans to revise a rule issued under the Biden administration that required coal power plants to install more advanced water pollution controls, with a proposed rule expected in November. Under the previous administration, EPA required power plant owners to virtually eliminate heavy metals and other harmful pollutants from three major waste streams through the installation of new technologies. Regulated entities had until 2029 to comply, or notify EPA by December 31, 2025 that they would permanently stop burning coal by 2034. The current EPA plans to extend those deadlines.

Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule

A proposed rule narrowing the scope of the CWA would restrict the types of water bodies regulated under the act and is expected to limit federal regulation of wetlands and small streams. Until a final rule is implemented or additional action taken, EPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) continue to follow the EPA and Corps’ joint March 2025 interim guidance regarding the definition of “waters of the United States.”

Section 401 Revision

EPA is also expected to roll back requirements under CWA Section 401, which requires applicants for a federal permit that may result in a discharge to “waters of the United States” to obtain a certification from the relevant state or tribe that the discharge will comply with state water quality standards. According to the agenda, the Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification Improvement Rule will “increase transparency, efficiency, and predictability” for states and energy companies seeking permits. The proposed rule is expected in December 2025.

RELAXED PFAS RULES

The US Administration is expected to pursue a number of Biden-era policies impacting PFAS, or “forever chemicals.” Plans are underway to finalize CWA regulations for monitoring and reporting PFAS in wastewater discharges, as well as to finalize effluent limitation guidelines (ELGs) for chemical manufacturers. Other rules are expected to be narrowed and deadlines extended.

Safe Drinking Water Act

As previously announced by the agency, EPA is expected to retain the enforceable four parts per trillion maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). However, it will propose a rule by October 2025 to extend the compliance deadline for water systems by an additional two years, with a final rule expected by April 2026.

EPA also intends to propose a rule in September 2025 to withdraw its regulatory determinations to regulate four PFAS (perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid and its ammonium salt (HFPO-DA, commonly known as GenX), and the mixture of these three PFAS plus perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS)) under the SDWA, and to rescind all associated regulatory provisions. This rule is expected to be finalized by February 2026.

The Unified Agenda also includes plans to finalize two Biden-era Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) PFAS rules, as well as a rule that would add 16 individual PFAS and 15 PFAS categories to the TRI.

EPA is also eyeing a more relaxed PFAS TSCA Section 8(a)(7) reporting rule. On August 9, it submitted the “Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Data Reporting and Recordkeeping under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); Revision to Regulation” to the US Office of Management and Budget. The rule aims to roll back a Biden-era PFAS reporting regulation under TSCA that required manufacturers and importers to submit information on their PFAS production volumes, disposal, exposures and hazards as far back as 2011, for both chemicals and articles.

EPA plans to propose a rule in December 2025 to incorporate “certain exemptions and other modifications to the scope of the [TSCA PFAS] reporting rule,” which is expected to be finalized by June 2026. EPA also delayed the start of the reporting period, which will now begin on April 13, 2026 and end on October 13, 2026 for most regulated parties. EPA cited the need to prepare the Central Data Exchange (CDX) reporting system as the reason behind the delayed reporting requirement.

The Unified Agenda also includes proposals to finalize the pending rules for regulation of nine PFAS as “hazardous constituents” under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), together with the associated rule definition amendments (to modify the regulations to confirm with the statutory definitions and EPA practice), both by April 2026. Notably absent from the Unified Agenda is any reference to rulemaking relating to the designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Refer to our May 16 LawFlash for more information about EPA’s PFAS agenda.

IMPLICATIONS

The Unified Agenda is largely deregulatory and underscores this administration’s actions to support US industry, with initial counts indicating EPA has the fourth most deregulatory actions of all federal agencies. EPA’s Unified Agenda items largely align with prior deregulatory announcements from EPA since January and are in line with various environmental and energy executive orders signed by the president during his first weeks in office aimed at unleashing US energy, lowering the cost of living for US families, and advancing cooperative federalism. Some of the new proposed rules included in the Unified Agenda also are deregulatory in nature because they seek to reverse prior rulemakings through the rulemaking process.

Rollbacks of EPA regulations, such as the Section 401 revision and narrowed WOTUS rule, will result in both the streamlining of the federal permitting process through the reversal or elimination of permitting hurdles and the need for fewer required federal permits. Fewer restrictions on air emissions and water discharges will ease regulatory burdens on all manner of industry, including stationary energy generation sources such as power plants and mobile sources, including vehicles and aircraft. Relaxed endangered species protections and eased leasing requirements are also expected to hasten domestic energy exploration and production.[1]

In all, these identified actions, which include completed, ongoing, and long-term rulemakings (i.e., those anticipated to be on a 12-month time horizon or longer), will have a resounding impact across industries. It will be imperative for stakeholders and members of the regulated communities to continue to monitor regulatory developments and related rulemaking activities. Interested parties should also take notice of stated rulemaking timelines included in the Unified Agenda, as these proposed deadlines (while not set in stone) are instructional. It can also be expected that these actions will spur challenges and litigation. Stakeholders should consider options for participation in the rulemaking process, such as through direct submission of comments in response to the rulemaking, or indirect participation through industry groups or other channels.

Dive Brief:

California lawmakers approved a sweeping energy package at the end of the legislative session that does not include funding to continue two grid reliability programs, including a virtual power plant advocates believe is the largest in the world.

Earlier this year, the state faced a $12 billion budget shortfall, and the two programs were in limbo for months as legislators negotiated down to the wire. The bills awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature after the session closed Saturday include proposals aimed at bringing down energy costs, expanding the Western grid and codifying virtual power plants in longterm planning.

Advocates say gutting the Demand Side Grid Support and Distributed Electricity Backup Assets programs threatens to undermine the state’s progress toward a more resilient grid that can respond to system stress by calling on batteries, electric vehicles, rooftop solar panels, smart thermostats and other energy resources that are increasingly common in homes, businesses and institutions.

Dive Insight:

Legislators created DSGS and DEBA in 2022 to try to improve reliability and avoid blackouts during emergencies. At one time, they were slated to receive nearly a billion dollars in state funds.

Kate Unger, senior policy advisor for the California Solar and Storage Association, said the DSGS program alone has more than one gigawatt of enrolled capacity, of which about 750 MW is batteries. The program is run by the California Energy Commission and offers customers, utilities and/or aggregators compensation in exchange for allowing their resources to be dispatched at times of grid stress.

A test event in July saw more than 500 MW of battery energy dispatched to the grid for two hours.

“I think we’re at a point now where I can actually see the program come to a grinding halt,” said Unger. “There appears to be a risk that DSGS providers and customers could participate in 2026 and not get paid.”

A study by The Brattle Group, commissioned by Sunrun and Tesla Energy, both of which participate in the DSGS program, concluded that the taxpayer-funded virtual power plant could reduce the need for gas peaker plants and has the potential to save ratepayers $206 million between 2025 and 2028.

After several rounds of appropriations and clawbacks, the programs had been expected to receive more than $400 million through at least 2028, funded primarily from California’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is funded by its cap and trade program.

Their fate, however, rested on the reauthorization of the cap and trade program, which was the centerpiece of a sprawling energy package that Newsom pushed through. The legislature passed a bill reauthorizing cap and trade and rebranding it as “cap and invest,” but without the grid reliability funding.

Edson Perez, senior principal at Advanced Energy United, expressed disappointment that the programs seemed to have been left on the cutting room floor amid intense negotiations and budget constraints.

“It just went into the black box of negotiations,” he said. “It is a huge missed opportunity.”

Perez said overall, reauthorizing cap and trade was a “great achievement” and he expressed hope that legislators would find another way to fund the grid reliability programs early next year.

“The Governor is steadfast in his commitment to building a more reliable, affordable, clean and safe power grid that can serve the evolving needs of millions of Californians in a hotter, drier climate,” a spokesperson for Newsom wrote in an email. “The reality is that California has rapidly deployed thousands of new megawatts in recent years meaning our grid is more resilient than it’s ever been.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/aij2CMW1E8FkQdp412zuJqTQmItFCxvCG0WleahOMCI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE4NDgyNDIxLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-16 18:00:44.678197

Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit , the benefit provides a tax discount of up to $7,500 for a new electric car, and up to $4,000 for a used one. It expires on Sept. 30.

The tax credit was approved as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 and initially set to last through 2032. That timeline was cut short, however, by Congress’ recent tax and spending-cut law, known as the “one big, beautiful bill,” which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades.

The electric vehicle credits are income-based. For a new car, the benefit applies to people whose adjusted gross income is no more than $150,000 or $225,000 for heads-of-household. For joint tax filers, they must make no more than $300,000 to use the credit.

For used vehicles, the income thresholds are $75,000 for individuals, $122,500 for heads-of-household, and $150,000 for joint filers.

The vehicles must also meet certain requirements. For new cars, that includes having a battery capacity of at least seven kilowatt hours and having undergone final assembly in North America. For used vehicles, the car’s sale price cannot exceed $25,000, not including taxes or title and registration fees, along with other requirements.

While the federal incentive ends on Sept. 30, Colorado will continue offering a state-level tax credit for electric vehicles, though the benefit will be considerably smaller next year.

Water for the center will be provided by the Racine Water Utility under an agreement with the village of Mount Pleasant.
Community members have a right to know how much water a data center will use before it is built.”","Two environmental groups are warning state residents about the amount of energy and water that is set to be used following the construction of AI data centers in southern Wisconsin.

In an analysis released Tuesday, Clean Wisconsin found that two data centers approved for construction in Ozaukee and Racine counties will consume enough energy to power 4.3 million homes — nearly double the 2.8 million housing units in the state.

The first AI data warehouse, operated by Microsoft, is set to open next year in Mount Pleasant. The company has promised it will support 500 jobs. The $3.3 billion project is located at the site initially planned for Foxconn’s massive manufacturing plant.

Further north in Ozaukee County, Denver-based Vantage Data Systems has acquired 700 acres of land in rural Port Washington. The company has planned a campus that will hold 11 data center buildings and five substations, according to concepts approved by the local government.

Clean Wisconsin’s analysis found that these two projects will require a combined 3.9 gigawatts of power and hundreds of thousands of gallons of water to keep the buildings cooled.

“To put this in perspective, that is more than three times the power production capacity of Wisconsin’s Point Beach nuclear plant,” Paul Mathewson, Clean Wisconsin science program director, who conducted the analysis, said in a statement. “And because only two of the data center projects have disclosed their power needs, we know this is really just a fraction of what the energy use would be if all those data centers are ultimately built.”

The power needs of the two sites are just the tip of the iceberg for the energy and water needs of data centers, which house the servers used to host chatbots such as Chat GPT, stream video and use social media. Microsoft has plans for a smaller data center in Kenosha County. Work is also underway on a data center on 830 acres in Beaver Dam reportedly for Facebook owner Meta. In addition, a Virginia-based company has eyed a site in Dane County, Wisconsin Rapids has plans for a $200 million data center and Janesville is seeking to build a center in a former General Motors assembly plant.

A proposed project in Caledonia has been delayed following local resistance to the project’s proposed rezoning of 240 acres of farmland. The community’s plan commission postponed a July vote on the proposal until later this month.

Environmental advocates say local officials and the state’s power companies are rushing to attract data centers to Wisconsin based on the ambiguous promise of jobs without accounting for the effect they could have on a community’s water sources and energy needs. Increases in the amount of power used by the state could result in the state relying more heavily and for longer periods on non-renewable sources of energy and raise energy rates for households.

‘More questions than answers’

“If data centers come to Wisconsin, they must benefit — not harm — our communities. But right now, we have far more questions than answers about their impacts. How much energy and water will a project use? How will those demands be met? Will there be backup diesel generators on site and how often will they be fired up for testing? Our communities don’t have the transparency they need and deserve,” Chelsea Chandler, Clean Wisconsin’s climate, energy and air director said.

Data centers also often emit a constant humming sound as the servers work inside, creating an irritating noise pollutant for neighbors.

Both the Mount Pleasant and Port Washington projects are close to Lake Michigan, raising further complications about the centers’ use of water and the protection of the Great Lakes. The Foxconn site in Mount Pleasant was already at the center of a controversial plan to divert 7 million gallons of water per day from Lake Michigan.

“There has been very little transparency about the amount of water that will be used on site at these proposed data center campuses. Add to that a lack of transparency about energy use, and it’s impossible to know what the impact on Wisconsin’s water resources will be,” Sarah Walling, Clean Wisconsin’s water and agriculture program director said. “Communities need to know what the on-site demand will be on the hottest, driest days of the year when our water systems are most stressed. And we need to understand how much water will be needed off site to meet a data center’s enormous energy demands.”

Demanding water-use information from Racine

Earlier this week, Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a lawsuit against the city of Racine for records about the Mount Pleasant center’s projected water usage. Water for the center will be provided by the Racine Water Utility under an agreement with the village of Mount Pleasant.

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Milwaukee Riverkeeper, is seeking to force Racine to hand over information about projected water usage requested through an open records request in February. In a news release, MEA noted that many companies constructing data centers across the country require that local governments sign non-disclosure agreements.

The legal advocacy group noted that data centers can use as much water as a small to medium sized city and the public has a right to know the scale of water use.

“Wisconsin law requires public officials to respond to public records requests ‘as soon as practicable and without delay.’ Yet more than six months after making their request, our clients are still waiting,” MEA legal fellow Michael Greif said. “This blatant disregard for the Public Records Law violates their rights and deprives them of the transparency they deserve. Community members have a right to know how much water a data center will use before it is built.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nj-powerlines.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 18:00:25.006175

Looking Ahead The OBBBA fundamentally reshapes clean energy incentives by accelerating phaseouts, shortening deadlines, and layering in complex new foreign entity restrictions.
Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.","I. Background

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law, marking a significant turn in US clean energy policy. The new law dismantles or narrows many of the clean energy tax credits introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). For developers, manufacturers, and investors, the message is clear: access to federal tax credits is shrinking, and the rules for eligibility are tightening.

Days after signing the OBBBA, on July 7, President Trump reinforced this policy shift with an executive order (EO 14315) directing federal agencies to end support for wind, solar, and other “green” technologies. Treasury was tasked with enforcing accelerated deadlines and stricter rules to prevent projects from using safe harbors to lock in credits for wind and solar. Together, the OBBBA and EO 14315 set the stage for a new framework that scales back incentives and imposes tougher compliance hurdles, particularly around foreign ownership and supply chain sourcing.

II. New IRS Guidance: “Beginning of Construction” Rules

The IRS acted quickly, following EO 14315 with Notice 2025-42, which provides new rules addressing when wind and solar projects are considered to have “begun construction” for purposes of qualifying for the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) under Sections 45Y and 48E, respectively.[1] This notice significantly narrows the pathways available to developers.

The familiar “5% safe harbor” introduced under Notice 2013-29 and further clarified under various IRS notices, such as Notice 2018-59 and Notice 2022-61 (Prior Notices), is eliminated for most wind and solar projects. Instead, taxpayers must now satisfy the “physical work test,” which requires that physical work of a significant nature begins before July 5, 2026. That said, the 5% safe harbor is preserved for small-scale solar projects (1.5 MW or less), recognizing the unique challenges for distributed generation.

Qualifying work under the physical work test can include on-site activities such as excavation for wind turbine foundations or installation of racking for solar panels, as well as certain off-site manufacturing activities performed pursuant to binding written contracts. Preliminary steps like permitting or site clearing are not counted toward the physical work test.

Once construction begins, projects must maintain a continuous program of construction (i.e., the “continuity requirement”). That said, the “continuity safe harbor” from the Prior Notices still exists. If a project is placed in service within four years of the end of the year in which construction began, the project is treated as having satisfied the continuity requirement. If the construction period extends beyond the four-year safe harbor, a solar developer can no longer rely on merely showing “continuous efforts” but must be able to demonstrate a continuous program of construction that involves continuing physical work of a significant nature.

Fortunately, Notice 2025-42 preserves a list of excusable disruptions, such as weather, interconnection delays, and permitting delays, for purposes of satisfying the continuity requirement.

Finally, it is worth noting that Notice 2025-42 specially provides that the “beginning of construction” rules set forth in the notice are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the new restrictions on foreign involvement discussed below. Such guidance is currently being prepared by Treasury.

For developers, the takeaway is clear: simply incurring costs or securing contracts will no longer be sufficient. Projects must demonstrate physical progress of a significant nature on or before the July 4, 2026 deadline to remain eligible for PTCs or ITCs without being subject to the accelerated December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

III. Change Under the OBBBA

New Restrictions on Foreign Involvement

A central feature of the OBBBA is the creation of the Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE) regime. The goal is to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector, especially from countries deemed adversarial to the United States, such as China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.

The rules operate on two levels:

Specified Foreign Entities (SFEs): entities directly tied to adversarial governments or named in laws like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIEs): entities where an SFE has significant influence, such as owning at least 25%, holding certain debt interests, or having contractual control.

Even if a developer isn’t itself an SFE or FIE, projects can still lose eligibility if (1) they begin construction after December 31, 2025, and (2) they rely too heavily on goods or services sourced from PFEs. Treasury will measure this through a “material assistance” test, which compares overall project costs with the portion tied to PFEs. The thresholds will tighten overtime — wind and solar projects must show 40% non-PFE content in 2026, rising to 60% by 2030. Similar rules will apply across technologies, from batteries to inverters to critical minerals.

While official safe harbor tables won’t arrive until late 2026, transitional relief allows developers to rely on IRS Notice 2025-08 and supplier certifications in the meantime. Developers will need to closely track supply chains now, as eligibility will become progressively harder to maintain. As noted above, the “beginning of construction” rules under Notice 2025-42 for purposes of determining whether a project is eligible for PTCs or ITCs are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the “material assistance” restrictions. Until Treasury issues specific guidance, the historic “beginning of construction” rules remain applicable for this purpose.

Key Changes by Credit

Investment Tax Credit (Section 48E): Wind and solar face early termination deadlines — in order to be eligible for this credit, construction must begin on or before July 4, 2026, or, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026, such projects must be placed in service by the end of 2027. As discussed earlier, Notice 2025-42 introduced new rules on when wind and solar projects are considered to have begun construction, which further narrows eligibility. That said, other technologies like geothermal, nuclear, and hydrogen retain longer timelines, with a gradual phaseout starting in 2034.

Production Tax Credits (Section 45Y): Similarly, wind and solar projects must meet the July 4, 2026 “beginning of construction” date or the December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline. Other technologies, such as geothermal, hydrogen, and nuclear projects, are subject to the same phaseout schedule as the Section 48E ITCs.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits (Section 45X): Wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027 are ineligible for the Section 45X credit. With respect to critical minerals, the OBBBA (1) included metallurgical coal as an applicable critical mineral, and (2) provided for a critical mineral phaseout beginning in 2031 (except for metallurgical coal, which phases out beginning in 2030). In addition, the OBBBA tightened the definition of “battery modules” eligible for the Section 45X credit by clarifying that a battery module is comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality. The PFE rules also apply here, forcing manufacturers to reevaluate sourcing strategies.

Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q): Credit amounts are equalized at $17 per ton (base) for carbon captured from industrial and power facilities (increased to $85 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied) and $36 per ton (base) for direct air capture (increased to $180 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied), regardless of end use. But PFE restrictions will now limit who can claim or transfer the Section 45Q credits.

Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (Section 45U): The Section 45U credit for electricity production at existing nuclear power plants that were operational at the time of enactment of the IRA (i.e., placed in service prior to August 16, 2022) remains intact through 2032, but with new restrictions on sourcing nuclear fuel from covered nations. Specifically, after December 31, 2027, taxpayers must certify that any nuclear fuel was not sourced from covered nations or “covered entities” (unless pursuant to a binding contract in force prior to January 1, 2023). In addition, SFEs are not eligible to claim the Section 45U credit after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, and FIEs cannot claim the Section 45U credit for tax year beginning after the second anniversary of the date of enactment.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V): Eligibility for the per kilogram credit for qualified clean hydrogen production now requires construction to begin before 2028, significantly shortening the runway for new projects. Projects beginning construction after December 31, 2027, will no longer be eligible.

Clean Production Fuel Credit (Section 45Z): The Section 45Z credit for the production of certain transportation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel has been extended and is available through 2029, but with narrowed eligibility and stricter sourcing rules. PFE restrictions also apply. For example, for fuel produced after December 31, 2025, the enhanced rate for sustainable aviation fuel is no longer available and the credit value for fuels derived from foreign feedstocks would be reduced by 20%.

Direct Pay and Transferability (Sections 6417 and 6418): Both remain available, but credits cannot be transferred to PFEs (immediately for SFEs and two years later for FIEs).

IV. Looking Ahead

The OBBBA fundamentally reshapes clean energy incentives by accelerating phaseouts, shortening deadlines, and layering in complex new foreign entity restrictions. While certain technologies like nuclear and hydrogen retain more favorable treatment, the overarching trend is a sharp contraction in federal support for wind, solar, and PFE-linked projects.

Below is a list of action items for developers to do now:

Move quickly on project starts. Wind and solar developers must begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 to preserve credit eligibility while retaining the four-year “continuity safe harbor” to place the project in service; otherwise, such projects that begin construction after the first anniversary of the enactment of the OBBBA have to be placed in service by the end of 2027.

Focus on the Physical Work Test. For wind and solar projects, developers can no longer “begin construction” by satisfying a 5% safe harbor (other than certain small-scale solar projects of 1.5 MW or less). Paying or incurring costs for the manufacturing of project components is no longer enough — developers must plan for tangible, qualifying construction steps that constitute physical work of a significant nature, both for purposes of showing that construction began and for purposes of maintaining a continuous program of construction.

Track supply chains. The introduction of the PFE regime intended to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector means that developers and manufacturers must strengthen the supplier due diligence process and carefully document sourcing of key inputs to ensure no impermissible material assistance and build strategies to reduce foreign exposure.

Plan for shorter timelines. Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.

Monitor Treasury guidance. Future notices (including notices regarding the PFE regime and the beginning of construction rules for the PFE regime) will shape enforcement and safe harbor rules; staying up to date will be critical to avoid disqualification.

In this new era, careful planning and compliance will be essential to securing clean energy tax incentives, and maintaining strong documentation will be key to supporting credit eligibility and ensuring investors and tax credit purchasers that the underlying credits are secure. Please reach out to Gregg M. Benson or your Mintz relationship attorney if you have any questions regarding the changes to the clean energy tax credits under the OBBBA and relevant guidance.

""With this proposal, EPA acknowledges how important biofuels like ethanol are to the rural economy,"" she said in a statement.
""We commend the Trump EPA for being the first-ever EPA to propose a way to ensure past-year SRE gallons don't compromise renewable fuel demand.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- The Trump administration is planning to reallocate biofuels gallons lost through small-refinery exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard, according to a proposal released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday.

The question is, will it be 50%, 100%, another percentage, or even none of the gallons lost through exemptions from 2023 to 2025?

The EPA announced in August it had granted full exemptions on 63 petitions, partial exemptions on 77 petitions and denied 28 petitions on SRE requests covering 2016 to 2024.

EPA is proposing two approaches to reallocate volumes lost. One proposal accounts for 100% of the 2023-25 exempted renewable volume obligations -- or 2.18 billion gallons total. The other approach is to account for 50% of the 2023-25 exempted gallons -- or 1.09 billion gallons total.

The agency said it also is taking comments on other possible percentages, including reallocating no gallons, 25% or even 75%.

In addition, EPA is proposing to add a new SRE reallocation volume term in the percentage standard equations for 2026 and 2027, to account for small-refinery exemptions granted for the 2023-25 compliance years.

The agency said the proposed reallocation volumes and updated exempted projections would lead to revised proposed percentage standards for 2026 and 2027 that are lower than the original proposed standards in the current RFS volumes proposal yet to be completed.

PUBLIC HEARING, COMMENT PERIOD TO FOLLOW

Once the proposal is published in the Federal Register, the EPA said it will hold a public hearing followed by a 30-day public comment period.

EPA said it also expects ""additional exemptions"" to be granted for the 2025 compliance year.

""The ability for obligated parties to use these RINs to comply with the 2026 and 2027 RVOs is expected to impact demand for renewable fuel if not carefully considered,"" the agency said in a news release.

""This proposal is an important step in the EPA's tireless work to repair the damage done after four years of the Biden-Harris administration neglecting key components of the RFS program, including threats to transform the RFS program into a subsidy for electric vehicle charging stations as part of a larger strategy to electrify the transportation sector. The Trump administration reaffirms its renewed commitment to honor the program's purpose to support biofuels as an essential part of a thriving liquid fuels market.""

The EPA said it ""recognizes the importance"" of issuing one final Set 2 rule that establishes the RVOs for 2026 and 2027 and addresses the reallocation of SREs from 2023-2025.

RFA ENCOURAGED BY PROPOSAL

The Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement Tuesday that it was ""encouraged"" by EPA's proposal.

""While we continue to question whether any SREs for 2023-2025 are truly justified in the first place, we are encouraged that EPA is proposing to add the exempted volumes back to future RFS requirements for 2026 and 2027,"" said Geoff Cooper, RFA president and CEO.

""We support EPA's proposed option to fully reallocate 2023-2025 SREs and believe such an approach will ensure intended levels of renewable fuel consumption are maintained over the long-term. We appreciate that EPA continues to focus on SRE approaches that minimize marketplace disruptions, while honoring the congressional purpose and intent of the RFS program. EPA clearly recognizes that an unmitigated influx of RIN credits from SREs could devastate markets and undermine renewable fuel production and consumption.""

GROWTH ENERGY COMMENDS EPA

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said her group also supports the full reallocation option presented by EPA.

""With this proposal, EPA acknowledges how important biofuels like ethanol are to the rural economy,"" she said in a statement.

""We commend the Trump EPA for being the first-ever EPA to propose a way to ensure past-year SRE gallons don't compromise renewable fuel demand. Full reallocation of exempt gallons is a surefire way to drive income to America's rural communities.""

(AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company broke ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged Tuesday that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit , the benefit provides a tax discount of up to $7,500 for a new electric car, and up to $4,000 for a used one. It expires on Sept. 30.

The tax credit was approved as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 and initially set to last through 2032. That timeline was cut short, however, by Congress’ recent tax and spending-cut law, known as the “one big, beautiful bill,” which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades.

The electric vehicle credits are income-based. For a new car, the benefit applies to people whose adjusted gross income is no more than $150,000 or $225,000 for heads-of-household. For joint tax filers, they must make no more than $300,000 to use the credit.

For used vehicles, the income thresholds are $75,000 for individuals, $122,500 for heads-of-household, and $150,000 for joint filers.

The vehicles must also meet certain requirements. For new cars, that includes having a battery capacity of at least seven kilowatt hours and having undergone final assembly in North America. For used vehicles, the car’s sale price cannot exceed $25,000, not including taxes or title and registration fees, along with other requirements.

While the federal incentive ends on Sept. 30, Colorado will continue offering a state-level tax credit for electric vehicles, though the benefit will be considerably smaller next year.

The survey of 1,000 likely 2026 voters commissioned by Conservatives for Clean Energy Florida shows that 78% support clean energy initiatives, including 63% of Republicans.

Two-thirds of voters overall in the poll (67%) would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports growth of solar power in Florida. The survey also shows a shift toward support for nuclear power. When described “as something that Trump and large corporations support,” 62% of voters support increasing nuclear energy production.

“Pocketbook issues are clearly the number one issue of concern going into the 2026 election cycle, and connecting the dots here it’s very easy to see that Florida voters across the political spectrum understand that diversifying our portfolio and taking an ‘all of the above approach’ is going to be key to actually bringing their costs down,” said Zachary Colletti, executive director of Conservatives for Clean Energy. “That’s the most important story here.”

Solar power provides only 8% of the state’s electricity portfolio now, but that’s expected to increase over the next decade. The amount of solar power that will fuel the state will rise to 28% by 2032, according to a report published earlier this year by the Florida Public Service Commission.

The solar industry in Florida and across the country suffered a huge blow this summer following passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which removes a 30% tax break for individuals who buy rooftop solar panels, effective at the end of this year.

“Solar power has been getting a bad rap as of late, mostly because the public does not want to see green space turned into solar farms — which is totally understandable,” said Jake Hoffman, president of the Tampa Bay Young Republicans, in an email message.

“However, solar farms are not the only solar solution. If we want to be serious about filling the immediate need for energy independence, our government should be accelerating all forms of energy and solar energy with battery storage in locations that make sense as a major part of that equation.”

The survey shows that nearly three quarters of Republicans and two-thirds of NPA voters support nuclear power, while Democrats are split on the issue. Nuclear power supplied about 11% of Florida’s energy portfolio in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Florida Power & Light operates the only two functioning nuclear power plants in the state — at St. Lucie and Turkey Point. A third nuclear plant at Crystal River was shut down in 2013 by Duke Energy

Politics

Byron Donalds, the Naples Republican U.S. House member running for governor, is a supporter of nuclear power. He co-sponsored a resolution in 2023 expressing Congress’ commitment to embracing nuclear power as a clean baseload energy source.

Paul Renner, the former Florida House Speaker who recently entered the Republican race for governor, supported energy legislation (HB 1645) in the 2024 legislative session that erased several instances of the words “climate change” from state statutes.

“We are looking at ways — including clean energy ways — to make sure that we are not ever subject to brownouts and blackouts that places like California have suffered and other places are predicted to suffer that are not focusing on a reliable grid,” Renner told reporters in December 2023

“And, unfortunately, that works at cross-purposes with the uber-aggressive timeline that climate activists have put us on where they want us to go tomorrow. And if I had a magic wand and I could say, ‘All energy is clean energy and we will never use fossil fuels again and we can do that tomorrow at no cost,’ I would do it,” Renner continued. “Everybody should want a clean future. But that’s not realistic.”

The Florida Democratic Party’s leading candidate for governor, David Jolly, has said that if elected he would appoint people to the Public Service Commission “to begin to require our utilities to incorporate more clean and renewable energies.”

Nearly 12 million customers of Florida Power & Light Co. faced potentially the largest rate hike in U.S. history as recently as last month. However, days before the Public Service Commission was set to hear arguments in the case, FPL filed a four-year rate settlement agreement that reduced its original revenue request by approximately 30%, according to FPL.

Subject of Research: Electrification of homes and vehicles in the U.S.","A future where homes and vehicles are fully electrified poses significant challenges to the power supply infrastructure in the United States, potentially leading to power outages. Researchers from Purdue University have recently conducted a comprehensive study to better understand this impending transformation and its implications. They noted that without critical upgrades to the distribution grid, the increased load from electric heating systems and vehicles could strain the existing framework and result in massive infrastructure costs. These necessary upgrades are estimated to be between $350 billion and $790 billion, which translates to individual household expenses ranging from $2,000 to $6,400 by 2050.

The research indicates that the electrification process would involve replacing existing home heating systems, like traditional boilers, with electric heat pumps and transitioning away from gasoline and diesel vehicles toward electric counterparts. This shift, while essential for meeting climate goals and enhancing energy efficiencies, necessitates a substantial increase in electricity demand. Kevin Kircher, a mechanical engineering assistant professor at Purdue University and a key contributor to the research, elucidates that such a transition will invariably require infrastructure enhancements, including thicker wiring and more potent transformers.

Moreover, the coldest regions in the United States could see electricity demand spikes reaching five times above current peak levels, which would exacerbate the challenges utilities face in maintaining reliability. The financial burden imposed on consumers is a significant concern, as utilities tend to pass on infrastructure costs directly to customers. The implications of these costs could push the electrification benefits significantly out of reach for the average household if expansive measures are not implemented.

However, the study reveals a silver lining: strategic mitigations can significantly reduce grid reinforcement expenses by two-thirds. By adopting methods such as improving home insulation and prioritizing energy efficiency, potential financial burdens can be minimized. For instance, using ground-source heat pumps rather than air-source heat pumps can lead to greater efficiencies. Ground-source systems benefit from consistent ground temperatures, which reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling, demonstrating that not all electric systems are created equal when it comes to efficiency.

An impactful recommendation from the research emphasizes the importance of coordinating the operation of electric devices in homes. By optimizing the timing for charging electric vehicles and utilizing electric heating systems, demand on the electrical grid can be balanced to minimize strain during peak usage periods. This can lead to sub-optimal charging times for electric vehicles if not managed correctly, but with smart technology, homes could leverage their entire electric ecosystem to work in harmony.

Priyadarshan, a PhD candidate and primary author of the study, underscores the potential of integrating communication between electric vehicles and HVAC systems. The research highlights a transformative concept where electric vehicles could adjust their charging schedules to avoid simultaneous operation with heating systems, thereby alleviating grid demands during critical times. This form of coordination could realize a 40% reduction in grid reinforcement costs, demonstrating the paramount importance of smart technology in the electrification landscape.

Furthermore, this extensive study analyzed each of the Lower 48 U.S. states, modeling the effects of complete electrification on distribution grids while integrating specific data. This comprehensive approach included public surveys assessing home electricity usage, electric vehicle travel patterns, equipment specifications, building code guidelines, and localized weather data. To ensure the accuracy of their findings, researchers calibrated their model against a fully electrified test house, the DC Nanogrid House in West Lafayette, Indiana.

The model’s sophistication allowed researchers to explore various strategies for enhancing the efficiency of residential energy use and quantifying how those measures affect grid demands. By adjusting these parameters with their proposed strategies for home weatherization and equipment efficiency, the researchers aimed to devise a holistic approach for tackling future electrification challenges.

While various studies have probed into the electrification of homes and vehicles before, this research stands out due to its nationwide, county-by-county analysis. It offers unparalleled insights into local grid demands and the economic ramifications of transitioning to an electrified future. The correlation between household electrification and grid reliability is an intricate web that demands meticulous exploration, and this study begins to unravel that complexity.

The conclusions drawn from this research cast a dual perspective on the electrification phenomenon. On one hand, there is a palpable sense of urgency and concern surrounding the substantial expenses that an uncoordinated electrification effort could engender. Conversely, if electrification is approached intelligently and systematically, many of these financial challenges can be mitigated, leading to a more sustainable and efficient future.

Individuals and families across the nation can rest assured that ongoing research is seeking to illuminate the pathways of transitioning to an electrified society, emphasizing the need for innovative and cooperative solutions to make electrification both feasible and economically viable. As the country steps toward this new horizon, the emphasis will lie in fostering responsible and smart use of energy resources, ensuring that everyone benefits from the advancements in electrification without overwhelming the existing power infrastructure.

Ultimately, this research serves as a stepping stone for policymakers, utilities, and consumers to collaborate actively in crafting solutions that not only accommodate but also thrive amidst the electrification wave. Awareness of the implications, coupled with strategic implementations, will be imperative as the march toward a fully electrified society continues to unfold.

“Pocketbook issues are clearly the number one issue of concern going into the 2026 election cycle, and connecting the dots here it’s very easy to see that Florida voters across the political spectrum understand that diversifying our portfolio and taking an ‘all of the above approach’ is going to be key to actually bringing their costs down,” said Zachary Colletti, executive director of Conservatives for Clean Energy. “That’s the most important story here.”

Solar power provides only 8% of the state’s electricity portfolio now, but that’s expected to increase over the next decade. The amount of solar power that will fuel the state will rise to 28% by 2032, according to a report published earlier this year by the Florida Public Service Commission.

Mary Creasman, the chief executive of California Environmental Voters, repeatedly used an expletive to describe how things had gone at the State Capitol this year.
Republican state lawmakers said they felt some sense of redemption from the Democrats’ approach in California this year.","California has long prided itself as an environmental trailblazer. It was the first state to set its own vehicle emission rules and the first to outlaw plastic shopping bags.

In 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, went so far as to seek a ban on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Standing in front of several electric cars, he warned automakers against being on “the wrong side of history.”

So it surprised environmentalists this year when Mr. Newsom and Democratic lawmakers began backtracking on signature green initiatives. They rebuked the state’s coastal preservation commission for regulatory overreach and rolled back the landmark California Environmental Quality Act, better known as CEQA, to address the state’s severe housing shortage.

“It’s a complete 180,” said Hollin Kretzmann, a lawyer at the Climate Law Institute, part of the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity that focuses on protecting endangered species. “It’s become more urgent than ever to rid ourselves of fossil fuels, so it’s really inexplicable why our policymakers in Sacramento are moving the exact opposite way we should be going.”

Even in liberal California, Democrats say they have been stung by their party’s tailspin after last year’s losses in national elections. They understand that voters are frustrated with the high cost of living in California, and they are trying to show that they are doing something about it.

If they gain traction by tilting toward pocketbook issues, even at the expense of long-held environmental orthodoxy, it could provide lessons to Democrats nationally even if it angers activists locally.

Gas prices have long been higher in California than elsewhere — they’re about 45 percent higher than the national average at the moment — but lawmakers are worried that costs could skyrocket if they don’t help the oil industry immediately. And the transition to electric vehicles has not advanced to a point where drivers — or politicians — can ignore prices at the pump.

“Climate leadership is not $10-a-gallon gas — we need California to be an inspiration and not a cautionary tale,” said Assemblywoman Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat from Orange County who chairs the energy committee in the State Assembly. “For decades, there were policymakers and advocates who somehow thought we could set really high goals and wave a magic wand and deliver on them.”

“We are all out of magic wands,” she said.

The modern environmental movement was born in California when an oil spill in 1969 off the coast of Santa Barbara captured the attention of Americans who were increasingly concerned about how development was harming the natural world around them. The disaster led to the first Earth Day in 1970, when coast-to-coast demonstrations drew a stunning 20 million Americans — one-tenth of the country’s population at the time — and precipitated action at the state and federal levels to safeguard the environment.

Soon after, California enacted the California Environmental Quality Act, which required reviews of new development to address potential environmental impacts. In 1972, voters approved the creation of the California Coastal Commission, a state agency in charge of protecting the seashore and ensuring public beach access. In the years since, California has approved a number of standards for water and air quality, and the state instituted the nation’s first cap-and-trade-programs.

Democrats have long asserted that they can help American consumers and improve the environment all at once. They have promoted the idea that workers in fossil fuel industries can transition to jobs in clean energy. That drivers will ultimately save money by charging their vehicles instead of pumping gas. That homes will become more efficient and need less energy for heating and cooling.

Mr. Newsom, in a State of the State letter he sent to lawmakers last week, still made that case. “In California,” he wrote, “economic growth and environmental protection go hand in hand.”

But for many Democratic state legislators, Mr. Trump’s presidential victory last year was something of a reckoning. After that loss — in which Republicans made gains in California — lawmakers said they had begun to consider whether their priorities were truly in line with voters’ daily concerns, like paying for rent or groceries.

At the end of the legislative session on Saturday, state lawmakers passed a proposal to allow more oil drilling in Kern County, a petroleum-rich region in the Central Valley. The legislation could allow up to 2,000 new oil and gas wells to be drilled in the county per year for 10 years.

Mr. Newsom had previously pledged to end oil drilling in the state by 2045. But after two refineries announced closures, he now says that he must be realistic about ensuring there’s enough fuel to supply California’s needs.

“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one is naive about that,” Mr. Newsom said at a recent news conference, noting that he personally flies around the state. “It’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism.”

To environmentalists, however, pragmatism sounds a lot like selling out. Mary Creasman, the chief executive of California Environmental Voters, repeatedly used an expletive to describe how things had gone at the State Capitol this year. More than a dozen pro-environment bills, such as efforts to keep PFAS chemicals out of drinking water and to create a 3,000-acre conservancy near Fresno, stalled in the Legislature this year, she said.

Environmentalists also believed that the catastrophic Los Angeles fires in January, the most expensive climate disaster in United States history, should have been a catalyst to pass climate change bills, not roll back regulations.

“I fear that the things that Newsom is doing and the legislators are doing are rolling us back,” said Kathryn Phillips, a former director of Sierra Club California who worked on many of the state environmental initiatives in place today. “They aren’t pressing to move harder and faster on shifting us out of a dependence on fossil fuels for vehicles and so on, and instead are clearing the way for some things to go back to the way they were.”

Polls show that voters still see environmental issues as a priority. But as their personal budgets are stretched ever more thin, Californians want help reducing the costs of housing, gas and electricity.

The oil legislation was part of a larger package of bills that lawmakers sent to Mr. Newsom last week. One proposal would extend the state’s cap-and-trade program, which sets limits on emissions and requires companies to buy credits if they exceed them. Another bill would allow California to participate in a regional energy grid, which could increase reliability but also increase the share of electricity produced by fossil fuels.

The tonal shift among Democrats seems partly to reflect a growing acceptance that the state’s transition to clean energy hasn’t come as fast as they had once hoped. A vast majority of drivers still rely on gas-powered vehicles and live in sprawling metropolitan areas where they do not regularly take mass transit.

Meanwhile, Republicans in Washington have made it even harder for Americans to adopt clean technologies. President Trump and House Republicans this year blocked the state from carrying out Mr. Newsom’s prohibition on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles in 2035. They also revoked the state’s authority to set its own tailpipe emissions standards. And incentives for purchasing electric vehicles will end this month as a result of Republican legislation.

Republican state lawmakers said they felt some sense of redemption from the Democrats’ approach in California this year. “I have long warned about the dangers of eliminating reliable energy in favor of costly green agendas,” said Shannon Grove, a Republican state senator from Bakersfield whose district includes many of the oil wells that would benefit from the package on the governor’s desk.

Henry Stern, a Democratic state senator from the Los Angeles area who has long been considered an environmental leader, said that the green movement may need to become more pragmatic to ensure its longevity. He marveled at the fact that he was once wrote anti-fracking laws and was now working on legislation to allow more drilling in Kern County.

He believes California has a responsibility to show the nation that climate policies can be smart and cost-saving, in a moment when the Trump administration has attacked clean energy initiatives.

“In California, we can sort of project this perfectionism,” Mr. Stern said. “But we drive more than anyone. So, yeah, we’re complicit, too. We’re a leader in electric vehicles and petroleum consumption, we’re both.”

He recognized that many voters don’t want to be told “that driving a pickup and eating a hamburger is evil.” But he said that many of them would support environmental policies that also resulted in cost savings.

“This whole environmental movement — has it failed? ” he asked. “Or is it evolving into something that can actually be more durable, regardless of politics?

By securing $1.5 billion in state incentives to build a $5 billion factory near Social Circle, Georgia,

is not only positioning itself for scalable production but also leveraging job creation and product diversification to accelerate EV market penetration. This analysis explores how these elements—state incentives, long-term employment, and a broader product portfolio—could redefine Rivian's trajectory in the EV sector.

State Incentives: A Catalyst for Scalable Production

Georgia's $1.5 billion incentive package for Rivian's Social Circle plant is among the most aggressive state-level commitments to EV manufacturing in recent years. The deal, which requires Rivian to deliver 80% of its promised jobs and investments by 2030, reflects Georgia's strategic bet on the EV industry as a driver of economic growthUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed[ 1 ]. While the exact structure of the incentives—tax credits, infrastructure funding, or workforce development programs—remains unspecified, historical precedents suggest a blend of fiscal and operational support. For instance, Rivian's existing facilities in Illinois and California have benefited from similar state-level incentives tied to job creation and clean energy goalsUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed[ 1 ].

This financial backing is critical for Rivian's ability to scale production of its R2 and R3 midsize SUVs, which are designed to compete in one of the most lucrative segments of the automotive market. By reducing upfront capital costs, Georgia's incentives enable Rivian to accelerate its timeline for achieving economies of scale, a key determinant of long-term profitability in the EV sector.

Long-Term Job Creation: A Win for Georgia and Rivian

The Social Circle plant is projected to create 7,500 jobs by 2030, with construction slated to begin in 2026 and production commencing in 2028Update on new Georgia plant - site development resumed[ 1 ]. This represents a significant infusion of high-paying manufacturing roles into Georgia's economy, aligning with the state's broader strategy to attract advanced manufacturing. For Rivian, the workforce development component of the incentive package likely includes partnerships with local educational institutions to train employees in EV-specific skills, ensuring a steady pipeline of talent.

Complementing this, Rivian's new East Coast headquarters in Atlanta, which will employ 100 people by 2025 and scale to 500 roles, further cements the company's presence in the regionCharlotte, NC RAN is now OPEN! | Rivian Forum - R1T R1S R2 …[ 2 ]. This dual approach—combining blue-collar manufacturing jobs with white-collar corporate roles—positions Georgia as a hub for Rivian's operational and strategic growth. The long-term stability of these jobs also mitigates risks associated with automation and offshoring, providing a buffer against industry volatility.

Product Diversification: Capturing Broader Market Demand

Rivian's decision to produce the R2 and R3 models in Georgia is a calculated move to diversify its product lineup and appeal to a wider demographic. The R2 and R3, positioned as more affordable and compact alternatives to the R1T and R1S, target consumers who may have been hesitant to adopt EVs due to cost or size constraints. This expansion into midsize SUVs mirrors the success of Tesla's Model Y and Ford's Mustang Mach-E, both of which have driven significant market share gains in the segmentUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed[ 1 ].

Moreover, Rivian's parallel investment in charging infrastructure—such as the new RAN station in Charlotte, North Carolina—addresses a critical barrier to EV adoption. By enhancing the East Coast's charging network, Rivian not only supports its own customers but also contributes to a broader ecosystem that could accelerate regional EV penetrationCharlotte, NC RAN is now OPEN! | Rivian Forum - R1T R1S R2 …[ 2 ]. This infrastructure play is particularly astute given the Southeast's historically lower EV adoption rates compared to coastal markets.

Strategic Implications for the EV Market

Rivian's Georgia expansion exemplifies a holistic approach to market capture. The combination of state incentives, job creation, and product diversification creates a virtuous cycle: lower production costs enable competitive pricing, which drives sales; increased sales justify further investment in infrastructure and workforce development; and a robust ecosystem attracts more consumers and suppliers. This model could serve as a blueprint for other automakers seeking to scale in the EV space.

However, risks remain. Rivian must meet its 2030 job and investment targets to retain the full value of Georgia's incentives, and delays in production timelines could strain its financial position. Additionally, the R2 and R3's success hinges on Rivian's ability to differentiate its vehicles in a crowded market.

Conclusion

Rivian's Georgia expansion is more than a manufacturing play—it is a strategic investment in the future of the EV industry. By securing state incentives, creating jobs, and diversifying its product offerings, Rivian is laying the groundwork for sustained growth and market leadership. For investors, the key takeaway is clear: companies that can align public policy, workforce development, and product innovation will be best positioned to thrive in the EV era.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd23363a0bc001.png,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:40.409746

The reality, however, reveals a fundamental difference between electrotech and fossil fuel systems: electrotech borrows materials, while fossil fuels burn them forever.
Surf the electrotech wave or be dragged under.” (p.111) Countries building electrotech capacity now will dominate the energy system of the future.","The global energy system is undergoing its most dramatic transformation in over a century. While the current U.S. administration doubles down on fossil fuels, a technological revolution is accelerating worldwide that will fundamentally reshape economic and geopolitical power. The winners won’t be determined by oil reserves, but by who can harness the power of our nearest star, the sun, and manage electrons most efficiently.

An insightful and easy-to-review report by Ember, a global energy think tank that accelerates the clean energy transition with data and policy, documents the accelerating Electrotech Revolution. It is a good news story for our children and the planet. The speed of change in what researchers call “electrotech” – solar, wind, batteries, electric vehicles, and heat pumps – is outpacing even the most optimistic forecasts. Consider solar power, which the Ember report notes has gone from the smallest to the largest source of capacity in 15 years (p. 19). The exponential growth isn’t slowing – it’s accelerating. Solar capacity has been doubling every three years for three decades, while battery storage has been nearly doubling annually since 2020.

This isn’t a gradual change. Complex energy models consistently underestimate the reality of exponential adoption. The report shows how forecasters have repeatedly lowballed both solar additions and electric vehicle sales, missing the S-curve dynamics that define technology revolutions.

The Manufacturing Base Is Being Built – Just Not Here

While America debates energy policy, the rest of the world is building the infrastructure for the electrotech era. The numbers are staggering:

Solar manufacturing capacity: Already 1,600 GW globally, far exceeding even aggressive Net Zero scenarios

Battery manufacturing: 16 TWh of capacity planned by 2028, outpacing projected demand

Geographic concentration: China dominates with 60% of global solar manufacturing capacity

The report reveals a crucial insight: The same people and places that made digital tech, mainly in China, are now making electrotech. Many electrotech leaders started in digital technology, bringing manufacturing expertise and supply chain knowledge to energy applications. This manufacturing dominance matters because electrotech follows learning curves – costs fall approximately 20% with every doubling of deployment. Technologies get cheaper with scale. Commodities get more expensive the deeper you dig. In the South, we started to build out that manufacturing base, but the Trump administration has created uncertainty and chaos in the clean technology markets in our region.

Star Power: Solar The Unstoppable Force

Solar power exemplifies why the electrotech revolution is unstoppable. The physics are undeniable: “The sun supplies more energy to Earth every five days than all fossil fuel reserves.” (p.10)

The cost trajectory is equally compelling. Solar module prices have fallen 99.6% since 1980, while oil prices have increased with cumulative extraction. Solar-plus-storage systems in India now cost $40 per MWh – competitive with the marginal cost of existing fossil plants.

But solar’s real power lies in its democratic nature. As the report highlights, 92% of countries have renewables potential over 10x their current demand. Unlike fossil fuels concentrated in specific geographies, solar potential is nearly universal, fundamentally altering geopolitical dynamics.

The Efficiency Revolution

The electrotech advantage isn’t just economic – it’s thermodynamic. Fossil fuel systems waste two-thirds of their primary energy input. Just think of all the waste heat in a gas-powered car that requires a liquid-cooled radiator. The report quantifies this staggering inefficiency: “$4.6 trillion a year goes up in smoke.”

Electrotech is three times more efficient across sectors, representing two-thirds of fossil fuel demand:

Electricity generation: Wind and solar at 100% efficiency vs. 30-40% for thermal plants

Transportation: Electric vehicles at 80-90% efficiency vs. 25-40% for internal combustion

Heating: Heat pumps at 300-400% efficiency vs. 85% for gas boilers

This efficiency advantage creates a virtuous cycle with Electrotech enabling us to get much more for much less. The entire global car fleet could run on about 13 EJ of electricity – equivalent to under 15% of current electricity demand.

Giving the Keys of Power to the Fossils is a Strategic Misstep

While the world builds electrotech capacity, America’s current energy policy, doubling down on fossil fuel, represents a historic strategic error. The report’s geopolitical analysis is stark: fossil fuel dependency creates vulnerability, while electrotech enables energy security.

Three-quarters of the world depends on fossil fuel imports, spending over 5% of GDP in many cases. Meanwhile, electrotech offers a path to energy independence: “Just a few technologies can reduce global energy imports by 70%” through renewables, EVs, and heat pumps. (p.63)

China understood this dynamic early, becoming what the report calls “the first major electrostate.” Chinese electrotech investment since 2023 totals over $100 billion in outbound foreign direct investment, building manufacturing capacity globally for the future, while America’s current political leadership is looking in the rear-view mirror.

The Coming Fossil Fuel Decline

The data suggests we’re approaching “peak fossil demand” globally, not “peak fossil availability.” The report shows fossil fuel demand has already plateaued outside China, while Chinese fossil electricity generation peaked in the first half of 2025.

This isn’t a gradual decline – it’s the beginning of structural disruption. Road transport, representing 75% of transport energy demand, faces particular vulnerability as EVs scale. The report projects: “Road transport is the soft underbelly of the oil system. Sales translate into stocks within 15 years or less.” (p.79)

The implications extend far beyond energy companies. Refineries dependent on gasoline revenues, LNG terminals facing stranded assets, and entire fossil fuel supply chains risk obsolescence.

Borrowing, Not Burning: The Mining Materials Reality

One persistent criticism of electrotech focuses on mineral requirements for batteries and solar panels. The reality, however, reveals a fundamental difference between electrotech and fossil fuel systems: electrotech borrows materials, while fossil fuels burn them forever.

The report’s analysis is striking: “The fossil fuel system requires over 50x more materials than electrotech.” (p.49) Annual fossil fuel extraction totals 17.4 billion metric tons globally, while the entire 25-year electrotech transition requires just 300 million tons of materials – and crucially, these can be recycled. Battery recycling creates a circular system impossible with fossil fuels. The report shows how mineral demand per vehicle can fall dramatically through recycling and technological improvement. With recycling rates of 90-94% achievable, and chemistry improvements reducing material intensity by 25-45% per decade, the material footprint shrinks over time rather than growing.

As the report puts it: “If you recycle batteries and improve performance, you don’t need to extract new minerals.”(p.50) A battery reaching end-of-life in 2035 provides a secondary supply for new batteries in 2045, creating a closed loop that fossil fuels can never achieve.

Catching the Wave

The report’s conclusion is unambiguous: “This is the decisive decade. Surf the electrotech wave or be dragged under.” (p.111)

Countries building electrotech capacity now will dominate the energy system of the future. Those clinging to fossil fuel strategies risk becoming energy importers rather than exporters, dependent on technologies developed and manufactured elsewhere.

The choice facing our country is clear. Continue doubling down on 20th-century energy sources while other nations build 21st-century infrastructure, or recognize that the electrotech revolution represents the most significant economic opportunity since the internet.

The manufacturing base is being built. The costs are falling below those of fossil fuels. The efficiency advantages are undeniable. The only question is whether America will participate in shaping this future or find itself buying technology from those who saw the wave coming.

The electrotech revolution is happening with or without American leadership. So many times, I have heard climate deniers say, “What about China and its emissions?” Well, China got the memo and has stepped up to the challenge. The question is whether America will lead or be led. The good news for our health, but bad news for the economy, is that the rest of the world is not waiting for us to figure it out. A safe and healthy planet depends on all of us making the transition.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-Featured-Imgs-Mastheads-Promos-with-image-abovetext-below-1-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 15:01:10.198726

Undercutting renewable energy also undercuts millions of jobs and revenue that support farmers and rural communities.
Everywhere in the world, renewable energy has become the cheapest form of energy.
Unfortunately tariffs and changes in federal policies that subsidize fossil fuels over clean energy are increasing the cost RPU must pay for transitioning to clean energy in the short run.","Nearly every politician who waxes poetic about not leaving our children in debt has shown themselves to be a flaming hypocrite.

The most recent example is Rep. Brad Finstad, who voted to take away health care and food from millions of low-income families and to somehow still increase the federal debt. Our debt is now bigger than our annual economy and only growing. There is a reckoning coming, and it is going to be brutal. But there at least can be a reckoning. Financial crises are bad but survivable, and you can come out of them.

I am more concerned about the second debt that we are leaving our children: anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change. We are already experiencing climate change. It is creating massive wildfires in Canada which choke our air each summer. More frequent severe storm events and droughts are pushing already-stressed farmers over the edge. And, unlike a financial crisis, there likely is not a way to correct a climate crisis in a human time frame.

Let’s not pretend we aren’t already paying for climate change. Insurance on your home has increased significantly as a result of climate disaster-related claims. The Harvard Joint Center on Housing Studies found that from 2008 to 2024, average costs rose from about $1,150 to $2,000 annually. These are only averages and probably lower than the increases we have seen in Minnesota. Thank God we don’t live in Florida.

The Trump administration is trying hard to undercut clean energy by removing clean energy incentives and by heavily subsidizing coal, oil and gas. Nuclear energy is a good climate solution, but makes no fiscal sense. Renewable technologies are made more expensive by heavy tariffs.

In the face of all of this, Rochester Public Utilities is asking us, its customers, if we want to abandon our commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2030. I was part of the team that put this in place and I hope that subsequent leadership doesn’t fail us. I hope Mayor Norton and RPU board members are not remembered as the ones that gave up the vision.

The idea of abandoning renewable energy is as irresponsible fiscally as it is environmentally. There used to be a trade-off between cleaner energy and lower costs. Now they are aligned, and the only thing gained by sabotaging clean energy is to make our energy more expensive and remove the U.S. from a leadership position. Undercutting renewable energy also undercuts millions of jobs and revenue that support farmers and rural communities.

Battery storage technology has come a long way, and today the batteries aren't that expensive, and the technology is already working in places like California. I would encourage everyone to listen to David Roberts’ Volts Podcast to learn just how far solar and battery storage has come.

Everywhere in the world, renewable energy has become the cheapest form of energy. In 2018, the sales of fossil-fueled cars peaked and that number is falling every year. Attacking clean energy is attacking America’s leadership position and even those attacks will fail. By next year, renewables will surpass coal as the top power source in the world . Investing in new fossil fuel power generation today is the mark of a fool.

So, instead of RPU asking how it can do less, it should be asking how it can do more. RPU should be leading the charge to eliminate gas from home heating and water conditioning. A permit to install residential solar should be free and take less than 15 minutes.

Unfortunately tariffs and changes in federal policies that subsidize fossil fuels over clean energy are increasing the cost RPU must pay for transitioning to clean energy in the short run.

Sun Day is a day of action on Sept. 21, 2025, celebrating the power of clean energy. I installed solar panels on my family home long ago and look forward to the celebration. Just last week I used our gas cooktop for the very last time. I believe it is only a matter of time before the U.S. joins the rest of the world on a near-total transition to clean energy.

I was proud to be a part of the team that made RPU a leader. As part of my Sun Day celebration, I will be contacting current RPU board members and asking them to do more, not less.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/eb7b31a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2834x1771+0+0/resize/1706x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffcc-cue-exports-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fpostbulletin%2Fbinary%2Ff44ba7fc04e7c15e7274059b97b910a8_binary_5051994.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:03.880749

The path to sustainable automotive manufacturing is fraught with challenges, but the opportunities for innovation are immense.

Making the shift to sustainable automotive manufacturing is far from simple and requires industry-wide strategies to overcome a variety of persistent and complex challenges.

Manufacturing vehicles at scale has always been resource-intensive, with the production of heavy metals like steel and aluminum consuming vast amounts of energy and impacting the environment. Additionally, materials used throughout the manufacturing lifecycle are frequently wasted, further increasing carbon emissions and releasing harmful chemicals into the ecosystem.

Similar challenges exist regarding the management of materials at the end of a vehicle’s lifecycle. Manufacturers often struggle with inefficient and eco-unfriendly disposal processes, hindering the recovery and reuse of materials. This inefficiency increases the energy required to produce the next generation of vehicles.

These challenges are compounded by the complexity of global supply chains. Manufacturers must ensure that their suppliers worldwide engage in sustainable practices while adapting to evolving regulations and compliance obligations associated with each supplier’s location.

At Magna, sustainability is embedded into every aspect of our global business. Our ECO50 sustainability initiative, aimed at creating annual savings through energy reduction projects and on-site renewable energy generation, saved 260,000 megawatt hours of electricity last year—the equivalent of planting more than 4.6 million trees or powering approximately 24,000 homes for a year.

To reduce emissions, we have heavily invested in sustainable energy sources. In the past year alone, we tripled the number of our divisions using solar panels. In 2024, 135 divisions are using renewable electricity, and we’ll go to 150 divisions by the end of 2025. For context, it was only 29 divisions in 2021 and 61 in 2022.

One example of our energy-saving efforts is the automatic control of roof hatches at a Magna Mirrors facility in Europe. By adapting the control system to stop heating and cooling when the domes are opened manually, we saved more than 14,000 kilowatt hours per year, the equivalent of charging nearly 800,000 smartphones.

These programs underscore the importance of automotive innovation in addressing sustainable challenges and maximizing outcomes. As a testament to our efforts, Magna’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 was verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), confirming that our sustainability targets align with the latest climate science.

Maximizing our use of sustainable materials and reducing waste has also been a significant focus at Magna.

The discussions came as Louisiana faces decisions that could significantly shape its energy future.

Research Institutions & Private Sector Lead Change

Bobby Tudor, founder and CEO of Artemis Energy Partners, said recent global events have made clear just how dependent modern society remains on traditional fuels.

“The war in the Ukraine changed everything because it reminded the world the degree to which our society is highly dependent on our energy systems and, at this moment, highly dependent on fossil fuels,” he said.

He pointed to Houston’s business landscape as evidence of that reliance, noting that 21 of the city’s 25 Fortune 500 companies are in the energy field.

Even so, Tudor insisted that government is not the primary force behind energy’s direction. “It’s not the government that determines the direction energy will take, it’s research institutions and the private sector,” he said.

To illustrate his point, Tudor cited Texas’ surprising shift to renewables. “A few years ago, if you told people the majority of power in Texas would one day be provided by renewable energy sources, they would have laughed,” he said. “On a recent hot sunny day this year, renewables provided 71% of our grid’s power. It’s technology that changes the game.”

The Challenge Ahead

Colette Hirstius, president of Shell USA, echoed Tudor’s focus on transition while stressing the scale of the challenge.

“We need to figure out how to transition from the 80% fossil fuels we use today, which is still about one-third coal, one-third natural gas and one-third oil, and transition to lower carbon intensities and then eventually, as the system evolves and grows, transition to much more renewables,” she said.

Hirstius added that while the path to renewables will take time, the policies adopted now will determine where investment flows in the years ahead.

“The policies that we are developing today are vital,” Hirstius said. “In many cases, the investments that are required are more on the renewables and the carbon capture side. The policy that we have around oil and gas is pretty well established, so it’s in the new growth where we need policies in support of those investments to come here.”

Carbon Capture and Sequestration

Louisiana is already testing new approaches. On Sept. 15 the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources authorized the construction of its first carbon capture and storage well.

The decision came more than a year and a half after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gave Louisiana authority to issue Class VI permits for CO₂ injection wells, shifting oversight from the federal level to the state.

The permit, located near Hackberry and under the Black Lake southwest of Lake Charles, allows a Sempra Infrastructure affiliate to inject up to 2 million metric tons of CO₂ annually for 20 years. For Louisiana, where heavy industry drives both jobs and emissions, the project marks a significant step.

Although critics argue carbon capture is simply a way for fossil-fuel producers to keep operating while claiming to be part of the solution, industry leaders say it serves as a necessary stopgap at a time when oil and gas will remain central to global demand.

Tudor said during the Tulane Forum that population and wealth growth in Asia will keep consumption high for decades. “Demographic changes in Asia will keep the demand for oil and gas high for a further 30-40 years,” he said.

Global Shipping Fee on Greenhouse Gases

That same tension between sustained demand and the need to cut emissions is also visible at sea, where shipping companies are preparing for new climate rules.

The Getting to Zero Coalition, joined by shipping industry leaders and environmental groups, is preparing for a critical meeting in London this fall. The International Maritime Organization will convene its Marine Environment Protection Committee from October 14 to 17. At that meeting, delegates are expected to vote on the IMO Net-Zero Framework, a package of amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) that would, for the first time, place a global price on carbon emissions from shipping.

The proposal calls for a minimum charge on each ton of carbon dioxide emitted by ships, with higher costs for vessels that exceed set thresholds. Supporters say the levy would push the industry toward cleaner fuels and new technologies while generating revenue to support climate transition efforts. They argue the policy is essential to align shipping with the Paris Agreement.

The coalition is urging member nations to back the measure, framing it as a necessary step to bring the world’s shipping fleet in line with international climate commitments.

Studies in the U.S. and Japan tested ChargeMinder, an app developed by TRI’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) division, which incorporates insights from behavioral science.

Key findings:

In the U.S., behavioral interventions increased charging by 10% for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) drivers.

In Japan, PHEV and battery electric vehicle (BEV) drivers shifted charging to peak renewable energy hours by 59%, adding nearly 30 minutes of daytime charging per vehicle, per day.

Interventions increased the satisfaction of U.S. PHEV drivers with their vehicles by 16 percentage points, bringing it to 100%.

“Technology is not the only way to reduce emissions — people’s choices matter too,” said Dr. Gill Pratt, Chief Scientist for Toyota Motor Corporation and CEO, Toyota Research Institute. “This research and development shows how science-based behavioral interventions can both help us reduce carbon emissions as much as possible, as soon as possible, and increase customer satisfaction.”

Why Behavior Matters

Technology is not the only path to lower emissions. To reduce their total carbon impact, electrified vehicles must be charged regularly and at the optimum times when cleaner energy sources are available. Without changes in charging behavior, vehicles like PHEVs and BEVs cannot deliver their full climate benefit.

“Behavioral science is a powerful, scalable tool to help achieve carbon neutrality,” said Dr. Laura Libby, Manager, Carbon Neutrality, Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, Toyota Research Institute. “Research in behavioral science shows that small, targeted interventions can have a large impact on people’s decisions and actions.

By securing state incentives, accelerating production timelines, and aligning with national manufacturing trends, the automaker is positioning itself to capitalize on a rapidly evolving industry while creating long-term value for shareholders.

State Incentives and Cost Structure Optimization

Georgia's incentive package—valued at $1.5 billion—includes infrastructure support and job creation commitments, reflecting the state's aggressive pursuit of EV manufacturing dominance. According to a report by the

Forums, the agreement requires Rivian to deliver 80% of its promised jobs and investments by 2030, with 7,500 direct jobs expected at the new 2,000-square-foot plant near Social CircleUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed, [https://www.rivianforums.com/rivian-georgia-plant-site-development-resumed/][ 1 ]. These incentives directly reduce Rivian's capital expenditures and operational costs, enabling the company to scale production without shouldering the full burden of infrastructure development.

The financial implications are significant. By leveraging state support, Rivian can allocate resources to R&D and supply chain optimization rather than front-loading costs for factory construction. This aligns with broader industry trends, where states like Georgia are competing to attract EV manufacturers through tailored incentives, including tax credits and workforce training programsUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed, [https://www.rivianforums.com/rivian-georgia-plant-site-development-resumed/][ 1 ]. For Rivian, this reduces financial risk and enhances profit margins, particularly as the company ramps production of its R2 and R3 midsize SUVs—a segment critical to capturing mass-market demand.

Production Timelines and Market Positioning

Rivian's Georgia plant is scheduled to begin construction in 2026, with first vehicles expected by 2028Update on new Georgia plant - site development resumed, [https://www.rivianforums.com/rivian-georgia-plant-site-development-resumed/][ 1 ]. This timeline is strategically designed to complement its existing Illinois facility, where R2 production has already commenced to meet early demand. By overlapping production between the two sites, Rivian mitigates bottlenecks and ensures a steady supply of vehicles, a critical advantage in a market where competitors like

and legacy automakers are grappling with production delays.

The R2 and R3 models represent a calculated pivot toward affordability and accessibility. Priced lower than Rivian's flagship R1 lineup, these SUVs target a broader demographic, aligning with the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) consumer tax credits for U.S.-made EVs. With Georgia's incentives and IRA benefits, Rivian can undercut competitors on price while maintaining profitability—a dual advantage that strengthens its value proposition.

Strategic Alignment with U.S. Manufacturing Trends

Rivian's expansion in Georgia also underscores its alignment with U.S. manufacturing trends, including nearshoring and supply chain resilience. The state's incentives are part of a larger policy shift to localize EV production, reducing reliance on overseas suppliers and insulating manufacturers from global trade disruptionsUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed, [https://www.rivianforums.com/rivian-georgia-plant-site-development-resumed/][ 1 ].

Long-Term Value Creation and Shareholder Implications

For shareholders, Rivian's Georgia investment represents a calculated bet on sustained growth. The $1.5 billion in state incentives directly lowers the break-even point for the plant, while the 7,500 projected jobs by 2030 signal a scalable business model. Moreover, the R2 and R3's entry into the midsize SUV segment—a category projected to dominate EV sales—positions Rivian to capture market share from both traditional automakers and tech-driven rivals.

However, success hinges on Rivian's ability to meet its 2030 commitments. Delays in construction or unmet job targets could trigger clawbacks or reputational damage. Yet, given the company's track record of accelerating timelines (e.g., starting R2 production in Illinois ahead of Georgia's plant), these risks appear manageable.

Conclusion

Rivian's Georgia expansion is a masterclass in leveraging state incentives to drive cost efficiency, align with national manufacturing priorities, and scale production in a competitive EV landscape. By securing infrastructure support, optimizing production timelines, and targeting a high-growth vehicle segment, the company is laying the groundwork for sustained profitability. For investors, this represents a compelling case of strategic capital allocation—one that could redefine Rivian's role in the U.S. EV ecosystem and deliver outsized returns in the years ahead.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd23363f0bc001.png,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:49.489292

The company intends to build a magnet plant in South Carolina by the end of 2025, which will be able to produce approximately 2,000 metric tons per year when running at full capacity. As much as 90 percent of the new American plant’s output will go to GM.

“European governments are starting to wake up slowly, but they’re far behind what America is doing,” VAC CEO Erik Eschen told Reuters. “We have a lot of technology in Europe, and what we are doing right now is transferring a lot of that technology to the United States.” VAC currently operates a magnet facility in Hanau, Germany.

The new enforcement funding was expected to raise $100 billion in revenue from corporations and individuals making over $400,000.","Key takeaways

Congressional leaders have eliminated nearly all the Inflation Reduction Act’s $45.6 billion in new funding for tax enforcement at the IRS in just three years (it was supposed to last for 10). That account is down to roughly $300 million at the end of June, with only $2.7 billion spent for its intended purpose and the rest abandoned in a series of ill-advised political deals.

This funding was essential to helping our tax system function properly by collecting the taxes owed by wealthy households and profitable corporations.

The funding boost would also have modestly reduced the deficit, since tax enforcement funding more than pays for itself. Killing it puts additional pressure on the growing deficit.

As the media and the public focus on Congressional negotiations that may or may not avert a government shutdown, Republican lawmakers are quietly luring their Democratic colleagues into weakening the IRS, just as they did during the previous government funding showdown in the spring and on several occasions before that.

Tucked in the Senate’s bipartisan FY2026 bill (S.258) to fund the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education is language rescinding $11.7 billion from the IRS’s operations budget, which had been provided by 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

In the spring, the Republicans succeeded in eliminating virtually all the $45.6 billion provided by the IRA for tax enforcement against high-income tax cheats. Having completed that mission, they are now moving on to attack the funding for IRS operations, which affects everyone trying to file their taxes.

To find our way out of this mess, we need to understand how we got here.

The IRA provided the IRS with $80 billion in new mandatory funding designed to bolster the agency’s regular annual base funding for the next decade. While the base funding is all about “keeping the lights on” and covering the agency’s routine activities, the mandatory money was designed to be transformational, filling in long-standing gaps, upgrading 1960s-era technology, and bringing the country’s accounts receivable department into the 21st century.

Of that total, a little under half was earmarked for operations support ($25.3 billion), taxpayer services ($3.2 billion), business systems modernization ($4.8 billion), and oversight ($557.5 million).

Tax enforcement was supposed to receive the rest: roughly $45.6 billion to help the agency recoup some of the hundreds of billions in revenue lost to federal coffers due to wealthy and corporate tax avoidance. This was a smart, fiscally responsible investment which should have had broad appeal to anyone serious about addressing annual deficits. After all, as the Congressional Budget Office routinely finds, this funding pays for itself many times over.

But now an account that had once held close to $46 billion and was intended to help the IRS collect more of what is owed by rich households and profitable corporations through 2031, is down to roughly $300 million (based on expenditures through June 30) and will likely be depleted before the end of the year.

The ramifications of this successful assault on IRS funding have largely flown under the radar. But these attacks should be viewed as a tax giveaway to the ultra-rich that is every bit as egregious as the massive tax cuts for the well-off included in the recently enacted Trump megabill.

Funding tax enforcement should be a no-brainer

At first glance, ensuring that the public follows the laws that Congress has enacted seems like something Congress would support without much controversy. One might even expect that to be especially true for tax compliance, since tax enforcement raises revenue without requiring elected officials to raise existing taxes or create new ones.

A well-funded IRS fully staffed up with highly trained experts can get a huge bang for its buck, raising $12 for every $1 it spends on auditing the richest 10 percent of households. Some estimates suggest that the true benefit may be even higher when it comes to auditing the ultra-ultra-rich—closer to $26 per every $1 spent auditing the top 0.1 percent. Part of this return on investment comes through spurring improved voluntary compliance. Just like drivers tend to slow down when they’ve been dinged by a traffic camera, wealthy taxpayers tend to be more vigilant about paying what they owe in the years following an audit.

Yet attacking the IRS has been a popular GOP pastime since the Gingrich era—with “abolish the IRS” serving as a regular campaign pitch to GOP base voters. Between 2010 and 2021, the House Tea Party majority led a sustained attack on the agency that cut funding for IRS enforcement by 25 percent, leading to a 40 percent reduction in the number of dedicated revenue agents.

As a result, audit rates for large corporations fell 54 percent and audit rates for millionaires dropped by a staggering 71 percent between 2010 and 2019, according to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of Treasury data.

Auditing regular taxpayers is easy, and relatively cheap, and although each individual audit doesn’t raise much revenue, one agent can alone handle dozens of cases. Auditing the ultra-rich, however, requires teams of experienced personnel trained in combing through complicated business arrangements, sophisticated tax shelters, and tax returns that can run hundreds of pages.

That’s why, in 2020, the last year of the first Trump administration, a grossly underfunded IRS audited low-income tax filers receiving the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) at a higher rate than it audited millionaires for the first time in history.

And as a result, the annual tax gap— the difference between what is legally owed and what is actually collected— grew. Early in 2021, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, appointed by Donald Trump, warned Congress that the gap could be as high as $1 trillion, and urged lawmakers to take action to improve enforcement.

Bipartisan agreement to fix the IRS fell apart

In June 2021, a bipartisan group of 20 senators unveiled a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure investment package paid for, in part, by a $40 billion increase to IRS tax enforcement capabilities. The new enforcement funding was expected to raise $100 billion in revenue from corporations and individuals making over $400,000.

Republican Senators Shelley Moore Capito and Susan Collins, for example, were quoted as saying “regular taxpayers can’t stand it when somebody is not paying their fair share,” and “providing IRS with more resources so that people who were evading taxes [pay what] they owe is a good idea.” Compared to the perceived political pain of raising new taxes, enforcing existing tax laws promised to be a win-win for members on both sides of the aisle, providing an influx of new revenue without violating conservatives’ no-new-taxes pledges.

But the bipartisan enthusiasm for enforcing our nation’s tax laws was soon short-circuited by the same special interests that had benefited from the IRS’s decline in the first place. As Politico reported that May, “Conservative groups have launched a campaign of TV ads, social media messages and emails to supporters criticizing the proposal to hire nearly 87,000 new IRS workers over the next decade to collect money from tax cheats.” Soon, anti-IRS messages were flooding the airwaves with ominous warnings that Biden’s IRS was “aggressively coming for every dime they can grab from your house.”

Eventually Senate Republicans backed away from IRS funding and the bipartisan infrastructure package was eventually enacted without tax enforcement funding and with a $256 billion revenue shortfall built in.

Inflation Reduction Act to the rescue

Despite this setback, the Biden administration remained committed to its plan to overhaul the IRS through an infusion of new mandatory funding (on top of its annual discretionary funding) that would ensure the agency had the resources to modernize its aging technology, improve customer service, and crack down on wealthy and corporate tax avoidance and evasion.

And so, in the summer of 2022 a pared-down version of the Biden tax plan was enacted as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). IRS enforcement funding was one of the few tax provisions that made it into the final bill (along with an important corporate alternative minimum tax)—and the one designed to ensure the successful implementation of the Act’s other tax provisions.

In the heady months that followed, the IRS dove into cracking down on rich tax cheats and rolled out an ambitious 10-year spending plan that envisioned hiring “hundreds of employees in the coming years with skills to undertake those audits and to transform the agency’s technology to better spot noncompliance.”

Despite the inherently slow nature of hiring highly skilled personnel, the administration’s focus on auditing the ultra-rich paid off relatively quickly. By fall of 2024, the Biden IRS had announced that it had recovered $1.3 billion from “high-income, high-wealth individuals,” including $172 million from 21,000 wealthy taxpayers who had not filed tax returns since 2017.

To reduce the debt, cripple the taxman?

To best understand how the IRA money for tax enforcement disappeared, we need to travel back to 2011. As the economy struggled to recover from global financial collapse, President Obama faced an extremist House Republican majority threatening to default on the federal debt unless he agreed to deep spending cuts. He capitulated, and the resulting Budget Control Act unleashed years of chaos across the federal government, negatively impacting everything from federal research to transportation and infrastructure.

This was also a cautionary tale about legitimizing debt-limit hostage-taking. Two years later, Obama warned against creating “a situation in which each time the United States is called upon to pay its bills, the other party can simply sit there and say, ‘Well, we’re not going to pay the bills unless you give us what we want.’ That changes the constitutional structure of this government entirely.”

By 2023, with the lingering economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic playing the same role that those of the Great Recession had 12 years before, the circumstances were once again ripe for an extremist House Republican majority to hold a first-term Democratic president hostage as he grappled with a global economic crisis. After months of suggesting that he wouldn’t negotiate over the debt limit, President Biden suddenly changed course and agreed to a deal with Speaker McCarthy.

In exchange for suspending the debt limit until January 2025, the deal—a mixture of immediate legislative changes and informal “sidecar” agreements designed to guide future legislation—would impose unrealistically low caps on discretionary spending, create new red-tape bureaucracy for older adults receiving food assistance, claw back billions in unspent Covid relief funds, and cut over $20 billion of IRS’s mandatory funds over the next two fiscal years.

A wolf in sheep’s clothing

The first official cut was deceptively small, rescinding only $1.4 billion of the IRS’s IRA enforcement funds.[1] Since most observers focused on the IRA’s headline figure of “$80 billion” for the IRS, this seemed like a drop in the bucket. But the real cuts were coming next, and the real total wasn’t $80 billion, it was just shy of $46 billion—the amount designated for enforcement.

Here’s how the deal was supposed to work: House Republicans would agree to boost non-defense discretionary spending above the so-called Fiscal Responsibility Act’s caps in upcoming appropriations bills. In exchange, Senate Democrats would cut the IRS’s IRA enforcement money by $10 billion in Fiscal Year 2024 and another $10.2 billion the next fiscal year. This sleight of hand would let Republicans pretend they were “paying for” the boost to non-defense spending, even as the real-world effect was to slash revenues and increase the deficit.

But it didn’t work that way. Instead, in January 2024 with a partial government shutdown looming, House Republicans and Senate Democrats struck a deal that would keep the topline spending level, but only with additional concessions from Democrats— including frontloading all of the planned IRS rescissions into the first fiscal year, leaving the question of Fiscal Year 2025 unresolved.

Each side messaged the deal differently, with Democrats arguing that the IRS cuts that Biden had agreed to were now fulfilled and Republicans claiming they’d won “an additional $10 billion in cuts to the IRS mandatory funding” with more cuts to come in Fiscal Year 2025.

Advocates cautioned Democratic leadership that the deal was a bad one, noting that it created a $70 billion hole in the budget that Congress would have to fill “simply to maintain spending at current levels and Speaker Johnson is already predicting additional IRS cuts next fiscal year.”

“This is why,” the advocates continued, “it’s essential for you to unequivocally state your strong opposition to any further reductions in IRS funding.”

But the administration assured its allies in Congress that the IRS could easily absorb the cuts, and that it would simply reduce by two years the 10-year runway created by the IRA. That argument was based on the highly implausible notion that it would be easy enough for a future Congress to simply provide more IRS funding in another six years, despite the previous two decades of underfunding. But it was enough to convince Democratic leadership and senior appropriators.

With the topline question settled, Congress passed a Fiscal Year 2024 omnibus appropriations package in March that included the entire $20.2 billion IRS rescission in one fell swoop.

And thus the transformational account had become a piggybank— and not only at the legislative level. Behind the scenes, IRS leadership was also transferring funds out of the enforcement account to backfill gaps in other parts of their base budget, in part to ensure the public’s experience with tax filing season went off without (too many) hitches.

As bad as it looked to outside observers, the reality was worse.

IRS cuts on autopilot

In September 2024, Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) extending Fiscal Year 2024 policies and funding levels through December (it would normally have ended September 30). Unfortunately, passing a CR instead of writing a new appropriations package comes with its own complications.

As the name suggests, a continuing resolution simply extends the previous year’s language, unless an explicit exception (an “anomaly” in congressional parlance) is included to strip out or alter that language. The 2024 law included a $20.2 billion rescission to IRS funding, so absent an anomaly, the old language automatically replicated itself for the new fiscal year, like a dangerous mutation that gets passed on every time a cell replicates.

The CR didn’t formally rescind the IRS’s funding by an additional $20.2 billion, but it did block the agency from obligating any of those funds during its duration.

White House staff and Democratic leadership explained to advocates that they hadn’t put up a fight over the IRS anomaly in September because the IRS could survive until December without facing a shortfall. But, they promised, in December they would absolutely stand their ground.[2]

In December, reeling from the election results, Democratic leadership once again declined to fight for the anomaly, arguing that the IRS could make it until March without facing a shortfall. Besides, they said, there was no need to fight over the anomaly right then, because Republicans would have to write a new bill come March regardless, and that new bill wouldn’t carry the bad “mutation” of the IRS cuts.

When pressed, appropriators noted that while Republicans could technically carry forward the IRS cuts by simply extending the 2024 language again, “that’s not how it’s ever been done.”

It doesn’t take an astute political scientist to guess what happened next.

Republican leadership crafted a CR that stealthily repeated in Fiscal Year 2025 the $20.2 billion cut to IRS that was included in Fiscal Year 2024—along with a host of other highly partisan provisions—and then dared Senate Democrats to blink. Senate Democrats blinked. And just like that, a $45.6 billion account was slashed by 92 percent.

Combined with the IRS’s spending, the mandatory enforcement account is close to gone, if not entirely gone. And Republicans, impressively, didn’t have to do much of anything at all to win their number one biggest priority: protecting rich tax cheats.

[1] The legislative text of the Fiscal Responsibility Act allowed the rescission to be withdrawn across a number of IRS’s IRA accounts, but the Biden Administration chose to pull the entire rescission from enforcement, specifically Section 10301(1)(A)(ii) of the IRA.","https://media.itep.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,onerror=redirect/https://media.itep.org/IRS-funding-blog-cover-1024x576.jpg",N,,2025-09-16 15:01:48.044328

ONE founder and CEO Mujeeb Ijaz told Crain’s on Tuesday that the move is the result of EVs failing to launch in the U.S. at the previously predicted scale.

“Our contracting effort on automotive looks to be delayed by several years based on the current macro condition, and we’ve just adjusted our business to manage that,” Ijaz told Crain’s in an interview.

ONE made a major splash in fall 2022 with plans to be the first U.S.-based company to establish a domestic lithium iron phosphate battery plant. The factory — backed by $237 million in taxpayer subsidies — was to feed EV-crazed automakers with a less costly, more sustainable battery than the standard nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry.

But demand for EVs failed to launch, automakers pulled back investment dramatically and the business case for battery plants imploded. The Trump administration’s rollback of EV tax credits and fuel emission regulations has further chilled electrification in the auto industry.

ONE will continue to operate its cell production pilot line in Van Buren Township. The company has created about 70 jobs and invested $117.6 million in eligible costs under its deal with the state. It employs a total of 180 people in Novi.

Per terms of the contract, ONE has until December 2029 to meet its investment and jobs commitment. The cash it has received from the state was not dependent on creating jobs, but on meeting private financing benchmarks.

The MEDC is in regular contact with Our Next Energy and reviewing “potential impacts to the incentive agreement,” spokeswoman Danielle Emerson said.

“While the jobs requirement milestone for this project is not due until December 2029, we are being proactive in working with ONE to ensure the agreement reflects any updated scope of the project,” Emerson said. “In the meantime, no new disbursements will be made under the current agreement.”

The statement continued: “We are optimistic about the company’s path forward given the potential benefit from the federal One Big Beautiful Bill tying tax credits to domestic content … The MEDC is committed to protecting those disbursed public dollars and ensuring this opportunity stays in Michigan.”

ONE has been treading water since its Series C fundraising round fell through at the end of 2023, but notably, the company has avoided total collapse — a fate that has befallen many EV companies and projects over the past couple of years.

Most recently, Australian mining giant Fortescue scrapped plans for a $210 million EV battery factory in Detroit that had been expected to create up to 600 jobs, citing “current policy settings and market conditions.”

Ijaz also pointed to regulatory upheaval as a force delaying EV growth in the U.S.

“Basically, a lot of noise in the system in the last six months regarding tariffs, incentives, customer demand, all of the interest rate, economic considerations have just pushed the automotive market out, and we just can’t predict how long that will be,” he said.

Ijaz said the company aims to achieve break-even by the end of next year. The CEO has been focused on reducing cash burn and finding revenue streams. While its long-term goal is landing a major auto contract, its primary focus now is energy storage systems for the power grid. It is also working to grow business in other sectors including defense and even locomotives.

The company declined to disclose revenue or the state of its fundraising efforts. Ijaz said he is confident that Our Next Energy has enough runway to see through to brighter days in the auto sector.

ONE’s non-binding agreement with Ashley Capital to develop an automotive battery factory next to its current building remains in place when that time comes, Ijaz said. It did not make sense to pay millions of dollars to lease all of the current space without using it. The new development would be built taller and specifically for battery manufacturing, unlike the current one.

Ijaz also remains confident that LFP technology will withstand the test of time even as auto companies work furiously for the next tech breakthrough.

“I don’t believe iron phosphate is a chemistry that is going to be forgotten for the advancement of some other chemistries,” he said. “It is safe, it is very durable, it is cost-effective, using materials that are abundantly available around the world, and it is well industrialized now around the world.”",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/230518_OurNextEnergy_168.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 14:01:31.681486

The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they’re superior.

“We did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,” Hoffman said. “And we’re going to prove that we’re going to be successful in the future.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S sport utility vehicle in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. The company has said the Georgia operation will be able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028. It plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful of the startup automakers.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But the competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Hoffman said Rivian hopes the U.S. Department of Energy will distribute the loan money, arguing it will boost domestic manufacturing.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is “in this for the long haul.”

“We think that we can compete with anyone out there and that once given the opportunity, we’re going to excel,” he said.

Kaufman, Shayle Kann, Stephen Lacey, Open Circuit",,,,,https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/the-trump-administration-is-stonewalling-tribal-clean-energy-projects/,"It’s a question that DOI has yet to answer, despite calls from Tribal clean energy advocates for the office to clarify its stance.
“The result is Tribal clean energy projects will be delayed or blocked outright, clearing the way for fossil fuel projects that are not subject to equivalent secretarial-level oversight.” Campaigning for clarity Miller explained that Tribal Nations face significantly higher energy burdens than other communities; according to the Department of Energy, Tribal communities endure 6.5 times more outages than the national average.
But as far as Miller and the Alliance are aware, only one Tribe applied for funding to build clean energy.
New partners The new approval process isn’t the only hurdle facing clean energy developments on Tribal land; Miller said that 100% of the Tribes that her organization works with rely on some form of federal funding to build clean energy projects.
Ultimately, the Alliance’s biggest question is whether any federal funding at all will be available for clean energy on Tribal lands.","In July, the Department of Interior quietly issued a directive requiring that every move made by a wind or solar project involving federal land — including at least 68 specific actions listed out in the memo, plus “any other similar or related decisions” — go through a multi-layered review and approval process ending with Secretary Doug Burgum himself.

The clean energy industry understood the memo to be a clear effort to block the buildout of a huge range of projects, including by causing such extended delays that projects couldn’t meet the window to be eligible for tax credits, which had been newly shortened by the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.” According to data from the Bureau of Land Management, as of January there were at least 48 wind, solar, and generator tie line projects proposed on public land, totaling 25.4 gigawatts of power.

One potentially unintended consequence of the wide-reaching memo, however, is its impact on clean energy projects built on Tribal lands, which are sovereign lands held in trust for federally recognized Tribes, and are separate from federal public land managed by agencies like BLM. In the wake of the memo, federal employees at the Department of Indian Energy, which supports federally recognized Tribes in executing energy projects, told Latitude Media that they were concerned that it could mean wind and solar projects seeking funding from the office would also be stonewalled.

It’s a question that DOI has yet to answer, despite calls from Tribal clean energy advocates for the office to clarify its stance.

Dr. Crystal Miller, who leads policy and government relations for the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, said that from a Tribal perspective, the memo as written was a “re-institutionalization of paternalism over Tribal Nations.”

“This additional review layer makes it even harder for Tribes to meet timelines for federal grants, and projects on Tribal lands often already require right of ways, leases, and even cultural resource reviews, all of which are directly named in the memo,” Miller said.

In practice, the memo is creating a bottleneck for Tribal projects, most of which are relying heavily on federal tax credits, she added.

Meanwhile, Tribes are more impacted by the early phase-out of those credits under the OBBB than most, Miller said, because they already face higher permitting hurdles thanks to overlapping jurisdictions.

“This additional review layer makes it even harder for Tribes to meet timelines for federal grants and tax credits,” she said. “The result is Tribal clean energy projects will be delayed or blocked outright, clearing the way for fossil fuel projects that are not subject to equivalent secretarial-level oversight.”

Campaigning for clarity

Miller explained that Tribal Nations face significantly higher energy burdens than other communities; according to the Department of Energy, Tribal communities endure 6.5 times more outages than the national average.

For more reliable energy, solar projects, both community-scale and rooftop, are often the most accessible forms of energy for a Tribe to build, she added: “They directly reduce utility bills and even allow, in some instances, Tribal Nations to actually have electricity for the first time.”

The DOI memo is already having a dampening effect on Tribal activity at the federal funding level, Miller said. The Alliance has already heard from some Tribes that they’re discouraged from applying for funding opportunities.

For example, over the summer the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs issued a solicitation for proposals for projects “that conduct resource inventories and assessments, feasibility studies, or other pre-development studies necessary to process, use, and develop energy and mineral resources.” The grant, called the Energy and Mineral Development Program, had $8.5 million to disburse to up to ten projects. But as far as Miller and the Alliance are aware, only one Tribe applied for funding to build clean energy.

In the weeks since the release of the memo, the Alliance’s goal has been to get “clarification” from DOI that Tribes are not included in the new review requirements. “We have been calling on Tribes to really reach out to their representatives, to have conversations with Secretary Burgum and his staff, and to request that…they clarify that Tribes are not being swept up in this,” Miller explained.

To date, there’s been very little movement on clarifying the memo. But Miller said the Alliance is still hopeful, partly because Burgum and his staff are taking meetings with Tribal-led coalitions on other topics.

Into the midst of this uncertainty, the Government Accountability Office earlier this month dropped a report recommending changes to federal procedures to reduce barriers for Tribes developing energy projects. The subject of the report is the DOE Tribal Energy Financing Program specifically, which was designed by the wider Loan Program’s office in collaboration with the Office of Indian Energy. But the challenges identified in the report, such as lack of access to capital and systemic barriers to accessing federal programs, mirror those that Miller has experienced in the Alliance’s work with DOI — ones that are already being worsened by the July memo.

New partners

The new approval process isn’t the only hurdle facing clean energy developments on Tribal land; Miller said that 100% of the Tribes that her organization works with rely on some form of federal funding to build clean energy projects.

That means the general uncertainty around disbursement of federal funding is taking a serious toll. Major sources of funding in recent years have included EPA’s now-cancelled Solar For All program, the Grid Deployment Office’s Tribal Transmission Infrastructure Planning Program (T-TIPP), and the Grid Resilience Formula Grant.

The latter is a cost match program established under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which offers $2.3 billion, spread over five years, to states and Tribes for grid resiliency projects. There are two years and about $1 billion left in that program, Miller explained, but today those funds are in limbo. In December, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which operates the program, issued a notice of intent to open the next round of funding by February 2025. As of August, though, Miller said Tribes haven’t heard any updates, and it’s not clear what will happen with that funding source.

Ultimately, the Alliance’s biggest question is whether any federal funding at all will be available for clean energy on Tribal lands. If that funding comes with additional hoops to be jumped through, Tribes will work through those, Miller said. But if funding simply isn’t available from the federal government, Tribes will have to pivot.

“The conversation that we’re all having is, ‘where do we turn to next?’” she explained. “We were accustomed to seeing a lot of different grant opportunities coming down from the federal level… but now if it’s no longer on the table, it’s really about removing the blinders. Where weren’t we looking in the past?”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-16T123405.457.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 14:01:18.084131

For now, U.S. installations fall far short of what would be required for grid-scale backup, and 80% to 90% of those batteries are tied up in vehicles or homes, rarely connected to the grid.

That imbalance is beginning to shift. The Connected Solutions program in the northeast U.S. already links more than 70,000 residential and commercial batteries, while China is weighing a nearly 1 TWh vehicle-to-grid network. If the United States tapped its 300 million passenger vehicles, averaging 100 kWh each, the result would be about 30 TWh of mobile storage. With U.S. annual electricity use at roughly 4,300 TWh, that’s almost three days of backup power parked in driveways and parking lots.

California’s residential batteries are projected to reach nearly 4 GW of power capacity by the mid-2030s. Since residential batteries average about 2.5 hours in duration, that translates to roughly 10 GWh of stored energy, a scale comparable to multiple gas plants. State regulators have taken notice.

The Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) program, launched in 2022, pays households to share part of their behind-the-meter storage during high-price hours and emergencies. According to the Brattle Group’s new analysis, The Demand Side Grid Support Program: An Assessment of Scale and Value, DSGS has already enrolled 700 MW of battery capacity, comparable to a large gas plant, and could nearly double to 1,300 MW by 2028.

Brattle’s modeling shows that between 2025 and 2028 the program will cost about $196 million but deliver $223 million to $402 million in benefits, producing net savings of up to $206 million. The benefits come from capacity and energy supplied during the 35 highest-priced “energy events” on California’s grid—hours that would otherwise be met by expensive, high-emission gas peaker plants.

One such event occurred on June 27, 2024, when a peak grid emergency triggered the Tesla Energy distributed battery fleet. Output jumped from zero to nearly 70% of enrolled capacity in just two hours, highlighting the responsiveness of residential batteries.

Source – Brattle Report

Beginning in 2025, defined DSGS events will be triggered when the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) day-ahead energy price exceeds $200/MWh, or during systemwide emergencies. Households that participate earn annual capacity payments of $62.10 to $82.80 per kilowatt, based on actual capacity delivered to the grid. Roughly 90% of total program costs are these payments to participants, with the remainder covering administration.

In total, Brattle estimates that $178 million in homeowner payments will offset $220 million to $399 million that would otherwise go to gas plant operators.

On July 29, 2025, California conducted its largest virtual power plant test—possibly the largest in the world. More than 100,000 distributed batteries sustained an average output of 539 MW over a two-hour period. Tesla units supplied 459 MW and other manufacturers 81 MW. Sunrun managed 68% of the fleet, Tesla Energy another 174 MW, with the rest spread across smaller aggregators.

The combined output shaved about 1.9% of California’s peak demand during the event. This is capacity typically supplied by gas peaker plants, which often cost several hundred dollars per megawatt-hour, and at times thousands, compared to average wholesale prices of $20 to 80/MWh.

The first virtual power plants were launched by sonnen in 2018 in Germany, and later recognized in the U.S. when the New England Independent System Operator approved Sunrun for a 5 MW facility.

As Donald Trump rolled down the 18th fairway at his Turnberry golf resort in July, he was troubled by a deathly vision, slowly spinning in the Scottish distance: wind turbines. “These things are massive, and you’re looking at these ugly windmills, and it’s a shame,” Trump lamented in an interview with the New York Post—yet another salvo in the president’s escalating war on wind energy and other renewables.

“It’s a con job saying the environmentalists want it, because I can’t believe they really want it,” Trump went on. “It kills the birds, ruins the look, they’re noisy. If you see them from your house, your house is worth like 50 percent or more less. I just think it’s a very bad thing.”

At Trump’s side on the course was his son Eric, who oversees his father’s golf empire as executive vice president of the Trump Organization. But a few months earlier and an ocean away, Eric had inked a remarkable series of deals in a very different industry, becoming a major player in a complex network of cryptocurrency ventures that could become a vast new source of family wealth. Key to his plans: a brand new bitcoin mine powered by a wind farm in the Texas Panhandle and a merger with a crypto company that once billed itself as “a pioneer in the realm of zero-emissions bitcoin mining.”

The bitcoin mine—known as the Vega Data Center—is a 162,000-square-foot building that will be packed to the rafters with thousands of high-end computers, cooled with water. The computers’ task is, quite literally, to print money. They’ll churn their way through increasingly complex algorithms, which, as they’re solved, release new bitcoins into the world. Bitcoin, the world’s marquee cryptocurrency, now has a market price well above $100,000; it’s a potentially lucrative project, but an enormously energy-hungry one.

That’s where wind power comes in—the Vega center was built over the last year next to the Canadian Breaks wind farm, a 200-megawatt facility in North Texas. Since 2019, the wind farm had supplied inexpensive green energy to Texas’ power grid. But last year, the farm’s owners agreed instead to sell the facility’s energy to a subsidiary of a company called Hut 8, which owns that new bitcoin mine. The deal was a triumph for Hut 8. Crypto mining is profitable only if the electricity it runs on is cheap, and, the company’s CEO told investors, the new mine “benefits from some of the lowest locational wholesale power prices in North America.”

So this past spring, when he struck a deal with Hut 8, Eric Trump became a power player in the worlds of both renewable energy and crypto mining—interlocking industries whose fortunes are being reshaped by his father’s presidency. His timing couldn’t have been better. He was locking in a low-cost source of clean power just as the Trump administration was ramping up a campaign to block construction of new wind projects around the country.

In late May, Eric and his brother Don Jr. took the stage at the annual Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas—and they had a message the crowd loved. America was now a pro-bitcoin country, and their father was a pro-bitcoin president who was going to do what he could to make American bitcoin dominant.

“We’re bringing bitcoin to America and America is going to win the crypto revolution—that much I can tell you!” Eric enthused. “We finally have a competent president in the White House. And we have a president who loves this industry. And who is behind this industry 100 percent!”

Eric wasn’t saying this as a simple emissary of his father’s political movement, delivering good news to the crypto-­loving conference-goers. He was gloating about the cleverness of American Bitcoin, a new crypto company he’d recently launched with a handful of partners. Eric and Don Jr. were onstage with two of those partners—Matt Prusak and Mike Ho—hyping bitcoin and the possibility that it would keep growing in price.

It’s not illegal for the Trump kids to run a crypto empire, says Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. But the potential conflict of interest is obvious: The president and his administration “have had a lot to say about the crypto industry and whether it should be regulated and how it should be regulated.”

“The American people have always been troubled by the idea that families would want to profit from the presidency or connection to the president,” Bookbinder adds.

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to break into the public consciousness and remains one of the most valuable and sought-after digital coins. When it was established, its anonymous creator designed it to be a finite resource that would slowly be distributed through “mining.” By solving complex mathematical problems that validate other bitcoin transactions, new bitcoins can be unlocked and claimed—a process that at first was simple and easy, but, by design, has become increasingly difficult. Once something that could be done by a hobbyist with a home PC, bitcoin mining is now the domain of investors who tie together the computing power of hundreds of servers to slowly grind away at unlocking new wealth.

While it’s still possible to have a crack at mining your own bitcoin, realistically, the vast computing power needed to make any significant headway requires hardware and energy on an industrial scale. It’s akin to the difference between a frontiersman panning for gold and a multinational conglomerate excavating it from a milewide pit. These days, crypto mining consumes so much electricity that it rivals the energy needs of entire cities—one recent study found that combined, the 34 largest bitcoin mines in the United States used one-third more electricity than all of Los Angeles. As new mines are established, it’s the equivalent of adding whole neighborhoods worth of energy consumption.

“I don’t know if you could call it an industry; they just take electricity and create bitcoin,” says Colin Read, a professor at SUNY Plattsburgh who has studied the environmental economics of crypto.

Crypto mining is almost entirely unregulated in the United States, and the formula for turning a profit is relatively straightforward. “If bitcoin’s prices go up and energy prices go down, you make a lot of money,” says Del Wright, a Louisiana State law professor who generally opposes new environmental rules on crypto. “It’s really a forecast on the cost of energy versus the cost of bitcoin, because you’re speculating on both.”

Still, few in mainstream finance have expressed an interest in the mining business; the demand for energy quickly becomes overwhelming, and the price of bitcoin is too unstable for most investors. For years, it was primarily done by huge server farms in China, where energy could be had for rock-bottom prices. But after the Chinese government turned against crypto, the US suddenly became a viable option—especially if you have the kind of access to cheap electricity that Eric Trump has secured in Texas.

Without hard assets backing it, the value of bitcoin is largely driven by interest and enthusiasm from investors. And the easiest way to generate that enthusiasm just might be a president who is relentlessly excited about promoting crypto—and relentlessly opposed to tightening restrictions on it.

That describes Trump, who has promised to defend Americans’ sacred right to mine for crypto and has even established a “strategic bitcoin reserve” for the US government. It’s a sharp departure from Joe Biden’s administration, which had generally cracked down on crypto, proposing strict regulation of the industry as a whole and floating the idea of a 30 percent tax on mining operations. Since Trump’s election last year, the price of bitcoin has skyrocketed.

There’s nothing simple about the Trump family’s ties to crypto. There are the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins and a line of NFTs bearing the president’s likeness. There’s World Liberty Financial, the Trumps’ decentralized crypto-finance exchange that has spun its own sprawling web of controversies. But the new bitcoin mining project might be the most byzantine of all.

It began with Don Jr. and Eric Trump joining a small investment bank called Dominari Holdings. Based in Trump Tower, Dominari is a publicly traded entity that began life as a pharmaceutical firm called AIkido Pharma before rebranding in 2022 as a financial services company. On January 21, the day after Donald Trump returned to office, Dominari’s stock was selling for just $1.41 a share after years of sliding since its rebirth. A few weeks after the inauguration, Don Jr. and Eric were announced as members of Dominari’s advisory board. They were each initially awarded 250,000 shares of the little bank’s stock, and eventually a total of 750,000 shares each—a stake that quickly ballooned to a value of nearly $10 million but has since slid to less than $5 million. Dominari is now trading around $6 per share.

Within a week, Dominari created a new company—working alongside the Trumps, though it’s unclear what their ownership stake might be—called American Data Centers. With the stated goal of becoming a leader in the world of giant server farms that power AI and crypto, it wasn’t yet clear to the public exactly what the operation might look like.

On March 31, the publicly traded bitcoin mining company Hut 8 announced it would buy the majority of American Data Centers, which it would rebrand as American Bitcoin. With Eric Trump as its new chief strategy officer, American Bitcoin now had a purpose—it would begin accumulating bitcoin by directing high-powered computer servers to unwind the complex algorithms.

American Bitcoin wouldn’t own any bitcoin mining machines itself—it would use equipment belonging to a different subsidiary of Hut 8. That includes the computers at Hut 8’s mammoth Vega Data Center in Texas, powered by dozens of neighboring wind turbines.

Eric’s new company will essentially serve as a digital vault for all this newly created bitcoin. In theory, as the value of the bitcoin it owns rises—through the slow creation of new coins and, hopefully, an ever-rising bitcoin market price—American Bitcoin’s value will grow with it.

Dominari Holdings and Hut 8 are themselves both publicly traded. Their new company, American Bitcoin, has also now gone public—a huge potential gold mine for its investors, including Eric and Don Jr. But going public is a difficult and onerous process if you follow the normal route of an initial public offering. To be successful, an IPO often requires teaming up with a traditional Wall Street powerhouse, like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan, and months or years of scrutiny and paperwork.

Instead, the partners chose an easier path—a merger with an already public company in need of a new purpose. In May, Eric Trump, Dominari, and Hut 8 announced that American Bitcoin was merging with Gryphon Digital Mining, a publicly traded but relatively low-profile bitcoin mining company. The new entity is 98 percent owned and fully operated by American Bitcoin and uses that name—Gryphon’s shareholders got 2 percent of the stock and no role in the new business.

American Bitcoin, Hut 8, the Trump Organization, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Dominari declined to comment.

It’s a long and winding path, but it ends with Eric helping to lead a public company whose plan is to become more and more valuable with every noisy whir of a server’s fan, every watt of energy, every pro-crypto utterance from his father—and every turn of a wind turbine alongside the Vega mine.

The question of where to get the electricity this expanding empire requires is a tricky one, but at least initially, Eric Trump and his partners are turning to one of his father’s greatest bêtes noires: renewable energy. Despite Donald Trump’s well-documented loathing of green power, it has a lot of upsides for bitcoin mining—once the infrastructure is built, the cost of producing wind, solar, and hydro power is extremely low.

That’s why Eric and Don Jr. have found themselves in business with companies that are very pro–green energy. The Hut 8 data center at the core of American Bitcoin’s business was built next to the Canadian Breaks wind farm; last year, Hut 8 reached an agreement giving it “exclusive access” to buy the energy the wind farm produces to power its mining equipment. And that equipment, according to SEC filings, will now be used for American Bitcoin’s mining business.

Gryphon—the publicly traded company subsumed into American Bitcoin—has its own long-standing commitments to green energy, boasting that its electricity use has been “certified as 100% renewable.” Its website touts its adherence to ESG, the “environmental, social, and governance” business principles that investors in Don Jr.’s orbit—along with the rest of the MAGA movement—tend to vilify as “woke” capitalism. Gryphon had previously announced plans to pair natural gas-powered data centers with carbon capture technology, and as recently as last spring, it pitched the idea that its bitcoin mining operations could be “the knight in shining armor” helping to support green energy development.

In reality, the armor might not be so shiny. Crypto mining operations gobble up limited clean power resources while driving up prices for everyone else, says Read, the SUNY economist. Long before its association with bitcoin mining, the Canadian Breaks wind farm was supplying enough clean energy to power thousands of homes in Texas. But now it will be sending all that electricity to Eric Trump’s bitcoin machines instead.

“They’re not green crusaders,” Read says. “Solar and wind are some of the cheapest power sources available if you can get the permit for them, but if all of that is going to crypto, it just means it’s not going to you and me.”

Meanwhile, the president and his allies in Congress have thrown up major new roadblocks and phased out tax incentives for renewable energy development, meaning that all those turbines could become increasingly difficult to replace on the power grid. The administration has repeatedly halted construction of new wind farms, including a nearly finished project off the coast of Rhode Island that was slated to provide enough power for hundreds of thousands of New England homes beginning next year. The result of all this, according to Bloomberg, is that deployment of new wind, solar, and battery infrastructure could fall by as much as 41 percent by 2028.

Across the country, utilities are reportedly raising rates for consumers, citing the increased demand from AI and crypto mining. Beyond his research, Read has firsthand knowledge of the drawbacks of mining—for four years, he was the mayor of Plattsburgh, New York, which had extraordinarily low electricity rates thanks to the nearby Niagara Falls hydro plant. When bitcoin miners approached the city around 2016 about building a facility similar, though smaller in scale, to the one American Bitcoin will be operating, local officials got on board. But according to Read, the new mine generated virtually no meaningful economic value for the city, while sending electric bills soaring with its huge demand for energy.

Read, who has published a book on the impacts of bitcoin, says the idea that the Trumps or anyone else in the mining industry are building anything of economic substance is an illusion.

“There’s almost been nothing like it,” Read says. “It’s an industry that uses that incredible amount of power, in a pretty small footprint, and yet employs very few people.”

He points out that in both mining and AI support, a facility that consumes as much as half a gigawatt of electricity—enough to power a large manufacturing plant—might employ fewer people than a McDonald’s.

“We usually think of industry as job creation. That’s why a lot of these communities are bending over backwards for data processing units for bitcoin or AI—because they think it will somehow translate into jobs and tax bases, but it simply doesn’t,” he says.

None of those pitfalls have dissuaded the Trumps. The president has thrown the full weight of his office behind crypto—everything from slashing SEC enforcement to undoing rules on crypto exchanges. And the first family’s tireless efforts to hype the industry have likely contributed to bitcoin’s rising price.

“The fact that some of his kids are getting in, I would say they have an expectation of how those things are going to move,” says Wright, the Louisiana State law professor. “If you’re around somebody who has access to levers of power, they can probably give you a better forecast of certain things.”

This past summer, the White House released a new crypto policy roadmap endorsing a long list of industry priorities. The report, which Wired described as “everything the industry ever wanted,” derided Biden’s “regulatory overreach” and trumpeted the end of Washington’s “enforcement-­first approach” to digital currency.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/506_BITCOIN-MINING.gif?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:36.757167

(NYSE American: HYLN), a developer of innovative electricity-producing technology, today announced that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a determination confirming that Hyliion’s KARNO™ Power Module is not regulated as an internal combustion engine under existing federal law and regulations. Instead, the KARNO Power Module will primarily be subject to local air permitting requirements applicable to power generation installations.

In a recent announcement, the EPA stated that the agency “is getting out of the way of new, innovative technology that will strengthen economic, national, and energy security. These generators have the ability to power data centers, the electric grid, and military installations. As these generators fall outside the scope of EPA’s engine standards, they can be deployed without triggering additional permitting requirements.”

The EPA’s determination acknowledges the fundamentally different and innovative design of the KARNO Power Module and provides a clear pathway for its deployment across both stationary and mobile power generation markets. This determination along with low emission performance of KARNO technology ensures effective regulatory compliance and a more efficient permitting process for customers adopting the technology.

“Hyliion is appreciative of the EPA's determination as it marks an important step in the commercialization journey of the KARNO Power Module,” said Thomas Healy, Founder and CEO of Hyliion. “This clarity allows us to accelerate deployment of a solution that is versatile, reliable, and fuel-flexible, helping power the industries of tomorrow, from data centers to defense, while creating jobs here in America.”

The KARNO Power Module is a fuel-agnostic linear generator capable of operating on more than 20 fuels, including natural gas, hydrogen, ammonia, renewable gases, and conventional liquid fuels. This unique versatility allows the KARNO Power Module to serve a wide range of critical applications such as defense installations, data centers, industrial facilities, and transportation hubs where reliable and cost-effective onsite power is increasingly essential.

Powered by heat and enabled by advanced 3D metal additive manufacturing, the KARNO Power Module offers breakthrough performance while expected to meet the most stringent emissions requirements in the United States, including the standards set by the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s Rule 1110.3 for Linear Generators.

The thermal batteries come complete with superheated liquid tin and argon-filled hermetically sealed chambers. The company’s goal, though, is far more prosaic — to store electricity cheap enough to make solar and wind an obvious choice for 24/7 power.

Here’s how the technology works: To store energy, electricity from the grid heats blocks of carbon inside insulated chambers filled with argon gas. When power is needed, the system pumps molten tin heated to a scorching 2,400°C (4,352°F) through graphite pipes — the only cost-effective material that can withstand those temperatures. Special solar panel-like devices called “thermophotovoltaic cells” then convert the heat back into electricity by capturing the white-hot tin’s infrared light.

The four-year-old, Cambridge, Massachusetts, startup has been refining the technology for the last two years, and it’s now preparing to build its first full-scale battery, molten tin and all. If all goes to plan, Fourth Power plans to deliver commercial-scale batteries to customers in 2028 at a cost that could undercut both lithium-ion batteries and peaking natural-gas plants.

“Our projections are for the first-of-a-kind — the first ones to market — that they’ll be cost competitive,” Arvin Ganesan, Fourth Power’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “Our comps for these markets are very high.”

In normal operation, Fourth Power envisions charging and discharging daily, providing continuous electricity for around eight hours or more. That’s twice as long as most grid-scale lithium-ion batteries are designed for. The insulation system, made from petroleum coke (a waste product from oil refining), keeps temperatures remarkably stable, losing only 1% of stored energy per day.

The company is currently running extensive testing on smaller versions of the system. “We’re now running cycles to make sure that we’re getting the expected amount of power out and to ensure the system is durable,” Ganesan said.

Alongside those tests, the company is designing a 1-megawatt-hour demonstration battery. To build that project, Fourth Power has raised $20 million in a round it’s calling a Series A Plus, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Munich Re Ventures with participation from Breakthrough Energy Ventures and DCVC. The startup previously raised a $19 million Series A in 2023.

Ultimately, Fourth Power hopes that once it hits large-scale production, the cost of storing electricity using its thermal batteries will fall to $25 per kilowatt-hour, one-tenth the cost of lithium-ion batteries.

“There’s not a lot of moving pieces. There’s not a lot of players in the supply chain, which means that you can get to cost targets in a fairly straightforward way,” Ganesan said. “We feel the $25 target is fairly straightforward to achieve.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8r3.MRdYIitF3Y2Hx4OMOQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/08afd70031c3cd91937812d68e77a8ae,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:19.898703

ATLANTA — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they’re superior.

“We did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,” Hoffman said. “And we’re going to prove that we’re going to be successful in the future.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S sport utility vehicle in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. The company has said the Georgia operation will be able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028. It plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful of the startup automakers.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But the competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Hoffman said Rivian hopes the U.S. Department of Energy will distribute the loan money, arguing it will boost domestic manufacturing.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is “in this for the long haul.”

“We think that we can compete with anyone out there and that once given the opportunity, we’re going to excel,” he said.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4 million worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.","A Texas refinery that supplies green fuel to U.S. airlines has been purchasing animal fat from cattle raised on illegally cleared lands in the Amazon rainforest, according to a Reuters review of government tracking data, interviews and eyewitness accounts.

Louisiana-based Diamond Green Diesel, a joint-venture between biofuels producer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a refinery in Port Arthur, Texas that turns cattle fat—called tallow—into a cleaner alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel and diesel.

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the U.S. sustainable fuels market. It has collected over $3 billion in U.S. tax credits for producing biofuels since 2022, according to filings.

But interviews and documents show at least two Brazilian factories that supplied Diamond Green Diesel with tens of thousands of tons of cattle fat since 2023 are sourcing some of it from slaughterhouses that have bought animals from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon rainforest.

Carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines, which struck deals with Valero to use the “green” jet fuel, can claim credit for lowering their emissions because Diamond Green Diesel’s plant is certified under a United Nations agreement curbing the impact of aviation on the climate called CORSIA.

The global market for sustainable jet fuel is small, about $2.9 billion in 2025 according to analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group, compared to the $239 billion global market for conventional aviation fuel. But government incentives are expected to help the market grow exponentially, pumping more resources into the Brazilian cattle industry, the leading driver of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Pedro Piris-Cabezas, an economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said any additional demand “could result in the expansion of herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation.”

It could also violate Brazilian law. “Companies that profit from raw materials originating from a supply chain that involves deforestation, are also responsible for these illegalities,” said Ricardo Negrini, a Brazilian federal prosecutor who has opened a number of government investigations into the cattle industry.

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.

To track the tallow trade from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, Reuters partnered with the nonprofit investigative outlet Reporter Brasil, which helped review court documents that link slaughterhouses to the tallow plants, corporate filings, trade data, and government cattle tracking records.

Reuters also interviewed over a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally-cleared land in the Amazon.

Tainted cattle

In 2022, Darling Ingredients CEO Randall Stuewe announced the $557 million acquisition of several plants in Brazil, including four in the Amazon region, that would supply “waste fats to be used in the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” according to a statement issued at the time.

Reuters found one of those rendering plants in Para state, called Araguaia, sourced cattle fat from at least five meatpackers that failed a May 2025 audit conducted by federal prosecutors for slaughtering 20,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4 million worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.

In June, a Reuters journalist saw a truck with an Araguaia logo inside the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse, which failed an audit for buying cattle from farms on illegally deforested land.

The driver of the truck, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he had been picking up carcasses at the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse and delivering them to the Araguaia plant for two years. Two other drivers and two Sao Francisco employees confirmed the slaughterhouse was an Araguaia supplier.

Sao Francisco didn’t confirm or deny that it is a supplier of the Araguaia plant. It said it has been cooperating with federal prosecutors since 2018 and that it hired an outside firm to monitor its supply chain.

Sao Francisco sources some of its cattle indirectly from Vale do Paraiso, a farm that had been blocked from grazing cattle since 2006 because 15 square miles of trees had been illegally razed, according to Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama. Cattle tracking data shows that the cattle was moved from Vale do Paraiso to a farm with a clean record before it reached the slaughterhouse.

The agency unblocked Vale do Paraiso last year because a court determined that the statute of limitations had expired, but its owner Antonio Lucena Barros still owes over $3 million in fines for the deforestation there, according to government documents.

Barros’ lawyer Calebe Rocha said in a statement that his client is fighting the fines in court and has been granted an injunction that suspends the payment of the fine. He also said that no animals were sold from the part of Vale do Paraiso that Ibama had blocked due to deforestation.

Another plant owned by Darling Ingredients sourced fat from a slaughterhouse that confirmed to Reuters that it bought hundreds of cattle in 2022 and 2023 from rancher Bruno Heller, who Brazil’s Federal Police has described as possibly the Amazon’s biggest deforester in a 2023 investigation.

In a statement, Heller’s lawyer Vinicius Segatto said Brazil’s environmental law is “excessively rigorous” and that the criminal case against his client is ongoing.

Fat to fuel

Airlines have been under pressure to buy more green jet fuel, which is now produced in tiny quantities, to meet industry targets of net zero emissions by 2050.

Supporters of the use of tallow as a biofuel assert that demand for it alone is unlikely to push ranchers to clear rainforest to grow their pastures because of its economic value – less than 3% of what slaughterhouses get for each animal.

Diamonds’ imports from Brazil were certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond’s plant for CORSIA.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land that was deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond’s supply chain because it considers tallow a “byproduct” of the beef industry under CORSIA.

Three experts who helped design CORSIA told Reuters that the program allows producers to omit the score for carbon emissions and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest because it assumes demand for tallow is unlikely to push ranchers to grow their herds.

The International Civil Aviation Organization declined to comment when asked about whether it viewed deforestation in the tallow supply chain as a violation of its sustainability standards.

However, the agency said it is “constantly monitoring the compliance” of third-parties responsible for certifying sustainable aviation fuel producers and welcomes information on “any potential deviations” for further evaluation.

The platform is designed to provide a streamlined way for investors to finance the development of EV charging and solar projects across the United States.

The move comes as the clean energy sector continues to grow, driven by a surge in demand for renewable energy and EV infrastructure. The capital-intensive nature of these projects has created a need for specialized financing mechanisms like tax equity investments. This type of financing allows investors with significant tax liabilities, such as corporations and wealthy individuals, to receive tax credits and other benefits in exchange for funding a project. For developers, this provides a vital source of upfront capital. The new Helios Charging platform aims to bridge this financing gap by simplifying the investment process for a wider audience of accredited investors.

According to Helios Charging, the platform offers a ""vertically integrated"" approach by managing the entire project lifecycle, from initial site assessment and engineering to installation and maintenance. This model is intended to ensure the quality and long-term viability of the assets being funded.

Gavin Newsom that came forward in the final days of the California legislative session.

The measures that extended proceedings into Saturday include legislation that clears the way for California to join a regional electric grid, tries to boost statewide oil production in the wake of a pair of looming refinery shutdowns, extends California’s cap-and-trade program and replenishes the state’s wildfire funds.

The bills head to now head to the governor’s office, where Newsom has until Oct. 13 to sign them into law.

By all indications, that will be a mere formality.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said when the raft of last-minute bills were introduced.

Regional grid

Assembly Bill 825, originally known as Senate Bill 540, will enable California to join a new energy trading market with other states in the West. By more easily tapping into power in the region, the bill’s supporters say it will lead to lower energy costs for consumers and more seamlessly integrate power supplies.

The California Independent System Operator that manages the electric grid for about 80% of the state, took to social media and hailed the bill’s passage as “a major milestone for the West” that was “shaped by years of successful and evolving regional collaboration.”

AB 825 passed 34-0 in the Senate on Friday and 74-1 in the Assembly on Saturday.

But critics worry that joining a regional grid with other states that don’t all share California’s decarbonization goals could link the Golden State with those like Wyoming that use coal-fired power plants.

“This concerns us because the federal government has recently forced customers in other regional markets to pay increased costs to prop up fossil (fuel) generation facilities at risk of retirement,” Lee Trotman, communications director for The Utility Reform Network, known as TURN, said in an email. “TURN asks each policymaker to do everything you can to make sure, that TURN’s warnings about AB 825 never come to pass.”

Boosting in-state oil

Senate Bill 237, which also zoomed through the Legislature with large bipartisan support, passed amid worries that California’s already high gasoline prices may climb even higher.

Phillips 66 plans to shut down its twin refineries in Carson and Wilmington by the end of this year and Valero recently gave notice it will shut down operations at its refinery in the Northern California city of Benicia by 2026. The Valero and Phillips 66 facilities combine to account for roughly 18% of the state’s crude oil capacity.

In the wake of the pending closures, the California Energy Commission sent Newsom a series of recommendations to bolster stability to the petroleum market.

SB 237 includes provisions aimed at increasing crude oil production in the state, particularly in the Bakersfield area where the largest concentration of derricks are located.

“This legislation will protect consumers from supply disruptions, provide investor confidence in the state’s energy sector and ensure Kern County continues to lead with both environmental responsibility and energy reliability,” the Kern County Board of Supervisors said in a statement.

But a coalition of environmental groups decried SB 237, saying it runs counter to the state’s clean energy goals.

“More in-state drilling will not prevent inevitable refinery closures or guarantee lower gas prices,” said the group that included Sierra Club California, the Natural Resources Defense Council and California Environmental Voters. “Additional permits will not change the fact that California oil fields are in decline, nearly completely depleted, but will worsen racial and climate injustice.

Keeping cap and trade going

Since 2013, California participates in a cap-and-trade program that requires power plants, natural gas providers and large industries that emit greenhouse gases to buy permits on the carbon pollution they produce.

The Legislature over the weekend passed Assembly Bill 1207, which extends the program for the next 20 years, and Senate Bill 840 that will distribute the estimated $60 billion to $90 billion of revenue among various air, water and fire prevention programs aimed at reducing emissions.

The legislation also earmarks $20 billion that will go to the state’s controversial and expensive high-speed rail project.

“By aligning the future of cap and trade with the timeline of California’s ambitious emission reduction targets, California is positioned to achieve its climate goals in the most cost-effective way possible,” said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California state director of the Environmental Defense Fund.

AB 1207 renames the cap-and trade program as the California Cap-And-Invest Program.

Despite the passage of AB 1207 and SB 840, a large number of Republicans voted against the two bills, with some complaining about the lack of funding for agricultural projects in the program.

Wildfires and utilities

A wide-ranging piece of legislation, Senate Bill 254 raises $18 billion to shore up the state’s Wildfire Fund, which some worry will get depleted after January’s deadly fires in the Los Angeles area.

Under SB 254, the state’s big investor-owned utilities (including San Diego Gas & Electric) would combine to pay for half of the $18 billion total while electricity customers across California would pay the other $9 billion over a 10-year period.

The bill also creates low-interest loans to cover the construction of new transmission lines and prohibits utilities from earning a rate of return on the first $6 billion they spend on their upgrades on wildfire prevention.

Those provisions and others, SB 254’s supporters say, can help reduce monthly electric bills for customers across the state.

“There are pieces that some of us like and some of us don’t,” Sen. Aisha Wahab, D-Fremont, told Politico, “but this is a very large collaboration.”

This means that nearly all U.S. greenhouse gas reporting would stop, making it harder for the government to track emissions.
A Critical Choice for America’s Climate Future The EPA’s plan to end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is a major shift in U.S. climate policy.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The agency says this move could save businesses up to $2.4 billion in compliance costs over the next ten years.

If approved, about 8,000 large facilities would no longer be required to report their greenhouse gas emissions. These businesses currently have to share data if their emissions exceed 25,000 tons of CO₂ equivalent each year.

This proposal follows President Trump’s executive orders on his first day in office, which focus on cutting regulations and promoting energy production.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin explained that,

“Alongside President Trump, EPA continues to live up to the promise of unleashing energy dominance that powers the American Dream. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality. Instead, it costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity, and hurting American communities. With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.”

Turning Point for America’s Climate: EPA’s Bold Move to Scrap Greenhouse Gas Reporting

The EPA argues that the GHGRP creates “burdensome red tape” without helping improve human health or protect the environment. The agency says this data doesn’t directly lead to rules that regulate emissions or enforce climate action.

The proposed rule would remove reporting requirements for facilities across many industries—power plants, refineries, steel mills, cement factories, and landfills. The public would no longer have access to self-reported emissions data from these sources.

Reporting for petroleum and natural gas companies would also be suspended until 2034. This aligns with recent law changes that delayed methane fee collections. Only small parts of the petroleum sector would still be required to report emissions for future adjustments.

According to the EPA, this change would save between $2 billion and $2.4 billion over ten years. The agency believes that by reducing regulatory costs, companies can focus on real environmental improvements instead of filling out reports.

Background on the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program

The GHGRP was created by Congress in 2008 and started collecting data in 2010. It requires 47 categories of sources to report their emissions each year. The goal was to improve transparency and track trends in pollution.

The Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) was added to the Clean Air Act in 2022. It imposed fees on methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems that exceeded certain limits. However, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed in 2025 delayed this charge until 2034, meaning those companies won’t report until then.

Earlier in 2025, the EPA announced it would reconsider the GHGRP as part of a wider effort to cut regulations and boost American energy.

However, Zeldin said that rolling back GHGRP would still meet the agency’s legal obligations under the Clean Air Act (CAA).

What the Proposal Means

If the proposal is approved:

Nearly all large polluters, like power plants, refineries, steel and cement makers, landfills, and others, will no longer report their emissions.

Only small parts of the petroleum and natural gas sector will report, and even that is postponed until 2034.

This means that nearly all U.S. greenhouse gas reporting would stop, making it harder for the government to track emissions.

Industry’s Reaction: Mixed Support, Strong Worries

Many scientists, economists, and environmental groups worry that this move will make it much harder to fight climate change. Environmental organizations argue it can significantly weaken efforts to hold polluters accountable.

Even some business groups that support deregulation warn that without reliable data, companies and investors won’t be able to manage climate risks.

Loss of Transparency: The GHGRP is one of the country’s biggest sources of emissions data. Without it, governments, investors, and communities won’t know where pollution is coming from.

Risk of “Blind Spots”: Policymakers will have fewer tools to track pollution and design solutions. This could slow down efforts to reduce emissions.

Higher Long-Term Costs: Studies show that mandatory reporting has helped lower emissions by 20% since 2009. Without data, companies may pollute more, leading to greater health risks and economic costs later on.

Weakening Climate Agreements: The U.S. shares emissions data with other countries. Without this reporting, global trust in U.S. climate commitments could fall.

Economists warn that while companies save money in the short term, the risks from extreme weather, regulatory uncertainty, and damaged public trust could lead to bigger problems down the line.

On the other hand, some industry groups support the rollback. They say reporting rules are expensive and outdated. Cutting them would free up money for more direct investments in cleaner technology.

They believe this proposal is part of a wider effort to reduce regulations, paperwork and encourage energy production. It will create jobs, boost the economy, and let businesses invest more in real environmental solutions.

Next Steps

The EPA will open a public comment period where citizens, businesses, and experts can share their views. Instructions will be available in the Federal Register and on the EPA website. Many expect fierce debate, and legal challenges are likely if the rule moves forward.

A Critical Choice for America’s Climate Future

The EPA’s plan to end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is a major shift in U.S. climate policy. While it could lower costs for businesses, it also creates serious risks by making it harder to track pollution and protect the environment. As the public voices its opinions, this debate will help determine how the country balances short-term savings with long-term climate goals.

U.S. Emissions Set to Rise in 2025?

The EIA projects that U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions will rise by 1.5% in 2025, before declining by 0.5% in 2026. The increase in 2025 is driven by higher emissions from coal, natural gas, and petroleum products. Significantly, coal will be contributing the most to the growth.

However, the decline in 2026 will also be primarily attributed to reduced emissions from coal.

Overall, this deregulation decision could affect the U.S. globally. Other nations depend on American emissions data to measure progress and coordinate efforts. Without this information, the U.S. risks losing trust and influence in international climate discussions. In the end, it’s not just about cutting regulations. Ensuring accountability, leadership, and a cleaner future for all should also matter.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2268563399.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 13:01:30.143239

A decade ago, global investment in fossil fuel supply outpaced clean energy by 1.2 to 1. Today, the equation has flipped.

Clean energy receives twice as much investment as fossil fuels, driving GDP growth and creating millions of jobs. Renewable electricity has surged past 40% of the global power mix, with solar leading the way as the fastest-growing energy source in history.

Between 2023 and 2024, new solar, wind and battery capacity displaced more than 650 terawatt-hours (TWh) of fossil fuel use, more than the entire electricity consumption of South Korea.

The report highlights that electrification is also transforming energy demand across industries. Electric vehicle (EV) sales have risen from 4% to 22% of global car sales in just five years, displacing more than 1.3 million barrels of oil per day. That figure is expected to reach 5 million barrels daily by 2030.

Heat pumps and electrified industrial processes also consume three to five times less energy than fossil-based alternatives, further weakening the case for oil and gas.

We Mean Business Coalition’s chief executive Maria Mendiluce said: “The message is clear: The clean energy transition is accelerating, and fossil fuels are losing ground.

“Business and governments that continue to bank on rising demand for coal, oil and gas are taking on serious risk. The smart move now is to double down on clean energy — it is where growth, jobs and competitiveness lie.”

Fossil fuels face rising risks

The report warns that fossil fuels face mounting structural risks as renewables surge.

Oil demand is nearing a peak this decade, with high-cost producers likely to struggle as electric vehicles (EV) expand. No sector, including petrochemicals, can offset the lost consumption.

The report also highlights that gas for power is becoming uncompetitive as solar and batteries undercut new turbine projects, raising the prospect of overbuilt liquefied natural gas infrastructure. Coal’s decline is already entrenched. Planned capacity has dropped 65% over the past decade, with new projects concentrated in just 10 countries and vulnerable to early retirement.

Businesses are pressing policymakers to accelerate the shift. A survey of more than 1,400 executives across 15 countries found that more than 90% view renewable electricity as critical to new investment decisions.

Half said they would relocate operations if governments fail to support the transition.

Ember’s energy strategist Kingsmill Bond said: “The world is experiencing its most profound energy transformation since the 18th-century shift from biomass to fossil fuels.

“Across countries and sectors, electrotech is proving superior in efficiency, cost and security. It is replacing fossil fuels rather than adding to them – disrupting the fossil fuel industry while creating a new generation of electrotech winners.”",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/SolarWindRenewables.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 17:03:00.674198

“Research in behavioral science shows that small, targeted interventions can have a large impact on people’s decisions and actions.","New Studies in the U.S. and Japan Reveal That Behavioral Interventions Yield Significant Results

PALO ALTO, Calif., and TOKYO (Sept. 16, 2025) — The Toyota Research Institute (TRI) today released new research showing that behavioral science-based interventions significantly improve electric vehicle (EV) charging habits, helping reduce carbon emissions. The studies, conducted in the U.S. and Japan, tested ChargeMinder, a prototype app developed by TRI’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) division, which incorporates insights from behavioral science to improve EV charging behavior.

Key findings:

In the U.S., behavioral interventions increased charging by 10% for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) drivers.

In Japan, PHEV and battery electric vehicle (BEV) drivers shifted charging to peak renewable energy hours by 59%, adding nearly 30 minutes of daytime charging per vehicle, per day.

Interventions increased the satisfaction of U.S. PHEV drivers with their vehicles by 16 percentage points, bringing it to 100%.

“Technology is not the only way to reduce emissions — people’s choices matter too,” said Dr. Gill Pratt, Chief Scientist for Toyota Motor Corporation and CEO, Toyota Research Institute. “This research and development shows how science-based behavioral interventions can both help us reduce carbon emissions as much as possible, as soon as possible, and increase customer satisfaction.”

Why Behavior Matters

Technology is not the only path to lower emissions. To reduce their total carbon impact, electrified vehicles must be charged regularly and at the optimum times when cleaner energy sources are available. Without changes in charging behavior, vehicles like PHEVs and BEVs cannot deliver their full climate benefit.

“Behavioral science is a powerful, scalable tool to help achieve carbon neutrality,” said Dr. Laura Libby, Manager, Carbon Neutrality, Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, Toyota Research Institute. “Research in behavioral science shows that small, targeted interventions can have a large impact on people’s decisions and actions. Furthermore, compared to other causes of behavior change such as public charging infrastructure initiatives and consumer financial incentives, behavioral interventions are inexpensive and can be deployed quickly.”

The ChargeMinder Research App

ChargeMinder applies behavioral science to EV charging by:

Delivering just-in-time reminders — up to 50% more effective than generic prompts in laboratory studies.

Providing positive reinforcement with streaks, summaries, and encouraging messages.

Surfacing engaging educational quizzes that leverage memory science to enhance learning.

ChargeMinder integrates more than a dozen interventions based on well-replicated findings from behavioral science research that have been tailored for specific charging behavior change goals. These interventions are surfaced through in-app features and mobile push notifications. The ChargeMinder platform can also securely and anonymously ingest and surface user data from multiple sources, including vehicle telematics and charging locations. With this data, we can provide a personalized intervention experience and conduct advanced data analytics while preserving user privacy.

What’s Next

Technologies that account for how people think, feel, and behave will play a crucial role in the future of lower-carbon mobility.

TRI and Toyota’s Carbon Neutral Center plan to extend ChargeMinder research to focus on personalized, data-driven interventions, making EV charging even more consistent with Toyota’s global carbon neutrality strategy.

We need to build technologies that bridge the gap between human behavior and carbon reduction,” added Manabu Handa, Assistant Manager, Carbon Neutral System Planning Department, Toyota Motor Corporation.",https://toyota-cms-media.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChargeMinder-hero-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 13:02:19.551353

The company is also investing in new technologies, including artificial intelligence, or AI, tools, to help recover more oil from reservoirs that would not have been possible even just a few years ago.

Tomorrow, it’s about bringing online new deep water projects and investing in continued exploration for new prospects that will further grow U.S. energy supplies.

In 2024, bp announced plans to invest in a sixth platform, Kaskida, that will operate in the region. That development is expected to produce up to 80,000 barrels per day, with an anticipated start-up in 2029. And before the end of the year, we hope to announce plans for developing another major project: our seventh floating platform, which would produce oil from the Tiber and Guadalupe fields.

There have also been recent oil discoveries at bp’s Far South prospect, and we are actively pursuing other exploration opportunities.

As bp’s senior vice president for the Gulf of America and Canada, I’ve been in this business for more than 30 years, and I continue to marvel at the work our people do every day to produce the oil and gas that fuels the American economy and way of life. More than 1,300 employees at the company directly support the region.

So much of these employees’ stories — and that of the Gulf — are about innovation and technology. Whether it’s making a discovery six miles below the water’s surface, analyzing vast amounts of seismic data with the help of a supercomputer, or using drones to inspect equipment in the middle of the Gulf, the offshore oil and gas industry of today rivals space exploration in its complexity and sophistication.

The offshore industry of tomorrow — which bp is helping to lead — is just as awe-inspiring. AI tools are helping to plan maintenance jobs remotely with cloud-based virtual models of bp platforms, and machine learning is helping to detect and predict issues with offshore production equipment.

Recent passage of the federal tax bill will help ensure that the U.S. offshore industry continues to play a significant role in growing American energy production and for continued investment in America.

At bp, we commend Congress and the Administration for advancing the bill to final passage, providing more certainty and stability for offshore leasing, which is crucial to the future of U.S. energy supply. We’ll continue to work with the administration to support the delivery of American energy.

The Gulf of America has been a cornerstone of U.S. energy production for many years, and it remains a critical part of bp’s global strategy, both today and tomorrow. As we continue to innovate and invest in this region, we remain committed to enhancing energy security, driving technological advancements and contributing to the U.S. economy.

“Rapidly expanding demand for new energy resources from data computing needs, aging transmission infrastructure and extreme weather conditions are raising the cost of electricity across the West. The stakes are high, and with passage of AB 825, we have an opportunity to collaborate and create a Western regional market for cost-effective supply of newer clean energy resources,” said Vijay Satyal, Ph.D., deputy director of markets and transmission at WRA.

Recognizing the growing energy demands in the region and the untapped opportunity to better utilize the existing resources, power companies and public officials across the West are developing day-ahead markets — a way to plan each day for the following day to ensure adequate resources at the lowest available price.

Last month, as it reported its second quarter financial results, the company said it expects the third quarter to be the strongest of the year.

Demand for electric vehicles in the US has surged this quarter, with the EV tax credits expiring by the end of September.

In August, leasing prices were cut for the standard variants of the 2026 R1 models, after a price spike in the prior month.

A month later, prices for the Standard version of the R1S was raised from $811 to $831 per month.

Two environmental groups are pressing ahead with their challenge to Imperial County’s approval of the Hell’s Kitchen lithium and geothermal project, a development they say risks worsening water scarcity, air pollution and cultural loss in one of California’s most fragile regions.

On appeal before the California Fourth District Court of Appeal, attorneys for Comité Cívico del Valle (CCV) and Earthworks submitted their opening brief on Thursday, Sept. 11, arguing that the county rushed the project’s approval and relied on a faulty environmental review that underestimated impacts and ignored legal obligations. The developer, Controlled Thermal Resources (CTR), has hit back forcefully, calling the lawsuit “frivolous” and insisting the project is key to Imperial Valley’s economic transformation.

The appeal comes after the original case before the Imperial County Superior Court was ruled meritless and the lawsuit was dismissed in January.

A Project With Big Promises

Located near Niland on the southeastern edge of the Salton Sea, the Hell’s Kitchen project aims to harness geothermal brine deep underground to produce both renewable electricity and lithium, which is the essential mineral used in electric vehicle batteries and grid storage.

The plan includes a 49.9-megawatt geothermal power plant, a Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) facility, and related infrastructure to process and ship lithium products. CTR has pitched the project as part of California’s clean-energy future, promising thousands of jobs and tens of millions of dollars in local tax revenue.

But the project comes with a heavy water footprint — about 6,500 acre-feet annually — in a desert region where the shrinking Salton Sea already drives some of the state’s worst air quality.

The Appeal: Four Key Criticisms

In their opening brief, CCV and Earthworks focused first on water supply, arguing that the county’s analysis was dangerously short-sighted. The Environmental Impact Report (EIR) only examined whether water would be available for 20 to 30 years, while the project is designed to operate for 50. The Imperial Irrigation District (IID), which controls all Colorado River water in the Valley, went on record calling the county’s assumptions “inaccurate,” warning that water for the project was not guaranteed, especially in light of looming federal cuts to Colorado River allocations.

The groups also charged that the county overlooked cumulative impacts by failing to account for other projects competing for IID water. Among them are three proposed geothermal plants from BHE Renewables, as well as Imperial County’s own Lithium Valley Specific Plan, which could require more than 100,000 acre-feet of water annually. Compounding the concern, CTR announced during the review process that it intends to expand Hell’s Kitchen into a seven-stage, 190-acre lithium campus, which is a massive enlargement that was not fully evaluated in the EIR.

On air quality, appellants argued that the EIR downplayed how the project could worsen toxic dust emissions from the shrinking Salton Sea. As the lake recedes, exposed sand releases harmful chemical residues from decades of agricultural runoff, contributing to asthma and respiratory illness in nearby communities. A letter submitted by the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability during the review process underscored that the neighborhoods immediately surrounding the project are already “most impacted by poor air quality” and deserve stronger protection.

Finally, the brief criticized the county’s failure to consult local tribes as required under Assembly Bill 52. Tribal Elder Carmen Lucas of the Kwaaymii Laguna Band submitted objections, stressing that the county had not adequately recognized or protected cultural resources connected to the project site. According to the appellants, requests for tribal monitors and stronger cultural protections went unanswered, leaving significant tribal concerns unaddressed.

“These omissions skewed the project’s environmental analysis, leaving critical impacts unstudied and feasible mitigation measures off the table,” the groups argue in their filing.

CTR Fires Back

CTR responded to the appeal and opening brief with a sharply worded statement, defending the project and criticizing its opponents.

“Controlled Thermal Resources is deeply saddened and frustrated by Comité Cívico del Valle’s decision to continue its frivolous legal appeal after the Imperial County Superior Court ruled that their claims had no merit and dismissed their lawsuit,” the company said. “This group’s ongoing actions are a clear abuse of the original intentions of CEQA and only serve to delay progress on clean energy projects that are essential to the community, California and the nation.”

The company argued that while environmental groups stall, other states like Nevada, Utah, Texas and Arkansas are attracting billions in investment for lithium and clean-energy projects.

“Imperial County is on the cusp of a generational transformation that includes sustainable development, thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue every year to support infrastructure, schools, workforce training, health, and Salton Sea restoration,” CTR said. “As hard as some special interest groups try to stop this positive progress — they will fail.”

The Bigger Picture

California lawmakers have branded the Imperial Valley “Lithium Valley,” betting big on its geothermal brine as a cornerstone for the state’s clean energy transition. But the Hell’s Kitchen case underscores the challenges of balancing industrial development with fragile ecosystems, scarce water and long-marginalized communities.

Tribal leaders, community advocates and health experts say the county’s process skipped over important voices. As Elder Lucas put it in her objection, the county “failed to properly identify tribal cultural resources” and moved forward despite repeated requests for greater protections.

The appeal now before the Fourth District Court of Appeal will not only play a role in determining the fate of CTR’s flagship project, but also how Imperial County navigates the tension between economic opportunity and environmental justice in the decades ahead.",https://calexicochronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CTR-Steam-Testing-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 12:04:02.144782

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The California Energy Commission (CEC) has awarded Brooklyn-based EV charging company it's electric $1.1 million to develop, certify, and commercialize the world's first curbside vehicle-to-grid EV charger.

The award comes through the Enabling Electric Vehicles as Distributed Energy Resources grant, part of California's Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) Program, which invests in breakthrough technologies to strengthen the state's energy system and meet its ambitious climate goals. In partnership with the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Delaware, it's electric will bring the technology to market by 2028.

Unlike traditional chargers, which only pull electricity from the grid to charge a car, it's electric's new charger will also be able to push energy back from the EVdirectly to the grid. This has never before been possible in a curbside format, where millions of cars are parked every day.

California is leading the way in bi-directional curbside EV charging with the development and demonstration of this first-of-its-kind hardware. Visually identical to it's electric's current award winning design, this next generation of chargers will expand equitable access to vehicle-to-grid technology in low-income and disadvantaged communities, helping to accelerate EV adoption and reduce emissions in line with the state's climate targets.

The project will also develop a second innovative technology: the J3068 Active Cable, created with the University of Delaware. This first-of-its-kind cable integrates the SAE-standard untethered charging format with Delaware's Active Cable Communication Module, enabling bi-directional charging while seamlessly associating driver account information with the cable for reliable compatibility across a wide range of charging systems.

""We have absolute conviction that bi-directional capability is a prerequisite for sustained long term public EV charging deployment,"" said Nathan King, Co-Founder and CEO of it's electric. ""Seven million light duty vehicles are routinely parked on city streets in California. As these vehicles convert to electric, their batteries have enormous potential to help offset peak demand in critically overstrained electric utility service areas. And as a matter of equity, all EV drivers should have equal opportunity to participate in EV charging demand-response programs and V2G energy arbitrage opportunities.""

""Vehicle electrification is about both cleaner transportation and a strong grid. This project helps unlock the full potential of EVs to provide load flexibility, support electric system reliability, and reduce peak demand,"" said Commissioner Andrew McCallister, who leads the Commission's Research and Development division. ""These are exactly the kinds of innovations California needs to build a more resilient and sustainable energy system.""

""Very pleased the California Energy Commission is funding innovations that will enable EV batteries to support our grid, power buildings and more,"" said Commissioner Nancy Skinner. ""it's electric's impressive project will pilot EV chargers that can not only power a car but also help that car power our grid, demonstrating the economic and resiliency benefits of V2G technology.""

At scale, curbside V2G chargers will allow cars that park on the street to function as distributed energy resources, delivering benefits to both EV owners and grid operators. By enabling large-scale distributed energy storage, the technology can help mitigate peak demand growth and reduce the need for costly grid infrastructure upgrades.

""The Energy, Controls, and Applications Laboratory (eCAL) team is excited to get to work on this project, and proud to be hosting deployment and testing of the world's first bidirectional curbside charger at UC Berkeley's Richmond Field Station,"" said Professor Scott Moura, Director of eCAL. ""This project will advance our ability to leverage vehicle-to-grid capabilities for grid stability, helping to create more resilient and efficient infrastructure in California.""

""The University of Delaware is proud of the role we have played to date in bringing vehicle-to-grid technologies to market,"" said Professor Willett Kempton. ""We applaud the California Energy Commission for investing in this project, which will advance the ability of all communities to take advantage of V2G opportunities.""

With the support of the California Energy Commission, it's electric and its partners are pioneering the next era of EV charging infrastructure. By combining rapid curbside deployment with groundbreaking vehicle-to-grid technology, this project demonstrates how innovation can be scaled quickly and equitably across communities. The world's first curbside vehicle-to-grid chargers will not only accelerate EV adoption but also strengthen California's energy resilience, paving the way for cities everywhere to embrace a cleaner, more reliable, and more affordable energy future.

The nonprofit has joined other environmental groups in suing the Trump administration to get the funding restored.","The Trump administration is reducing or eliminating environmental regulations and scientific funding.

Advocacy groups and some state agencies are increasing their efforts to address the resulting gap.

In North Carolina, federal cutbacks have impacted agencies like the EPA and NOAA.

With the Trump administration moving quickly to water down or even dismantle much of the country's environmental infrastructure, from regulations to financial support for science, advocates for issues ranging from clean energy and healthy living to environmental justice and habitat protection are moving to fill the void.

While these groups individually don't have the public megaphone and reach of federal agencies like the Enivronmental Protection Agency and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the hope is they can collectively keep the conversation going and step into the breach formerly filled by government-led groups and initiatives.

Still, the scale and speed of the federal government's retreat from environmental and health issues has been breathtaking. Moves by the Trump administration in North Carolina include plans to dissolve the EPA's Office of Research and Development in the Research Triangle Park near Raleigh and significant cutbacks to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information campus in Asheville. The downsizing and financial cutbacks to the Federal Emergency Management Agency also has raised concerns about states' abilities to plan for and recover from natural disasters, including last year's Tropical Storm Helene that pounded Western North Carolina. Federal support for research at many N.C. universities, including the University of North Carolina Wilmington and Duke University, also have taken significant hits.

States run by Republicans also are moving to rein in environmental and health mandates, with Florida notably announcing in early September that it would end school vaccine requirements. In the Tar Heel State, the GOP-dominated General Assembly also has made some moves to backtrack on environmental commitments and policies championed by previous administrations in Raleigh. That includes a recent override of a veto by Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, that will see North Carolina retreat from aggressive carbon-reduction goals in the energy sector hashed out by former Gov. Roy Cooper, Republican lawmakers and Duke Energy back in 2021.

In response to all these changes, many groups and Democratic administrations have stepped up their environmental outreach and educational efforts − even as they deal with often substantial federal funding cuts. In North Carolina, that list includes the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Duke University, and the N.C. State Climate Office.

Transform understanding into action

One environmental group that has recently stepped up its outreach efforts is Charlotte-based CleanAIRE NC, which pushes for healthy communities by advocating for cleaner air and environmental justice.

The nonprofit has launched CleanAIRE Academy, an online interactive learning tool designed to help N.C. residents educate themselves about air quality and other environmental issues, something that's often invisible but can have tremendous health impacts. Topics that are covered by the self-paced seminars include the permitting process, understanding federal and state regulations, and how to effectively advocate for healthier communities.

According to the state's environmental agency, the two biggest air quality problems in North Carolina are ozone and particle pollution, with both pollutants primarily caused by vehicle emissions. Sustained exposure to a polluting source, say a factory smokestack, also can cause numerous health issues and irritate the lungs and respiratory system.

According to the American Lung Association's latest ""State of the Air"" report, North Carolina's ozone pollution isn't that bad, although Mecklenburg County is an outlier. But the state's particle pollution is a concern, with Mecklenburg and Davidson counties receiving a failing grade.

In a release, CleanAIRE said recent changes have raised questions about North Carolina's readiness to handle potential future environmental and climate challenges. Political and legal changes also have left communities and individuals short of resources and access to science and expert-driven analysis even if they wanted to advocate for change. In an example that hits close to home for CleanAIRE, the group in March lost a $500,000 EPA grant to test air quality in lower-income communities in and around Charlotte. The nonprofit has joined other environmental groups in suing the Trump administration to get the funding restored.

Rafi Vaca, the group's education manager, said while the genesis of the academy program started 18 months ago after officials saw public interest in environmental issues spike during the Covid lockdown, it has taken on a new urgency with recent actions in Washington. This summer CleanAIRE also launched the ""AirKeeper Dashboard,"" an interactive tool that displays historical and real-time air quality information for North Carolina, in response to the federal government ending much of its air quality monitoring work.

Vaca said the academy's learning modules and other programs have intentionally been made palatable and engaging to help ""demystify complex issues and inspire meaningful engagement.""

""What we're asking people to learn about can be heavy and emotive,"" she said, noting CleanAIRE is also stepping up its education and outreach efforts with its partner agencies. ""But ultimately it's important.""

Fossil fuel interests pushed back on the endangerment finding when it was first written, yet little is known about more recent advocacy to overturn it.","In the wake of the Trump administration’s announcement that it will overturn the rule which underpins virtually all US climate regulations, a Senate committee has launched an investigation into a suspected lobbying push that led to the move.

On Tuesday, the Senate environment and public works committee sent letters to two dozen corporations, including oil giants, thinktanks, law firms and trade associations. The missives request each company to turn over documents regarding the 2009 declaration, known as the endangerment finding, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said in July that it will unmake.

The finding enshrined that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases harm the health of Americans.

“Rescinding the endangerment finding at the behest of industry is irresponsible, legally dubious, and deeply out of step with the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, and the American public deserves to understand your role in advancing EPA’s dangerous decision,” wrote Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the ranking member of the committee. “I am concerned about the role that fossil fuel companies, certain manufacturers, trade associations, polluter-backed groups, and others with much to benefit from the repeal of the endangerment finding – including your organization – played in drafting, preparing, promoting, and lobbying on the proposal.”

Fossil fuel companies and their allies are threatened by the endangerment finding because it confirms in law that carbon dioxide, which their products produce, are dangerous, Whitehouse told the Guardian. It also gives the EPA the authority to regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act.

The letter, which asks for all relevant private communications between the day Trump was re-elected in November to the day the EPA announced plans to rescind the endangerment finding in July, was sent to oil giants Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP, as well as coal producers, a rail giant and two auto manufacturers, whose business plans rely on fossil fuels.

“The only interests that benefit from undoing the endangerment finding are polluter interests, and specifically fossil fuel polluter interests,” Whitehouse said.

It was also sent to trade associations and law firms representing big oil and auto companies. And it was sent to far-right, pro-fossil fuel thinktanks Competitive Enterprise Institute, New Civil Liberties Alliance, the Heartland Institute, America First Policy Institute, and the Heritage Foundation, each of which challenge the authority of federal agencies, and some of which have directly praised the proposed endangerment finding rollback.

The Guardian has contacted each recipient for comment.

Because Republicans control the Senate, Democrats on the environment and public works committee lack the power to subpoena the documents. But the Senate committee still expects the companies to comply with their request.

The letter could send a signal to polluting sectors and rightwing firms that they are being watched, and could set the stage for continued investigation if Democrats win back a congressional chamber in next November’s midterm elections.

Fossil fuel interests pushed back on the endangerment finding when it was first written, yet little is known about more recent advocacy to overturn it. Immediately following the EPA’s announcement of the rollback, the New York Times reported that groups have not “been clamoring in recent years for its reversal”. But Whitehouse believes that has changed since Trump was re-elected in November 2025.

When Joe Biden was president and Democrats controlled at least one chamber of Congress, Whitehouse said “a request to rescind the endangerment finding would have just looked like useless, pointless, madness.

“But now that they can actually do it in their desperation and with the mask of moderation pulled off, I think it’s very clear that they were directing this happen,” he said.

Under Trump, former lobbyists and lawyers for polluting industries such as oil, gas and petrochemicals have entered leadership positions at the EPA.

“The fossil fuel industry owns and controls the Trump administration on all matters that relate to their industry, and they have subservient Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate,” said Whitehouse. “The change in power has allowed a change in tactics and attitude.”

Two environmental non-profits have sued the Trump administration for “secretly” convening a group of climate contrarians to bolster its effort to topple the endangerment finding.

The EPA’s proposed undoing of the crucial legal conclusion comes as part of a larger war on the environment by the Trump administration, which has killed dozens of climate rules since re-entering the White House in January.

“The motive is to help fossil fuels survive,” said Whitehouse.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0900887899ccc9c96368b0f4cfbc7fe2239120e7/1340_0_6713_5369/master/6713.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e18c30e8a4abd26929e94f1fc59bd0c1",N,,2025-09-16 13:02:08.485826

It’s remarkable that with everything else that’s raging, climate and energy bills still managed to dominate the legislative session that just wrapped in Sacramento. After all, the reason lawmakers were still at work this past Saturday — the day after the legislative session was supposed to end — was that negotiations on climate bills pushed them into overtime.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, Senator Pro Tem McGuire, and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas reached last-minute agreement on a package of half-a-dozen climate-related measures. “California is delivering real and lasting energy savings for families, workers and businesses,” the Big 3 announced.

The truth is messier, of course. These include bills to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program to stay on track toward long-standing climate goals, but also to allow Kern County to expand oil drilling. “While Newsom and Rivas were largely aligned on tempering the state’s ambitious climate goals amid the reality of rising costs, McGuire and his staff were wary of handing wins to polluting industries without extracting victories for environmental and social justice causes,” Maya Miller, Alejandro Lazo and Jeanne Kuang report for CalMatters.

Climate policy people seem mostly satisfied, if not exactly happy, with the measures that passed. “Relieved” might be the word. Relieved that it wasn’t worse. Let’s recap how we got here.

Back in December, my UCLA Emmett Institute colleague Julia Stein predicted that “affordability” would dominate the conversation in Sacramento and outlined how climate measures are also pocketbook issues. At the time, many lawmakers were geared up to start talking about cap-and-trade reauthorization framed as both a climate and affordability issue. Then the January fires ravaged Los Angeles. The issue of rebuilding understandably sucked up all of the oxygen. Overhauling CEQA became the focus. The conversation changed again when we started seeing headlines about two California oil refineries preparing to shut down. Even a distant threat of higher gas prices in California can dominate headlines. By August, legislators returned to the subject of cap-and-trade, with just weeks left in the session. Negotiations on such a condensed timeline made it hard to grapple with some of the more radical and complex proposals to modify the program. It probably also disadvantaged environmental justice advocates who have spent years organizing in California but were largely relegated to the backseat. In the end, California reauthorized its signature climate program until 2045 with some notable new improvements to boot, as my UCLA colleague Jason Gray explains here.

Given the deregulation onslaught in 2025, that’s enough to leave climate policy people feeling relieved. “They have, collectively, found a way to get to yes on a whole series of energy legislation that taken individually would represent a massive accomplishment,” Stanford’s Michael Wara skeeted. Several environmental groups praised the cap-and-trade reauthorization while also criticizing expanded oil drilling allowances as a sellout to fossil fuel companies. “Removing environmental safeguards won’t reverse the terminal decline of California oil production but it will allow the industry to do more damage on its way out the door,” Hollin Kretzmann, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity said. My UCLA colleague Mary Nichols told the LA Times that the negotiated measure does seek to fend off companies looking to take advantage of offshore oil in federal waters under the oil-friendly Trump administration.

By contrast, what do Republican lawmakers in Washington have to show for themselves on energy? A lot of executive orders but not legislation. This morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee is holding hearings on various GOP bills. They include efforts to let fossil gas projects bypass more cost-efficient wind and solar developments; to “codify an industry definition for showerheads” of all things; and to try to restrict local and state government’s authority. This at a time when American household power bills have risen 10% since Trump entered the White House and the administration has spent months trying to destroy much-needed energy projects. Energy Secretary Chris Wright admitted last month that rising energy prices could be a political challenge for the GOP ahead of next year’s midterm elections. However, a new Heatmap Pro poll of registered voters finds that Americans are more likely to blame rising energy prices on their state government and local utility than on the federal government. Voters want to see local action.

What we can say for certain about California is that legislators are at least wrestling with the messiness of the energy transition and confronting the increasing costs of climate-fueled disasters on electricity and insurance. And that shows from this vacillating legislative session.

Here are some of the notable bills headed to Newsom’s desk:

AB 1207 – Reauthorizes a Cap-and-Invest program along with the related SB 840 – which directs how the money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will be spent.

SB 237 – Eases rules to increase the state’s oil production and tightens other rules to prevent oil spills.

SB 254 – Doubles the state’s wildfire liability fund to cover wildfire damage and finance mitigation efforts while looking to accelerate clean energy.

AB 39 – Requires local governments to adopt electrification plans.

AB 825 – Establishes a pathway to participate in a regional electricity market

SB 352 – Sets new rules for toxic air pollution monitoring program

SB 34 – Limits South Coast AQMD’s ability to regulate emissions from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

SB 782 – Facilitates the use of enhanced infrastructure financing districts or climate resilience districts to respond to disaster events like the Los Angeles wildfires.

SB 79 – Seeks to increase housing development and density by allowing Transit Oriented Development upzoning.

As for that last one, SB 79 passing is a big “W” for the growing YIMBY movement in California. If Newsom signs the bill, it will also be a big “L” for the former reality TV influencer Spencer Pratt, who has been trying to influence California policy from his TikTok account.

Speaking of celebrities influencing policy: Another California bill, SB 682, would ban the sale and distribution of several categories of products — most notably cookware — that contain intentionally added PFAS, starting in 2028. David Chang, Rachael Ray and other celebrity chefs who sell cookware are advocating for keeping “forever chemicals” in their non-stick products. As a former line cook, cookbook author, and cast-iron enthusiast I can say with some authority that, “No chef, we do not need PFAS in our pans.”

Welcome to The Drain, a weekly roundup of environmental and climate news. Our song of the week is the “California” by Joni Mitchell. Here’s what else I see happening…

The Emissions Protection Agency

The EPA is planning to end what’s called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. This 15-year-old program requires the reporting of carbon dioxide, methane and other emissions data from about 8,000 power plants, oil refineries, and other facilities, Axios notes. But that could soon end. “Nothing more than bureaucratic red tape,” is how EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin describes the program. That’s blatantly false.

The data is used by businesses and others to track and compare facilities’ greenhouse gas emissions, identify opportunities to cut pollution, minimize wasted energy, and save money, the EPA’s own website reads. “States, cities, and other communities can use EPA’s greenhouse gas data to find high-emitting facilities in their area, compare emissions between similar facilities, and develop common-sense climate policies.” Plus, private companies rely on the program’s data “to demonstrate to investors that their efforts to cut greenhouse gases are working,” Maxine Joselow writes for the New York Times, “and communities often use it to determine whether local facilities are releasing air pollution that threatens public health.” This move could also cripple the oil industry’s carbon capture ambitions because it “may gut the carbon capture tax credit, at least in the short term,” Robinson Meyer writes at Heatmap News.

You cannot fight what you cannot see, and you can’t reduce what you don’t track. That may be the point. EPA’s proposal must be published in the Federal Register followed by public comment so it could be finalized within the next year. Enjoy the mapping features of this data while it’s available.

Other Pollution News

New research has for the first time linked carbon emissions from the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies to deadly heatwaves. The study’s authors examined 213 heat waves from 2000 to 2023 in the International Disaster Database, a list of global disasters reported because of casualties, economic losses, emergency declarations and calls for international assistance, Karissa Waddick reports for USA Today. “The research has been hailed as a leap forward in the legal battle to hold Big Oil accountable for the damages being caused by the climate crisis,” reports Damian Carrington for the Guardian. For example, it finds that the emissions from any one of the 14 biggest companies were by themselves enough to cause more than 50 heatwaves that would otherwise have been virtually impossible.

Tiny toxic particles spewed by Canadian wildfires killed 82,000 people in 2023, according to a study published in Nature on Wednesday. These toxic particles were even responsible for 22,000 early deaths in Europe, the Guardian reports.

The Trump administration is taking yet another shot at climate litigation, this time in Colorado. In a friend of the court brief filed last week, the Solicitor General’s office sided with Big Oil, which wants the lawsuits transferred out of state courts and sent to federal courts.

Energy

We Americans currently subsidize the fossil-fuel industry to the tune of nearly $31-billion per year, according to a new analysis by the environmental campaign group Oil Change International. The subsidies “allow the sector to receive stunning 30,000% returns on investments,” writes Dharna Noor.

Why hasn’t it been a bigger story, Emily Atkin asks, that Energy Secretary (and rich, former fracking CEO) Chris Wright just went on a “multi-day, taxpayer-funded trip to Europe to tell world leaders that the climate crisis is not really a big deal, and that the best way to protect their citizens is actually to buy more American gas”?

Wind (Political) Power: There is one East Coast wind farm that has thus far escaped unscathed: a $10.8 billion project under construction off the shores of Virginia, where Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, has been its champion, the New York Times reports. “The governor has privately urged the Trump administration not to target the project.”

Solar Power: Texas installed 3,800 MW of new solar capacity — most in the nation — during the first half of 2025, ahead of California, Indiana, and Arizona. Meanwhile LA is falling behind: LAist and Crosstown LA analyzed permitting data and found rooftop solar installations have plummeted in the city of L.A. in recent years. The market may be saturated in terms of early adopters.

Big data centers are even less popular with neighboring residents than wind farms, according to a national poll conducted by Heatmap’s intelligence platform, Heatmap Pro.

Strong demand and community solar Despite facing significant challenges from the OBBB, the US solar industry continues to thrive, driven by strong demand from data centres and electrification.","These changes are having a significant impact on US solar companies and forcing them to rethink how they do business in the country.

Alex Zhu, CEO of ES Foundry, who spoke exclusively to PV Tech Premium about this topic last week, said that the company’s business decisions have been made with the IRA tax credits in mind.

“We started ES Foundry and brought back manufacturing to the US purely because of policy, because of the domestic content adder to get the additional 10% of the ITC,” he said

Julia Bell, chief investment officer at CleanCapital, said that these tax credits were important for her company too. “Domestic content is a part of every one of our discussions, ” she said. “We’re always weighing the benefit of the adder versus the cost of purchasing domestically.”

Supply chain challenges

Regarding foreign entity of concern (FEOC) regulations, which amount to a restriction on imports of products from China, the issue of supply chain transparency has become a key concern throughout the industry.

Companies are now under pressure to track the origin of system components at every stage of production. This goes beyond meeting regulatory requirements to meet the expectations of investors and lenders.

Bell emphasised: “Transparency is really important because, as we see from our lenders and investors, everyone wants to know where the products are coming from at each step of the pathway.”

The challenge is especially severe because many manufacturers depend on intricate global supply chains, where information about subcomponents may be lacking.

Elissa Pierce, solar module supply chain analyst at Wood Mackenzie, highlighted that upstream component manufacturing has not kept pace with module manufacturing in the US. Module manufacturers mostly rely on imported components, which makes them vulnerable to tariffs, legislation and other global supply chain disruptions.

Jessica Lawrence-Vaca, chief commercial officer at Array Technologies, acknowledged the company has faced challenges confirming that its supply chain is entirely FEOC compliant, given the bill’s vagueness. Lawrence-Vaca was one of many speakers who called for the solar industry to advocate for making FEOC workable.

Other supply chain policies continue to hang over the US solar sector, including the Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act (UFLPA). According to Zhu: “For the whole value chain, traceability is important because we’ve seen policy challenges in the past with the UFLPA becoming an issue for all imports.”

New antidumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) are forcing manufacturers in China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam to shut down or relocate. As a result, India, Laos, Indonesia, and the Philippines are seeing a rise in solar manufacturing capacity, but even these countries have seen increased pressure from AD/CVD enforcement.

Nikita Trivedi, director of supplier management and strategic shared services at Southern Company, said the company has had to “get creative about manufacturing slotting and making progress payments to secure assets,” adding: “Power transformers have a 30-month lead time. So before my solar project is done, I have to have a transformer lined up.”

The industry is also struggling with complex ownership issues, particularly in light of the FEOC rules. Zhu explained: “Following OBBB guidance, customers coming to us about their due diligence ask, ‘What’s your ownership structure?’ ‘Who owns you?’ ‘What debt do you have?’”

’Eager to safe harbour as much as we can’

While major shakeups are occurring throughout the industry, speakers also emphasised the importance of weathering the current storm.

Bell shared: “We’ve been eager to safe harbour as much as we can, as I think everyone has across the industry. We’ve actually taken advantage of both ways to begin construction—both the 5% method and physical works.”

Ryan Pfaff, executive vice president at EDF Renewables, confirmed: “Most of the larger companies have safe harboured. There will be some pain moving forward; some companies don’t have the cash to safe harbour, so they are already facing significant challenges.”

As Stacy J. Ettinger, vice president of supply chain and trade at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and others maintained: “the industry will continue to grow out of necessity.”

Trivedi declared: “We are bullish on renewables. Of our US$13 billion additional capex, it is heavily geared towards batteries and solar. There is so much power demand coming at us that we need to meet quickly.”

John Smirnow, principal at Smirnow Law, advocated presenting US solar manufacturing as “a national security imperative.” Lawrence-Vaca shared a similar sentiment, saying: “the game is to keep the lights on”, and the low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) and scalability of solar mean it remains an attractive technology.

Strong demand and community solar

Despite facing significant challenges from the OBBB, the US solar industry continues to thrive, driven by strong demand from data centres and electrification.

Although the OBBB has introduced new hurdles compared to the IRA framework, industry leaders are finding ways to adapt through safe harbour strategies, supply chain enhancements and coalition building. There is widespread agreement that solar will keep growing, thanks to its cost benefits and rapid deployment capabilities, even as tax incentives eventually come to an end.

In the last few weeks, a number of states have seen increased appetite for small-scale solar in particular, as a way to meet electricity demand and give local communities a degree of control over the power projects being built in their areas.

In California, the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) has proposed fines for utilities for delaying the community solar approval process, while Wisconsin Republicans have introduced a bill to grant local groups more power over approvals for community solar projects.

Arevon Energy CEO Kevin Smith noted the importance of building relationships within communities, noting: “Community engagement activities are critical right now. Communities speak on your behalf, and the volatility that comes from not using renewables won’t reflect well on the administration.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pvt.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 12:04:50.237170

The incentives apply to everything from heat pumps to solar panels, electric vehicles, and home weatherization.

These incentives help reduce energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby protecting the climate. The recently passed “Big Beautiful Bill” legislation moved up the deadlines for these tax incentives, so it is important to act on them now.

Electric vehicles

For individuals and homeowners, the new and used electric vehicle tax incentives expire September 30, 2025. You must purchase the electric vehicle by that deadline to qualify for the tax credits. See qualified new models and regulations for a tax credit up to $7500. See qualified used models and regulations for a tax credit up to $4000. Tax credits of up to $1000 are available for electric vehicle chargers as well, with a deadline for installation by June 2026. Check out the details here.

Electric vehicles are cheaper to run and have lower maintenance costs than gasoline-powered vehicles. Plugging in saves money and the hassle of gassing up your vehicle, and electric vehicles are great performers on the road. Charging your electric vehicle in Alameda reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline-powered vehicles, as Alameda Municipal Power provides 100% renewable energy electricity.

Home energy

Save on your home energy costs and earn a tax credit of up to $3200 with energy-efficient home improvements by December 31, 2025. Qualifying actions include installing insulation, sealing doors and windows, installing a heat pump HVAC or a heat pump water heater, and performing energy audits. You can receive 30% of the total cost for these energy improvements with various regulations applied.

Lastly, you can receive a residential clean energy credit of 30% of the system cost for installing renewable energy, including solar, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and home batteries. There is no cap on the value of 30% of the system cost.

Gavin Newsom’s (D) desk.

The package’s six bills — some of which passed with bipartisan support in an extended session on Saturday — marked a last-minute victory for Newsom, who negotiated the final terms of the legislation with State Senate and Assembly leaders over the past week.

“We have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” the governor said in a statement in the days leading up to the package’s passage.

Within the package is a bill to increase the amount of climate credit appearing on utility bills, as well as another that would revive California’s ability to expand regional power markets via U.S. West clean energy. A third bill focused on improving utility wildfire safety by strengthening oversight and expanding a dedicated fund for wildfire readiness.

The package also included an extension of the state’s cap-and-trade program, now to be known as “cap-and-invest.” This system, which sets emissions caps and distributes tradable credits within that framework, seeks to hold carbon polluters accountable by charging them for excessive emissions.

Established by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006, the program was set to expire in 2030 but would now be reauthorized until 2045, if signed into law.

The fifth bill in the package centered on strengthening local air pollution reduction efforts and oversight by extending monitoring periods, redoubling the efforts of state and local air quality agencies to deploy effective strategies.

A final piece of legislation, which received pushback from some progressive lawmakers, involved the stabilization of both in-state petroleum production and refinery supply, while also offering protections to communities located near wells.

The Center for Biological Diversity slammed the passage of this bill, arguing that it was included “as a last minute ‘gut and amend’ measure at the end of the legislative session.”

The bill, the organization warned, exempts oil drilling in California’s Kern County from state environmental quality requirements for the next decade, allowing for the approval of up to 20,000 new wells.

“It’s senseless and horrifying that California just gave its seal of approval to this reckless ‘drill, baby, drill’ bill,” Hollin Kretzmann, an attorney for the center, said in a statement.

Other environmental groups, however, voiced their support for the suite of climate-related bills, with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) commending the state for maintaining “its climate leadership.”

NRDC staff members particularly praised the advancement of the cap-and-invest extension, as well as western grid regionalization and the wildfire protections.

“While the Trump administration takes us backward, California will continue to address climate change, while improving affordability,” Victoria Rome, California government affairs director for the NRDC, said in a statement. “Our lives and prosperity depend on it.”

In addition to the six-bill energy package, Newsom will also be receiving a selection of unrelated climate bills that received the legislature’s approval.

Pilot Company has opened electric vehicle charging sites at more than 200 of its travel centers across almost 40 states, according to an announcement last week.

Recent openings include Pilot’s first EV charging stations in Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.

This puts the program, which is being developed through a collaboration with General Motors and charging infrastructure company EVgo, nearly halfway to its goal of 500 locations and 2,000 charging stalls.

Dive Insight:

Pilot is building many of its chargers in rural areas because fewer than half of rural counties had any public EV charging infrastructure, the company noted in its announcement. These could not only be a resource for customers in more remote areas, but can also encourage stops from road-trippers with electric vehicles.

Pilot travel centers are typically located along interstates, which carry more than 20% of total traffic in the U.S., according to the announcement. Its travel centers, which offer on-site restaurants and free WiFi in addition to their 350 kilowatt fast chargers, give customers plenty to do while their cars charge. They also feature Plug & Charge payments for compatible EVs.

“Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel,” said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot.

To date, Pilot has received $15 million in funding help from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. While the Trump Administration has made some changes to the NEVI program, that funding could still help Pilot, GM and EVgo build more sites.

Pilot said it expects to reach 1,000 stalls in 40 states by the end of this year.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ZPCIDg7BrSXJx5DNH8a_kPcqsp4gCe4k64Z1FAlMcro/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfOTY4Ni5KUEc=.webp,N,,2025-09-16 11:01:18.239660

ATLANTA — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Sept. 16 east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they’re superior.

“We did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,” Hoffman said. “And we’re going to prove that we’re going to be successful in the future.”

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S sport utility vehicle in Normal, Ill., as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. The company has said the Georgia operation will be able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028. It plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful of the startup automakers.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But the competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre site near Social Circle, about 45 miles east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Hoffman said Rivian hopes the U.S. Department of Energy will distribute the loan money, arguing it will boost domestic manufacturing.

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is “in this for the long haul.”

“We think that we can compete with anyone out there and that once given the opportunity, we’re going to excel,” he said.

Moreover, around 10% of the new home solar systems are being used to generate income and operate small businesses.
In 2022, we also removed taxes on off-grid solar products, services, and equipment, to reduce costs and make solar more accessible to low-income households.
Crucially, off-grid solar technologies are delivering power to communities that were left behind by traditional infrastructure.","LILONGWE – Like many African countries, Malawi faces significant energy-access challenges. In 2024, just 26% of the population had regular access to electricity – 11.3% via the grid and 14.6% through off-grid systems. With a population that is predominantly rural and widely dispersed, grid extension is costly, slow, and often unfeasible. Making matters worse, recent global economic shocks have further constrained investment in large-scale infrastructure.

Thus, for millions of Malawians, life after sunset has long unfolded in near-total darkness. Children struggle to study, businesses shut down early, and community life grinds to a halt. Rural households have had no choice but to rely on candles, kerosene, or battery-powered torches – costly, polluting stopgaps that undermine health, education, and economic opportunity.

But the outlook has brightened thanks to advances in distributed renewable energy (DRE) technologies – including solar-powered lanterns, solar home systems, and mini-grids – which can be deployed quickly, scaled flexibly, and priced more in line with household-income levels.

As realistic, sustainable, and inclusive solutions to the energy-access problem, DREs are powering economic growth by enabling small businesses to operate after dark, creating jobs in the clean-energy sector, and unlocking opportunities across education, health care, agriculture, and other sectors.

To leverage the opportunities implied by off-grid solar, the Malawian government has launched a suite of new initiatives and programs. A good example is the flagship Ngwee Ngwee Ngwee Fund (NNNF), launched in 2023 with $20 million from the World Bank through the Malawi Electricity Access Project. Designed to expand rural electrification, the NNNF offers concessional finance and subsidies to off-grid solar companies, enabling them to reduce costs to consumers and make home solar systems more affordable.

By focusing on small Tier-1 systems, this approach has successfully expanded electricity access in Malawi, already surpassing the original target of 250,000 households by June 2025. Moreover, around 10% of the new home solar systems are being used to generate income and operate small businesses.

The NNNF’s success has led to a rapid increase in private-sector investment. For example, local and women-led companies like Zuwa or Yellow offer pay-as-you-go solar power systems that align with rural income patterns and support unbanked customers, while SolarAid Malawi supplies electricity through its energy-as-a-service approach. Thanks to these efforts, the country aims to reach 1.55 million off-grid connections by 2030.

To complement this ambition, new energy cooperatives are rolling out mini-grids in high-demand areas. These cooperatives will also help to keep the focus on productive uses of electricity (such as oil expelling, welding, and bakeries) and provide power for farming needs such as irrigation and processing.

Through our Mission 300 Energy Compact, Malawi aims to achieve 70% national electricity access by the end of the decade, setting an example for others across the Global South. The NNNF has shown that public finance can unlock private-sector delivery, helping solar companies to reach rural households quickly and affordably.

But subsidies are just one lever. In 2022, we also removed taxes on off-grid solar products, services, and equipment, to reduce costs and make solar more accessible to low-income households. NNNF subsidies have helped, but the consistent, predictable tax and policy frameworks that support them have been no less important.

Now, we are looking beyond access to explore how off-grid solutions can also serve broader development goals. The economic logic is clear. Energy access allows Malawians to work and study after dark, run small businesses, irrigate farms, store food, and access mobile money. These activities raise incomes, deepen markets, and ultimately expand the country’s tax base.

Proactive, responsible fiscal policies can not only promote energy access but also drive rural development and economic growth. Off-grid energy is breathing new life into local economies, with the sector itself creating thousands of jobs. Solar companies are training and hiring sales agents, technicians, installers, customer service teams, and community representatives. These jobs often replace informal work or subsistence farming, offering skills, steady incomes, and long-term career paths. Many of these jobs go to women and young people, fostering greater inclusion and stronger community leadership.

Beyond creating jobs, reliable energy access enables new livelihoods – powering everything from barbershops and radio stations to farms and restaurants. Malawi is proving that clean energy and economic growth can go hand in hand, opening doors for the next generation.

Crucially, off-grid solar technologies are delivering power to communities that were left behind by traditional infrastructure. These are no longer niche, untested solutions. They are a central part of our integrated energy-access strategy. By combining public commitments, private innovation, and integrated planning, we are building energy systems that reflect today’s rural and urban realities.

The momentum behind these technologies is growing globally, with initiatives like Mission 300 signaling stronger international political will. But we must not become complacent. Clean energy is not a luxury. It is the foundation for modern life, and millions are still waiting for access.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/651640067eb659413bbdf1f95a9db3e8.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 17:03:04.999164

FEOC thresholds are 55% for projects beginning in construction in 2026 and go up to 75% for projects starting after 2029.
This Safe Harbour status is thought to apply to a significant capacity of supply deals signed by Chinese players.
Following industry announcements throughout this year, it seems Chinese companies are also chasing non-US markets like Europe and the Middle East harder than ever before, perhaps to de-risk exposure to US policy, including FEOC and import tariffs.","Under the new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules, US downstream projects or upstream manufacturing cannot benefit from material assistance from prohibited foreign entities (PFEs) above certain thresholds, if they want to receive tax credit support.

China is among the countries on a list that includes Russia, Iran and North Korea. The latter three are already largely cut off from accessing the US market.

More pertinently, China’s dominant position of involvement in almost every aspect of the supply chain bar software—from which it is already prohibited—means the question of what happens next realistically only applies to China.

At this year’s RE+ solar PV, BESS and EV trade show last week in Las Vegas, ESN Premium was briefed behind the scenes by representatives of Chinese companies and discussed the situation further with analysts and developers.

In Energy-Storage.news’ coverage of the show last week, we reported on the emphasis on domestically made products for the US market, evident from US-headquartered companies like Fluence and South Korean players like Samsung SDI. This time out, we ask: what’s next for China’s incumbent suppliers?

The Chinese company representatives we spoke to preferred to do so on condition of not being named or directly quoted for this article, as this would require a longer lead time to clear from their head offices.

FEOC ‘will definitely have a big impact on energy storage’

“Storage can keep tax credits until 2033 at the full rate, although there are some caveats around new restrictions on the prohibited foreign entities, namely around material assistance from Chinese companies or working with China,” Isshu Kikuma, energy storage analyst at BloombergNEF (BNEF), told ESN Premium.

The restrictions on material assistance from PFEs apply to everything from materials to finished products, investment and even service agreements for operations and maintenance (O&M). That makes it a big challenge for the industry, Kikuma said.

“Basically, three-quarters of the import value of lithium-ion batteries in the US comes from China. Having that restriction for projects starting after 2025, when it comes to the construction year, will definitely have a big impact on energy storage,” Kikuma added.

FEOC thresholds are 55% for projects beginning in construction in 2026 and go up to 75% for projects starting after 2029.

It is important how ‘in-construction’ rules are defined. They refer to the date when either physical work began or 5% of capex spend was incurred. Again, solar and wind lost this 5% rule, whereas storage and other technologies retain it, explained BNEF policy expert Derrick Flakoll.

“The FEOC rule is obviously still an issue, but if you can begin construction on your project before the end of this year, you don’t have to worry about that,” Flakoll said.

Safe Harbour represents immediate opportunity

In other words, projects in the pipeline that are already advanced enough can carry on as before. This Safe Harbour status is thought to apply to a significant capacity of supply deals signed by Chinese players.

A member of US-based senior management from one Chinese vertically integrated BESS technology provider told ESN Premium that it has signed contracts on Safe Harboured projects for completion over the next two to three years, totalling around 10GWh.

Flakoll said that rules still need some final clarification from the Trump administration, but in all, the OBBBA’s final passing into law will likely spur activity for projects that can begin construction as soon as possible.

Kikuma said that, based on the law’s language, the US will be a “difficult market” for Chinese players going forward, but Safe Harbour represents a significant potential “last-minute opportunity.”

Players talk up chances of overcoming ‘very difficult’ situation

Another representative of a Chinese company ESN Premium spoke to, which is involved in system integration but not battery cell manufacturing, said that while it had yet to secure a definitive roadmap to compliance with non-FEOC rules, “there was no doubt” that it would do so.

Perhaps the cell and non-cell question is pertinent: lithium cells still comprise the most significant part of a BESS project’s Capex. Therefore, compliance with some Chinese equipment may be possible, but compliance using all-Chinese-made cells is challenging.

Following industry announcements throughout this year, it seems Chinese companies are also chasing non-US markets like Europe and the Middle East harder than ever before, perhaps to de-risk exposure to US policy, including FEOC and import tariffs.

Nonetheless, the companies we speak with appear determined to meet eligibility criteria somehow, even if those plans themselves are not fully formed.

When asked if corporate restructuring on the part of Chinese players could help them achieve this goal, BNEF’s Derrick Flajkoll said it is a “very difficult situation for them to figure out.”

“In terms of corporate structure and debt, there’s a series of very complicated, overlapping tests that mean you would have to go through a very tough obstacle course to be compliant and claim tax credits,” Flakoll said.

“You would have to reduce Chinese ownership share, which includes not just the share from the government, but the share from any Chinese citizens who are not also US permanent residents or citizens. You also have to make sure your debt is structured properly so you haven’t issued 15% or more of it to Chinese citizens or entities.

“That said, theoretically speaking, you could perhaps arrive at a certain small enough collective Chinese ownership share that a joint venture (JV) would qualify. However, it’s then on a facility-by-facility level, and is fairly likely to get hit by prohibitions either related to supply chains or related to intellectual property, EPC and other service contracts.”

It would take what the policy analyst called a “very thorough scrub” to be compliant, while compliance for the 45X manufacturing tax credit is determined yearly, based on when a component is sold.

“It is theoretically possible that they could go from non-compliance to compliance, or vice versa, but keep in mind, we have a fairly short window on these remaining tax credits. They start phasing out in the early 2030s and by that point, that’s only a little bit of your amortisation of your factory that’s going to cover,” Flakoll said.

“So, it’s a difficult situation for them to figure out. I have no doubt that some of them are trying, but it’s tough, and you can imagine why some of them might be looking to sell to other players for that reason.”

One workaround beyond Safe Harbour that a Chinese company we spoke to was considering is the establishment of manufacturing facilities outside China, such as in Southeast Asia or the US itself.

ITC: Not the only game in town?

There are reasons why China’s position in the battery storage supply is so dominant.

Chief among them is that China can deliver much cheaper products, partly through technology innovation and largely through the sheer scale of manufacturing that its companies have often achieved.

Indeed, our contact at the vertically integrated Chinese BESS manufacturer tells us that it hopes to sell products into the US for projects that don’t have any ITC strings attached.

This may be especially true for large projects like data centres, which have an economic imperative to come online quickly and, therefore, have less cost-sensitive developers.

Kikuma said his team at BNEF are currently checking this, although he has some doubts.

“If their products are cheap enough, maybe their projects don’t need investment tax credits to be economically cost-competitive, so possibly there might be opportunities for non-ITC projects,” he said.

Kikuma said going the non-ITC route sounds like a disadvantage. Still, his colleague Flakoll added that there may be a “wedge” of projects in the market that turn to unsubsidised Chinese supply chains, rather than as a mainstream option.

“Isshu did some modelling, and basically the projected US storage build in 2035 can be almost, but not quite, met by production from Southeast Asia to South Korea and the US combined. There’s a little wedge there that needs to be filled by somebody, and the Chinese manufacturers have the expertise,” he said.

“The costs are going to keep declining. They have the scale. They’re locked in fairly deadly competition with each other that none of them wants to lose. They want access to a valuable market like the US.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7050.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 11:01:02.807801

Strategic Location Drives Industrial Transformation

The timing of this investment reflects Morocco’s calculated positioning in global supply chains. Located just 14 kilometres from Spain, Morocco provides a natural gateway to European markets, where demand for electric vehicle batteries is surging ahead of the EU’s 2035 ban on new fossil fuel vehicles.

According to Khalid Qalam, Gotion’s Moroccan director, construction will begin imminently, with earthworks already completed and production scheduled to commence in the third quarter of 2026. The facility’s initial capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually will be sufficient to power hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles, with plans to scale operations to an impressive 100 GWh over time.

This vertical integration approach sets the project apart from typical assembly operations. Unlike many plants that rely on imported components, the Kenitra facility will produce critical electrode materials including cathodes and anodes. This comprehensive manufacturing capability reduces Morocco’s dependence on foreign supply chains while strengthening regional supply security, providing a competitive advantage that few other regions can match.

Morocco’s Automotive Success Story Provides Foundation

The battery gigafactory builds upon Morocco’s remarkable automotive sector transformation. The kingdom’s automotive industry has maintained its position as the country’s leading export sector, with overseas sales rising 6.3% to MAD 157.6 billion ($15.7 billion) in 2024. This achievement represents Morocco’s emergence as Africa’s leading automotive exporter, surpassing traditional powerhouses including China, Japan, and India as the EU’s top automotive supplier.

Morocco’s vehicle production reached 535,825 units by the end of 2023, with nearly 80% destined for export markets. Major manufacturers including Renault and Stellantis have established significant operations in the kingdom, creating an established industrial ecosystem that provides the ideal foundation for battery manufacturing expansion.

The automotive sector’s success demonstrates Morocco’s ability to integrate into global supply chains while developing local industrial capabilities. Passenger cars now represent 14.9% of Morocco’s total exports, followed closely by automotive parts and components at 3.7%, establishing a comprehensive automotive value chain that the battery project will significantly enhance.

China’s Evolving African Investment Strategy

The Morocco battery project exemplifies China’s evolving approach to African investment, shifting from traditional infrastructure projects toward high-tech manufacturing and clean energy initiatives. Chinese FDI in Sub-Saharan Africa reached an all-time high of $15.2 billion in 2024, representing 16.5% of newly announced investments.

This investment wave reflects China’s strategic positioning in Africa’s energy transition. Between 2010 and 2021, Chinese financial institutions provided approximately $18 billion annually in global energy lending, with nearly one-third directed to African economies. The Morocco project represents a significant evolution from earlier coal and hydropower investments toward renewable energy and battery technology.

Gotion High-Tech is not operating in isolation. Other Chinese companies including BTR, CNGR, Hailiang, and Shinzoom are simultaneously investing heavily in Morocco’s battery materials sector, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for green technology manufacturing. This coordinated investment approach positions Morocco as North Africa’s definitive hub for clean energy manufacturing.

Economic Impact and Job Creation

The economic implications of the gigafactory extend far beyond its impressive $5.6 billion price tag. The first phase alone involves $1.3 billion in investment and is projected to create 17,000 jobs directly and indirectly. As the project expands through its five planned development phases, total employment could reach 10,000 direct positions, with thousands more indirect opportunities across the supply chain.

Initial operations will create 2,300 jobs immediately, while the facility will serve European automakers and Morocco’s domestic automotive hubs. The project will also target energy storage markets in Africa and the Middle East, regions ideally suited for renewable energy development with approximately 300 days of sunshine annually.

For Morocco, this represents a strategic opportunity to diversify beyond traditional industries like agriculture and textiles, moving decisively into high-tech manufacturing. The vertical integration approach – producing both batteries and their critical components – positions Morocco as a comprehensive supplier rather than merely an assembly location.

Continental and Global Implications

The Morocco-China partnership carries significance extending far beyond national boundaries. By anchoring Africa’s first battery gigafactory, Morocco is establishing a precedent for how the continent can transition from primarily supplying raw materials to becoming a value-added manufacturer in the clean energy economy.

Africa’s mineral wealth includes substantial deposits of copper, lithium, cobalt, manganese, and rare earth metals – all essential ingredients for electric vehicle batteries and renewable technologies. If the Morocco model is replicated in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo (cobalt), Zambia (copper), and Zimbabwe (lithium), the continent could capture significantly greater value from its natural resources.

The project also addresses Africa’s massive energy access challenge, with 600 million people – roughly 43% of the continent’s population – still lacking reliable electricity access. Battery manufacturing capabilities could support renewable energy storage solutions across the continent, accelerating electrification efforts.

Market Positioning and Export Strategy

Approximately 85% of the gigafactory’s output will be exported to the European Union, providing the bloc with a strategic alternative to Asian supply routes that have traditionally dominated battery manufacturing. This positioning offers Europe enhanced supply chain security while supporting its ambitious decarbonization targets.

The facility will leverage Morocco’s existing trade relationships and geographic advantages. Morocco’s proximity to Europe, established logistics infrastructure, and preferential trade agreements create an ideal export platform. The kingdom’s demonstrated ability to integrate with European supply chains, evidenced by its automotive sector success, provides confidence in the battery project’s commercial viability.

Beyond Europe, the facility will target Africa’s emerging electric vehicle market, where Chinese EV manufacturers are rapidly expanding operations. Electric car sales in Africa more than doubled in 2024, reaching approximately 11,000 units, though they still represent less than 1% of the continent’s total vehicle market, indicating substantial growth potential.

Sustainability and Environmental Considerations

The gigafactory project aligns with broader environmental objectives across multiple dimensions. Morocco’s commitment to renewable energy development provides a sustainable power source for battery manufacturing, while the facility’s output will support global electrification efforts and carbon emissions reduction.

The project addresses China’s commitment to cleaner overseas investments, following President Xi Jinping’s 2021 pledge to cease funding new coal-fired power plants overseas. The battery project represents the type of clean technology investment that characterizes China’s evolved approach to African development cooperation.

Morocco’s abundant renewable energy potential – with substantial solar and wind resources – positions the battery manufacturing facility to operate with minimal carbon footprint. This sustainable approach could establish a template for similar projects across the continent, demonstrating how industrial development can align with environmental objectives.

Challenges and Risk Considerations

While the project offers substantial opportunities, it also presents challenges requiring careful management. Some experts express concerns about potential debt dependencies and the concentration of Chinese influence in critical industries. Morocco’s government will need to ensure that the partnership delivers genuine technology transfer and local capacity building rather than merely creating assembly operations.

The project’s success will depend on Morocco’s ability to develop local technical expertise and supplier networks. Building a sustainable industrial ecosystem requires more than foreign investment – it demands educational institution development, skills training programs, and policies that encourage local participation in emerging industries.

Market volatility in the global battery sector poses another consideration. While demand projections remain strong, technological developments, raw material price fluctuations, and shifting government policies could impact project economics. Morocco’s diversified approach – targeting multiple markets and applications – helps mitigate these risks.

Future Implications and Expansion Potential

The Morocco battery gigafactory represents the beginning rather than the culmination of Africa’s clean energy manufacturing transformation. Success in Morocco could inspire similar projects across the continent, particularly in countries with abundant mineral resources and favorable investment climates.

The project’s vertical integration model – producing both batteries and critical components – could be replicated and expanded. Future developments might include lithium processing facilities, cathode material production, and battery recycling capabilities, creating a comprehensive clean energy manufacturing ecosystem.

Regional integration through initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) could further enhance the project’s impact. Imagine vehicles assembled in Morocco using components manufactured across Africa and exported tariff-free continent-wide. Such integration would reduce costs, build intra-African trade, and decrease reliance on volatile overseas markets.

Looking Ahead: A New Model for African Development

As the world accelerates toward cleaner energy and transport systems, Morocco’s battery gigafactory may well become a blueprint for African nations determined to transform natural resource wealth into sustainable, long-term prosperity. The project demonstrates how strategic international partnerships can create jobs, facilitate technology transfer, and secure stronger positions in global industries of the future.

The success of this initiative could inspire a new development model across Africa, where countries move beyond commodity exports toward value-added manufacturing. With proper execution, Morocco’s gigafactory could mark the beginning of Africa’s emergence as a major player in the global clean energy economy, offering a path toward sustainable industrialization that benefits both the continent and its international partners.

For Morocco, the project represents both economic opportunity and geopolitical positioning. By aligning with China while strengthening ties with the European Union, the kingdom is establishing itself as a bridge between Africa, Asia, and Europe in the rapidly growing green economy. This strategic positioning could prove transformative for Morocco’s long-term economic development and regional influence.

The gigafactory’s impact will extend far beyond battery production, potentially catalyzing broader industrial development and positioning Morocco as Africa’s clean energy manufacturing hub. As construction advances and production begins, the project will serve as a crucial test case for similar initiatives across the continent, offering lessons and insights for Africa’s clean energy future.

The looming expiration date of federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits has shaken up the EV market, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), the leading American EV manufacturer, may be the most impacted. Its shares have dropped 45% in 2025, reaching a calendar-year low of $214 in April.

And even though share prices bounced back in recent days/weeks/months, they are still down for the year, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn't very optimistic about the short-term outlook.

Tesla has another rough earnings report

In its July 23 Q2 earnings report, Tesla posted a 16% decline in quarterly sales for the second straight quarter. The automaker also saw year-over-year declines in both revenue and vehicle deliveries.

Musk stated back in July that the company could have a few ""rough quarters,"" highlighting tariff-related cost increases and the expiration of the tax credit as contributing factors. The company plans to limit vehicle inventory for Q3, and is uncertain whether it will be able to guarantee delivery for orders placed after August.

Musk, who was an advisor to President Donald Trump until May, when he resigned, stated in April that he believes lower tariff rates are beneficial for ""prosperity."" While Tesla is a U.S. manufacturer, it imports various car parts from multiple foreign countries that are currently impacted by tariffs, including battery cells from China.

The end of the EV tax credit

First introduced in 2009, the federal EV tax credits were implemented as incentives for U.S. consumers to purchase electric vehicles. The current credit for a new EV purchase is $7,500, while used car purchases can receive $4,000.

However, now that Congress has passed President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" those credit incentives will expire on Sept. 30. Consumers who have their car delivered after Sept. 30 will still receive the credit, provided the purchase occurs before the deadline.

In 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS reported that the government spent more than $2 billion in federal tax credits for more than 300,000 electric vehicle purchases. There's a strong chance that consumers will capitalize on the expiring credits, causing EV sales to spike briefly in September and then drop.

A study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research in October 2024 predicts that if the credits are eliminated, EV sales in the U.S. will fall by nearly 30%.

Tesla's share price increased in August

The EV company's stock price climbed 9% in August, marking a second consecutive month of price increases. But it has a lot of catching up to do, as share prices are currently down by 16% in 2025 in the first week of September. It's been over eight months since Tesla stock reached an all-time high, peaking at $488 on Dec. 2, 2024.

Competitors such as Ford Motor Company and General Motors will also be impacted by the tax credit elimination, but have their gas vehicle production to fall back on. Ford's share price was up by 18% in 2025, as of early September, while GM's increased 17%.

Is Tesla stock a buy right now?

While Tesla stock has been trending upward in recent months, macroeconomic factors like ongoing tariff disputes and a presidential administration that is actively rolling back EV initiatives make the stock a potentially volatile investment.

Once investors understand how Tesla plans to manage production after tax credits expire, they'll be able to make a more informed decision about the stock's long-term value within their portfolio. And there's a strong chance the stock will bounce back once President Trump is out of office. But for now, investors should wait for the next earnings report before purchasing shares.

“The question isn’t if Utah invests in new energy resources, we know we need to bring on new energy.
The real question is how much those investments will cost,” Sarah Wright, CEO of Utah Clean Energy said in a statement.
But, developers can still access clean energy production tax credits.
“This is a rare opportunity to invest in needed new energy resources while harnessing homegrown resources that are by far the most cost effective right now,” Wright said in a statement.","Before clean energy tax credits expire under congressional Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law, clean energy advocates are requesting the Utah Public Service Commission to direct PacifiCorp, the parent company of Utah’s largest electricity supplier, to open an expedited procurement process for wind, solar and storage resources.

The process, Utah Clean Energy says, has the potential to save Utahns millions, or even billions of dollars in future energy costs.

“The question isn’t if Utah invests in new energy resources, we know we need to bring on new energy. The real question is how much those investments will cost,” Sarah Wright, CEO of Utah Clean Energy said in a statement. “This is a once in a decade opportunity to procure zero-fuel-cost renewable projects at record low prices.”

According to the filing, with the passage of the federal spending package, there’s a tight window for PacifiCorp to develop new energy resources with federal tax credits, which would result in substantial cost savings for state ratepayers.

Utah Clean Energy analysts calculated that PacifiCorp’s preferred resource portfolio could save ratepayers 56.8% for solar resources and 55.7% for wind over 25 or 30 years, the estimated lifetime of the assets, if it takes advantage of tax credits.

“In dollars, this amounts to over $150 million of savings for every 100 MW of solar built and over $210 million of savings for every 100 MW of wind built,” the request reads.

The spending package, in addition to new U.S. Treasury Department guidance for clean energy projects eligible for the tax incentives, have created new restrictions and shorter timelines for projects pursuing tax credits. But, developers can still access clean energy production tax credits.

PacifiCorp’s preferred portfolio would have “3181 MW of tax-advantaged solar and 2641 MW of tax-advantaged wind that will reach commercial operation by the early 2030s,” the filing says. The company is planning to start a procurement process in the next four years to reach that deadline.

But, those plans were made before the updated federal legislation, so if the company wants to capture the tax credits, it needs to push the accelerator.

“This is a rare opportunity to invest in needed new energy resources while harnessing homegrown resources that are by far the most cost effective right now,” Wright said in a statement. “These ultra-affordable resources will contribute to Governor Cox’s Operation Gigawatt goal of doubling energy generation over the next 10 years while ensuring Utahns have reliable, affordable clean energy for decades to come.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47642/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/012925_wind-energy_08-1024x6831758024477.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=XbTKNRg3,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:44.973746

(TNS)

The Trump administration has been slashing green energy incentives, freezing the construction of wind farms and ordering coal-burning power plants to keep running longer than planned. And yet, more American homes and businesses are getting their power from renewable sources than ever before — and in greater amounts.

In June, almost one-quarter of U.S. power generation was green, up from 18% in the year-earlier period, according to data compiled from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The question now is whether the trend continues with President Donald Trump back in the White House.

The recent growth in renewables usage is almost certainly tied to investments made prior to Trump’s election in November. Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. backed roughly $100 billion of investments in clean energy. Now, the Trump administration is taking a sledgehammer to those efforts by opposing offshore wind farms and eliminating incentives for electric vehicles and solar power.

Still, Texas is a prime example of how the energy markets have changed. In early March, the state’s grid set a record for wind generation; in mid-June, it registered a new peak for electricity produced from renewable resources; and a month later, Texas notched new highs for battery storage and solar generation.

Similar records are popping up across the country on an almost weekly basis, as utilities harvest a windfall from new solar and wind farms that can be built faster and more affordably than fossil fuel-based power plants.

Here are five charts that capture a bit of the size and scope of America’s recent wave of green energy, showing where and how it’s happening, and what the landscape looks like going forward.

Nearly one-third

For utilities and folks operating the nation’s power grids, the wave of green energy couldn’t come at a better time because volatile weather, electric vehicles and a rash of AI-focused data centers are all driving up demand.

In April, as grid operators were girding for heat waves, nearly one-third of U.S. power was generated from renewable sources. And the green energy boom is spreading beyond the Sun and Wind belts. The New York grid hit a renewable record on June 24. New England recorded new highs for both wind and solar power this summer and the grid in the Mid-Atlantic states reported a record renewable harvest in late June.

“We’re in an entirely new landscape for load growth, so this is none too soon,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and utility policy director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Every solution available will need to be called on.”

What good is the dawn?

If all of the utility-owned solar panels in California were considered one facility, it would have ranked at the end of July as the second-largest power plant in the world. At noon on July 30, solar generation on the state’s CAISO grid hit 21.7 megawatts, second only to the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam on China’s Yangtze River.

For much of that day, the sun accounted for roughly two-thirds of the power Californians were using and the panels fed into batteries that, once the sun went down, juiced nearly one-third of the state.

Charge baby charge

The Texas power market is truly the Wild West of electricity.

As a deregulated, wholesale market, the state’s consumers can choose their provider and plants are only paid for what they produce. In this eat-what-you-kill energy world, utilities have turned en masse to a novel tool: big batteries.

These so-called storage facilities let power players sock away electrons when demand (read: prices) are low and discharge the juice when usage peaks. Often, the most economical strategy is storing solar power during the day and releasing it in the evening when the lights and TVs switch on and air conditioners are still humming.

A rash of new storage facilities have been switched on in Texas this year, shoring up the grid with record amounts of reserve power.

A mighty wind

In Wyoming, the largest coal-producing state in the U.S., it’s common for tractor trailers to get blown over onto their sides. Such is the power of the wind on the Great Plains. And it’s steady as well as strong.

On the Southwest Power Pool grid, which stretches from the Dakotas south to Texas, new records for wind power were reached twice in August alone. At one point on Aug. 16, almost two of every three electrons in the system were coming from turbines.

Clicking the boxes

Good, cheap or fast? Typically, one only gets to choose two of those things. But now, solar, wind and other renewable sources are clicking all three of those boxes when it comes to producing electricity. So-called green energy is currently the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy power generator in the U.S., even without incentives, according to research from Lazard Inc.

Given President Donald Trump’s attacks on green power, the decisions made by utilities have become more fraught than usual and a bit more complicated than just choosing the cheapest plant to build. In May, Gordon van Welie, chief executive officer of the ISO New England grid, told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that his organization was counting on large quantities of offshore wind to meet rising demand. Three months later, the Trump administration ordered crews to stop working on a project off the coast of Rhode Island where 45 of 65 planned turbines have already been installed, a directive that it now has to defend in court.

The facility was expected to power roughly 350,000 homes. Administration officials say solar and wind is unreliable and too connected to China-based supply chains. Trump’s term, however, will likely be over long before any new coal-fired or nuclear plant can be built to replace that capacity.

“We need more electrons in this country and the industry seems to have an agnostic view,” said Lazard Managing Director Samuel Scroggins, referring to where electrons originate. “Practically speaking, renewable energy is ready to build and it remains below the cost of alternatives.”

While the European Union has upheld “green” designations for nuclear and natural gas to support its clean energy transition, Washington is signaling a retreat from renewables in favor of fossil fuels.","The Donald Trump administration’s sharp pivot away from renewable energy and electric vehicles could wipe out more than half a trillion dollars in clean energy and transportation investments, threatening to derail America’s decarbonisation trajectory, according to a new report by research provider Rhodium Group.

In its Taking Stock 2025 analysis released this week, Rhodium warned that the U.S. is on course for “much slower emissions reductions than previously anticipated” as the White House and Congress roll back policies that underpinned the rapid expansion of solar, wind, and EV adoption over the past decade.

Hostile Climate Policy Shift

Since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has advanced what analysts describe as one of the most abrupt reversals in U.S. energy and climate policy in recent history.

His administration has scrapped incentives for clean energy projects, moved to accelerate fossil fuel development, and targeted the 2009 “endangerment finding”, a landmark Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruling that established greenhouse gases as harmful to public health and provided the legal basis for climate regulations.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has formally proposed rescinding the endangerment finding, calling it a step toward “commonsense policies that expand access to affordable, reliable, secure energy.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright praised the move as a way to strengthen fossil fuel and nuclear power generation, in sharp contrast to the previous Biden administration’s prioritisation of renewable technologies.

“The first seven months of the second Trump administration and 119th Congress have seen the most abrupt shift in energy and climate policy in recent memory,” Rhodium Group noted.

Decarbonization Pace Slows

Rhodium’s projections show the U.S. could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26–41% by 2040 relative to 2005 levels. That is far below the 38–56% cut the firm estimated in last year’s report. The slowdown is particularly stark in its “high emissions scenario,” where average annual reductions would collapse to just 0.4% between 2025 and 2040—less than half the rate achieved in the past two decades.

At the heart of the reversal is the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA), a sweeping budget reconciliation measure passed by Congress earlier this year. Rhodium estimates the law will cut the build-out of new clean power-generating capacity by 53–59% over the next decade, effectively putting at risk more than $500 billion in clean energy and transportation investment.

“It also places nearly $150 billion of existing clean energy manufacturing investment under pressure,” the group said, warning of reduced domestic demand for solar panels, wind turbines, and EV components.

Solar Industry at Risk

The solar industry faces a particularly uncertain future. While developers are racing to complete projects before remaining tax incentives expire in 2027, longer-term prospects have dimmed due to new restrictions on permitting and penalties tied to Chinese supply chains.

A joint report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie forecasts the U.S. could lose 44 gigawatts (GW) of planned solar deployment by 2030—a decline of about 18%.

“Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardising grid reliability,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.

Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie, added that “federal policy uncertainty is making the business environment incredibly challenging,” with developers cautious about committing new capital.

Notably, the industry’s growth has been concentrated in Republican-led states. SEIA data show that 77% of solar capacity installed this year has been built in Trump-won states such as Texas, Indiana, Arizona, and Florida.

Wind Power Stalls

Wind energy is also showing signs of strain. Although installations rose earlier this year, turbine orders plunged by 50% in the first half of 2025, reaching their lowest point since 2020, according to a report by Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

ACP data show the U.S. clean power development pipeline has stagnated, with solar installations falling 23% and new power purchase agreements nearly grinding to a halt.

“The uncertainty created by new bureaucratic delays and unclear demands is chilling the pipeline for future projects,” ACP CEO Jason Grumet said. “This is stalling growth precisely when the nation needs more energy to power a growing economy.”

Broader Implications

The policy U-turn not only undermines U.S. climate commitments but also threatens jobs and industrial investments tied to the energy transition. Clean power and EV supply chains had been a cornerstone of federal and state-level industrial policy in recent years, with billions of dollars flowing into domestic manufacturing hubs.

Now, analysts warn, those investments could dry up, ceding ground to Europe and Asia, where governments continue to incentivize renewables and clean technologies.

The Rhodium report underscores that executive decisions will further shape how deeply the OBBBA curtails clean energy momentum. If the administration aggressively enforces new trade and permitting rules, the hit to investment could exceed its current half-trillion-dollar estimate.

The Bottom Line

What emerges is a sharp divergence between the U.S. and its major trading partners. While the European Union has upheld “green” designations for nuclear and natural gas to support its clean energy transition, Washington is signaling a retreat from renewables in favor of fossil fuels.

For now, the U.S. remains on a path to slower emissions reductions, weaker renewable growth, and a less certain investment climate. As Rhodium put it bluntly: “The U.S. is no longer driving decarbonization at the pace required to meet its climate commitments. The policy environment has turned openly hostile to wind, solar, and electric vehicles, with consequences that will reverberate for decades.”",https://cdn.businessday.ng/2022/03/clean-energy.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 12:04:12.495270

Why not navigate the interactive map and find out where your nearest energy storage project is located?","The EU is a proud champion of renewable energy. By 2023, almost a quarter of all the energy we consumed came from renewable sources – double the share in 2010, when it sat at 12.5%. Building on this progress and to keep the momentum, in 2023, EU countries set the binding target of achieving a share of at least 42.5% renewables in the energy mix by 2030.

Harnessing the energy of abundant renewable sources like the wind, the sun and our rivers offers a sustainable and crucial alternative to burning fossil fuels – allowing us to produce our own clean, secure and affordable energy in Europe. In 2024, almost half of our electricity needs could be covered from renewables. As we decarbonise our economy, the electrification rate needs to pick up significantly, and so will demand for storage solutions.

While renewable energy sources can’t be depleted in the same way as fossil fuels, they are ‘variable’, meaning their availability fluctuates. It is therefore important that we invest in technologies that help address this. That’s where energy storage solutions, such as batteries, have a vital role to play. Technological developments and market uptake have already had a positive impact on the storage sector: the costs of battery storage are down by 93% since 2010, according to theInternational Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Hydropower: a leading storage solution

Pumped storage hydropower is the largest energy storage technology globally. It works by pumping water into reservoirs when there is an electricity surplus in the grid, for example on a sunny or windy day, and releasing it to generate electricity when more energy is needed.

46 GW capacity of pumped storage hydropower is installed in the EU, amounting to almost a quarter of the total global installed capacity.

Furthermore, from 2019 to 2021, EU companies were responsible for 29% of high value hydropower inventions globally.

The world’s growing demand for batteries

Although your smartphone, power bank or kitchen clock is likely to spring to mind when you think of batteries, you may be surprised to learn that consumer electronics made up only 2% of global battery deployment distribution in 2023. Meanwhile, mobility applications (such as electric vehicle batteries) and stationary energy storage systems accounted for 86% and 12% respectively. This paints a clear picture of the effect that the energy transition and electrification are having on driving global battery demand.

According to the International Energy Agency, the average global demand in the energy sector, for both electric vehicle (EV) batteries and storage applications, for a single week in 2024 exceeded the total demand for an entire year just a decade earlier. In this context, the sector reached the historical milestone of 1 TWh in battery demand in 2024.

Here in the EU, according to the quarterly report on European electricity markets, more than 620 000 new electric vehicles (EVs) were sold in the passenger car segment in the first 3 months of 2025. This marks a record high for the first quarter of any year and is 15% higher than the same quarter last year, translating into a 21% EV share in the EU passenger car market.

Securing the EU’s battery supply

The global battery sector is intensely competitive. According to the 2025 report from the Commission’s Clean Energy Technology Observatory, in 2023, the EU accounted for 8% of the global Li-ion battery production capacity, contributing an estimated 90 000 direct jobs to the EU economy, up from 61 000 in 2022. This being said, the EU still relies on imports to meet 50% of its demand, with approximately 83% of global Li-ion battery production capacity situated in China in 2023.

In this respect, the EU is determined to close the gap with China and the United States and assert itself as a global leader in this key industry.

As part of these efforts, in July 2025, the Commission announced a total of €852 million in strategic investments in 6 pioneering EV battery cell manufacturing projects, in the form of grants from the Innovation Fund. This followed the Commission’s 2023 announcement to strengthen the EU's battery manufacturing capacity by allocating up to €3 billion in targeted support to incentivise investment in domestic EV battery cell manufacturing capacity to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.

The EU’s Batteries Regulation, which entered into force 2 years ago, helps ensure that Europe’s ambition on batteries does not come at an environmental cost. It contributes to the EU’s circular economy and zero pollution ambitions and strengthens our strategic autonomy on batteries.

Novel energy storage solutions

Beyond batteries and pumped storage hydropower, the EU ranks second, after the U.S., in the number of companies developing novel energy storage technologies and leads in liquid air energy storage.

From 2019 to 2021, the EU submitted 277 invention claims, with 54% considered high value, while China submitted 5 000 claims, of which 3% were high value. Nonetheless, both regions exhibit similar levels of high value inventions.

A lack of reliable data represents a challenge in analysing emerging energy storage markets. The Commission’s European Energy Storage Inventory can help address this gap within Europe. Launched in March 2025, it is the first European-level tool of its kind, providing a real-time dashboard of energy storage levels in Europe, offering energy storage data across a full range of technologies.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has today (Tuesday 16 September) set out his vision for Great British Energy, detailing his expectations for how the UK’s publicly-owned clean power company will deliver on the government’s clean energy superpower mission – that will take back control of Britain’s energy supply to protect billpayers from global fossil fuel price spikes.

Great British Energy is already delivering savings to the British public at a local level, following its investment of around £200 million in solar and renewable energy projects on schools, hospitals and public buildings across the country, with solar panels already starting to cut bills for vital public services.

Under its objectives, the company will drive clean energy deployment across the whole of the UK, as a developer, investor, and owner of clean energy projects – working in tandem with the private sector, devolved governments, local authorities and community energy groups.

Throughout this, the company will be required to put working people and communities at the heart of the clean energy transition – by increasing public ownership and community involvement in the development of clean energy projects, and supporting jobs and economic growth across the UK.

The government has also now set a target for Great British Energy to start making returns on its commercial activities as a whole by 2030. This includes a requirement for the company to have a plan for becoming self-financing in place by 2030, with profits reinvested into clean energy projects that will help protect billpayers permanently.

The strategic priorities – agreed by all devolved governments – set a clear vision for how Great British Energy will provide a catalyst for the expansion of the UK’s homegrown, clean energy supply. It follows the passing of the Great British Energy Act in May.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

It is time to make things and own things in Britain again. That’s why we have set up Great British Energy to be a new national champion and allow us to reap the benefits of Britain’s abundant natural resources.

Great British Energy will place working people, communities and British industries at its core, turbocharging clean energy across the country as part of our clean power mission.

The government has today confirmed the 3 key areas that the company should focus on to meet these objectives:

investment in and development of nascent and more established technologies and assets required for Clean Power 2030 and beyond

activity in domestic supply chains to build long-term domestic resilience and economic growth

supporting the growth of local and community energy, working alongside government to deliver a Local Power Plan that will help to ensure local people and communities benefit from the clean energy transition

Great British Energy will produce a strategic plan within 6 months, setting out how it will meet the Energy Secretary’s expectations to support the clean power mission and deliver for the British public.

Great British Energy’s CEO, Dan McGrail said:

Work is already underway at Great British Energy to deliver our Strategic Plan, and we welcome the Secretary of State’s recommendations. Most of the clean energy projects in the government’s’ Industrial Strategy will flow through Great British Energy, enabling us to be the green growth engine for the UK.

We are going to invest £1 billion in domestic supply chains, which I expect will unlock billions more in investment and create thousands of jobs. Along with our partners like The National Wealth Fund, The Crown Estate, Great British Energy-Nuclear and many more, we are primed to develop innovative ways to grow new renewable technologies, ensuring our energy is engineered in the UK.

The company will also continue to work closely with the National Wealth Fund and build on key partnerships made over the last year, to support the development of clean energy projects – including with The Crown Estate and Crown Estate Scotland. This has already seen Great British Energy and the government join forces with The Crown Estate and industry to invest £1 billion in offshore wind supply chains, supporting economic growth and skilled well-paid jobs across UK.

Notes to editors

The Great British Energy Act 2025 set a requirement for the government to publish a Statement of Strategic Priorities for Great British Energy within 6 months.

In March, Great British Energy awarded £180 million to fund rooftop solar panels at schools and NHS sites, set to deliver savings of up to £400 million over 30 years.

In July, Great British Energy awarded mayoral authorities across England a share of £10 million in grant funding to roll out clean energy projects for community buildings, including care homes, leisure centres and libraries. The schemes are estimated to produce £35 million of lifetime savings on energy bills, money which can be reinvested in vital services.

Its shares have dropped 45% in 2025, reaching a calendar-year low of $214 in April.

And even though share prices bounced back in recent days/weeks/months, they are still down for the year, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn't very optimistic about the short-term outlook.

Tesla has another rough earnings report

In its July 23 Q2 earnings report, Tesla posted a 16% decline in quarterly sales for the second straight quarter. The automaker also saw year-over-year declines in both revenue and vehicle deliveries.

Musk stated back in July that the company could have a few ""rough quarters,"" highlighting tariff-related cost increases and the expiration of the tax credit as contributing factors. The company plans to limit vehicle inventory for Q3, and is uncertain whether it will be able to guarantee delivery for orders placed after August.

Musk, who was an advisor to President Donald Trump until May, when he resigned, stated in April that he believes lower tariff rates are beneficial for ""prosperity."" While Tesla is a U.S. manufacturer, it imports various car parts from multiple foreign countries that are currently impacted by tariffs, including battery cells from China.

The end of the EV tax credit

First introduced in 2009, the federal EV tax credits were implemented as incentives for U.S. consumers to purchase electric vehicles. The current credit for a new EV purchase is $7,500, while used car purchases can receive $4,000.

However, now that Congress has passed President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" those credit incentives will expire on Sept. 30. Consumers who have their car delivered after Sept. 30 will still receive the credit, provided the purchase occurs before the deadline.

In 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS reported that the government spent more than $2 billion in federal tax credits for more than 300,000 electric vehicle purchases. There's a strong chance that consumers will capitalize on the expiring credits, causing EV sales to spike briefly in September and then drop.

A study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research in October 2024 predicts that if the credits are eliminated, EV sales in the U.S. will fall by nearly 30%.

Tesla's share price increased in August

The EV company's stock price climbed 9% in August, marking a second consecutive month of price increases. But it has a lot of catching up to do, as share prices are currently down by 16% in 2025 in the first week of September. It's been over eight months since Tesla stock reached an all-time high, peaking at $488 on Dec. 2, 2024.

Competitors such as Ford Motor Company and General Motors will also be impacted by the tax credit elimination, but have their gas vehicle production to fall back on. Ford's share price was up by 18% in 2025, as of early September, while GM's increased 17%.

Is Tesla stock a buy right now?

While Tesla stock has been trending upward in recent months, macroeconomic factors like ongoing tariff disputes and a presidential administration that is actively rolling back EV initiatives make the stock a potentially volatile investment.

Once investors understand how Tesla plans to manage production after tax credits expire, they'll be able to make a more informed decision about the stock's long-term value within their portfolio. And there's a strong chance the stock will bounce back once President Trump is out of office. But for now, investors should wait for the next earnings report before purchasing shares.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/833639/evs.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 11:00:32.697783

ABB announced today that it will invest a further $110 million in the United States in 2025 to expand the R&D and manufacturing of its advanced electrification solutions as customers focus on improving energy efficiency and uptime while reducing their energy costs. The IEA estimate US wholesale electricity prices rose by 30-40% in the first half of 2025, compared with 2024.

Creating nearly 200 new jobs, the investment will support expected future growth in key industries, including data centers and the power grid. Rapid expansion of data centers in the US is expected to keep annual electricity demand growth above 2% in both 2025 and 2026, more than double the average growth rate over the past decade (IEA).

A new production line will be created in Mississippi for ABB’s innovative Emax 3 circuit breakers, an advanced technology used to protect critical infrastructure, such as data centers.

“This $110 million investment in the US is part of our long-term strategy to support future growth in our biggest global market,” said Morten Wierod, ABB’s Chief Executive Officer. “Demand is being driven by key trends, from the surging power needs of AI in data centers, to grid modernization and customers improving energy efficiency and uptime to reduce their costs. Our investments will ensure we can meet growing demand from customers across North America in line with our local-for-local strategy.”

Manufacturing new technology

ABB will invest $15 million to create a new production line for Emax 3 in its Senatobia, Mississippi site. The cutting-edge Emax 3 air circuit breaker improves the energy security and resilience of power systems in large facilities with high power demands, including data centers, advanced manufacturing sites, and airports. The new line is expected to open in 2026.

A $30 million project will double the footprint of ABB’s Richmond, Virginia facility adding a new test center, warehouse and new assembly lines. The power quality and protection products made in Richmond are used by data centers, manufacturing plants and utilities to protect critical systems in essential operations and services, like servers, MRI machines and production lines from electrical failures. The new facility, opening in Q4 2025, will create around 100 new production and engineering roles.

In Arecibo, Puerto Rico, an investment of more than $30 million will increase the size of the facility to accommodate three new production lines. Made for industrial and commercial operations in the US, technologies produced in Arecibo include smart circuit breakers and switching devices, essential power components that help distribute electricity, protect equipment and monitor energy usage. The expansion will create 90 new skilled jobs by the end of 2026.

A $35 million investment will increase the capacity of ABB’s manufacturing facility in Pinetops, North Carolina. This will support expected demand for advanced low and medium voltage grid components from the utilities, and for data centers and industrial facilities. The expansion will support customers upgrading their energy infrastructure with advanced sensors and new switching and grid protection devices. The upgraded facility will open in 2026.

From 2022-2024, ABB invested around $500 million in its US business, including a new $100 million manufacturing facility and innovation laboratory in New Berlin, Wisconsin and a new $40 million factory in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In March 2025, ABB announced a $120 million investment in its facilities in Selmer, Tennessee ($80 million) and Senatobia, Mississippi ($40 million). A further $20 million investment in Selmer will increase production capacity. ABB opened a new $4 million Regional Distribution Center in Dallas, Texas in August 2025 and invested $4 million in several service facilities to enhance customer support this year.

The revenue of ABB in the US was close to $9 billion in 2024, accounting for ~27% of the ABB Group total. With approximately 17,000 people across the US, ABB has nearly 40 manufacturing, distribution, and operational facilities across 20 states, including nine major R&D centers. ABB has a presence in all 50 states. Today, approximately 75-80% of the revenues ABB generates in the US are from products manufactured in the US.",https://resources.news.e.abb.com/images/2025/9/14/1/Senatobia-large.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 10:06:37.097861

And it wasn’t a welcome surprise, industry insiders and experts say.

“I think we maintained some hope that they wouldn’t go this far because we had advocated to the EPA that they shouldn’t do that,” said one industry lobbyist granted anonymity to discuss the proposed rule freely.

EPA’s proposal would relieve major emitters in most industrial sectors from the duty to report annual emissions above a certain threshold. The reporting program, which has existed since 2009, feeds into EPA’s comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory.

The agency was widely expected to leave the oil and gas industry out of the proposal. Greenhouse gas reporting for oil and gas producers, processors and operators — which falls under the program’s “Subpart W” — is mandated under the 2022 climate law.

The oil and gas industry has sought modifications to the Biden-era rules for that reporting, but no major trade associations have asked EPA to end it. The Trump EPA was expected to propose different —and likely more industry-friendly — reporting methodologies for oil and gas next summer.

Instead, EPA unexpectedly proposed shelving annual emissions reporting for oil and gas until 2034.

The agency is claiming that a provision in the Republican megalaw that suspended a related fee on methane emissions until 2034 also empowers the administration to mothball emissions reporting until the same year. That assertion is controversial and likely to be litigated if the rule is finalized in its current form.

Oil and gas experts say that the loss of EPA’s reporting program could present problems — especially for companies hoping to sell their gas in the European Union.

EU complications

Starting in January 2027, E.U. gas importers will have to prove the supply they sell on the European market meets the bloc’s standards for monitoring, reporting and verification of methane leakage. Companies can show compliance with those standards at the corporate level, or exporting nations can secure an “equivalence determination” that covers all their producers.

The E.U. has never agreed to deem that all U.S. producers meet that “equivalency” threshold, even during the Biden era when the sector was covered by methane regulations and a fee on excess methane leakage.

The Biden administration tried to negotiate that, noted Fred Hutchison, president and CEO of LNG Allies, which promotes U.S. gas exports.

“They didn’t say yes, didn’t say no — it was right around the time of the election, and I think they wanted to see where the leaves fell off the trees,” he said. But with the greenhouse gas reporting program, along with state regulations, industry practices and outside certification programs, “it was sort of judged that you could patch together a reasonable case on country level equivalency.”

Now, those Biden-era methane controls are either gone or in the process of being rolled back. Meanwhile, the E.U. and authorities in its member states who will implement the new methane limits have been vague about their criteria for determining national “equivalence” or corporate compliance with the standards. Those policies may not be filled in until next year, and U.S. gas exporters — who supply about 45 percent of E.U.’s liquefied natural gas imports — are staring down possible restrictions beginning in 16 months’ time.

EPA’s proposal to stop reporting and data collection for oil and gas emissions can only make that more likely, experts say, because companies expected to be able to use that emissions database to demonstrate compliance.

“This completely shoots a hole in anyone who would be advocating for there to be equivalent before the Europeans,” said the oil and gas lobbyist.

To prove compliance with the E.U. policy, a company’s emissions data must be verified by a qualified third party. The loss of EPA’s database would likely prompt industry to look for certification elsewhere, experts said, not only to access European and other global markets, but to attract climate-conscious purchasers within the United States.

Bob Stout, senior adviser to the Natural Gas Innovation Network, said the industry could partner with energy experts in academia to create a high-quality voluntary database.

“If we don’t have a mandatory framework like Subpart W here, having those different credible and trusted stakeholders come together to say, ‘OK, here are the data. Here’s how we’re accounting for it,’ is going to be critical for its credibility internationally,” he said. “It’s in our interest even from a pure energy standpoint, setting aside the climate change concerns. We want a credible accounting system so that we can demonstrate the emissions characteristics of the gas that we’re selling around the world.”

Getting ahead of the curve

The E.U. methane requirements are set to take effect in the midst of a broader upheaval in global trade wrought by Trump’s tariff policies. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum spent last week in Europe pressing the European Commission and member countries to loosen methane regulations to ease the flow of U.S. gas onto the market.

“In this environment, where there’s further definition to be made regarding those rules, the U.S. government is pressuring various individual countries and the E.U. to relax or scrap them,” said Christopher Goncalves, chair of the energy and climate practice at consulting firm BRG.

“I just note — or observe — the synchronicity between this decision about the Subpart W data and the effort to get the Europeans to relax the requirements,” he added. “It’s sort of like saying, ‘We’re not going to be collecting this data anymore, and you shouldn’t be either.’”

Hutchison of LNG Allies said the only workable solution for U.S. producers and exporters would be for the E.U. to substantially amend its methane legislation.

“They simply did not take account of the complexity of our system and the enormous co-mingling and practical intraceability of our pathways,” he said.

E.U. gas importers are primarily responsible for demonstrating compliance with the standards, and they don’t produce the gas and may not have good information about its methane intensity.

Ben Cahill, an analyst at the University of Texas, Austin, said that was a complicating factor, and industry is seeking clarity from the European Commission and national-level authorities about how the standards would be implemented. But he said the the restrictions are unlikely to simply go away.

“It’s a law,” he said. “I mean, it’s legislation that’s been passed in the European Union. So, the question is: How can it be implemented in a practical way, so that it’s actually achievable for the industry to do what the European Commission wants? And I still believe it’s possible, but it’s going to require some clarity and simplification.”

EPA said last week that doing away with the greenhouse gas reporting rule would save the oil and gas industry $2.4 billion in compliance costs.

But Goncalves of BRG said removing the regulatory requirement wouldn’t prevent many oil and gas companies from devoting resources to finding and fixing leaks and tracking their emissions.

“Companies have been eager to get ahead of the curve to comply with European requirements, anticipate Asian requirements, and pursue [environmental, social and governance] and other things that the administration doesn’t like, but they’ve done it for a variety of reasons having to do with long-term thinking,” he said.

“They might stop doing it, but I think the people who have already committed and developed it as a commercial differentiator and corporate differentiator are likely to continue doing that,” he said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/76/a6/01bbb87949fc8338a40de1f1d04a/texas-daily-life-45343.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 08:58:46.663119

The following month, OPEC announced it would increase production at a time when oil prices were already at a four-year low, taking industry analysts by surprise.
Oil prices would spike tremendously.
And while they did surge, they came right back down.” Trump’s tariffs haven’t helped the U.S. fossil fuel industry either.
“There is some expectation that oil prices could be lower for an extended period of time.”","When President Donald Trump took office, he promised to “unleash American energy” — and quickly left no doubt that he meant fossil fuel energy in particular.

In the months since, he has opened up vast stretches of public lands and U.S. oceans for drilling and reduced the royalty rates that companies must pay for extracting oil and gas in those areas. His administration has also proposed scrapping environmental rules requiring polluters to report their emissions to the EPA, easing regulations for oil and gas wastewater disposal, and rewriting rules to weaken risk management protocols at refineries. And by declaring a national energy emergency, Trump has cleared the way for faster permitting primarily for fossil fuel infrastructure, bringing down review timelines from multiple years to a few weeks. Trump’s signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Act, quietly included billions of dollars in new federal tax breaks available to fossil fuel companies. More substantially, it dramatically scaled back federal support for wind and solar energy, as well as electric vehicles — effectively dealing a blow to the newer technologies competing with oil and gas interests.

But the boom times Trump has promised U.S. fossil fuel producers have not materialized. In fact, the industry is headed in the opposite direction: In recent months, Chevron said it would cut as much as one-fifth of its workforce, ConocoPhillips announced plans to let go of up to a quarter of its workforce by the end of the year, and Halliburton began its own round of layoffs. Across the sector, companies have also been reining in spending, cutting capital expenditures, pausing or cancelling major projects, and reducing rig counts.

“We believe we are at a tipping point for U.S. oil production at current commodity prices,” warned Travis Stice, CEO of Diamondback Energy, a Texas-based oil and gas company, in May. “Today’s prices, volatility, and macroeconomic uncertainty have put [the industry’s] progress in jeopardy.”

Since Trump’s inauguration in January, crude oil prices have dropped nearly 20 percent. That’s left prices below the roughly $65-per-barrel level where most U.S. producers can expect to break even on drilling, and they’re cutting back in anticipation of these unprofitable extraction conditions lasting into 2026. Indeed, the Energy Information Agency projects that oil prices, which currently sit at about $62 per barrel, will drop to $51 per barrel next year.

This reflects the makeup of the global oil market, which President Trump has far less control over compared to the domestic regulations he’s attacked. In Saudi Arabia, for instance, where drilling costs are among the lowest in the world, a barrel of oil costs at most $10 to extract. So when the global price of oil drops, as it has this year, American producers feel the squeeze — but national oil companies in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, continue to be profitable.

So even though President Trump has called for more drilling to lower domestic gasoline prices, American companies see little reason to pump more oil when prices are below the break-even point. The result reveals a paradox in the administration’s pursuit of what it calls “energy dominance”: It wants both lower prices and more drilling, but the former automatically discourages the latter.

“The goal of energy dominance is perhaps not fully aligned with the goal of low oil prices without significant innovation,” said Susan Bell, a senior vice president at Rystad Energy, an independent research firm, in an emailed statement. “Increasing U.S. production in a world that is oversupplied with oil in the near term would certainly drive prices down, ultimately making investment in the sector uneconomic.”

That disconnect has been on full display this year. Even as Trump promised boom times for the oil and gas industry, he has called on OPEC to increase production as a means to fulfill his promise to lower gasoline prices for Americans. In a January speech, he told OPEC to “bring down the oil price,” and in March he said that it was “very important that OPEC increase the flow of oil” in a social media post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

The following month, OPEC announced it would increase production at a time when oil prices were already at a four-year low, taking industry analysts by surprise. While the move may have been an attempt to appease Trump, it was also an opportunity to assert dominance over American companies and increase the cartel’s market share. The increased production also acts as a buffer against price volatility by creating oversupply that can be tapped in times of crisis. There has been no shortage of the latter in recent years, with escalating conflict in the Middle East and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

“All this extra supply creates a cushion,” said Trey Cowan, an oil and gas analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which tracks the rise of renewable energy and its impact on fossil fuels. “Events like the hunting down of people in Qatar by Israel — normally, that would be a crisis situation. Oil prices would spike tremendously. And while they did surge, they came right back down.”

Trump’s tariffs haven’t helped the U.S. fossil fuel industry either. His surcharges on steel and aluminum, two metals ubiquitously used in oil and gas infrastructure, have increased the cost of production. “The cost of our largest drilling input cost, casing, has increased over 10 percent in the last quarter due to steel tariffs,” Stice, the Diamondback Energy CEO, noted in his letter to shareholders.

Cowan said that, while oil prices rise and fall periodically, the industry is facing a highly volatile market at a time when gasoline demand is poised to take a hit from the growing adoption of electric vehicles. In its drive to find new markets, the industry invested heavily in refineries producing plastics. But there, too, the industry is now facing oversupply and slim profit margins.

“You’re running out of places to use the oil, so then you’re creating an oversupply condition that’s going to continue for a longer period of time,” said Cowan. “There is some expectation that oil prices could be lower for an extended period of time.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1351214628-e1757961534986.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-16 10:06:32.302966

India’s coal problem is not scarcity but sustainability.","India’s energy transition is among the government’s most pressing policy priorities. The country is the world’s third-largest consumer of energy, yet coal continues to dominate—accounting for 70% of electricity generation and more than half of the overall energy mix. Ambitious renewable targets have been set, but coal remains the weak link in the shift to clean power.

To address this, the government is preparing a national carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) initiative, offering financial support of 50% to full project funding in some cases. The plan is to embed CCUS in coal-fired power generation and coal gasification projects, thereby reducing the environmental cost of continued coal use. CCUS works by capturing carbon dioxide from industrial processes or at the point of emission, and then storing it underground.

READ | Data centre future hinges on policy stability, not tax breaks

Beyond technical risk, CCUS raises concerns about how local communities will be affected. Global environmental justice literature warns that CCS/CCUS projects risk exacerbating pollution burdens in already overburdened or vulnerable regions if siting, health impact, and land use are not managed with transparency and strong safeguards. This includes needing public consultation, securing “free, prior, and informed consent”, ensuring community health monitoring, and establishing strict liability regimes in case of leaks or contamination. Without those, public trust may falter, and regulatory backlash may delay deployment.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) calls CCUS indispensable for net-zero pathways, especially in hard-to-abate sectors like cement, steel, and chemicals. For India, the technology could ease reliance on imported natural gas by supporting coal-to-gas projects. If deployed effectively, CCUS could cut gas imports nearly by half, strengthening energy security while renewables scale up.

Costs and Risks

Still, CCUS is no silver bullet. Globally, projects have faced high costs, technical obstacles, and doubts over the long-term safety of underground storage. The economics are daunting: experts estimate the cost of capturing one tonne of carbon dioxide at $40–120, depending on the sector. For coal-fired plants in India, the additional burden could raise tariffs sharply unless government subsidies cover much of the expense.

Beyond economics, storage risks loom large. Leakage could undo climate gains, damage ecosystems, and erode public trust. Without robust regulation, CCUS could add more uncertainty than relief.

India’s coal production crossed one billion tonnes for the first time in March 2025, underlining the sector’s centrality to energy security. Policymakers expect coal to remain dominant at least until 2047, when India hopes to mark its centenary as a developed nation. The real challenge, then, is not abandoning coal but using it more sustainably without compromising climate commitments.

Any CCUS deployment at scale will need far more than government grants or subsidies. According to an OECD handbook on CCUS policies and business models, successful frameworks couple policy certainty (tax incentives, carbon pricing, guaranteed off-take) with private capital mobilisation via risk-sharing mechanisms, loan guarantees, and public-private partnerships.

Reports such as “Unlocking Private Capital for Carbon Capture and Storage in Industry and Power” emphasise that projects become more bankable when cost-recovery is assured through regulated tariffs or long-term contracts—with clarity on liability, transport, storage risks, and carbon credit regimes.

Global Lessons

International experience offers both guidance and warning. Norway’s Sleipner project, launched in 1996, has successfully stored carbon dioxide beneath the North Sea, underpinned by strict monitoring and regulation. The US has expanded CCUS rapidly through the Inflation Reduction Act, which raised tax credits to $85 per tonne of stored carbon.

By contrast, Canada’s Boundary Dam project has struggled with costs and technical snags, while Australia’s pilot projects drew criticism for poor oversight and unfulfilled promises. The lesson is that success depends as much on regulatory design and institutional capacity as on technology itself.

Internationally, the trend is shifting toward CCUS hubs—clusters where capture, transport, and storage infrastructure is shared across multiple industries—which deliver cost efficiencies in scale, infrastructure, pipeline networks, and storage facilities. According to the Global CCS Institute and others, investment in CCUS is growing rapidly: in 2022, global investment almost tripled to USD 6.4 billion, with planned capacity more than doubling. For India, planning CCUS hubs in coal regions, industrial corridors or near large emitters could lower per-unit costs and foster institutional efficiencies.

India’s Path Ahead

For India, the risks are amplified by weak institutional capacity. Unlike Norway or the US, it lacks a mature framework for geological monitoring, liability transfer, and long-term regulatory oversight. Building this institutional scaffolding will be as important as building physical projects.

CCUS should therefore be seen as a transitional tool, not an excuse to expand coal indefinitely. Its value lies in buying time while renewables and green hydrogen ecosystems mature. Integrating CCUS with gasification, hydrogen production, and underground coal mining could also reduce pressure on new greenfield projects, limiting environmental disruption.

India’s coal problem is not scarcity but sustainability. With the world’s fifth-largest reserves, it cannot phase out coal overnight.

The country’s total energy-related CO₂ emissions fell by 20% during this period while population grew by 14%, resulting in a 30% drop in per capita emissions.

It was reported that CO₂ emissions nationwide have primarily decreased due to a reduction in coal consumption within the electric power sector.

This decline was due to electricity generation from natural gas, which emits approximately half the CO₂ per unit of energy compared to coal, as well as from renewable sources such as wind and solar.

EIA’s ‘Short-Term Energy Outlook’ anticipates a 1% rise in US total CO₂ emissions in 2025, partly due to higher fossil-fuel use for crude oil production and electricity generation growth.

Maryland recorded the largest decline in per capita emissions, down by 49% between 2005 and 2023.

The state’s total CO₂ emissions dropped by 43% while its population grew by 11%.

Maryland also achieved the lowest per capita CO₂ emissions among states in 2023, at 7.8 tonnes, the second lowest level on record since 1960.

In the state, coal and natural gas made up 56% and 4%, respectively, for electricity generation in 2005.

By 2023, the mix had shifted to 5% coal and 41% natural gas, with new solar and wind generation contributing to a 74% cut in the state’s power sector-related CO₂ emissions.

In 2023, the transportation sector was the leading source of CO₂ emissions in almost all states along the east and west coasts of the contiguous US. These states typically have higher population densities and increased road and air travel.

Many of these coastal states have ceased using coal for electricity generation, leading to a reduction in CO₂ emissions since 2005.

In 2023, the electric power sector was the leading source of CO₂ emissions in 18 states.

Many states, including Pennsylvania, Alabama, and Wyoming, act as net electricity suppliers to neighbouring regions. A significant portion of their electricity production is derived from coal.

The industrial sector was the top emitter in four states, comprising Texas, Louisiana, and Alaska, where oil, gas, and refining dominate and in Iowa, where agriculture and biofuels contribute significantly.

The DSGS program The DSGS program was established in the wake of its blackout and near-blackout grid events in 2020 and 2022.
The DSGS program includes one of the largest VPPs in the world, with more than 200 MW in capacity, according to the California Energy Commission.
The Brattle report also said the DSGS program could provide up to $206 million in net cost savings to all Californians.
Additionally, every dollar put into the DSGS program results in up to two dollars in customer rate reduction, according to CSSA.","California’s legislature and Gov. Newsom chose not to renew funding for its grid reliability and premier virtual power plant (VPP) program.

The decision risks ending the program altogether, according to Advanced Energy United, and may mean losing more than $200 million in energy cost savings for Californians and extending the state’s dependence on peaker plants to meet emergency power needs.

Though the Demand-Side, Grid-Support (DSGS) program is not a save-all solution, the program helps deliver reliability during heatwaves and other high-demand grid emergencies by coordinating clean distributed-energy resources, such as batteries, solar and smart thermostats. This enables utilities to use existing resources at their disposal, and in turn helps avoid resorting to building new infrastructure.

Advocates previously hoped lawmakers would enable the DSGS program to expand by boosting its funding. But the program’s funding was whittled down throughout the budget’s drafts until the boost eventually became a cut to the tune of $18 million. The DSGS program is funded through California’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

When Gov. Gavin Newsom approved the budget, he deferred decisions on most Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund investments until later in the year. Lawmakers also deferred decisions on the Distributed Electricity Backup Assets (DEBA) program, which funds new distributed batteries and microgrids.

However, after deciding not to renew the DSGS program’s funding, Advanced Energy United said the program will run out of funding by the end of the year, rendering it unable to operate in 2026.

“Cutting DSGS is a huge missed opportunity and a major step backwards on enabling a more flexible, resilient, and affordable energy future,” said Leah Rubin Shen, managing director at Advanced Energy United in a statement. “This program is a proven success in keeping the lights on while saving ratepayers money.”

“Allowing it to disappear undermines progress on affordability and discourages further clean energy investments in California,” Rubin Shen said.

Last month a coalition led by Advanced Energy United sent a letter to Newsom urging the governor to fund the program. The coalition said the DSGS program needed at least $75 million to remain operative in 2026. The coalition said the $50 million allocated to DEBA through Proposition 4 must be appropriated this year for DEBA to get off the ground.

“Defunding or delaying either program at this crucial juncture would not only undermine affordability and reliability, but also damage California’s credibility as a reliable partner for the businesses driving clean energy forward at a time when we should be leveraging their innovation and investment,” the coalition said.

The DSGS program

The DSGS program was established in the wake of its blackout and near-blackout grid events in 2020 and 2022.

California has managed to avoid similar grid emergencies since then despite rising electric demand. During the summer of 2024, the California Energy Commission said the DSDG program helped stabilize California’s grid during four separate heatwaves. The VPP part of the program was called upon 16 times during summer 2024, and its non-combustion demand-response option activated one time.

As part of California’s Strategic Reliability Reserve, the DSGS program provides incentives for residents to reduce electricity usage or to send energy to the grid during periods of high electric demand. This compensation rate is less than the cost of new incremental resource adequacy capacity costs, which have been exponentially increasing over the past several years, according to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

The DSGS program leverages different resources to manage demand, offering four different enrollment options:

Option 1: Emergency Dispatch

Option 2: Market-Integrated Demand Response Incremental Capacity Pilot

Option 3: Market-Aware Storage Virtual Power Plant Pilot

Option 4: Emergency Load Flexibility Virtual Power Plant Pilot

The emergency dispatch option pays participants $2 for each kWh of incremental load reduction from their typical energy usage during DSGS dispatch events.

The DSGS program includes one of the largest VPPs in the world, with more than 200 MW in capacity, according to the California Energy Commission. Since its launch, the program has enrolled 720 MW of customer battery capacity, according to the California Solar Storage Association (CSSA).

The program’s battery VPP option could grow to 1,300 MW in the next three years if the program is funded and able to continue, according to a Brattle Group report commissioned by Sunrun and Tesla Energy, both of which are DSGS participants.

The Brattle report also said the DSGS program could provide up to $206 million in net cost savings to all Californians. Additionally, every dollar put into the DSGS program results in up to two dollars in customer rate reduction, according to CSSA.

A path forward

Edward Cazalet, CEO of TeMix and a former governor of California’s grid operator CAISO, helped show five years ago that dynamic pricing that incorporates several cost components can work on a single distribution circuit.

Cazalet, who participates in the Tesla VPP program, told pv magazine USA the VPP program would do a better job it had dynamic rates instead of its current time-of-use rates, “because then it would focus the charging at even lower prices and focus the discharging at even higher prices, particularly when the grid is stressed.”

With dynamic pricing in place, Cazalet said there’d be no benefits to the VPP programs. “What the VPP programs do is they take tax money and distribute it to customers, aggregators and VPP program monitors, and enrich them with very little benefit, if any, to the system.”

Last week, the California Public Utilities Commission ordered the state’s three major electric utilities to develop and offer to all customer classes demand flexibility rates. The order specifies that the prices must change at least hourly in response to the changing wholesale electricity cost and other factors.

The new rates are expected to reduce solar curtailment because when solar generation is high, wholesale electricity costs are lower. Customers who choose flexible rates will be able to shift some of their consumption to lower-cost hours when the sun is shining.

Even so, not all is lost for California’s VPPs.

California passed two VPP bills earlier this month that streamline how utilities use distributed energy resources (DERs) and implement VPP programs. The bills currently await Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature.

Since lawmakers did not act on the DSGS program during this year’s session, Advanced Energy United said “the pressure is now on for the next session to produce meaningful results and close the policy gaps necessary to keep energy affordable and flexible enough to meet future needs.”

“Policymakers must act quickly in 2026 to keep DSGS alive and ensure affordable, reliable power for years to come,” Rubin Shen said.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/47998131737_80e4e0e534_k-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 10:06:15.681269

Early Winners Not all carbon capture projects are created equal.
Europe, China and other regions are rolling out their own carbon capture incentives, creating both pressure and opportunity for US companies to lead.","Carbon capture is gaining momentum in the US as expanded tax credits and new legislation improve project economics and attract investment. A growing pipeline of projects and early industry partnerships signal potential for scale. Still, questions around permitting, policy durability and financing highlight the uncertainties that will shape how far and how fast the sector develops.

When the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) became law on Aug. 16, 2022, it gave carbon capture a powerful boost. The act raised the federal tax credit for projects that capture and store carbon dioxide from $50 to $85 per ton, and to $60 for CO2 used in enhanced oil recovery or industrial processes. That shift under Section 45Q of the tax code suddenly made carbon capture and storage (CCS) a much stronger business proposition.

Even before the increase, the incentive was enough to get certain projects off the ground. A North Dakota ethanol plant, Red Trail Energy, used the $50 credit to capture and store its emissions while also selling low-carbon ethanol into premium markets. But with the credit now set at $85/ton — a 70% jump — the economics have improved dramatically. Deloitte’s carbon capture specialist, Jeremy DuMuth, noted that before the IRA, fewer than half of the US projects he reviewed made financial sense. Afterward, every one of them did.

That extra support brings the credit closer to covering the real costs of capturing CO2 in tougher industries such as cement, steel and power generation. Analysts at the Clean Air Task Force have argued that the old $50 rate seriously undervalued the cost of capture, transport and storage for these sectors.

And there’s more change ahead. The newly passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) keeps Section 45Q in place but expands its reach, opening the door for projects that use captured carbon in oil recovery and other commercial applications.

In essence, the government is now covering such a large portion of project cost that it’s been likened to Uncle Sam financing about 30% of a project’s equity — a powerful incentive luring many new players into the game. It’s no surprise, then, that proponents describe 45Q as the “foundational market driver” for scaling up carbon management in the US. With a reliable $85/ton revenue stream locked in for 12 years per project, carbon capture has turned into a bankable business model rather than just a climate experiment.

Momentum and Investor Interest Surges

Carbon capture has been riding a wave of new investment since the IRA expanded the 45Q credit in 2022. Within a year, the US project pipeline nearly doubled — from 81 prospective facilities in late 2022 to 154 by the end of 2023, according to E&E News. Today, more than 270 carbon capture and removal projects have been announced nationwide, and over 190 of those came after the IRA’s passage. The floodgates aren’t fully open yet, but capital is pouring in as investors see real potential in turning emissions reduction into profit.

That enthusiasm spans the spectrum, from venture capital and private equity to industrial players and oil and gas majors. Tens of billions of dollars are funneling into energy transition technologies, with CCS climbing near the top of the list. Corporations are moving quickly to stake their ground in what looks like a growth sector.

Exxon Mobil, for example, created a Low Carbon Solutions division and last year bought Denbury for $4.9 billion, gaining control of the largest CO2 pipeline network along the Gulf Coast and multiple storage sites. The company described the purchase as a way to accelerate its energy transition strategy and offer CO2 transport and storage services to heavy emitters.

Partnerships are also multiplying. Midstream operators and industrial emitters are joining forces to capture and store carbon at scale. One prominent deal paired Exxon with CF Industries, a leading fertilizer producer, and EnLink Midstream to capture up to 2 million tons per year of CO2 from CF’s Louisiana ammonia plant. The CO2 will be stored in geological formations beneath Exxon’s property, with the project expected to generate about $170 million annually in tax credits at the $85/ton rate. Industry watchers say this is likely the first of many such arrangements.

Early Winners

Not all carbon capture projects are created equal. Some are advancing more quickly because their economics are stronger and the technology is ready to go. The most approachable opportunities tend to come from industries in which CO2 is easier and cheaper to capture, or where there are extra revenue streams to sweeten the deal.

Natural gas processing plants and fertilizer producers have been among the first movers, since in both sectors CO2 streams can be captured at relatively low cost. Ethanol plants have also proved attractive, thanks to their pure CO2 emissions from fermentation. Two US ethanol facilities — including Red Trail Energy in North Dakota — are already capturing and storing carbon, supported by 45Q credits and the ability to sell ethanol into low-carbon fuel markets.

Another promising model is the creation of carbon capture hubs in petrochemical and refining regions, such as the Houston Ship Channel or Louisiana’s industrial corridor. These hubs allow multiple emitters — from refineries to cement plants — to connect into shared pipelines and storage infrastructure, spreading costs and accelerating deployment.

Power generation is beginning to see movement as well. While capturing CO2 from coal and natural gas plants has long been seen as too expensive, the richer incentives are starting to close the gap. While the Petra Nova project in Texas remains the only US power-plant CCS facility in operation, it may soon have company.

Perhaps the boldest frontier is direct air capture (DAC), which removes CO2 directly from the atmosphere. Here, the IRA’s boost to $180/ton in federal credits is catalyzing projects once considered out of reach. Occidental Petroleum, for instance, has begun building a large-scale DAC facility in Texas designed to pull half a million tons of CO2 from the air each year and has announced plans for dozens more plants. Other companies — including Climeworks, CarbonCapture and Global Thermostat — are also raising capital and siting projects, encouraged by both federal support and private investment.

Taken together, these early wins show how policy incentives are creating the conditions for first movers to act. From industrial emitters to next-generation carbon removal, the projects advancing today could set the stage for carbon capture to scale at a pace once thought impossible.

Challenges and the Road Ahead

For all the optimism around carbon capture, building and operating these projects is no easy task. Each facility requires multiple moving parts — capture systems, compressors, pipelines, injection wells and long-term monitoring — which adds years to development timelines and layers of regulation.

Permitting is often the biggest bottleneck. Outside of a few states like North Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana and West Virginia, developers must rely on the Environmental Protection Agency to approve CO2 storage wells, a process that can take years and involve tens of thousands of pages of documentation. Large multistate pipeline projects have also faced local pushback and lengthy reviews, slowing their progress.

Policy durability is another concern. The 45Q credit is only valuable if the incentive remains in place politically. While the current support is strong and bipartisan, investors remember that shifting administrations could always change course.

To ease this risk, the IRA introduced transferability and direct pay options so that companies without big tax bills can still realize the credit’s value quickly, improving cash flow. More recently, the OBBBA strengthened 45Q further, restoring full transferability and adjusting for inflation, a sign lawmakers recognize the need for stability, even as rising costs erode the credit’s buying power.

The economics, while improved, still demand heavy upfront investment. Developers often rely on government grants or low-interest loans to derisk early projects, pairing public dollars with private capital. That combination is helping to push projects forward, but scaling the industry to the level needed for climate goals will take far more. The US Department of Energy estimates that reaching net zero by 2050 could require an eighteenfold to eightyfold increase in US carbon capture capacity, hundreds of new projects beyond what exists today.

Global competition is also intensifying. Europe, China and other regions are rolling out their own carbon capture incentives, creating both pressure and opportunity for US companies to lead. With 19 commercial CCS facilities already operating and more in the pipeline than anywhere else, the US holds a head start. Keeping it will depend on sustained policy support, faster permitting and the ability to finance projects at scale.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2fba42d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x2722+0+50/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F31%2F62%2F66a8a6ef4db895378c752a29f71d%2Fss-2155955325.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 06:57:47.016257

Solar Evangelists Are Hard at ...,"Liuan Huska, Aman Azhar",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16092025/faith-groups-celebrate-solar-energy/,"When Solar Faithful launched projects in early 2023, its leaders estimated that around 30 of the nearly 10,000 houses of worship in Michigan used solar panels.
After nearly three years of work, the nonprofit estimates about 70 of the state’s religious buildings have solar panels.
This Sunday, faith groups like Solar Faithful are promoting solar energy through a nationwide event called Sun Day.
During a webinar this summer, he described solar energy as an accessible and affordable source.
“If faith communities came together,” he said, “we could really see impacts in our world.” Solar Faithful’s Mulder considers faith communities a “sleeping giant” in the clean energy transition.","The connection between solar panels and his church mission wasn’t immediately obvious to Wilson Moore, deacon of New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church in Detroit. But when he was tasked to install energy-efficient renovations to the church building, Moore began to see the possibilities.

As Moore met with businesses and utilities, it became clear that installing solar would allow the church to do more of what it has always wanted to do—provide aid to its community in times of need.

The southwest neighborhood copes with nearly two dozen nearby polluting industries, including a petroleum refinery and wastewater treatment plant, and congregants experience frequent home power outages, he said.

“If you have a breathing machine, you need electricity to keep going. If you have a mobilizing chair, you need electricity to charge up. Families need a place to get cool, sit down, have a meal, and be at peace while they wait for the power to come back on,” Moore said. “It dawned on me—that’s our church.”

These services could be offered, he realized, with more reliable and economical energy within the church itself, and he began working with Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and Solar Faithful, two Michigan-based nonprofits that help houses of worship adapt to climate change.

When Solar Faithful launched projects in early 2023, its leaders estimated that around 30 of the nearly 10,000 houses of worship in Michigan used solar panels. Board member Steve Mulder said the nonprofit aims to increase that to about 350, a 3.5 percent rate on par with commercial and industrial use of solar panels. After nearly three years of work, the nonprofit estimates about 70 of the state’s religious buildings have solar panels.

Such work is getting harder as federal incentives supporting clean energy diminish under the Trump administration. But advocates are pushing to keep making inroads. This Sunday, faith groups like Solar Faithful are promoting solar energy through a nationwide event called Sun Day.

Organizers have modeled Sun Day after Earth Day, which started in 1970 and quickly became an annual staple for the environmental movement. Hundreds of events will take place around the country Sept. 21, many of them led by communities of faith. Mulder’s Solar Faithful will collaborate with other nonprofits to reference the New Mount Hermon story and hear from others at an event in Kent County in western Michigan.

Actress Antonique Smith is a Sun Day spokesperson and co-founder of Climate Revival, a nonprofit that aims to mobilize communities of faith and people of color to combat climate change. Smith sees parallels in this moment and the Civil Rights Movement, which was rooted in Black churches.

“This is such a crazy time when we’re dealing with these forces and this administration that seem insurmountable,” Smith said. “We need a higher power. We need people to have faith and hope that we can win so that they would be willing to get out there and really fight.”

For Smith, pushing for solar is the same as pushing for environmental justice. “That same pollution that is causing climate change is what’s making us sick in our neighborhoods,” said Smith, who grew up in East Orange, New Jersey, near a power plant.

She said the fumes were constant and Smith believes they harmed family members, including a sister who suffers from interstitial lung disease. “Because Black and brown communities are the ones being oppressed by the pollution—they are the sacrifice zones—they should be leading the climate movement,” Smith said. “The same way Martin Luther King and those congregations led.”

Bill McKibben, the author and environmentalist, helped launch Sun Day. During a webinar this summer, he described solar energy as an accessible and affordable source.

“Solar is no longer alternative energy,” McKibben said. “It’s one of the most obvious, straightforward and commonsense sources. It’s not the Whole Foods but the Costco of energy.”

Clear Savings

The New Mount Hermon church embarked on multiple improvements, funded through federal and state grants that Michigan Interfaith Power & Light advisors helped to navigate. In February, it installed 60 solar panels at the cost of $75,000. It has also installed three furnaces for $25,000; water heaters, $21,000; LED lighting, $28,000; energy-efficient front doors, $22,000; and new freezers, $3,500.

The church’s modest one-story brick building is now saving 30 percent in monthly energy bills and training congregants to run the church as a resilience hub to help community members during power outages and extreme weather events, Moore said. Recently, seventh-grade science classes from a nearby school visited the church to hear two young women engineers explain how the panels work and share career opportunities in the solar industry.

The school visit wasn’t anything the church planned when it first considered solar, but “it turned out to be one of the best things,” Moore said.

“It was an opportunity to show kids in the inner city that there are some things you can do that don’t require you to bounce or run a ball. The skilled trades are such a viable opportunity. You always have work, and that’s something nobody can take from you.”

Faith and Climate

Nearly 90 percent of Christian leaders believe in human-caused climate change, although religious leaders “who shape the attitudes and beliefs of their congregations” rarely discuss the issue, according to a study in PNAS, a peer-reviewed journal of the National Academy of Sciences, published this March. About half have never discussed it with their congregations, and only a quarter have “mentioned it more than once or twice,” the study found.

Sun Day could be a way to change that, according to its organizers. “Sun Day represents an opportunity for faith communities to stand up and make it clear that people are concerned,” said the Rev. Fletcher Harper, founder of the international nonprofit GreenFaith, a lead partner for Sun Day.

Support for solar and wind has declined since 2020 and the drop is largely driven by partisan politics, according to ongoing Pew Research Center studies. A Pew study from 2022 found “highly religious Americans are more inclined than others to identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, and Republicans tend to be much less likely than Democrats to believe that human activity (such as burning fossil fuels) is warming the Earth or to consider climate change a serious problem.”

The study found that evangelical Christians show the least concern (34 percent) for climate change while non-Christian people of faith and Black Protestants show the most concern (72 percent and 68 percent).

But even in places like the Bible Belt, congregational interest in solar panels rises when financial incentives are offered, one nonprofit has found.

The environmental nonprofit Georgia Interfaith Power & Light (GIPL) tracked a 50 percent increase in solar installations in the state from 2023 to 2025, all related to Inflation Reduction Act incentives from the Biden administration.

The Trump administration’s withdrawal of support for clean energy is “disheartening,” said the Rev. Jay Horton, GIPL’s communications manager. Georgia residents have experienced six electricity bill hikes since 2023 with an average $43 total increase on monthly bills, and installing solar is a way to cut costs and build resilience, Horton said.

GIPL has tracked 33 completed solar installations on houses of worship in the last decade, with another seven on track to finish by the year’s end. With roughly 15,000 houses of worship in the state, the solar adoption rate is infinitesimal: 0.003 percent. Horton sees the huge gap as an opportunity.

“If faith communities came together,” he said, “we could really see impacts in our world.”

Solar Faithful’s Mulder considers faith communities a “sleeping giant” in the clean energy transition. While the Biden-era IRA was a “huge shot in the arm” for the transition, Mulder thinks it also caused people to rely on the government.

Now, he said, people are realizing, “if we want to change this, we’ve got to do it ourselves.”

Sunny Celebrations

Events celebrating solar energy on Sept. 21 will reflect faith communities’ interests and culture.

In Chicago, members of houses of worship including the Unitarian Church of Evanston and the Jewish Reconstructionist Congregation will join nonprofits, universities, justice organizations and solar installers for a Solar Fest at Montrose Beach. In Secaucus, New Jersey, members of Episcopal Church of Our Saviour will don snorkel masks, flippers and floaties to show what would happen if climate-driven sea-level rise submerged their town.

Niles Discovery Church, in the United Church of Christ denomination, in Fremont, California, will sponsor an EV car show.

Rabbi Nina Beth Cardin in Baltimore is encouraging Jewish communities to celebrate Sun Day in tandem with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, on Sept. 22, by assembling a special seder plate of symbolic foods celebrating hope, renewal and the light of the sun.

Climate Revival’s Smith will sing in a Sun Day Festival in New York City, featuring McKibben, journalist Kai Wright and others.

“Climate has seemed a lot like a rich white people thing,” Smith said, noting that there was a time when solar panels were out of reach for most Black communities.

“Over time what I have seen is that our communities have not been approached enough to understand their part,” Smith added. “At this point, what’s so beautiful is that because of time and technology, the prices are much lower and solar is attainable for more people. It’s for everybody.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/New-Mount-Hermon-Solar-1024x732.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 05:59:01.148123

Advocacy groups and some state agencies are increasing their efforts to address the resulting gap.

In North Carolina, federal cutbacks have impacted agencies like the EPA and NOAA.

With the Trump administration moving quickly to water down or even dismantle much of the country's environmental infrastructure, from regulations to financial support for science, advocates for issues ranging from clean energy and healthy living to environmental justice and habitat protection are moving to fill the void.

While these groups individually don't have the public megaphone and reach of federal agencies like the Enivronmental Protection Agency and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the hope is they can collectively keep the conversation going and step into the breach formerly filled by government-led groups and initiatives.

Still, the scale and speed of the federal government's retreat from environmental and health issues has been breathtaking. Moves by the Trump administration in North Carolina include plans to dissolve the EPA's Office of Research and Development in the Research Triangle Park near Raleigh and significant cutbacks to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information campus in Asheville. The downsizing and financial cutbacks to the Federal Emergency Management Agency also has raised concerns about states' abilities to plan for and recover from natural disasters, including last year's Tropical Storm Helene that pounded Western North Carolina. Federal support for research at many N.C. universities, including the University of North Carolina Wilmington and Duke University, also have taken significant hits.

States run by Republicans also are moving to rein in environmental and health mandates, with Florida notably announcing in early September that it would end school vaccine requirements. In the Tar Heel State, the GOP-dominated General Assembly also has made some moves to backtrack on environmental commitments and policies championed by previous administrations in Raleigh. That includes a recent override of a veto by Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, that will see North Carolina retreat from aggressive carbon-reduction goals in the energy sector hashed out by former Gov. Roy Cooper, Republican lawmakers and Duke Energy back in 2021.

In response to all these changes, many groups and Democratic administrations have stepped up their environmental outreach and educational efforts − even as they deal with often substantial federal funding cuts. In North Carolina, that list includes the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Duke University, and the N.C. State Climate Office.

Transform understanding into action

One environmental group that has recently stepped up its outreach efforts is Charlotte-based CleanAIRE NC, which pushes for healthy communities by advocating for cleaner air and environmental justice.

The nonprofit has launched CleanAIRE Academy, an online interactive learning tool designed to help N.C. residents educate themselves about air quality and other environmental issues, something that's often invisible but can have tremendous health impacts. Topics that are covered by the self-paced seminars include the permitting process, understanding federal and state regulations, and how to effectively advocate for healthier communities.

According to the state's environmental agency, the two biggest air quality problems in North Carolina are ozone and particle pollution, with both pollutants primarily caused by vehicle emissions. Sustained exposure to a polluting source, say a factory smokestack, also can cause numerous health issues and irritate the lungs and respiratory system.

According to the American Lung Association's latest ""State of the Air"" report, North Carolina's ozone pollution isn't that bad, although Mecklenburg County is an outlier. But the state's particle pollution is a concern, with Mecklenburg and Davidson counties receiving a failing grade.

In a release, CleanAIRE said recent changes have raised questions about North Carolina's readiness to handle potential future environmental and climate challenges. Political and legal changes also have left communities and individuals short of resources and access to science and expert-driven analysis even if they wanted to advocate for change. In an example that hits close to home for CleanAIRE, the group in March lost a $500,000 EPA grant to test air quality in lower-income communities in and around Charlotte. The nonprofit has joined other environmental groups in suing the Trump administration to get the funding restored.

Rafi Vaca, the group's education manager, said while the genesis of the academy program started 18 months ago after officials saw public interest in environmental issues spike during the Covid lockdown, it has taken on a new urgency with recent actions in Washington. This summer CleanAIRE also launched the ""AirKeeper Dashboard,"" an interactive tool that displays historical and real-time air quality information for North Carolina, in response to the federal government ending much of its air quality monitoring work.

Vaca said the academy's learning modules and other programs have intentionally been made palatable and engaging to help ""demystify complex issues and inspire meaningful engagement.""

""What we're asking people to learn about can be heavy and emotive,"" she said, noting CleanAIRE is also stepping up its education and outreach efforts with its partner agencies. ""But ultimately it's important.""

“My first reaction to opening the DOE report was, ‘wow, that was like a time capsule from 25 years ago,’” Kopp said.
It cites the DOE report, though Kopp says the DOE doesn’t even say that.
“I’d say the other thing that’s different, though, is that people across the country are experiencing climate change every single day,” she said.","The “endangerment finding” is a seemingly nondescript term for what is arguably the most critical regulation in the U.S.’s climate change-fighting arsenal.

It allows the federal government, under the authority of the Clean Air Act, to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet and in turn causing climate change.

The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed it almost 20 years ago.

President Donald Trump wants to get rid of it.

And that has unleashed a flood of outrage, along with increasingly coordinated pushback, from groups of scientists, climate experts, legal entities, governments, environmental advocates and individuals.

Connecticut is in the thick of it, with its emissions levels and air quality hanging in the balance.

The endangerment finding was specifically targeted for reconsideration in the conservative government playbook Project 2025. In March, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced it was under review, denigrating endangerment as “the Holy Grail of the climate change religion.” And on July 29, EPA announced it wanted endangerment gone.

Repealing the finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,” Zeldin said.

“We will not let Trump and Zeldin do this without a fight,” said Connecticut Attorney General William Tong at the time. His office is now one of four on a leadership team, with California, New York and Massachusetts heading up a multistate pushback.

While the proposed repeal is viewed as catastrophic, what really incensed opponents and galvanized large group efforts to fight the administration was a draft climate report by the Department of Energy, conducted in secret, released simultaneously with the EPA announcement and used as justification for the repeal.

The DOE report was compiled by a working group of five known climate skeptics, if not outright deniers, handpicked by Energy Secretary Chris Wright. He has since disbanded the group in a letter that disputes the existence of climate change as “settled science.”

The report was not peer-reviewed, as is the norm with such material. It pulled information from existing research. But many scientists whose work was cited said the report cherry-picked information, then misinterpreted and lied about their findings.

Fury ensued.

Jennifer Marlon, executive director of the Yale Center for Geospatial Solutions and senior research scientist at the School of the Environment, who specializes in wildfires and climate change, is one of those whose work was cited. She said she found out through a network of friends and colleagues.

“’Hey, did you see that your paper is cited in this report that kind of says, oh, wildfires are not a problem?’” Marlon recalls hearing.

“DOE directly misinterpreted my study. They cited me and twisted my findings.”

The DOE report, she said, missed the importance of active suppression of wildfires and what it does to fuel sources. And it minimized, if not ignored, the importance of warming temperatures and changing precipitation rates. It used data known to be inaccurate.

“They omit and minimize the importance of climate change in driving uncontrollable wildfires today,” Moran said.

“I spent multiple years working to compile the data behind the article that they reference. And when you invest so much time and effort in careful scientific research, where you think about every sentence that you’re saying and you provide evidence for every claim that you make, and then you see somebody who knows nothing about wildfires whip out some sentences and make these graphs that misrepresent your data,” she said, “it made me angry and upset and motivated me to put down all my other work and say, ‘OK, I’m gonna respond to this.’”

Marlon joined a group of 85 scientists who provided what has become a massive refutation to the DOE report.

The pushback has come from the grassroots of science, but it’s also been increasingly coordinated because of the sheer volume of outrage.

“It is very unique,” Marlon said. ”It kind of comes out of the blue. It rises very quickly. It demands your full attention right now to respond quickly while you can. The Trump administration moves very, very quickly, and they always are starting fires in multiple places so that people are kind of scattered and trying to figure out, ‘how do we address the chaos that’s unfolding?’”

Science group efforts

It fell to Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist and director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M, to figure that out. He asked on social media if people like him and Marlon should have a coordinated response and, if so, who was organizing it.

“People took that to mean I was doing it. And so, ultimately, I agreed to do it,” he said.

The plan became to file a group response for both the DOE report and again with EPA on the proposed endangerment rollback. Coming in at some 460 pages — three times the length of the report — the first filing was made in time for the DOE report comment deadline on Sept. 2, which also drew a total of 59,563 written comments. The comment period for the proposed EPA rule rollback goes until Sept. 22.

“By coordinating it, we probably got more people to respond, because everyone sees everyone else doing it and a lot of people working together on sections,” said Dessler, who also said he was shocked at how many emails he got from people wanting to participate. “Also, I think it made the response better.”

He acknowledged the uniqueness of his effort.

“Yeah, it’s unique. What the government’s doing is unique. This is basically a show trial for climate science,” he said. “They picked the jury — all people that say CO2 is innocent — and then they wrote a report.”

In the end, he said, the administration will declare victory, and everybody knows that’s what’s going to happen.

“People are offended. People are doing it because they’re mad that these people are making a mockery of science,” he said. “I’ve spent my entire career doing science. I respect science. Science works.”

The comments the group submitted include experts responding to every section of the DOE report.

Among those participating was Robert Kopp, a noted climate scientist at Rutgers University whose research focuses on sea level rise, climate and their economic impacts. He also holds multiple titles on other climate endeavors and has helped author both national and international top climate reports. He co-edited the submission, co-authored the section on sea level changes, and his previous research was cited throughout.

“My first reaction to opening the DOE report was, ‘wow, that was like a time capsule from 25 years ago,’” Kopp said. “It’s the same people making essentially the same arguments for 25 years even as the evidence of climate change becomes clearer and the evidence of the damages climate change is causing become clearer.

“I feel like, as a scientist, I need to address the cherry picking and misrepresentation that DOE is putting out and that EPA is using.”

Kopp points specifically to subject matter he knows best — the claim in the EPA proposed rule that sea level rise has been minimal. It cites the DOE report, though Kopp says the DOE doesn’t even say that. It offers some contradictory minimal analysis in a couple of citings.

“I think they’ve tried to write the proposed rule such that they could give up on the science argument and still convince the Supreme Court of the validity,” he said.

Carrie Jenks, executive director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, agrees.

“Their primary proposal is to undercut the legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. They’re also proposing to attack the science, but they’re not relying on that. They don’t need to win on the science to undercut the legal authority,” Jenks said.

The goal, she said, seems to be to tie the hands of future administrations to prevent the regulation of greenhouse gases under the current Clean Air Act.

In an emailed statement, an EPA spokesperson appeared to confirm Jenks’ view.

“EPA’s proposal is legal in nature,” it read. “The Endangerment Finding is the legal prerequisite used by the Obama and Biden Administrations to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines. Absent this finding, EPA would lack statutory authority under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to prescribe standards for greenhouse gas emissions. EPA is bound by the laws established by Congress, including under the Clean Air Act. Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks.”

In an unusual move, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have undertaken what they call a fast-track review of the latest evidence for whether greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare. At the time of the announcement in early August, Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, said the review was in direct response to EPA’s proposal to rescind endangerment. The report is slated to be released Wednesday.

“Decades of climate research and data have yielded expanded understanding of how greenhouse gases affect the climate,” McNutt said in a statement at the time. “We are undertaking this fresh examination of the latest climate science in order to provide the most up-to-date assessment to policymakers and the public.”

Economists weigh in

Environmental and climate economists have also joined forces to respond to endangerment and the DOE report. So far there’s at least one group of a dozen. It includes Yale’s Ken Gillingham, senior associate dean of academic affairs. He has environmental and energy economics appointments in the environment and management schools and the economics department. He also served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration.

The group has filed objections to the DOE report, focusing on three chapters with economic assertions. Among its findings are that the economics literature used “is woefully out of date;” that it “employs an array of fallacies” in saying climate damages are small compared with other trends; it accuses the report of using “strawman scenarios and fallacious reasoning” in its cost benefit analysis; and it says the report misrepresents the effect of climate change on agriculture and on secondary issues such has death from heat stress.

Gillingham is mainly focusing on the economic reasoning in the endangerment rollback, along with numbers in the regulatory impact analysis and the proposed rule itself. The group will be filing a new document in time for the Sept. 22 deadline, and Gillingham is also working with a second group of economists that will be filing comment as well.

Gillingham is questioning the EPA’s assertions that the cost of cars will increase, the choices for cars will decrease and old polluting cars will stay on the road longer.

“It’s disingenuous to be worried about increasing car prices when implementing a massive tariff policy that’s raising car prices,” he said. “They’re clearly not worried so much about car prices. They’re just trying to destroy environmental regulations.”

What Gillingham sees at work is influential parties who stand to lose money from a decarbonized economy.

“It’s inconvenient to have climate policy — to a set of people whose fortunes depend on fossil fuels,” he said. “They are very keen to see a rollback of the endangerment finding and anything that can be done to make it very difficult to regulate greenhouse gases. That’s fundamentally what’s going on.”

Legal pushback

While scientists and economists are coalescing to push back against the double-barreled endangerment rollback, a group of more than two dozen state attorneys general and chief legal officers in several cities are also coming together, as they have frequently in Trump’s second term.

The attorneys general, including Connecticut’s William Tong, have already filed an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists that alleges the U.S. Department of Energy did not follow proper procedures in establishing the group that compiled the DOE report.

The group also filed 85 pages of comments against the report itself — enumerating the volumes of peer-reviewed research the report ignored and a 122-page appendix of state-by-state climate change impacts. Connecticut’s section notes the observed temperature increases, rise in sea levels that exceeds the global average and the region’s increase in climate extremes including storm intensity, rates of precipitation, flooding, heat and drought and the impacts from all of them.

A representative of Tong’s office has already testified during a live comment period on the legality of the Trump administration’s plan to dump endangerment. In the allotted two-and-a-half minutes, the testimony focused on how the proposed repeal denies the scientific reality that climate change is happening; that endangerment can only be changed by Congress, not the EPA; and that the proposal ignores health and other benefits of climate protection.

There were more than 600 live comments over four days of testimony (extended from the originally scheduled two days), that, according to observers, ran about 97% against and 3% in favor.

As of Sept. 15, more than 92,000 written comments were submitted on the endangerment repeal. The AG group filing on that will be a much-expanded version of its DOE comments.

“We’re pushing back on the junk science, but we’re also going to push back legally, procedurally and substantively legally that this is an illegal approach to rescinding the endangerment finding,” said Matthew Levine, deputy associate Connecticut attorney general and chief of the environment section. “I’ve been working on this stuff for decades, and the science is only continuing to improve and get better with specificity. We feel really confident on the facts and the support for it, and we also feel really confident on the legal issues as well.”

Endangerment in brief

Endangerment goes back to a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling — Massachusetts v. EPA — that paved the way for EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in motor vehicles in addition to the standard pollutants it had been regulating under the iconic Clean Air Act since it came into its modern existence in 1970.

The Act’s language says said that the EPA is required to regulate any air pollutant the administrator finds if the administrator finds they “cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”

Two years later, the administrator did just that, and greenhouse gases — six of them — have been regulated as pollutants since.

It’s widely assumed the EPA will go ahead with rolling back endangerment. So it’s also widely assumed this matter will wind up back before the U.S. Supreme Court. Three of the four justices who voted against it originally remain on the court: Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. None of the five justices who voted for it remain.

The use of the finding has been stretched since the original ruling to justify requiring emissions reductions from power plants and industrial facilities. In a related matter, the EPA proposed a rule on Sept. 12 to discontinue the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program signed into law in 2007 by President George W. Bush. The rule, which began operating a decade ago, required annual reporting of emissions by refineries, factories and other large industrial operations to make the public aware of emissions as a first step towards limiting them.

But the focus of endangerment in the current instance is for motor vehicles. And while the overall issue is wonky to the average person, it has a major impact on their lives, especially here in Connecticut.

Connecticut’s emissions

Connecticut set itself greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals to meet between now and 2050, when overall emissions are supposed to be 80% below 2001 levels. The annual GHG Inventory released by the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection earlier this month shows the state continues to be off-track to meet its goals.

The transportation sector, which constitutes the largest source of those emissions, provided a small bright spot. Its emissions were down 2% in 2023 (the most recent data available) over 2022. Prior to the pandemic, during which emissions dipped dramatically, it had been trending up slightly. But to reach its sector goals, the rate of decrease will need to increase 3.6-fold to meet its next benchmark in 2030.

It is likely the 2023 decrease was driven by greater adoption of electric and more fuel-efficient vehicles, as well as power sector emissions reductions mandated during the Biden administration that would have helped clean up power plants upwind of Connecticut. But the potential rollback of endangerment, along with the Trump administration’s elimination of electric vehicle tax credits and other motor vehicle efficiency measures, including the more restrictive emissions levels some states follow, may send them back up.

“We are concerned that recent actions by the EPA to roll back power plant regulations, vehicle fuel economy standards, and even the Endangerment Finding will remove critical federal tools that contributed to this progress,” said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes in a statement that accompanied the report’s release.

DEEP would not make anyone available to discuss the endangerment repeal effort or the DOE report specifically, though Deputy Commissioner for Environmental Quality Emma Cimino did speak during the EPA live testimony on endangerment.

“Greenhouse gas emissions significantly impact human health by contributing to climate change, which in turn leads to various health problems including respiratory illnesses, heat-related illnesses, infectious disease outbreaks, food and water insecurity, and mental health issues,” Connecticut Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani said in a statement at the time. “Amid the EPA pulling back on these efforts, Connecticut will hold our values to protect and improve the health and safety of our residents.”

“If you want to address the contributions of climate change from Connecticut, there’s no way to do it without making rapid and large reductions in gasoline use,” said David Reichmuth, a senior scientist in the clean transportation program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The EPA’s changes, he said, mean car buyers will have options that are less efficient and with higher emissions. “That‘s going to take us in the wrong direction. In a time where we need to be going as quickly as possible to reduce emissions, we’re going to be actually increasing emissions.”

The Trump administration argues in the endangerment rollback that the higher cost of EVs — now exacerbated by the loss of the EV tax credit coupled with tariffs, which Reichmuth calls disingenuous on the administration’s part — will cause people to hang onto existing dirtier cars for longer. It also claims lower emissions rules by class of vehicle means that any changes in each class will be negligible.

“The idea that the emissions from vehicles don’t matter — it flies in the face of all the of the data we have,” Reichmuth said, calling such arguments “absurd.”

He points out that even if the next administration were to reimpose tough GHG auto emission standards, the cars purchased under more permissive Trump standards could stay on the road for well over a decade. “You’re locking in decades of emissions from those new vehicles,” he said.

Advocates band together

Scientists like Harvard’s Carrie Jenks believe that public input will also be critical to the their cause in this effort.

“I think it’s important for stakeholders to give EPA as much information as they can,” she said. “I think it’s going to be important for EPA to really dig into that, and it’s going to be interesting to see how they do that.”

The Union of Concerned Scientists, like other advocacy groups, is no stranger to group efforts. It has sent out multiple emails requesting individuals file comments on endangerment and contact lawmakers. But Rachel Cleetus, the group’s senior policy director with the climate and energy program, said this one isn’t taking take much effort.

“This report is so egregious that it hasn’t even required a big coordinated effort,” she said. “Within 24 hours, there were scientists on the media, on social media, writing, from the perspective of their expertise, that this was just wrong. So many errors in this report, blatant, complete obfuscation of scientific facts.”

Cleetus was also among the hundreds who gave live testimony on the endangerment repeal effort. She said, as she waited her turn, that what struck her was the ordinary citizens who stepped up, like a woman from Texas on the panel before hers.

“She spoke so movingly about the impacts of Hurricane Harvey and then the recent floods in Texas and what it has meant for people in her community,” Cleetus said. “It’s heartbreaking, it’s enraging, actually. … This is not just political football. This really affects people’s lives.”

Among other organizing efforts, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University immediately provided a full explanation of the issue along with templates for comment letters for both individuals and governments.

The Climate Action Campaign, CAC, which is a coalition of major national environmental, environmental justice and public health groups representing about 15 million members across the country, has stepped up.

Executive Director Margie Alt said their tactical approach is both group and individual efforts, but a couple of things are different this time. First, the Trump administration seems more organized than it was in the first administration, and the fossil fuel interests operating within it are exerting more pressure.

“I’d say the other thing that’s different, though, is that people across the country are experiencing climate change every single day,” she said. “We’re just seeing incredible, incredible public response, especially as people are affected by extreme weather, which they understand to be supercharged by the climate crisis.”

She, and many others, accused the Trump administration of making climate denial the official policy of the U.S.

“I don’t think the public is going to stand for it,” Alt said.

At the Natural Resources Defense Council, Madeline Hankins, the group’s federal climate legal director, said the organization is pulling out all the stops.

Hankins said they knew what rollbacks were coming but not how quickly and widespread.

“We have required some level of sort of coordination and capacity and trying to figure out, ‘OK, it’s all hands on deck, but who’s going to handle what, and how are we going to address this?’” Hankins said.

Most inspiring, Hankins said, were the tens of thousands of members who have filed comments and that, even at the height of summer, “we’re seeing scientists band together to really rebut this report, and they’re coming out of the woodwork to talk about how their research is being misquoted.”

That may have been what motivated Yale’s Marlon to begin with. But she also sees the contrast with the previous federal climate policies she said were designed to improve people’s health, provide cleaner air, cleaner water, lower the temperatures globally, and to even make money doing it.

“All of these tools and policies were like a road map to a safer, cleaner future,” she said. “Basically what these new efforts are doing are taking that map, tossing it out the window, turning off the headlights in the car, and stepping on the accelerator towards a cliff. It’s really endangering the lives of millions of people.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/alz-indiana-7.29.25.jpeg,N,,2025-09-16 05:58:56.033918

But there’s little doubt that data centers are on the rise, propelled by the AI explosion.
“We can come to the table,” said John Burns, general counsel for Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, a trade group representing developers, manufacturers, and others in the clean energy industry.
And for AI data centers, the quicker the better: In Virginia, the world’s data center capital, construction of the facilities takes 18 months or less.
North Carolina regulators could consider inducements for so-called “energy parks,” where data centers and other large loads would be clustered around their new energy sources, reducing interconnection delays and the need for transmission upgrades.","In small communities across North Carolina, data centers are already sparking conflict over land use, water use, and quality of life. Now, the debate over the facilities’ voracious need for electricity — and whether it can be met with clean sources — is heating up in the state capital of Raleigh.

For months, North Carolina’s predominant utility, Duke Energy, has forecast ballooning demand from large customers like data centers: immense buildings that house the computing devices powering AI and other software that’s become part of everyday life.

Early last year, Duke projected these “large loads” would need an additional 3.9 gigawatts of capacity, equal to about four nuclear power plants and enough to serve millions of households. By May of this year, the company’s prediction had swelled to almost 6 gigawatts.

The eye-popping estimates helped lead regulators to approve Duke’s current plan to build a massive new fleet of gas plants, alongside some clean energy investments, despite a state law requiring the utility to decarbonize. The projections are certain to factor into the next iteration of Duke’s long-term blueprint, a draft of which is due in the coming weeks.

The forecasts have “thrown everything out of whack,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.

That’s why his organization asked the state’s Utilities Commission to host a technical conference on large loads. Electricity-demand projections undergird virtually every Duke case before the panel. But at a technical conference, commissioners could grapple exclusively with the issues vexing energy experts across the country: How can data center demand be predicted with the most accuracy? Will the tech giants pay their fair share of grid upgrades and other costs? What will power the new facilities, and will it be carbon-free?

In June, the Utilities Commission granted the law center’s request and then some by opening an entire proceeding to debate these questions. Stakeholders had the summer to submit written comments, with responses due from Duke early this month. In-person presentations are scheduled for Oct. 14.

It’s not clear if the process will culminate in a discrete order from the commission, or simply inform the myriad other Duke cases before it. But Jimenez praised regulators for being proactive. “You need a proceeding to get your arms around some of these issues,” he said. “I think that's really smart and forward-looking.”

The data center boom

In the race against other states to attract economic development, Duke and North Carolina officials keep confidential exactly which entities hope to draw power from the electric grid. And skeptics question whether all of the new facilities behind predictions of unprecedented demand growth will pan out.

But there’s little doubt that data centers are on the rise, propelled by the AI explosion. Researchers say they could account for 44% of U.S. load growth by 2028, and there’s ample evidence that North Carolina is following the national trend.

In June, Amazon Web Services announced a $10 billion, 800-acre computing campus in Richmond County, east of Charlotte, billed as the largest single capital project in North Carolina history. To the west of Charlotte, the development of a “data center corridor” is underway: Apple says its Catawba County site is included in its $500 billion U.S. expansion plans, and Microsoft envisions four new data centers nearby. Google is considering growing its facility in neighboring Caldwell County.

Not all communities are welcoming data centers with open arms. The town council of tiny Tarboro, an hour east of Raleigh, just voted to reject a $6.4 billion facility. In Apex, southwest of the city, opposition is mounting to a proposed “digital campus” that would displace 190 acres of farmland.

Still, early this month, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat and former attorney general, issued an executive order creating an “AI Accelerator” and a council designed to make the state “a national leader in AI literacy, governance, and deployment to the benefit of our residents, communities, and economy.”

Stein did note the technology’s downsides, including “the uncertainty around AI systems and their associated energy and water needs.” But his edict also reflects the seeming common wisdom of the moment: AI and its requisite facilities are multiplying and expanding, bringing economic opportunities that can outweigh their challenges.

“We can come to the table”

In the open docket before regulators, experts say that with the right policies in place, clean energy, efficiency, and related strategies can meet the moment. “We can come to the table,” said John Burns, general counsel for Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, a trade group representing developers, manufacturers, and others in the clean energy industry.

In their comments, Burns and others particularly promoted “load flexibility,” a form of demand response in which data centers curtail their electricity use when the grid is strained by lots of energy consumption.

Load flexibility is feasible because data centers don’t run at maximum capacity 24/7, said Tyler Norris, former special adviser at the U.S. Department of Energy and a doctoral fellow at Duke University, which has no connection to the utility.

“You never actually run the chips and the servers to 100% of their rated nameplate power,” he said. “You wouldn't want to, because they overheat and they don't perform as well when they're running that hard.”

Norris is the lead author of a February paper showing that Duke’s two utilities in the Carolinas could accommodate 4.1 gigawatts of load if data centers shave just 0.5% off their peak usage annually. In a simple example, the facilities could operate at half their maximum capacity for 88 hours over the course of a year.

A load-flexibility arrangement between Duke Energy and data centers could, in theory, avert the construction of several gigawatts of new gas plant capacity and expensive and time-consuming transmission upgrades.

Last month, Google announced demand-response agreements with the utilities Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority. In formal comments to the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Norris called the tech giant’s move the “first documented case where AI data center flexibility is explicitly integrated into U.S. utility planning.”

That’s why he hopes North Carolina regulators will study other means of incorporating curtailment, perhaps starting with voluntary measures, into Duke’s long-term plans.

“I think we need more creative thinking, and dialogue, and analysis around this kind of flexibility opportunity,” Norris told Canary Media. “It just has such substantial implications for affordability and reliability.”

Clean, cheap, quick

Even if Norris’ calculations bear out, Duke Energy’s projections show it will need hundreds more megawatts of power capacity in the next decade for large loads alone. And for AI data centers, the quicker the better: In Virginia, the world’s data center capital, construction of the facilities takes 18 months or less.

That’s where utility-scale solar and storage could be especially useful, said Burns. “Not only are the resources of our members clean,” he added, “they're also less expensive and quicker to market.”

A June report from global investment firm Lazard concludes that land-based wind turbines and large solar farms “remain the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation on an unsubsidized basis.”

By contrast, Lazard says, “the cost of building a new combined cycle gas turbine has reached a 10-year high. Turbine shortages, rising costs, and long delivery times are expected to continue driving steep [levelized cost of energy] increases for gas technologies in the near term.”

The North Carolina Department of Commerce has adopted Gov. Stein’s “all-of-the-above energy deployment approach,” said Jennifer Mundt, the agency’s assistant secretary for energy and infrastructure. But renewables align with the department’s economic development mission because nearly half of all Fortune 500 companies aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, Mundt wrote in her letter to utility commissioners. “Companies are prioritizing sites with access to diverse energy sources,” she noted, as well as those with affordable, reliable electricity.

Especially after the legislature repealed a key target for emissions reductions this summer, many tech giants now have more aggressive clean energy goals than the state. Amazon has pledged net-zero carbon emissions across its global operations by 2040. Google aims to power its data centers with 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

“Google leadership remains firmly committed to this goal,” the company said in its comments to regulators, “making it critical that we are able to identify viable pathways to supporting new carbon-free energy resources as we continue to grow our business.”

A best-case scenario for the clean energy transition?

In their comments to regulators, experts highlight a range of policies that would help data center growth align with — rather than contravene — the clean energy transition.

A voluntary “clean transition tariff,” for instance, would allow data centers to pay for new renewables to come online, rather than just chip in for carbon-free energy already in the works. In Nevada, Google partnered with utility NV Energy on such a scheme, which will enable 115 megawatts of around-the-clock geothermal power to supply the company’s data centers.

North Carolina regulators could consider inducements for so-called “energy parks,” where data centers and other large loads would be clustered around their new energy sources, reducing interconnection delays and the need for transmission upgrades. The on-site energy generation could increase the resilience of the grid as a whole, serving as backup power for the utility.

Indeed, “virtual” or “distributed” power plants, whereby utilities can access non-centralized energy resources during times of need, could help avoid the construction of new power plants, saving utilities and their customers billions of dollars.

The practice is already being tested elsewhere in the U.S. Black Hills Energy negotiated a contract with Microsoft that allows the utility to tap backup generation at the tech company’s Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center during periods of high electricity demand.

For Jimenez of the Southern Environmental Law Center, the best-case scenario is that the regulators adopt these and other policies suggested by advocates, such that “the large load that comes to the state pays for its own clean generation, and the rest of us don't pay excessive bills.”

The worst-case scenario, he said, “would be to do nothing.”

Of course, doing nothing is a distinct possibility. Like all investor-owned, monopoly utilities, Duke is financially motivated to invest in as many capital assets as possible, to be paid back with interest by captive customers. Though it was overridden, the utility opposed the Southern Environmental Law Center’s original request for a technical conference.

In September comments to the commission, Duke said there is “no need to rush into major changes” or “any paradigm shift.” It pointedly argued against reforms that might take place outside a general rate case or the long-term planning process. It acknowledged the risk of building new power plants that may not be used fully by large loads, but asserted that existing regulatory processes and other factors assure that in the short-term, “there is more than ample protection against investment in generation assets that are not needed.”

What’s more, it bodes ill that last year’s much-vaunted agreement between Duke and data center giants to develop a clean transition tariff in the Carolinas appears to have fizzled: Despite promises otherwise, the utility has yet to request such a tariff.

But Duke’s September comments did offer a few rays of hope for advocates. Load flexibility, it suggested, is no panacea, but the company acknowledged that “well-structured flexible operations can provide benefits for customers.”

On virtual power plants, the company said it is “open to all ideas that could provide benefits to the system as a whole and are compliant with applicable law. … Creative engagement around such ideas is essential.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3pitajASC9KfpfsOSyvUug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NjI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/24433c5b843a5de4a51c0e225823b9a0,N,,2025-09-16 04:57:47.274922

Eight of the top 10 states for new solar installations—Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas—are among these states.

Manufacturing capacity has also grown significantly in early 2025, with 13 GW of new or expanded solar module production facilities coming online in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. This brings total U.S. module manufacturing capacity to 55 GW. However, no new upstream manufacturing investments were recorded in the second quarter of 2025, as federal policy uncertainty threatens to stall momentum and deter billions of dollars in private investment.

Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO, stated, “Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses. Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid. But no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.”

Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie, mentioned, “There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects. The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1. Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment for the solar industry incredibly challenging.”

Looking ahead, the report forecasts that overall solar deployment will be about 4% lower by 2030 compared with projections made before HR1 was enacted. Short-term growth is supported by projects already under development, developers rushing to meet tax credit deadlines, and rising electricity demand as natural gas generation becomes more expensive and less reliable. Still, recent executive actions from the Department of the Interior (DOI) could delay or halt many planned projects. The DOI’s new permitting rules, which specifically target solar projects for stricter treatment, could affect roughly 44 GW of planned capacity—particularly in Arizona, California, and Nevada.

SEIA has urged DOI Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse these actions, warning that if they remain in place, they could lead to job losses, higher electricity prices, and reduced competitiveness for the U.S. economy. The association also cautioned that slower solar growth could undermine the administration’s broader economic and technological goals, including ambitions in artificial intelligence development. To address these challenges, SEIA has released a grid reliability policy agenda outlining key steps local, state, and federal leaders should take to strengthen the electric grid through greater use of solar and energy storage technologies, ensuring a stable and affordable power supply to meet the country’s growing energy needs.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-photo-356036.jpeg,N,,2025-09-16 04:57:54.850590

The Trump administration had declared an energy emergency, then set about reducing energy supply by going after renewables projects. The massive spending law yanked nearly seven years of tax credits for wind and solar. The White House arbitrarily halted construction on two major offshore wind farms that had all their permits in order, raising the fear that it might block other fully approved projects. Tariffs have changed the price of parts that go into clean energy equipment on a sometimes weekly basis. The cleantech bankruptcies have been relentless: Powin, Sunnova, Mosaic, Northvolt, Li-Cycle, Nikola, to name a few.

“I can’t think of a time when we have been subject to quite as much of a brutal swing as we’ve been in now,” said Abby Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, which puts on the conference.

But when I got to the exhibit hall at the Venetian Expo, it stretched farther than I’d ever seen at a clean energy show, and I heard rumors of additional halls above and below. The exhibitors even sprawled across a sunwashed bridge to Caesar’s Forum, where vendors of flow batteries and other alternative technologies hawked their wares, quite fittingly, from the periphery of the event.

Final attendance for the show hit 37,000, just shy of the record 40,000 from the previous two years, and other metrics broke records. The mood on the floor, in the halls, and at the myriad Vegas afterparties reflected an industry that had taken some punches, had lost some nice things, but was nonetheless charging forward, resolute and battle-tested.

“If you’d asked me in May how I was feeling about RE+, I would have a very different answer,” Hopper noted at a roundtable with journalists a few days into the show. ​“But we have more exhibitors than we’ve ever had in our history, and we have more registration revenue than we’ve ever had in our history. … [People] are really, really hungry for information and for a vision for what’s coming next.”

Judging by this year’s dire headlines, the show’s ebullient atmosphere does not seem entirely rational. Of course, even teetering startups try to project confidence among peers, customers, and especially journalists. And the overstimulated Vegas backdrop inspires a particular strain of optimism, the kind that encourages you to light cash on fire and feel lucky for the opportunity.

But after three days of roaming the frenetic halls, I came to see this year’s positive outlook as warranted. The general consensus among conference goers seemed to be that though political headwinds are blowing hard, economic tailwinds are blowing harder. Here are three reasons why I think they are right.

Forget policy, look at the markets

With the federal tax credits cut short, fewer solar projects will get built, and costs will rise for the ones that still go forward, passing on higher energy bills to American consumers.

But, with a little distance from the sting of this summer’s legislative setbacks, many solar and energy storage professionals believe losses in the policy arena are counterbalanced by increasingly rosy outlooks in the marketplace.

“I think people tend to over-orient on the policy story, and under-orient on the economic and financial story,” said Alfred Johnson, CEO of the clean energy financing platform Crux, as we sipped espressos outside the hubbub of the cavernous expo halls.

Johnson’s company launched as a marketplace for tax credit transferability, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, but has expanded into other forms of financing, like debt and tax equity. That perch gives him visibility into clean energy project economics and the flows of capital into the sector. He ticked off a series of key factors defining the current energy market: Electricity prices are way up; solar and battery keeps getting cheaper while improving performance; gas prices are rising as the Trump administration promotes exports; gas turbine prices are rising due to intense competition from buyers.

In short, it’s a bad time to be someone who uses electricity in America, despite President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to cut energy prices. That means, though, that it’s a great time to be someone who sells power.

Even better for power producers, the biggest new customers — data centers — have the price sensitivity of a ravenous grizzly bear. They’re trying, with the enthusiastic support of the White House, to win a global arms race to unlock artificial superintelligence, whatever that means. Facing such civilizational stakes, the hyperscalers aren’t going to quibble over nickels and dimes.

Even with elevated electricity prices, hyperscalers still have to pay a lot more for the ​“graphics processing units” that train and run their AI models, Johnson noted. And once they’ve paid for those GPUs, they want to use them as much as possible, which means gobbling up as much electricity as they can get.

“The value of being faster on delivering the model … is worth so much more … than the additional cost of energy, which means that the marginal demand in a lot of these markets is the data centers, who are not price sensitive,” Johnson said.

Solar is clearly the cheapest source of new electricity production. But what matters most now is speed to market, and here solar and batteries easily trounce all other commercially viable sources of power. Taking mass-produced panels and parts and assembling them in a field is fundamentally easier than constructing a traditional large power plant. And it’s a hell of a lot easier than some of the hyperscalers’ other ideas, like building nonexistent nuclear fusion plants, or nonexistent small modular reactors, or restarting a long-shuttered nuclear reactor at the notorious Three Mile Island plant.

These dynamics led some of my fellow conference goers to muse about a counterfactual choice: Would you rather have strong federal policy tailwinds and an unfavorable market, or booming market fundamentals but unfavorable policy? Nine months ago, the industry enjoyed both. Trump ended those good times, but the robust market serves to mollify the pain of his policy attacks.

Solar got whacked, but storage is booming

SEIA has strived to welcome energy storage into the fold, and diversification from solar alone looks especially prescient these days. Rooftop solar is struggling in a big way, with the federal onslaught and friendly fire from states like California, and large-scale developers are racing to cram in a bumper crop of projects before tax credits disappear next July. (Projects that start construction after that must be operating by the end of 2027 to qualify for the federal incentives.) But storage companies evaded the policy setbacks of their solar-powered brethren, and are building toward yet another record year of construction.

“Right now, we are seeing all of the factors are very supportive to storage,” said Johnson. ​“Demand is going up, there’s more of a focus on having dispatchable power. It got tax credits for the first time in the IRA … and then it retained the tax credits in [the One Big Beautiful Bill Act].”

The budget law preserves the battery-installation tax credits through 2033, with the stipulation that projects prove they don’t excessively rely on parts or corporate support from China. That sparked initial concerns from some analysts that these Foreign Entity of Concern rules (FEOC) could be enforced in a way that strangles development arbitrarily.

A few months later, many storage developers are encouraged by how clearly the text of the law lays out the boxes to check. Even so, compliance creates extra work for the American companies trying to expand the capacity of the grid, and the law does not explicitly encourage domestic manufacturing, since the rules are anti-China rather than pro-America.

Trump’s tariffs also pose a unique threat to storage, because so many of the battery cells used in these projects come from China. The U.S. has only just begun building supply chains for lithium ferrous phosphate, the battery chemistry now favored for grid storage. LG opened an LFP factory in Michigan this summer; AESC did so in an old Nissan Leaf battery plant in Tennessee, and Tesla is working on one in Nevada slated to start up early next year.

Now, said Brian Hayes, CEO of storage developer Key Capture Energy, it’s common for suppliers to offer three battery-sourcing options: China, Southeast Asia, and domestic. Buyers can toggle based on current tariff rates, U.S. manufacturing premiums, and the FEOC obligations of a particular project. Once the new FEOC rules kick in, though, the industry will need to move away from Chinese-made battery cells.

“I’m feeling a lot more positive today than I was six months ago,” said Hayes, whose company has built 40 megawatts in New York and 580 megawatts in Texas. ​“We ended up in a good place.”

That’s not to say storage developers can afford to get complacent.

“We can’t rest on our laurels,” Hayes mused. ​“We always have to be paying attention to what else could come.”

Domestic supply chains are developing in spite of the chaos

The Biden administration combined trade policy with methodical domestic incentives to reshore the manufacturing of clean energy equipment and other tech, like semiconductors. Trump supports the resurgence of domestic manufacturing in theory, but his primary tactic for that goal has been frequently shifting and legally dubious tariffs. These policies raise the price for materials that American manufacturers need to make their products and for the equipment required to build new factories, and they undermine the long-term certainty that reassures investors.

Still, the reshoring of clean energy supply chains has continued, and signs touting FEOC compliance have become a new form of currency on the expo hall floors.

Nextracker, the homegrown solar-tracking manufacturer and publicly traded cleantech success story, used the occasion of the conference to publicize its acquisition of Origami Solar for $53 million. That marked a refreshing shift in an era when cleantech acquisitions have tended to feature bankruptcy auctions or the kind of firesale where participants abashedly refuse to share the purchase price.

Origami developed a steel frame technology to replace the usual aluminum frames that wrap around solar panels. This enhances structural integrity as solar modules grow ever larger and more powerful. Indiana manufacturer Bila Solar, for instance, recently tapped Origami to frame its new 550-watt solar module.

But beyond preventing bending or buckling, the acquisition is a domestic-production play. The U.S. aluminium industry has cratered since the 1980s, so aluminum frames are now largely an import business, subject to all the vagaries of trade in 2025. The U.S. still makes things with steel though; Nextracker has been working with partners to open steel plants around the country to produce the torque tubes that carry the panels through their daily rotation. Origami manufactures in the U.S. too; now Nextracker can offer a more complete domestic solar package, making it easier for developers to clinch the 10% tax credit adder for Made-in-America content.

Over in Texas, module manufacturer T1 Energy signed a deal a few weeks back with glass producer Corning for a lot more than oven-safe casserole dishes. Corning subsidiary Hemlock Semiconductor will make hyper-pure polysilicon and carve it into solar wafers in Michigan, to supply T1’s forthcoming solar cell factory starting in the second half of 2026.

I tracked down Alex Zhu, CEO of ES Foundry, which in January opened one of the only currently operating solar cell factories in the country. Production from the 1-gigawatt line in Greenwood, South Carolina, is already sold out until 2027, Zhu said. He has greenlit a 2-gigawatt expansion, slated to be fully running by June 2026, to meet demand from domestic panel producers. A digital display by the company’s booth advertised ​“No FEOC Ownership. No FEOC Board. No FEOC Funding.”

Zhu stressed that it wasn’t easy opening a cell factory when the U.S. lacks a supply chain for some of the industrial inputs that are abundant and cheap in China. One of the key gases used in the process cost him 120 times the rate it sells for in that country’s solar industry centers. But Zhu nonetheless raised investment, launched the company, and built the factory all in the last two years.

That’s a clear risk factor, because that perk will disappear along with the solar tax credits. But tax rules say that if developers start construction before next July 4, they can take up to four years to finish projects. That means projects could get built with both the credit and the domestic content adder through the end of the decade.

It’s hard to know what context manufacturers will be operating in at that point. But Zhu noted that ​“after five years, we definitely need to move to the next generation.” Much like semiconductor fabs, solar cell factories must regularly refresh themselves to keep up with technological advancements.

Longer-term certainty would be nice for the generational effort to reshore the solar supply chain, but maybe five busy years of manufacturing is enough to look forward to right now.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-905962646.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=8a75596548d90ced84649f6c48e7fd0a,N,,2025-09-16 03:59:42.757351

Now, the debate over the facilities’ voracious need for electricity — and whether it can be met with clean sources — is heating up in the state capital of Raleigh.

For months, North Carolina’s predominant utility, Duke Energy, has forecast ballooning demand from large customers like data centers: immense buildings that house the computing devices powering AI and other software that’s become part of everyday life.

Early last year, Duke projected these ​“large loads” would need an additional 3.9 gigawatts of capacity, equal to about four nuclear power plants and enough to serve millions of households. By May of this year, the company’s prediction had swelled to almost 6 gigawatts.

The eye-popping estimates helped lead regulators to approve Duke’s current plan to build a massive new fleet of gas plants, alongside some clean energy investments, despite a state law requiring the utility to decarbonize. The projections are certain to factor into the next iteration of Duke’s long-term blueprint, a draft of which is due in the coming weeks.

The forecasts have ​“thrown everything out of whack,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.

That’s why his organization asked the state’s Utilities Commission to host a technical conference on large loads. Electricity-demand projections undergird virtually every Duke case before the panel. But at a technical conference, commissioners could grapple exclusively with the issues vexing energy experts across the country: How can data center demand be predicted with the most accuracy? Will the tech giants pay their fair share of grid upgrades and other costs? What will power the new facilities, and will it be carbon-free?

In June, the Utilities Commission granted the law center’s request and then some by opening an entire proceeding to debate these questions. Stakeholders had the summer to submit written comments, with responses due from Duke early this month. In-person presentations are scheduled for Oct. 14.

It’s not clear if the process will culminate in a discrete order from the commission, or simply inform the myriad other Duke cases before it. But Jimenez praised regulators for being proactive. ​“You need a proceeding to get your arms around some of these issues,” he said. ​“I think that’s really smart and forward-looking.”

The data center boom

In the race against other states to attract economic development, Duke and North Carolina officials keep confidential exactly which entities hope to draw power from the electric grid. And skeptics question whether all of the new facilities behind predictions of unprecedented demand growth will pan out.

But there’s little doubt that data centers are on the rise, propelled by the AI explosion. Researchers say they could account for 44% of U.S. load growth by 2028, and there’s ample evidence that North Carolina is following the national trend.

In June, Amazon Web Services announced a $10 billion, 800-acre computing campus in Richmond County, east of Charlotte, billed as the largest single capital project in North Carolina history. To the west of Charlotte, the development of a ​“data center corridor” is underway: Apple says its Catawba County site is included in its $500 billion U.S. expansion plans, and Microsoft envisions four new data centers nearby. Google is considering growing its facility in neighboring Caldwell County.

Not all communities are welcoming data centers with open arms. The town council of tiny Tarboro, an hour east of Raleigh, just voted to reject a $6.4 billion facility. In Apex, southwest of the city, opposition is mounting to a proposed ​“digital campus” that would displace 190 acres of farmland.

Still, early this month, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat and former attorney general, issued an executive order creating an ​“AI Accelerator” and a council designed to make the state ​“a national leader in AI literacy, governance, and deployment to the benefit of our residents, communities, and economy.”

Stein did note the technology’s downsides, including ​“the uncertainty around AI systems and their associated energy and water needs.” But his edict also reflects the seeming common wisdom of the moment: AI and its requisite facilities are multiplying and expanding, bringing economic opportunities that can outweigh their challenges.

“We can come to the table”

In the open docket before regulators, experts say that with the right policies in place, clean energy, efficiency, and related strategies can meet the moment. ​“We can come to the table,” said John Burns, general counsel for Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, a trade group representing developers, manufacturers, and others in the clean energy industry.

In their comments, Burns and others particularly promoted ​“load flexibility,” a form of demand response in which data centers curtail their electricity use when the grid is strained by lots of energy consumption.

Load flexibility is feasible because data centers don’t run at maximum capacity 24/7, said Tyler Norris, former special adviser at the U.S. Department of Energy and a doctoral fellow at Duke University, which has no connection to the utility.

“You never actually run the chips and the servers to 100% of their rated nameplate power,” he said. ​“You wouldn’t want to, because they overheat and they don’t perform as well when they’re running that hard.”

Norris is the lead author of a February paper showing that Duke’s two utilities in the Carolinas could accommodate 4.1 gigawatts of load if data centers shave just 0.5% off their peak usage annually. In a simple example, the facilities could operate at half their maximum capacity for 88 hours over the course of a year.

A load-flexibility arrangement between Duke Energy and data centers could, in theory, avert the construction of several gigawatts of new gas plant capacity and expensive and time-consuming transmission upgrades.

Last month, Google announced demand-response agreements with the utilities Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority. In formal comments to the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Norris called the tech giant’s move the ​“first documented case where AI data center flexibility is explicitly integrated into U.S. utility planning.”

That’s why he hopes North Carolina regulators will study other means of incorporating curtailment, perhaps starting with voluntary measures, into Duke’s long-term plans.

“I think we need more creative thinking, and dialogue, and analysis around this kind of flexibility opportunity,” Norris told Canary Media. ​“It just has such substantial implications for affordability and reliability.”

Clean, cheap, quick

Even if Norris’ calculations bear out, Duke Energy’s projections show it will need hundreds more megawatts of power capacity in the next decade for large loads alone. And for AI data centers, the quicker the better: In Virginia, the world’s data center capital, construction of the facilities takes 18 months or less.

That’s where utility-scale solar and storage could be especially useful, said Burns. ​“Not only are the resources of our members clean,” he added, ​“they’re also less expensive and quicker to market.”

A June report from global investment firm Lazard concludes that land-based wind turbines and large solar farms ​“remain the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation on an unsubsidized basis.”

By contrast, Lazard says, ​“the cost of building a new combined cycle gas turbine has reached a 10-year high. Turbine shortages, rising costs, and long delivery times are expected to continue driving steep [levelized cost of energy] increases for gas technologies in the near term.”

The North Carolina Department of Commerce has adopted Gov. Stein’s ​“all-of-the-above energy deployment approach,” said Jennifer Mundt, the agency’s assistant secretary for energy and infrastructure. But renewables align with the department’s economic development mission because nearly half of all Fortune 500 companies aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, Mundt wrote in her letter to utility commissioners. ​“Companies are prioritizing sites with access to diverse energy sources,” she noted, as well as those with affordable, reliable electricity.

Especially after the legislature repealed a key target for emissions reductions this summer, many tech giants now have more aggressive clean energy goals than the state. Amazon has pledged net-zero carbon emissions across its global operations by 2040. Google aims to power its data centers with 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

“Google leadership remains firmly committed to this goal,” the company said in its comments to regulators, ​“making it critical that we are able to identify viable pathways to supporting new carbon-free energy resources as we continue to grow our business.”

A best-case scenario for the clean energy transition?

In their comments to regulators, experts highlight a range of policies that would help data center growth align with — rather than contravene — the clean energy transition.

A voluntary ​“clean transition tariff,” for instance, would allow data centers to pay for new renewables to come online, rather than just chip in for carbon-free energy already in the works. In Nevada, Google partnered with utility NV Energy on such a scheme, which will enable 115 megawatts of around-the-clock geothermal power to supply the company’s data centers.

North Carolina regulators could consider inducements for so-called ​“energy parks,” where data centers and other large loads would be clustered around their new energy sources, reducing interconnection delays and the need for transmission upgrades. The on-site energy generation could increase the resilience of the grid as a whole, serving as backup power for the utility.

Indeed, ​“virtual” or ​“distributed” power plants, whereby utilities can access non-centralized energy resources during times of need, could help avoid the construction of new power plants, saving utilities and their customers billions of dollars.

The practice is already being tested elsewhere in the U.S. Black Hills Energy negotiated a contract with Microsoft that allows the utility to tap backup generation at the tech company’s Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center during periods of high electricity demand.

For Jimenez of the Southern Environmental Law Center, the best-case scenario is that the regulators adopt these and other policies suggested by advocates, such that ​“the large load that comes to the state pays for its own clean generation, and the rest of us don’t pay excessive bills.”

Of course, doing nothing is a distinct possibility. Like all investor-owned, monopoly utilities, Duke is financially motivated to invest in as many capital assets as possible, to be paid back with interest by captive customers. Though it was overridden, the utility opposed the Southern Environmental Law Center’s original request for a technical conference.

In September comments to the commission, Duke said there is ​“no need to rush into major changes” or ​“any paradigm shift.” It pointedly argued against reforms that might take place outside a general rate case or the long-term planning process. It acknowledged the risk of building new power plants that may not be used fully by large loads, but asserted that existing regulatory processes and other factors assure that in the short-term, ​“there is more than ample protection against investment in generation assets that are not needed.”

What’s more, it bodes ill that last year’s much-vaunted agreement between Duke and data center giants to develop a clean transition tariff in the Carolinas appears to have fizzled: Despite promises otherwise, the utility has yet to request such a tariff.

But Duke’s September comments did offer a few rays of hope for advocates. Load flexibility, it suggested, is no panacea, but the company acknowledged that ​“well-structured flexible operations can provide benefits for customers.”

On virtual power plants, the company said it is ​“open to all ideas that could provide benefits to the system as a whole and are compliant with applicable law. … Creative engagement around such ideas is essential.”

Meanwhile, the commission’s perspective may be in flux. Unlike the panel that opened the docket in June, a majority of the body’s members are now appointed by Republicans, and it has elected a new chair. How regulators engage in this debate will become clearer when experts gather in October.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-143135053.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=94746d0a1d259787a1a1ccbd2a52fd8d,N,,2025-09-16 04:00:04.590007

Policy volatility, including on-and-off again tariffs and the removal of incentives, is undermining the stability needed for strategic planning.
Navigating this period of uncertainty presents substantial challenges across the EV value chain, yet strategic foresight and planning can enable successful adaptation.
Both new EV companies and established OEMs now face major challenges.
Charting the Path Forward for the Road Ahead The EV market has progressed through distinct phases.","The pillars supporting the U.S. electric vehicle (“EV”) sector are facing significant strain. Financial incentives, including subsidies and tax credits, have been repealed, while long-standing fuel economy and emissions standards are being reconsidered and redirected toward alternative priorities. Policy volatility, including on-and-off again tariffs and the removal of incentives, is undermining the stability needed for strategic planning. In a short period of time, the discourse has shifted from scaling the EV supply chain to fundamental questions about the sector’s viability. Navigating this period of uncertainty presents substantial challenges across the EV value chain, yet strategic foresight and planning can enable successful adaptation.

Reflections From the Road Traveled

For over a decade, the world’s three largest automotive markets (i.e., China, Europe, United States) have promoted electrification through a dual-pronged approach — incentives to encourage EV adoption (“the carrot”) and regulatory measures to constrain internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicle usage (“the stick”). In the United States, this framework has historically meant subsidies to support domestic EV manufacturing and, more recently, consumer tax credits for EV purchases.1 Complementing these incentives have been stringent fuel economy and emissions standards designed to gradually phase out ICE vehicles.2 The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), along with the latest fuel economy regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), significantly bolstered this policy landscape.3,4

As a result, the first quarter of 2025 showed strong EV market growth, with sales increasing approximately 11% year-over-year, or roughly 10% of total new vehicle sales in Q1 2025. Notably, this coincided with Tesla’s market share declining to about 43% from over 50% in the previous year, signaling a more diversified and maturing EV market ecosystem.5

Hitting the Brakes

The U.S. faces a pivotal moment as both incentives and regulations driving electrification are under threat. Weakening tax credits, renewed challenges to longstanding emissions rules, and volatile tariff policies collectively jeopardize the long-term stability and momentum of the EV transition.

Two key regulatory agencies — the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) — have traditionally anchored U.S. fuel economy policy around carbon dioxide (“CO2”)-based emissions standards. These greenhouse gas (“GHG”) regulations have served as the principal mechanism incentivizing legacy automakers to invest in and commercialize electric vehicles. However, under the current administration, both agencies have begun shifting their regulatory focus from GHGs to hazardous air pollutants,6 a subtle yet consequential change. Unlike hazardous pollutants, CO2 is not directly harmful to human health in ambient concentrations but remains the primary ICE emission driving climate change. By deprioritizing CO2 in favor of hazardous emissions, the administration is reducing the emphasis on fuel economy and climate- focused standards and shifting the focus to public health.

The Biden administration established formal fleet fuel economy as well as CO2 reduction targets through 2032. The penalties for not meeting the fuel economy standards have now been set to zero and the EPA has planned to reveal more permissive standards for CO2.7 This regulatory instability is complicating long-term planning, making it more difficult for original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to commit to investment strategies and future product development.

On the incentive front, the IRA was designed to reduce the cost of EV production and ownership, while simultaneously strengthening the domestic supply chain. Key provisions included a $7,500 consumer tax credit for qualifying EV purchases, as well as manufacturing incentives. The IRA also had measures to subsidize EV charging infrastructure, notably mandating the deployment of EV chargers along major national highway corridors.8

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBB”), the EV charging infrastructure incentives are being sunset by June 2026 and the EV purchase credits by September 2025 — several years ahead of the IRA’s original 2032 end date. It is expected that there will be a temporary surge in EV sales leading up to the September expiration, followed by a decline in sales in Q4 2025. This accelerated timeline is likely to significantly reduce consumer demand, particularly for mass-market and used EVs, which have relied heavily on these incentives to remain competitive with traditional vehicles. The removal of the Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit further delays fleet electrification, impacting commercial EV manufacturers and infrastructure providers.9

Further complicating the policy landscape, on April 2, 2025, the administration introduced a new wave of tariffs, imposing a 145% duty on Chinese EVs and battery materials in an effort to reduce U.S. dependency on China, which currently controls over 70% of global battery and cell production and over 85% of cathode and anode capacity. Tariffs, primarily used as short-term negotiation tools, undermine predictability and complicate long-term capital commitments. Within weeks, tariff policy specifically toward China shifted repeatedly, including a temporary 90-day pause and subsequent rate adjustments, creating prolonged uncertainty around tariff levels and significantly complicating long-term capital planning.10

The combined effect of recent policy and regulatory changes, along with an increasingly protectionist tariff environment, is expected to substantially impact EV adoption in the United States. Consumer demand for both passenger and commercial EVs is likely to decline, and private-sector investment in EV charging infrastructure is anticipated to contract significantly. Automakers may scale back their EV deployment strategies in favor of higher-margin ICE vehicles, further weakening America’s competitive position in a rapidly growing global market. The effects are already evident, with EV sales flattening in Q2 2025 (see figure 1). Given the current policy environment, FTI has revised its forecast for U.S. EV adoption to below 30% by 2035, down from a 60% penetration forecasted just one year ago.11 Companies founded on expectations of sustained growth now face unpredictable regulatory shifts that outpace their capacity to adapt supply chains and strategic plans, creating persistent uncertainty over long-term strategic planning. Absent corrective measures, this could result in the U.S. falling behind other regions (particularly China and Europe) that continue to aggressively support electrification and battery manufacturing, resulting in economic and strategic disadvantages.

Shifting Gears

This is not merely short-term turbulence, the current environment presents deeper structural uncertainty that is now amplified by the OBBB. The termination of key incentives and weakening of regulatory enforcement mechanisms are placing pressure on the sector and eroding investor confidence, complicating long-term strategic planning across the EV ecosystem. Both new EV companies and established OEMs now face major challenges. Extended planning cycles have been disrupted, likely compelling companies to re-evaluate fundamental business assumptions and potentially slowing innovation, investment and deployment strategies, thus diminishing America’s global competitive advantage in the EV sector.

For the wave of new companies that were inspired by Tesla’s success and the broader promise of electrification, a breakdown in the foundational assumptions underpinning their business models (i.e., strong policy support and market growth for several years) could lead to restructurings, market consolidation and increased risks of outright failures.

For more established players, such as legacy automakers and Tier 1 suppliers, this uncertainty has thrown long-term investment strategies into disarray. General Motors, for example, publicly committed to phasing out its entire ICE portfolio.13

This bold move was echoed by several other OEMs who have redirected the majority of their R&D budgets toward battery-electric and autonomous vehicle technologies.14,15 These commitments are typically aligned with six-year regulatory cycles and twelve-year capital investment horizons. Frequent reversals in federal policy significantly undermine such extended planning, impairing investor confidence, stalling momentum and diminishing the nation’s future competitive edge in the global EV marketplace.

What You Can Do To Steer Through the Uncertainty

Managing Cash To Enhance Liquidity Management

Periods of heightened uncertainty, delayed product launches or reduced sales significantly impact cash flow, elevating the importance of disciplined liquidity management. Robust cash forecasting can offer critical visibility into short-term financial needs. Identifying levers for unlocking near-term liquidity can significantly enhance financial resilience. Raising additional capital or modifying existing debt instruments may be required to enhance short- to medium-term liquidity. Equally important is preserving strategic optionality, allowing businesses to extend their operational runway and adapt quickly as trade policies and market dynamics continue to shift. Companies can also proactively manage working capital by optimizing inventory levels and accounts receivable terms, ensuring alignment with shifting market realities.

Getting Lean To Optimize Operational Efficiency

Management teams can comprehensively evaluate their organizational structure, resource allocation and core operational processes to strengthen resilience amid persistent uncertainty. This involves evaluating spans of control, identifying redundant roles and addressing underperforming business units to improve efficiency and profitability. Companies can also prioritize digital transformation and AI initiatives and operational analytics to gain deeper insights into performance metrics and streamline decision-making processes.

Ultimately, businesses should clearly define their core competencies, leverage data-driven insights and concentrate resources on operations with clear pathways to profitability and growth to effectively navigate challenging market conditions.

Seize on Strategic Opportunities During Market Consolidation

If a market consolidation phase materializes, companies possessing high-quality assets but lacking sufficient liquidity or financial backing may be compelled to pursue divestitures in order to maintain solvency. Industry participants with strong balance sheets and access to capital can leverage this environment to pursue compelling opportunities to acquire strategic assets. Additionally, companies should remain agile and actively monitor market dynamics to rapidly capitalize on partnership opportunities or alliances that can enhance their competitive positioning and accelerate strategic objectives.

Charting the Path Forward for the Road Ahead

The EV market has progressed through distinct phases. In the early 2010s, EVs remained a niche product, often met with skepticism. Global momentum accelerated as China’s aggressive policy push and Tesla’s early breakthroughs spurred adoption. The COVID-19 era brought unprecedented regulatory and financial support, lowering costs, improving product quality and driving large-scale investment from global automakers. Today, however, the U.S. EV sector faces significant headwinds. Policy reversals threaten to slow progress, while a surge of lower-cost Chinese EV exports is intensifying competitive pressure on OEMs worldwide. These forces are straining the EV ecosystem and could trigger consolidation and market exits in the years ahead.

Despite these setbacks, underlying technological advancements and broader global market trends continue to strongly favor electrification in the long term. We believe that companies must maintain investment in innovation, particularly in battery chemistries, charging technology and integration with renewable energy grids to ensure readiness for the eventual market recovery. Amid escalating headwinds, the question for industry participants is clear: not merely who is best positioned today, but who possesses the resilience required to stay the course and emerge in a stronger position once the storm passes.

Padilla emphasized that Trump has gone back on his promises to cut energy costs, as energy prices are now rising twice as fast as inflation.
“This Administration is shamelessly working to block one of our best defenses against rising energy bills: renewable energy.
Padilla further emphasized that by investing in older fossil fuel plants, the Administration will continue to raise energy costs and cede global leadership in renewable energy production and innovation to adversaries like China.
Our solution has to be a more inclusive approach to energy portfolios.” Padilla concluded by outlining his vision for a more efficient, lower-cost, and reliable clean energy future.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, spoke on the Senate floor to outline the Trump Administration’s devastating cuts to clean energy projects across the country that are leading to significant energy cost increases for American families. He contrasted Trump’s shortsighted actions against renewable energy with California’s leadership in building a reliable grid and clean energy economy.

Padilla emphasized that Trump has gone back on his promises to cut energy costs, as energy prices are now rising twice as fast as inflation. In the face of rising prices, California state lawmakers passed a legislative package this weekend to strengthen the state’s energy portfolio and lower the cost of living for working families. The package will help increase the supply of energy Californians rely on while facilitating coordination with counterparts in states like Oregon and Washington to create a regional electric grid across the Western United States.

While Republicans claim that renewable energy isn’t affordable or dependable, Padilla stressed that solar and wind power are cheaper than both coal and natural gas, with solar power costing only half as much as coal. He highlighted that California’s historic economic growth across industries demonstrates the promise of a sustainable, clean energy future. In 2023, clean energy made up two thirds of California’s retail electricity. At the same time, the state’s grid has become more reliable as battery capacity in California has expanded by nearly 2,000% since 2019.

“This Administration is shamelessly working to block one of our best defenses against rising energy bills: renewable energy. And I say so because renewable energy is absolutely affordable, renewable energy is abundant, and whether you want to admit it or not, renewable energy sources are our future.”

“[California is] harnessing the power of solar and wind and hydroelectric power and nuclear, geothermal, even hydrogen power to our state. And it’s exactly because of those investments that even in a year like 2024, just last year, when we experienced record heat waves that we also saw record renewable energy generation, and we kept the lights on.”

“We know that with a growing population and a growing economy, including, but not limited to, the future of an AI boom, demand will continue to grow. But we’re committed to the kind of inclusive portfolio of energy options that has made our grid more reliable.”

Despite California’s leadership, the Trump Administration has decimated clean energy efforts, cutting historic tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, canceling offshore wind projects, and withholding funding from solar projects that lower energy bills and create good-paying jobs. According to Climate Power, since Trump was elected, over 120 clean energy projects across the country have been canceled or delayed or are laying off staff, amounting to nearly 14,000 megawatts taken off the grid — enough to power over 8.4 million homes. Padilla further emphasized that by investing in older fossil fuel plants, the Administration will continue to raise energy costs and cede global leadership in renewable energy production and innovation to adversaries like China.

Padilla underscored that Trump’s dependence on fossil fuels will exacerbate the climate crisis and lead to more intense natural disasters, including drought, atmospheric rivers, and catastrophic wildfires like Los Angeles experienced in January. As President Trump has baselessly attacked California’s wildfire policy and withheld disaster aid for California, Senator Padilla highlighted his previous work to pass the FIRE Act to help FEMA better prepare for and respond to wildfires, his efforts to finalize the transfer of seven C-130s from the Coast Guard to California to retrofit for fighting wildfires, and his ongoing bipartisan push to pass the Fix Our Forests Act to combat devastating wildfires, restore forest ecosystems, and make federal forest management more efficient and responsive.

“[Trump’s reliance on fossil fuels] is not just bad for consumers, it’s not just bad for reliability — it’s literally putting lives at risk.”

“It’s no surprise that Donald Trump loves to attack California’s leaders for wildfire policy and our climate leadership, and we also know he loves to play politics with disaster funding. That record is clear. Yet he continues to dig us deeper and deeper into an energy policy that actually increases the risk of the next great disaster. And Californians will be left to clean up the mess.”

“Reliance on fossil fuels comes at a cost, and Americans, not just Californians, but Americans are paying for it in the form of higher energy bills and in lives destroyed after these major disasters. So no matter how many times Trump says it, we can never and will never ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ our way to cheaper energy costs. Our solution has to be a more inclusive approach to energy portfolios.”

Padilla concluded by outlining his vision for a more efficient, lower-cost, and reliable clean energy future. He pushed for streamlining the approval and completion of energy projects while building out our transmission system and fostering regional cooperation to strengthen the grid.

“That’s how we meet our growing demand — more options, not less, more cooperation, not less, and more sources of energy, not less.”

“Trump might continue to lie to the American people about renewable energy, but Americans know that this energy crisis doesn’t have to continue forever, and California is proud to show the way forward.”

But a coalition of environmental groups decried SB 237, saying it runs counter to the state’s clean energy goals.
Those provisions and others, SB 254’s supporters say, can help reduce monthly electric bills for customers across the state.","Over the weekend, lawmakers in Sacramento passed a suite of energy-related bills pushed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that came forward in the final days of the California legislative session.

The measures that extended proceedings into Saturday include legislation that clears the way for California to join a regional electric grid, tries to boost statewide oil production in the wake of a pair of looming refinery shutdowns, extends California’s cap-and-trade program and replenishes the state’s wildfire funds.

The bills head to now head to the governor’s office, where Newsom has until Oct. 13 to sign them into law.

By all indications, that will be a mere formality.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said when the raft of last-minute bills were introduced.

Regional grid

Assembly Bill 825, originally known as Senate Bill 540, will enable California to join a new energy trading market with other states in the West. By more easily tapping into power in the region, the bill’s supporters say it will lead to lower energy costs for consumers and more seamlessly integrate power supplies.

The California Independent System Operator that manages the electric grid for about 80% of the state, took to social media and hailed the bill’s passage as “a major milestone for the West” that was “shaped by years of successful and evolving regional collaboration.”

AB 825 passed 34-0 in the Senate on Friday and 74-1 in the Assembly on Saturday.

But critics worry that joining a regional grid with other states that don’t all share California’s decarbonization goals could link the Golden State with those like Wyoming that use coal-fired power plants.

“This concerns us because the federal government has recently forced customers in other regional markets to pay increased costs to prop up fossil (fuel) generation facilities at risk of retirement,” Lee Trotman, communications director for The Utility Reform Network, known as TURN, said in an email. “TURN asks each policymaker to do everything you can to make sure, that TURN’s warnings about AB 825 never come to pass.”

Boosting in-state oil

Senate Bill 237, which also zoomed through the Legislature with large bipartisan support, passed amid worries that California’s already high gasoline prices may climb even higher.

Phillips 66 plans to shut down its twin refineries in Carson and Wilmington by the end of this year and Valero recently gave notice it will shut down operations at its refinery in the Northern California city of Benicia by 2026. The Valero and Phillips 66 facilities combine to account for roughly 18% of the state’s crude oil capacity.

In the wake of the pending closures, the California Energy Commission sent Newsom a series of recommendations to bolster stability to the petroleum market.

SB 237 includes provisions aimed at increasing crude oil production in the state, particularly in the Bakersfield area where the largest concentration of derricks are located.

“This legislation will protect consumers from supply disruptions, provide investor confidence in the state’s energy sector and ensure Kern County continues to lead with both environmental responsibility and energy reliability,” the Kern County Board of Supervisors said in a statement.

But a coalition of environmental groups decried SB 237, saying it runs counter to the state’s clean energy goals.

“More in-state drilling will not prevent inevitable refinery closures or guarantee lower gas prices,” said the group that included Sierra Club California, the Natural Resources Defense Council and California Environmental Voters. “Additional permits will not change the fact that California oil fields are in decline, nearly completely depleted, but will worsen racial and climate injustice.

Keeping cap and trade going

Since 2013, California participates in a cap-and-trade program that requires power plants, natural gas providers and large industries that emit greenhouse gases to buy permits on the carbon pollution they produce.

The Legislature over the weekend passed Assembly Bill 1207, which extends the program for the next 20 years, and Senate Bill 840 that will distribute the estimated $60 billion to $90 billion of revenue among various air, water and fire prevention programs aimed at reducing emissions.

The legislation also earmarks $20 billion that will go to the state’s controversial and expensive high-speed rail project.

“By aligning the future of cap and trade with the timeline of California’s ambitious emission reduction targets, California is positioned to achieve its climate goals in the most cost-effective way possible,” said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California state director of the Environmental Defense Fund.

AB 1207 renames the cap-and trade program as the California Cap-And-Invest Program.

Despite the passage of AB 1207 and SB 840, a large number of Republicans voted against the two bills, with some complaining about the lack of funding for agricultural projects in the program.

Wildfires and utilities

A wide-ranging piece of legislation, Senate Bill 254 raises $18 billion to shore up the state’s Wildfire Fund, which some worry will get depleted after January’s deadly fires in the Los Angeles area.

Under SB 254, the state’s big investor-owned utilities (including San Diego Gas & Electric) would combine to pay for half of the $18 billion total while electricity customers across California would pay the other $9 billion over a 10-year period.

The bill also creates low-interest loans to cover the construction of new transmission lines and prohibits utilities from earning a rate of return on the first $6 billion they spend on their upgrades on wildfire prevention.

Those provisions and others, SB 254’s supporters say, can help reduce monthly electric bills for customers across the state.

“There are pieces that some of us like and some of us don’t,” Sen. Aisha Wahab, D-Fremont, told Politico, “but this is a very large collaboration.”

This development will be supported by an average annual growth rate of 8 %, driven by favourable national policies, increasing grid stability needs and the expansion of renewable energy.

Chile leads regional installations

Chile will account for nearly half of the installed capacity in the region by that time, confirming its leading role in the energy storage sector. The country relies on an advanced regulatory framework that structures investment around large-scale projects. Mexico and the Dominican Republic complete the top three. Despite strong potential, Mexico is facing regulatory hurdles, while the Dominican Republic is showing rapid sectoral growth.

Utility-scale projects dominate

Utility-scale installations will overwhelmingly dominate the market. In Central America and the Caribbean, these projects are mostly standalone and aim to stabilise the grid. In contrast, countries in South America and Mexico are focusing on solar-paired systems, driven by high photovoltaic penetration. The commercial and industrial segment could gradually emerge in some countries from the mid-2030s.

Climate targets and tenders as drivers

National renewable energy targets and rising curtailment levels are pushing governments to integrate storage into their energy planning. Regional tenders have proven effective in driving projects, notably through the adoption of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). Several countries have already included long-term storage targets in their national plans.

Structural challenges remain

Despite growth prospects, the absence of comprehensive regulatory frameworks hampers BESS deployment. The lack of operational models and remuneration mechanisms for each market segment is slowing the structuring of the sector. In addition, high upfront costs persist in some markets, although they are expected to decline with the entry of new players.

The two companies completed a power purchase agreement (PPA) for the full output – all 851 megawatts (MW) – of three Texas solar farms. Together, those plants are expected to deliver 1.8 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, the equivalent of enough electricity to power 150,000 homes. That makes this Enel’s largest corporate PPA worldwide.

Michele Di Murro, CEO of Enel North America, said the deal “shows how renewables are among the fastest and most affordable solutions to meet the nation’s energy needs.

For Mars, the move goes beyond just greening its own factories. Kevin Rabinovitch, global VP of sustainability at Mars, explained that this PPA “lets us bring demand for all the electricity used in our value chain to the clean energy market in a highly efficient manner. The more demand we create together, the faster we can build the future we all want.”

One such avenue is the monetization of tax credits, particularly the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which has long been a cornerstone of U.S. renewable energy policy. However, recent inquiries into Opal Fuels' strategies—specifically, its purported use of “IRA Investment Tax Credits”—reveal a critical ambiguity in terminology and practice that merits closer examination.

The IRA-ITC Confusion: A Taxonomy of Terms

The confusion stems from the dual meanings of “IRA.” While the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 has expanded tax incentives for clean energy projectsIndividual retirement arrangements (IRAs) | Internal Revenue Service[ 1 ], the acronym is also widely associated with Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), which are tax-advantaged savings vehicles for individualsIndividual Retirement Account (IRA): What It Is, 4 Types[ 2 ]. Crucially, the IRS does not link IRAs to ITCs for sustainable energy projectsIndividual retirement arrangements (IRAs) | Internal Revenue Service[ 3 ]. This semantic misalignment highlights a broader challenge: companies and investors must navigate a complex regulatory framework where terms like “IRA” can obscure rather than clarify opportunities.

For context, traditional ITCs for renewable energy—such as those for solar, wind, and geothermal projects—are distinct from IRA retirement accounts. These credits, which reduce a company's tax liability in proportion to its investment in qualifying projects, have been instrumental in scaling clean energy infrastructureWhich IRA is right for you? Different types of IRA accounts[ 4 ]. The Inflation Reduction Act has further enhanced these incentives, extending and expanding ITC eligibility to a broader range of technologies and projectsIndividual Retirement Account (IRA): Types, How It Works[ 5 ].

Industry Practices: Monetizing ITCs for ESG-Aligned Capital Deployment

While Opal Fuels' specific strategies remain opaque, industry practices offer a blueprint for how companies might leverage ITCs to fund sustainable energy projects. The process typically involves three stages:

1. Project Development: Companies identify qualifying projects (e.g., solar farms, energy storage systems) under the ITC framework.

2. Credit Allocation: Tax credits are either retained to reduce corporate tax burdens or sold to third parties (e.g., banks, institutional investors) via tax equity partnershipsIndividual retirement arrangements (IRAs) | Internal Revenue Service[ 6 ].

3. ESG Integration: Proceeds from credit monetization are reinvested into ESG-aligned initiatives, such as community resilience programs or carbon capture technologies.

This model has proven particularly effective in sectors where upfront capital costs are high but long-term environmental benefits are substantial. For instance, data from BloombergNEF indicates that tax equity financing accounted for over 40% of U.S. solar project funding in 2024, underscoring its role in de-risking clean energy investments.

The ESG Imperative: Aligning Profit and Purpose

The strategic monetization of ITCs is not merely a financial tactic but a tool for advancing ESG goals. By converting tax credits into liquidity, companies can fund projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance energy access, and create local jobs—all while maintaining profitability. This dual benefit is especially critical as institutional investors increasingly demand transparency in ESG reporting and impact measurement.

However, challenges persist. The Inflation Reduction Act's expanded incentives have also intensified competition for limited tax equity capital, driving up the cost of credit sales. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties—such as potential changes to ITC eligibility criteria—require companies to adopt agile, forward-looking strategies.

Conclusion: A Path Forward for Sustainable Capital Deployment

While Opal Fuels' role in this ecosystem remains undefined, the broader industry's approach to ITC monetization offers valuable lessons. For companies seeking to balance financial and environmental objectives, the key lies in leveraging tax incentives as a bridge between capital efficiency and ESG alignment. As the clean energy transition accelerates, the ability to navigate these incentives will distinguish market leaders from laggards.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd27fae8d38001.png,N,,2025-09-16 00:00:14.549923

West Virginia has cut its carbon dioxide emissions in the past two decades, and by more than you might expect.

West Virginia saw a 33% reduction in per-capita CO2 emissions from 2005 to 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That’s higher than the national average reduction of 30%, and higher than big states such as New York, California and Texas.

Still, the state remains the nation’s most reliant on coal to generate electricity, and coal is a major source of CO2.

The state’s coal fleet operates less frequently than it did 20 years ago, and some coal plants have closed in that time.

Nationally, coal has fallen from producing nearly half of electricity to about 15% last year.

“I am not looking into any federal grants.","President Donald Trump’s efforts to stamp out his predecessor’s climate legacy are making some nonprofits and local governments wary of relying on Uncle Sam.

Since Trump took office, his administration has clawed back billions of dollars in federal grants, leaving climate and resiliency projects in the lurch and casting doubt on whether promises of funding from the federal government are as dependable as they once were, writes my colleague Alex Guillén.

The tiny village of Kipnuk, Alaska, for example, suddenly lost a $20 million grant to build a rock wall and take other steps to stop homes from falling into a river. In Mississippi, a nonprofit saw two grants terminated: $500,000 to turn dilapidated housing lots into community parks and $20 million for a solar-powered hurricane shelter.

With cash abruptly stripped away, local governments and organizations have been scrambling for other ways to fund these projects. The experience has left them feeling dismayed at federal agencies that had long been a reliable source of support.

“My mind was like, how could they terminate the grant, even when we did not do anything wrong?” Rayna Paul, Kipnuk’s environmental director, told Alex.

Federal agencies have long been critical in supporting resiliency projects in small communities across the country, but former President Joe Biden’s 2022 climate law opened the door for larger projects to be funded wholly by the U.S. government. That meant less cobbling together of funding from various donors or benefactors.

But now that money is gone. And while some groups have sued over the reneged grants, some federal courts are siding with the Trump administration, taking the lead of the Supreme Court.

Applying for federal awards can be both tedious and time consuming. If federal grants are now also unreliable, some recipients doubt they will seek support from Washington in the future.

“I am not looking into any federal grants. The risk is way too high, and the effort is way too large,” said Dominika Parry, with the nonprofit 2°C Mississippi, which spent 10 months working with the Environmental Protection Agency on its grant application to make microparks out of home lots.

For larger nonprofits, grant cuts have been major disappointments but not dire.

GRID Alternatives, a California nonprofit with a staff of roughly 500, will likely scale back its ambitions after it lost more than $300 million in federal grants to expand its work funding solar projects on low-income housing and tribal lands.

At smaller groups, the cuts have been more damaging. Parry has started to work without pay to cut costs. She said The Hartford, the Connecticut-based insurance company that provides 2°C with basic general liability coverage, also told her recently that it will not renew the nonprofit’s policy. The reason: insuring environmental groups is too risky.

Sierra Club gets new leader

The Sierra Club has a new boss after years of internal turbulence and leadership drama, writes Robin Bravender.

The environmental group’s board unanimously voted Saturday to hire Loren Blackford as executive director. Blackford has been a leader at the Sierra Club for nearly two decades, including serving as deputy executive director, as president and as the Sierra Club Foundation board chair.

The move comes after the board fired Ben Jealous from the executive director position in August “for cause” following “extensive evaluation of his conduct.”

Jealous was the subject of a sexual harassment complaint earlier this year, a person familiar with the details of the complaint told POLITICO’s E&E News. Jealous, the former head of the NAACP and the Sierra Club’s first Black leader, said he faced discrimination and a campaign against him during his time leading the group.

Hurricanes, with a side of measles?

Florida’s plans to scrap its vaccine requirements could increase the risk of disease outbreaks during future hurricane seasons, writes Ariel Wittenberg.

The state’s surgeon general announced this month that Florida’s Department of Health would begin the process of allowing people to opt out of vaccine mandates for “personal health benefits.” Public health experts worry that the policy could make matters worse during future hurricane seasons, as climate change fuels stronger storms in the Atlantic.

“Something like measles is so infectious, it would go through a hurricane shelter like wildfire,” said Katie Huffling, executive director for the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.

Long road ahead for Alaska LNG

The lead developer of Alaska LNG touted new deals last week, but the mammoth liquefied natural gas project remains far from the finish line, writes Carlos Anchondo.

The project aims to build a natural gas pipeline across the state, along with an export terminal. Majority owner Glenfarne Group unveiled two new partnerships last week — one with JERA, Japan’s largest power generation company, and another with POSCO International, a South Korean trading and investment company.

The project also has the support of the Trump administration, with Energy Secretary Chris Wright calling it “one of the greatest energy infrastructure projects in our nation’s history.” But Alaska has been trying to build a gas pipeline for decades, and it’s no small feat.

“It’s a tall order and it’s an expensive order,” said Brigham McCown, a senior fellow and director of the Initiative on American Energy Security at the Hudson Institute.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Electric-Grid.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:49.209081

(Erie News Now) — Solar energy advocates are warning Americans could see higher electricity bills, in part, due to clean energy rollbacks they say are squeezing supply as demand surges.

Advocates say the fight isn’t just about clean energy — it’s about pocketbook issues for families and businesses.

With electricity demand climbing, the industry warns that rolling back solar could leave Americans paying more while losing the upper hand in the clean-tech and AI race to global rivals.

The U.S. solar industry is on the rise, adding 18 gigawatts of new power in just the first half of 2025. That’s more than half of all new capacity to the grid—but momentum may be dimming.

“Demand is rising at a time when the federal government is trying to constrict supply,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

She says in most markets, solar is the most affordable form of energy — and that putting more affordable supply on the grid drives down costs for everybody.

But a new report by the SEIA found that Americans are on track to face higher energy bills. The potential cost increase comes after big changes to phase out Biden-era clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act. The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, phases out many of the clean energy tax credits.

“Since the passage of the Big, Beautiful Bill, we have seen a number of things happen,” said Ross Hopper. “The federal government has begun to use all the tools at its disposal to make it harder to build solar and storage projects across the country.”

Ross Hopper says the changes and other federal cuts threaten up to 55 gigawatts of solar by 2030, a 25% drop.

“You don’t have to have a policy in economics to know what happens then. Electricity prices are rising. We’ve already seen a 10% year-over-year increase in electricity prices. That’s going to continue if we continue to limit supply,” said Ross Hopper.

Solar supporters argue fast, affordable projects are key to meeting skyrocketing demand from data centers, EVs and other emerging tech. But not everyone supports using taxpayer dollars to meet that demand.

“There’s an old saying, if it’s market ready, you don’t have to subsidize it,” said Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.). “I am not against solar, I’m not against wind, I’m not against any of it. But I like sustainable power, sustainable energy sources. And while that may be important right now, should we be subsidizing it? We’ve got to be careful what we’re spending money on and what we’re subsidizing.”

Solar advocates stress it's not just a blue-state issue. 77% of all solar capacity installed this year has been built in states won by President Trump, including eight of the top 10 solar-leading states.

“The political backlash against solar and storage is impacting the very constituents that voted for President Trump,” said Ross Hopper.",https://WICU.images.worldnow.com/images/26602107_G.jpeg,N,,2025-09-15 18:00:13.049569

A bipartisan House proposal to “modernize” the National Environmental Policy Act has support from electric utilities who say it would help them build generation and transmission capacity they need to maintain the reliability of the nation’s electric grid.

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act would shorten permitting timelines, simplify the analysis NEPA requires, establish judicial review limitations and limit the use of procedural efforts to block projects, according to bill sponsors.

“The problems with the NEPA process are energy-neutral,” Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, said Wednesday at a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing. “They can be detrimental to both fossil fuel and renewable energy projects. … These problems with NEPA can cut both ways, and so, too, should the solutions. This is a pro-energy bill that takes an all-of-the-above, technology-neutral approach.”

Dive Insight:

Permitting reform has drawn bipartisan efforts in recent years, but previous proposals failed to yield results. With the nation’s electric grid facing rapid demand growth, renewed efforts have focused on the need add resources and maintain reliability.

Golden and Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, introduced the SPEED Act in July.

“We need robust power production and transmission to achieve energy dominance and lower costs. ... But NEPA has been warped over time to become a law that allows endless lawsuits and bureaucracy,” Golden said.

According to a summary of the legislation Golden provided, the SPEED Act will

Focus environmental reviews on “direct, significant impacts rather than hypothetical or tenuously connected effects.”

Create “reasonable timelines” for agency decisionmaking.

Streamline judicial reviews.

Clarify when a NEPA review is triggered by refining the definition of major federal action.

The MFA category “has grown so broad that nearly any federal action or funding can trigger a lengthy, complex review,” Golden’s statement said.

At Wednesday’s hearing, ClearPath Action CEO Jeremy Harrell said the broken permitting system is “the single largest barrier to deploying new clean energy in this country,” with solar energy projects facing the highest rate of NEPA litigation of all energy sources. “There’s a major challenge here.”

Electric utilities are supporting the legislation.

“Streamlining outdated permitting processes will help America’s electric companies better serve our customers and help our nation achieve energy dominance,” Edison Electric Institute President and CEO Drew Maloney said in a statement. “We ... urge Congress to advance this common-sense legislation that meaningfully removes roadblocks and supports the infrastructure that powers communities across America.” The group represents investor-owned utilities.

The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association is also backing the SPEED Act. The group said the legislation will streamline NEPA requirements on electric cooperatives applying for federal permits to build new generation, transmission and distribution capacity.

“One of the big changes in the bill is that receiving federal grants or other types of funding would no longer automatically trigger NEPA, meaning co-ops wouldn’t have to go through the review process every time they get federal money for an improvement project,” the group said.

However, Robert Glicksman, a professor of environmental law at the George Washington University Law School, cautioned against passing the SPEED Act now.

“Even if Congress is intent on revising NEPA, this is the wrong time to do it,” he said. Congress made changes to NEPA in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, and the Supreme Court has recently shifted judicial review toward greater deference to agencies in their NEPA preparations, he noted.

“It would make more sense to step back and evaluate the impacts of these developments, before rewriting the statute again,” Glicksman said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/5DoSHcBkdNB-Fffs8w41xsdSu1BjEsFh0Gxva_MmWGg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ORVBBcGFuZWwucG5n.webp,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:36.106658

South Carolina Production Takes Shape

The Terra and Traveler are slated to enter production in 2027 at a new factory in Blythewood, South Carolina. Recent construction updates show significant progress on the facility, which features a body shop, a paint shop, and final assembly buildings, plus a state-of-the-art training center and technology center.

The production facility is likely part of Volkswagen’s $10 billion investment deal with the government in exchange for tariff relief. Scout Motors targets late 2027 for start of production, with both vehicles debuting as 2028 models.

India has emerged as a leader in clean energy within the G20. In fact, India became the first G20 country to meet its Paris Agreement commitments, and it has set an ambitious target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity by 2030. To reach this goal, India’s renewable power fleet has grown dramatically. Installed renewables (including large hydro) topped 203 GW by late 2024, up from roughly 75 GW a decade earlier. (Excluding large hydro, capacity jumped from about 39 GW in 2015 to 137 GW by early 2024.) This rapid expansion – often cited as roughly a 135% increase over FY15–FY24 – reflects strong policy support and investment. Such growth puts India on track to meet its 500 GW by 2030 goal, about 200 GW of which has already been built and underpins its clean-energy commitments on the world stage.

The role of energy storage in the renewable ecosystem

Energy storage is critical to make this renewable build-out reliable and sustainable. By buffering supply and demand, storage smooths the variability of solar and wind, improving grid stability and power quality. Storage systems also enable “time-shifting” of energy – charging when the sun is shining or wind is blowing and discharging during peak demand – which allows much higher penetration of renewables and deferral of costly grid upgrades. These services not only stabilize the grid, but they also boost energy access (by firming up intermittent power) and reduce emissions (by displacing fossil peakers).

The impact is already visible, today nearly half of India’s generation capacity is non-fossil. Renewables alone accounted for about 46% of total installed capacity by late 2024. Energy storage will be key to maintaining and growing this share of clean energy as India expands its solar and wind fleets.

Current energy storage landscape in India

India’s energy storage sector is still emerging, but growth and planning are rapid. Today, pumped hydro storage provides most bulk storage (existing projects total only a few gigawatts and hundreds of megawatt-hours), while grid-scale batteries are just beginning to roll out. Looking ahead, analyses see a big surge in storage needs. For example, the Central Electricity Authority projects 32 GW/160 GWh of battery storage will be needed by 2030 to support the 500 GW renewables target which consistent with industry estimates of ~160 Gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2030.

To meet this demand, the government is focusing on key areas:

Electric vehicles and battery manufacturing are high priorities: India has pushed EV adoption (with targets like 30% electric vehicle sales by 2030) and launched Production-Linked Incentive schemes to scale up local battery production. This will not only decarbonize transport but also build out battery supply for the grid.

At the same time, policy and infrastructure efforts are integrating storage with solar parks and hybrid projects. For instance, new solar parks increasingly include co-located battery storage, and large hybrid wind-solar parks (with storage) are being planned to balance output.

Experts note that innovations like vehicle-to-grid integration and hybrid renewable-plus-storage projects will further enhance grid reliability and security. In short, the ESS industry in India is gearing up – backed by government targets and new policies – to play a central role in the country’s clean-energy transition.

Key projects and developments

Combined, these PSUs have earmarked over Rs. 25,000 crore (US$ 3 billion) for clean energy initiatives involving storage over the next 5–7 years. The public sector's entry gives confidence to private players, ensuring that storage is not just an add-on, but a core asset in India's power ecosystem.

Types of energy storage technologies

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)

Lithium-ion BESS is the most widely deployed technology due to high energy density, modularity, and cost decline. For example, Tata Power commissioned a 10 MWh BESS in Delhi, while JSW Energy is building a 500 MWh project under SECI’s standalone BESS tender. BESS is crucial for peak load shaving and renewable firming.

Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS)

India’s 4.8 GW of installed PHS includes projects like Tehri (Uttarakhand) and Purulia (West Bengal). These systems pump water to a higher elevation during surplus and release it to generate electricity during peak demand. NHPC and SJVN are exploring over 15 GW of new PHS capacity, particularly in hilly states.

Thermal Energy Storage

Used in industrial and CSP applications, thermal storage involves heat retention in media like molten salt. The NTPC Dadri plant evaluated a thermal energy storage pilot with phase change materials. L&T is also involved in developing CSP-based hybrid thermal storage solutions, aimed at supporting industrial load balancing and process heat needs.

Flow Batteries and Hydrogen Storage

Flow batteries, like vanadium redox, offer scalable long-duration storage with better safety. IIT Madras and IOCL are piloting flow battery prototypes. On the hydrogen front, NTPC is developing a green hydrogen project in Leh, integrating BESS and electrolysers to store energy as hydrogen, enabling seasonal storage and grid decarbonisation.

Policy and regulatory support

Recognising the strategic importance of energy storage, the Indian government has rolled out several initiatives:

Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Batteries: Allocated Rs. 18,100 crore (US$ 2.14 billion) to support domestic manufacturing.

Draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill: Proposed inclusion of energy storage as a distinct asset class.

Energy Storage Roadmap by MNRE and NITI Aayog: Outlines capacity needs, technology preferences, and investment frameworks.

Additionally, states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu are formulating storage policies in-line with their renewable energy goals.

Energy storage is the missing puzzle from India's clean energy journey. It promises to carry the load of ambition and action by making renewable energy dispatchable, reliable, and sustainable. Consequently, with technology costs being reduced, policy support growing, and innovations being accelerated, India is very well positioned to becoming an international leader in energy storage solutions.

Unlocking this potential will ensure energy security and climate resilience along with job creation, import dependency reduction, and enabling a sustainable future.",,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:20.648211

Letter to the editor Posted September 14, 2025 ( The Virginian Pilot and Daily Press)

Offshore wind off the Virginia Beach coast means reliable power for families, new jobs for our communities, and more substantial support for our military bases.

Speaker Mike Johnson’s recent support for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project is more than welcome—it is necessary. This project will power more than 600,000 homes, strengthen our military bases, and position Virginia as a leader in securing America’s energy future.

For too long, debates over energy have been framed as either/or. Either fossil fuels or renewables. Either traditional energy or innovation. The truth is, we need it all. As Congresswoman Jen Kiggans has rightly argued, an “all-of-the-above” approach is not just good policy—it’s common sense.

Energy security is one of the great national security challenges of our time. Our adversaries are pouring billions into alternative energy to modernize their grids and reduce vulnerabilities. If we ignore clean energy, we fall behind. Offshore wind is not a luxury—it is a strategic necessity.

For Virginia, the benefits are undeniable. This project creates jobs, expands local supply chains, and generates private investment in our communities. It strengthens the infrastructure that keeps our military ready and our lights on. And it ensures the Commonwealth is not just a consumer of energy, but a driver of innovation.

That is why it is so encouraging to see Speaker Johnson and Congresswoman Kiggans urging the Trump Administration to prioritize this project. Their leadership shows that clean energy is not a partisan cause—it is an American imperative. Offshore wind is about security, prosperity, and keeping Virginia—and America—strong.

By diversifying its monetization strategies—combining direct sales, joint ventures, and government grants—Opal Fuels can create a resilient financial model.","The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 has reshaped the U.S. clean energy landscape, offering a suite of tax credits and incentives designed to accelerate the transition to sustainable infrastructure. For companies like

, which operates at the intersection of energy innovation and infrastructure development, these provisions present a unique opportunity to scale operations while leveraging federal support. While direct information on Opal Fuels' specific IRA strategies remains scarce, industry trends and the broader context of clean energy investment suggest a compelling narrative for how tax credit monetization could drive its growth.

The IRA's Role in Clean Energy Infrastructure

The IRA builds on the foundational work of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which emphasized modernizing infrastructure to reduce carbon footprints and enhance energy efficiency : Why we must invest in sustainable infrastructure[ 1 ]. The 2022 legislation expands this vision by introducing tax credits for renewable energy projects, carbon capture technologies, and grid modernization. These incentives are not merely subsidies but tools for monetizing environmental value—transforming emissions reductions and energy efficiency gains into quantifiable financial assets.

For instance, the IRA's 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and storage offers up to $90 per metric ton of CO₂ sequestered, creating a revenue stream for companies that integrate these technologies into their operations. Similarly, the 48C Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit provides grants or tax reductions for domestic production of clean energy components, incentivizing supply chain localization. These mechanisms align with Opal Fuels' stated focus on decarbonizing energy systems, suggesting a natural fit for leveraging IRA provisions.

Tax Credit Monetization: A Strategic Imperative

Monetizing tax credits is increasingly becoming a core competency for clean energy firms. According to a report by BloombergNEF, companies that effectively structure their projects to access tax incentives can reduce capital costs by 20–30%, significantly improving return on investment . For Opal Fuels, this could mean partnering with tax equity investors—entities that provide capital in exchange for the right to claim tax credits—or directly selling credits to corporations seeking to meet environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets.

The latter strategy, in particular, has gained traction. Large corporations, including those in the tech and automotive sectors, are purchasing carbon credits and renewable energy certificates (RECs) to offset emissions. The IRA's enhanced credits make these assets more valuable, creating a secondary market where companies like Opal Fuels could generate recurring revenue. While no public announcements from Opal Fuels confirm such partnerships, the market dynamics strongly suggest this is a viable path.

Risks and Considerations

Despite the opportunities, tax credit monetization is not without challenges. Regulatory complexity, project development timelines, and market volatility in credit pricing could delay returns. Additionally, the IRA's phase-out provisions for certain credits after 2032 introduce long-term uncertainty. Investors must also weigh the risk of over-reliance on federal policy, which remains subject to political shifts.

However, for a company with Opal Fuels' technical expertise and infrastructure focus, these risks are manageable. By diversifying its monetization strategies—combining direct sales, joint ventures, and government grants—Opal Fuels can create a resilient financial model. This approach mirrors that of industry leaders like NextEra Energy and

, which have successfully integrated tax credits into their growth strategies.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for Growth

While Opal Fuels has not yet disclosed specific IRA-related projects, the alignment between its business model and the Act's incentives is clear. By treating tax credits as a strategic asset rather than a peripheral benefit, the company can accelerate its clean energy transition while generating value for stakeholders. For investors, this represents an opportunity to back a firm positioned to capitalize on one of the most transformative policy frameworks in U.S. history.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd1a888b938005.png,N,,2025-09-16 00:00:18.516056

Utility-scale solar capacity accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. solar capacity.
Although the project’s half-million First Solar solar panels are arrayed on 2,000 acres in Arkansas, the power they generate supplies GM plants in Michigan and Missouri.
Throughout the company’s advanced manufacturing and warehousing operations, solar energy is used to charge IoT systems, automation and robotics, and battery-powered industrial vehicles.","Imagine pulling into your work parking spot and leaving your vehicle in a shaded carport topped by solar panels that generate electricity for the lights and equipment inside the building.

Since 2023, that’s what workers at a First Solar Inc. production facility in Ohio have done. As such, they’ve followed in the footsteps—or tire tracks—of First Solar facilities in Germany, Vietnam and Malaysia.

Why should other companies follow First Solar’s lead? Helena Jochberger, global industry lead for information technology and business consultant firm CGI Inc., Montreal, outlined the strategic benefits for using use renewable energy.

“It not only reduces their carbon footprint and aligns them closer with ESG (environmental, social and governance) commitments and regulations, distributed energy resources (DERs)—like solar panels, wind-generation units and battery storage—empower companies to boost energy independence and resilience over a long period of time,” she explains. “By harnessing DERs to become their own energy producers, manufacturers take a more active role in their energy future in a market that is constantly changing. This makes achieving sustainability from an ESG and economic standpoint far more attainable.”

But implementing renewables is just the first step, according to Jochberger. Next is collecting data to demonstrate sustainability efforts and achievements. She cautions that when building a sustainability road map, companies need to collect accurate data about every step of their production process, from raw materials to a finished product.

“Leveraging digital tools like Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled energy monitoring and digital twins to help manufacturers deploy and monitor their renewable energy strategies can create even more value,” she says. “By tracking their progress and identifying inefficiencies in real time, manufacturers can not only generate their own power and reach net zero—they can do so efficiently and at scale.”

CGI client LKAB Minerals Ltd., a public iron ore mining company in Sweden, is in a joint effort to use hydrogen in its operations to reduce CO2 emissions, with the goal of fossil-free steel by 2035. Although solar power is not in its arsenal, LKAB does use alternative energy from wind and hydropower.

“If you have started that transition (to alternative energy), speed up,” Stefan Savonen, LKAB’s vice president of energy, advised in a recent podcast. “If you haven’t started, it’s time to start. Climate is a driving force, but a large part is also business. There is this huge business opportunity for the company, for yourself and for your well-being to start now … no time to lose.”

As a solar panel manufacturer, it’s no surprise that First Solar would have taken Savonen’s advice as well as the extra step of installing shaded photovoltaic (PV) carports. But the company’s solar efforts go beyond this.

Globally, First Solar’s PV arrays generated 7.5 million kWh in 2023, according to the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report. At an average yearly use of 10,800 kWh in an American home, that’s enough energy to power nearly 700 homes.

In 2021, First Solar set a goal of using 30% less energy per watt produced by 2028, compared with its 2020 usage. By 2023, it was halfway to that metric. And by 2026, First Solar set a target of powering 100% of its U.S. operations with renewable energy. It set a similar goal—100% renewable energy—for global operations by 2028.

In addition to PV carports, the company uses a variety of tactics to meet these goals, First Solar said in the 2023 report. “Since 2009, we have successfully reduced our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, water and waste intensity per watt produced by implementing resource conservation and low-carbon projects at our facilities and through improvements in module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, manufacturing yield and capacity utilization.”

Let the Sun Shine

By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total solar capacity of 139 gigawatts (GW)— an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022, according to Climate Central’s report, “A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power.” Citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the report says U.S. installations produced 238,121 GWh (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023—more than eight times the amount generated in 2014.

Utility-scale solar capacity accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. solar capacity. In 2023, utility-scale solar comprised around 8% of the nation’s total electricity capacity from all utility-scale sources (renewables, nuclear and fossil fuels), compared to about 1% in 2014, Climate Central says. And most of the nation’s new energy capacity is expected to come from renewable sources such solar and wind— shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) that produce carbon pollution, EIA forecasts.

Much of the capacity is being used by the manufacturing industry--and such efforts are becoming increasingly visible. Drivers on northbound Interstate I-75 in Saginaw, Mich., for example, can’t help but be struck by some 17,000 solar panels that help power Nexteer Automotive Group Ltd.’s facility, which supplies motion-control technology to domestic and international automakers. Developed in partnership with NorthStar Clean Energy, a subsidiary of CMS Energy Corp. that is the parent company of Michigan utility Consumers Energy, the prominent array started providing renewable energy to the 25-acre site in May 2024.

In addition to reducing operational costs, Nexteer expects the following results from its Saginaw solar array:

Lowering GHG emissions by 7,000 metric tons annually, which is equivalent to saving about 788,000 gallons of gasoline per year, based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s conversion calculator

Preparing Nexteer for growing expectations of its OEM customers for a sustainable supply chain

Supporting progress toward global clean-energy transition via enablers such as renewables, energy efficiency and electrification—as well as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, such as: Affordable and Clean Energy (No. 7); Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (No. 9); and Climate Action (No. 13)

One-fifth of Nexteer’s global energy comes from renewable sources, according to its 2024 Sustainability Report. “We continue to advance our climate road map strategy across global operations based on a portfolio of energy-efficiency measures, solar projects and power purchase agreement (PPA) initiatives (see sidebar p. XX). Additionally, efforts like our PPA in Mexico are supporting regional and community goals to green the electric grid,” according to the report.

Power Sharing

Three General Motors Co. assembly plants get their electricity from NorthStar’s 410,000-mWh Newport Solar project in Newport, Ark., through a 15-year PPA. Although the project’s half-million First Solar solar panels are arrayed on 2,000 acres in Arkansas, the power they generate supplies GM plants in Michigan and Missouri.

The PPA is the automotive company’s largest one yet, and a milestone in GM becoming carbon-neutral by 2040.

In 2022, GM finalized agreements to secure 100% of the electricity needed to power all of its U.S. sites with renewables by the end of 2025, according to an August 2024 article in GM News. However, the company’s 2023 sustainability report “Journey to Zero” reported it achieved just 39% of its goal of “sourcing 100% renewable electricity globally by 2035.”

While Nexteer and GM use huge solar arrays that occupy acreage to power their operations, others in the manufacturing sector plan to use rooftop solar to source their electricity, depending on the level of their energy use and their geographic location, according to a 2023 study by a group of engineers at Northeastern University.

“Our findings show that light manufacturing sectors such as furniture and apparel can cover their average net annual electricity demand by utilizing their own rooftop potential in locations across the country, while several other sectors can achieve electricity self-sufficiency but in a smaller subset of U.S. locations,” the authors wrote in “Technical Feasibility of Powering U.S. Manufacturing with Rooftop Solar PV.”

In spring and summer, nearly 40% of three-digit manufacturing sectors (i.e., specific subsectors in the North American Industry Classification System) could utilize solar PV for their electricity needs in the U.S. Southwest, according to the study.

“Regions like the Southeast that have a large concentration of low-electricity-intensity furniture and textile product operations will have greater opportunities to convert to full on-site generation,” according to the study. “In contrast, high-electricity-intensity food processing operations in the Southwest will struggle to generate enough electricity on-site to cover demand, despite a favorable solar resource.”

Results Start on the Roof

Two companies using rooftop solar include a Midwest-based furniture manufacturer and a solar-car startup in California.

In 2019, Ashley Furniture Industries Inc., Arcadia, Wisc., embarked on a multiphase project to install solar panels on 10 of its largest U.S. facilities, including its advanced manufacturing headquarters in Arcadia.

Throughout the company’s advanced manufacturing and warehousing operations, solar energy is used to charge IoT systems, automation and robotics, and battery-powered industrial vehicles. Ashley’s solar panel installations are expected to generate about 25 million kWh annually, according to an update in the company’s 2024 Corporate Social Responsibility report.

At Aptera Motors Corp., Carlsbad, Calif., the vehicle maker’s product-design goal meshes with that of its building’s owner. Aptera’s solar-powered vehicle’s battery, frame and body are produced in a two-story facility topped by 892 Silfab solar panels. “The system’s estimated annual output of 703,284 kWh provides nearly all the energy that Aptera will use each year,” according to a Silfab Solar case study.

“The fusion generator in the sky, the sun, is a renewable energy source that we will continue to utilize in every shape and form,” Aptera Co-CEO Chris Anthony said in another case study.

“Our mission is clear: move towards a sustainable future that empowers people around the world to get where they need to go with less impact on the planet and little need to pull from an external power source,” Anthony continues. “We hope to inspire other companies to do the same, and we could not be prouder of the brighter future we are building.”",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/advancedmanufacturing.org/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/8c/68c2606d-de01-4fce-9d91-01eef0be7af4/68c8643926ab9.image.jpg?crop=844%2C443%2C115%2C0,N,,2025-09-15 22:00:59.812582

Why should other companies follow First Solar’s lead? Helena Jochberger, global industry lead for information technology and business consultant firm CGI Inc., Montreal, outlined the strategic benefits for using use renewable energy.

“It not only reduces their carbon footprint and aligns them closer with ESG (environmental, social and governance) commitments and regulations, distributed energy resources (DERs)—like solar panels, wind-generation units and battery storage—empower companies to boost energy independence and resilience over a long period of time,” she explains. “By harnessing DERs to become their own energy producers, manufacturers take a more active role in their energy future in a market that is constantly changing. This makes achieving sustainability from an ESG and economic standpoint far more attainable.”

But implementing renewables is just the first step, according to Jochberger. Next is collecting data to demonstrate sustainability efforts and achievements. She cautions that when building a sustainability road map, companies need to collect accurate data about every step of their production process, from raw materials to a finished product.

“Leveraging digital tools like Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled energy monitoring and digital twins to help manufacturers deploy and monitor their renewable energy strategies can create even more value,” she says. “By tracking their progress and identifying inefficiencies in real time, manufacturers can not only generate their own power and reach net zero—they can do so efficiently and at scale.”

CGI client LKAB Minerals Ltd., a public iron ore mining company in Sweden, is in a joint effort to use hydrogen in its operations to reduce CO2 emissions, with the goal of fossil-free steel by 2035. Although solar power is not in its arsenal, LKAB does use alternative energy from wind and hydropower.

“If you have started that transition (to alternative energy), speed up,” Stefan Savonen, LKAB’s vice president of energy, advised in a recent podcast. “If you haven’t started, it’s time to start. Climate is a driving force, but a large part is also business. There is this huge business opportunity for the company, for yourself and for your well-being to start now … no time to lose.”

As a solar panel manufacturer, it’s no surprise that First Solar would have taken Savonen’s advice as well as the extra step of installing shaded photovoltaic (PV) carports. But the company’s solar efforts go beyond this.

Globally, First Solar’s PV arrays generated 7.5 million kWh in 2023, according to the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report. At an average yearly use of 10,800 kWh in an American home, that’s enough energy to power nearly 700 homes.

In 2021, First Solar set a goal of using 30% less energy per watt produced by 2028, compared with its 2020 usage. By 2023, it was halfway to that metric. And by 2026, First Solar set a target of powering 100% of its U.S. operations with renewable energy. It set a similar goal—100% renewable energy—for global operations by 2028.

In addition to PV carports, the company uses a variety of tactics to meet these goals, First Solar said in the 2023 report. “Since 2009, we have successfully reduced our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, water and waste intensity per watt produced by implementing resource conservation and low-carbon projects at our facilities and through improvements in module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, manufacturing yield and capacity utilization.”

Let the Sun Shine

By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total solar capacity of 139 gigawatts (GW)— an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022, according to Climate Central’s report, “A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power.” Citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the report says U.S. installations produced 238,121 GWh (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023—more than eight times the amount generated in 2014.

Utility-scale solar capacity accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. solar capacity. In 2023, utility-scale solar comprised around 8% of the nation’s total electricity capacity from all utility-scale sources (renewables, nuclear and fossil fuels), compared to about 1% in 2014, Climate Central says. And most of the nation’s new energy capacity is expected to come from renewable sources such solar and wind— shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) that produce carbon pollution, EIA forecasts.

Much of the capacity is being used by the manufacturing industry--and such efforts are becoming increasingly visible. Drivers on northbound Interstate I-75 in Saginaw, Mich., for example, can’t help but be struck by some 17,000 solar panels that help power Nexteer Automotive Group Ltd.’s facility, which supplies motion-control technology to domestic and international automakers. Developed in partnership with NorthStar Clean Energy, a subsidiary of CMS Energy Corp. that is the parent company of Michigan utility Consumers Energy, the prominent array started providing renewable energy to the 25-acre site in May 2024.

In addition to reducing operational costs, Nexteer expects the following results from its Saginaw solar array:

Lowering GHG emissions by 7,000 metric tons annually, which is equivalent to saving about 788,000 gallons of gasoline per year, based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s conversion calculator

Preparing Nexteer for growing expectations of its OEM customers for a sustainable supply chain

Supporting progress toward global clean-energy transition via enablers such as renewables, energy efficiency and electrification—as well as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, such as: Affordable and Clean Energy (No. 7); Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (No. 9); and Climate Action (No. 13)

One-fifth of Nexteer’s global energy comes from renewable sources, according to its 2024 Sustainability Report. “We continue to advance our climate road map strategy across global operations based on a portfolio of energy-efficiency measures, solar projects and power purchase agreement (PPA) initiatives (see sidebar p. XX). Additionally, efforts like our PPA in Mexico are supporting regional and community goals to green the electric grid,” according to the report.

Power Sharing

Three General Motors Co. assembly plants get their electricity from NorthStar’s 410,000-mWh Newport Solar project in Newport, Ark., through a 15-year PPA. Although the project’s half-million First Solar solar panels are arrayed on 2,000 acres in Arkansas, the power they generate supplies GM plants in Michigan and Missouri.

The PPA is the automotive company’s largest one yet, and a milestone in GM becoming carbon-neutral by 2040.

In 2022, GM finalized agreements to secure 100% of the electricity needed to power all of its U.S. sites with renewables by the end of 2025, according to an August 2024 article in GM News. However, the company’s 2023 sustainability report “Journey to Zero” reported it achieved just 39% of its goal of “sourcing 100% renewable electricity globally by 2035.”

While Nexteer and GM use huge solar arrays that occupy acreage to power their operations, others in the manufacturing sector plan to use rooftop solar to source their electricity, depending on the level of their energy use and their geographic location, according to a 2023 study by a group of engineers at Northeastern University.

“Our findings show that light manufacturing sectors such as furniture and apparel can cover their average net annual electricity demand by utilizing their own rooftop potential in locations across the country, while several other sectors can achieve electricity self-sufficiency but in a smaller subset of U.S. locations,” the authors wrote in “Technical Feasibility of Powering U.S. Manufacturing with Rooftop Solar PV.”

In spring and summer, nearly 40% of three-digit manufacturing sectors (i.e., specific subsectors in the North American Industry Classification System) could utilize solar PV for their electricity needs in the U.S. Southwest, according to the study.

“Regions like the Southeast that have a large concentration of low-electricity-intensity furniture and textile product operations will have greater opportunities to convert to full on-site generation,” according to the study. “In contrast, high-electricity-intensity food processing operations in the Southwest will struggle to generate enough electricity on-site to cover demand, despite a favorable solar resource.”

Results Start on the Roof

Two companies using rooftop solar include a Midwest-based furniture manufacturer and a solar-car startup in California.

In 2019, Ashley Furniture Industries Inc., Arcadia, Wisc., embarked on a multiphase project to install solar panels on 10 of its largest U.S. facilities, including its advanced manufacturing headquarters in Arcadia.

Throughout the company’s advanced manufacturing and warehousing operations, solar energy is used to charge IoT systems, automation and robotics, and battery-powered industrial vehicles. Ashley’s solar panel installations are expected to generate about 25 million kWh annually, according to an update in the company’s 2024 Corporate Social Responsibility report.

At Aptera Motors Corp., Carlsbad, Calif., the vehicle maker’s product-design goal meshes with that of its building’s owner. Aptera’s solar-powered vehicle’s battery, frame and body are produced in a two-story facility topped by 892 Silfab solar panels. “The system’s estimated annual output of 703,284 kWh provides nearly all the energy that Aptera will use each year,” according to a Silfab Solar case study.

“The fusion generator in the sky, the sun, is a renewable energy source that we will continue to utilize in every shape and form,” Aptera Co-CEO Chris Anthony said in another case study.

“Our mission is clear: move towards a sustainable future that empowers people around the world to get where they need to go with less impact on the planet and little need to pull from an external power source,” Anthony continues. “We hope to inspire other companies to do the same, and we could not be prouder of the brighter future we are building.”",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/advancedmanufacturing.org/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/8c/68c2606d-de01-4fce-9d91-01eef0be7af4/68c8643926ab9.image.jpg?crop=844%2C443%2C115%2C0,N,,2025-09-15 17:01:22.742180

DP World supports battery makers in the development of new gigafactories, alongside aftermarket contract logistics services.","Electrification is now a primary driver of complexity in automotive supply chains. The transition from internal-combustion to battery electric powertrains is advancing at different speeds across regions. China leads on the back of decades of investment from critical minerals to new energy vehicles (NEV) manufacturing and distribution, while Europe and the US are accelerating from a lower base with uneven momentum. Across markets, OEMs are prioritising battery logistics, hazardous-goods-ready infrastructure, proximity to production, compliant data and circular aftermarket flows – to de-risk operations and scale.

“If you are an OEM now you have to provide multiple powertrains because that shift to electric vehicles (EVs) is somewhere in transition depending on where in the world you are,” says David D’Annunzio, global vice-president and vertical head for Automotive at DP World. “While an EV has fewer parts and is easier to assemble, there are multiple variants of internal combustion and EVs, often being made in the same factory, increasing the complexity of assembly.”

The need to meet demand for both internal combustion (ICE) and EV variants also impacts the provision of service parts, the volume of which has increased by roughly a third because of the need to stock parts for both types of vehicles. For EVs, aftermarket battery services have their own very specific requirements and include regulation on recycling.

Bringing home the battery

OEMs face a strategic choice: one based on whether they purchase batteries from suppliers or vertically integrate into production. Ownership of battery production, independently or via joint ventures, requires significant capital but increases an OEMs control over cost, quality, resilience and the ability to navigate restrictions on trade. Recent examples include Toyota, which started its own battery production in the US this year at a $14 billion factory in North Carolina – its first in-house plant outside Japan, supplying hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure EVs. In Europe Stellantis is establishing a joint venture with CATL to make a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery plant in Zaragoza, Spain.

Vertical integration is a lesson Henry Ford learned back in the early days of car production and vehicle makers are returning to that original strategy in relation to battery production, according to D’Annunzio.

“One of the things that happened to Henry Ford was that the Dodge brothers originally provided full chassis to his company but then turned around and started their own business,” says D’Annunzio. “That irritated Henry Ford. He set up his own manufacturing and was 100% vertically integrated so no one could ever do that to him again.”

Careful handling

Crucially, lithium battery production and movement demand specialised, hazardous good logistics. EV batteries are categorised as hazardous goods under UN international dangerous goods regulations for road and air transport. Temperature, humidity and state of charge must be tightly controlled, and safeguards need to be in place to avoid any thermal runaway risks, which are difficult to extinguish.

DP World is providing battery logistics support, including deliveries both to assembly plants and to the EV dealer/service centre networks.

D’Annunzio notes most movements are simple, short-haul deliveries because battery manufacturing is deliberately located close to assembly plants and the centre of gravity for dealer distribution to try to minimise the hazards of moving batteries. “As long as they have been stored properly and they have the right state of charge, moving them from a storage location to either a manufacturing plant or to a service parts distribution location is an easy thing to do,” he says.

However, the right equipment and training is essential. At DP World storage locations, staff must be certified to manage hazardous goods by way of ensuring compliant handling and storage. Lithium batteries are segregated in dedicated zones, equipped with appropriate fire suppression systems and specialised lifting and charging equipment. With a decade of experience moving EVs and their batteries, we maintain an unblemished safety record.

DP World is also looking at the circular economy when it comes to aftermarket battery management. “The way the automotive aftermarket is set up for EV batteries is very simple,” says D’Annunzio. “If you take a battery and deliver it to the dealership you have to pick up the old battery and bring it back and recycle the black mass for somebody else. That is exactly what we do.”

Beyond operational changes, DP World has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050, with interim targets for 2030, aligning with global climate frameworks. These commitments are driving investments such as electrified trucking fleets, modal shifts from road to rail, and the deployment of electric and autonomous vehicles at ports and terminals – ensuring that battery logistics is managed sustainably end-to-end.

Passport to power

In Europe, the battery passport (EU Battery Pass) will be mandatory from 2027 – a digital certificate which will enable consumers to verify the sustainability and environmental credentials of batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs). It will provide a document of data along a battery’s entire lifecycle. Today, we are seeing industry leaders collaborating to drive and advance the development of the first, trusted industry wide passport. For example, Path.Era, a collaboration between carmakers BMW and VW Group and suppliers BASF, Henkel, Siemens, working with consultant Deloitte, are currently working on the first industry-wide, trusted battery passport. China is currently working on a battery passport initiative to align with and facilitate trade with the EU’s battery regulations. However, outside of Europe, the situation is less consistent and is down to logistics providers to adhere with local and regional legislation.

Alongside regulatory compliance, DP World applies digital monitoring to the batteries in its care. This includes real-time checks on temperature, humidity and state of charge to ensure stability during storage and movement. These measures provide early-warning safeguards that reduce the risk of incidents and support transparent, auditable supply chains.

D’Annunzio indicated that when solid state batteries become less expensive to produce, regulations will be less complex given the greater stability afforded by that battery chemistry and the concern will be focused on those lithium-ion batteries still out in the marketplace.

Keep your options open

Powertrain transition and the localisation of battery production are amplifying supply-chain complexity amid broader trade upheaval, challenging OEMs, suppliers and logistics providers alike.

“We are all grappling with that,” notes D’Annunzio. “What we are telling our customers is that the best that you can do today is have flexibility, or as Jim Tompkins [CEO Tomkins Ventures] calls it, ‘optionality in your supply chain’.”

Building in optionality means being able to react faster to whatever the market throws your way. What is important for traditional carmakers to understand, according to D’Annnunzio, is that having options ready doesn’t always mean aiming for the one with the lowest cost anymore. “You need that little bit of extra insurance as things are changing rapidly,” he says. “That is a very difficult message to get across to OEMs in general and more importantly, OEMs that are in financial distress because of everything else that is going on.”

China in charge

While EV growth in Europe and the United States is progressing unevenly, China remains a global leader. Chinese OEMs produce 60% of all NEVs and 70% of all batteries, with capacity outstripping local demand. This surplus is driving assertive export strategies.

China’s BYD has rapidly scaled exports from hundreds of thousands to close to a million vehicles annually, while localising NEV assembly in key overseas markets to mitigate tariffs. As BYD and others have indicated, nearshoring combined with vertical integration simplifies a carmaker’s supply chain at a time of complexity. China’s NEV makers are smashing the traditional five-year vehicle development cycle – designing, producing and testing a vehicle ready for release in 18 months.

Intensifying competitive pressure from China is forcing traditional American and European OEMs to articulate clear strategic responses.

DP World is positioning itself to manage the complex needs of Chinese NEV customers making electric vehicles, including comprehensive services for battery handling and storage.

“As Chinese carmakers expand around the world, we want to be there to help them with their destination logistics, whether that be for the NEVs that they are exporting or in local manufacturing assistance and service parts distribution among other services,” says D’Annunzio.

DP World supports battery makers in the development of new gigafactories, alongside aftermarket contract logistics services. More specifically, for Foton, DP World is blending contract logistics and tailored market-entry and expansion services on a unified platform, managing the legal entity for Foton.

“Foton stocks inventory in our warehouse; when an order for a part comes by, we buy it from Foton, deliver and remit the funds,” says D’Annunzio. “Rather than being a pure logistics service provider we are also their trading partner in South Africa. Those are the type of innovative solutions that we are trying to come up with for our Chinese clients as they expand around the world.”",https://image.automotivelogistics.media/666434.jpg?imageId=666434&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-09-15 16:01:04.313363

Sponsor spotlight: Siemens and the energy transition

Siemens, a leader in automation and machinery manufacturing, is the panel's sponsor, introduced by a keynote address from Stacy Mahler, Siemens' US Head of Sustainability.

With over 15 years of experience in the industrial and energy sectors, Stacy guides organisations along sustainability pathways.

Her work focuses on infrastructure advancements for enhanced energy efficiency, integrating renewable energy and promoting the electrification of transport and infrastructure.

Stacy also manages the carbon reduction strategies for Siemens Smart Infrastructure in the US.

With a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Florida and an MBA from Northwestern University, her expertise anchors the discussion.

Technologies like solar rooftops, wind farms, microgrids and virtual power plants are set to enhance resilience against outages, minimise transmission losses and democratise clean energy access.

Corporate pioneers continue to innovate distributed solutions, while governmental bodies adapt regulations to embrace peer-to-peer energy trading.

Decentralisation is also key to rural electrification, especially in emerging nations where microgrids can bypass traditional grid systems.

Electrification across sectors

The electrification of transport and heavy industry is a priority to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Electric vehicles are increasingly popular, with many automakers transitioning away from combustion engines.

Industries like steelmaking and cement are progressively shifting towards renewable power sources.

Meeting these demands without affecting grid reliability will require advancements in energy storage, demand response systems and grid modernisation.

​​​​​​​Green hydrogen and sustainable fuel alternatives

Green hydrogen, produced through renewable-powered electrolysis, emerges as a crucial component of the energy transition.

Providing solutions for sectors where direct electrification is challenging, such as aviation and heavy industry, it sees increased investment from companies like Air Liquide, Siemens Energy and bp.

Alongside biofuels and synthetic options, hydrogen holds potential for decarbonising global trade and transport.

You don’t have to walk far in Keene to spot a home with shiny black solar panels affixed to the roof.

The city has issued more than 230 permits for solar installations since 2017. Those installations were relatively rare until 2022. From 2018 to 2022, the city issued 51 permits. Since 2022, the city has issued 180.

Those incentives were rolled back in July when President Donald Trump signed what’s known as the One Big Beautiful Bill. Experts say that rollback could make solar less appealing for some property owners, but other factors, like electric costs, could help counterbalance it.

Rapid growth

According to city data, three solar installation permits were issued in 2018. The next three years saw a slight increase, with numbers hovering in the teens, but in 2022 something changed; solar permit applications began to come in much more rapidly.

The city issued 49 permits that year, 73 in 2023 and 58 in 2024. With four months left to go in 2025, the city has already issued 48.

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law under President Joe Biden on Aug. 16, 2022, implemented the Residential Clean Energy Credit, equal to 30 percent of the cost of a new clean energy system.

That means that a homeowner who spent $10,000 on a solar array, solar water heater, or battery storage could be exempt from $3,000 in taxes that year, and be eligible for additional exemptions in the future.

Clean Energy N.H. Executive Director Sam Evans-Brown said the act brought a lot of attention to solar, with more interest in both residential and commercial projects throughout the state.

Spiking electricity prices in 2023 and 2024 added fuel to the fire, he said, as people sought ways to reduce their energy costs.

The growth of solar installations in Keene that has followed that act is part of a national trend of solar growth. The installed capacity of residential solar projects in the U.S. has grown by more than 19,000 megawatts since 2021.

Utility-scale solar has grown even more rapidly.

In total, there’s now enough solar capacity nationwide to power more than 41 million homes.

The city of Keene has worked to incentive that trend. In 2020, the city earned a SolSmart bronze designation from the U.S. Department of Energy program for efforts to make solar a more affordable choice for homes and businesses.

Then-Mayor George Hansel said the designation was “a testament to the shared commitment by our citizens, elected leaders, city staff, businesses, and other community partners to reach our ambitious renewable energy goals.”

The city offers a property tax exemption for solar and other renewable energy systems equal to their total assessed value. That exemption is available to both homeowners and businesses.

More information about going solar in Keene can be found at keenenh.gov/going-solar-keene.

Variables

“There’s a lot of variables involved,” when homeowners or businesses are considering going solar, according to Scott Maslansky, who directs the clean energy finance program of the Community Development Finance Authority.

Tax credits and other incentives, like the Rural Energy for America grant program for businesses, are one thing people take into account. But they also consider things like their electrical costs or whether they’re planning to get a heat pump or electric vehicle, both of which need a lot of power.

“All of those things contributed” to the growth of solar over the past few years, he said.

Maslansky said he believes many people who had been thinking about going solar for a long time jumped at the 30 percent tax credit when it became available. He installed a solar array on his own home last year, in part to take advantage of that credit.

What happens now?

The July, One Big Beautiful Bill set in motion the rollback of most of the solar incentives that the Inflation Reduction Act started. Most were set to run for at least a decade. Now, they’ll phase out over the next two years.

The solar tax credit for homeowners is set to end at the end of the year. Businesses have a little more time; projects just need to be underway by mid 2026 or completed by the end of 2027 to qualify.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month it won’t provide any more funding through REAP, the program that covered up to 50 percent of the cost of renewable energy projects at rural small businesses.

Maslansky said he expects to see a short-term spike in solar installations through the end of the year as people hurry to qualify for incentives before they expire.

Longer-term plans, like developments that might have been considering building solar-ready, might be more likely to change their mind, he said.

Evans-Brown said he expects a “rush for the doors” in the last quarter of 2025.

“If you’re thinking about it, now is the time to do it,” he said.

But once the incentives expire, both experts said they expect a fall-off in interest.

With the REAP program in limbo, some companies who had planned to go solar might decide it’s no longer worth it.

“That will definitely cause a drop,” Maslansky said.

But for most home and businessowners, there are still good reasons to go solar.

Rising electrical costs could make solar look more and more desirable, according to Maslansky and Evans-Brown.

If you lose a 30 percent tax credit but electric costs go up 40 percent, solar still pays for itself in the anticipated timeframe, Evans-Brown explained.

“Taking on debt for something you’re going to see pay back on makes sense,” Maslansky said.

On the other hand, tariffs could cause the price of solar equipment to go up, making it a less cost-effective option.

Both said tariffs are a big area of uncertainty, but Evans-Brown said ongoing incentives for domestic manufacturing of solar equipment could increase US manufacturing.

Keeping up

As in many other areas of the economy, things are changing rapidly in the solar industry. It can be difficult to keep up.

Maslansky recommends property owners consult Clean Energy N.H.’s webpage or speak with a solar contractor to get up-to-date information.

“You really do have to be plugged in,” Evans-Brown said. “You have to do serious research.

“One of the challenges right now is that things are changing really quickly, and it is hard to get good information.”

Green firms in the US have found something of a lifeline in artificial intelligence after being bogged down by high interest rates, shrinking funding and, more recently, President Donald Trump’s sharp rollback of support.

Clean technology companies that have inked deals to support data centers have seen their stocks soar this year, outperforming the S&P 500. Nuclear power startup Oklo Inc.’s shares are up nearly 275% year-to-date while the stock price of fuel cell provider Bloom Energy Corp. has risen 66%. Energy storage and clean power snagged the most public and private investment among climate tech sectors last quarter, according to BloombergNEF.

Even as some clean energy firms struggle to convince investors that they can thrive during Trump’s second term, the AI-driven surge in electric demand — the most in decades — is providing clear tailwinds for others.

“That has reinvigorated enthusiasm for companies that benefit from the trend,” said Jeff Osborne, a senior clean energy analyst with TD Cowen.

But the data center boom may prove short-lived for some carbon-free tech companies. While the age of AI is just starting, the ability of renewable firms to continue benefiting could be limited by a White House keen to boost fossil fuels and kill wind and solar.

Other clean technologies aren’t facing the same headwinds. Trump is an unabashed supporter of nuclear power, which is also seeing a rebound in public support. Geothermal today provides less than 1% of US generation capacity, but new drilling techniques and support from both tech giants and Energy Secretary Chris Wright have positioned it for growth.

Nuclear is an “ideal supply source for data centers,” and companies are willing to pay a premium for carbon-free, round-the-clock power, said David Brown, director of the energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie.

Even before Trump took office for a second term, tech giants like Microsoft Corp. were seeking nuclear power. The company signed a deal with Constellation Energy Corp. last year for energy from the Three Mile Island plant, set to restart in 2027. Constellation struck a similar deal with Meta Platforms Inc. in June to sell power from an Illinois nuclear plant.

Almost a quarter of all venture funding for the US climate tech sector went to nuclear startups in the first half of this year, with firm TerraPower LLC closing the largest deal in the clean power sector at $650 million, according to BNEF. Funders include Bill Gates, who also founded the company, and Nvidia Corp.’s venture capital arm.

In addition, firms focusing on grid-enhancing technologies are also attracting funding, Osborne said. That includes startups like Veir Inc., which is making superconducting powerlines it thinks can solve the AI-fueled power crunch, and Heron Power Electronics Co., which signed a letter of intent to sell next-generation transformers to data center developer Crusoe in June.

A senior official said the Trump administration is working with states and utility regulators to speed data center development while looking to lift restrictions and roadblocks. These successes come as tax credits for some renewables are set to be wound down as part of Trump’s tax law.

“It is dangerous out there for a solar and wind company right now,” said Nancy Pfund, managing partner of impact investment firm DBL Partners and an early Tesla Inc. investor, adding that firms will need to cut costs and look at developing projects in other countries.

Altogether, companies canceled, closed or scaled back more than $22 billion in clean-energy investments during the first half of the year, according to research group E2. That’s about 17% of green projects announced since the start of 2022.

“Even though AI is a national priority for the Trump administration, the energy sector policies that the president has ultimately put forward threaten to slow down US momentum in AI,” Woodmac’s Brown said.

“The Trump administration is working with states and utility regulators to facilitate data center development, fostering a productive and symbiotic relationship among grid operators, developers, and hyperscalers,” a senior administration official said in an emailed statement. “This approach avoids imposing unreasonable or onerous restrictions on American tech companies at the forefront of AI development.”

While the Trump administration has created incentives for geothermal and nuclear, that support alone is not going to make those resources “readily available or plentiful in the next five years,” said Gabriel Kra, co-founder of climate tech venture capital firm Prelude Ventures. Both will take significant time and capital to get permitted and deployed at scale.

Nuclear power plants have historically faced long construction delays, permitting challenges and cost overruns. The last two nuclear reactors built in the US, Vogtle Units 3 and 4, took over a decade to get up and running, compared to utility-scale solar projects, which can be stood up in a year-and-a-half on average.

“The tools we have to scale are gas, solar, wind, batteries,” said Kra. And with natural gas turbine shortages, the hit to the renewables industry means “we just shut down the ability to produce cheap electricity for those customers who want to pay for it.”

For geothermal producer Ormat Technologies Inc., though, the policies in place are set to be a boon. Its shares have risen more than 29% so far this year, and the company has power purchase agreements with utilities and community choice aggregation programs in California. Ormat expects to finalize contracts to support data centers and hyperscalers in the “second half of the year and beyond,” Chief Executive Officer Doron Blachar said on an investor call on Thursday. He added the firm is benefitting from faster permitting timelines and quicker responses from the federal government due to recent regulatory reform.

By extending the production and investment tax credits for geothermal and energy storage, Trump’s legislation is “positioning us uniquely within the renewable energy sector,” Blachar said.

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25254502230745-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 20:01:13.764971

The office plans to award $6 million to the Western Piedmont Council of Governments and $4 million to a list of current WAP service providers.

DEQ hopes to serve more than 575 households with the program, according to a press release.

The funds can contribute to home repair for affected homes on the WAP deferral lists, where households were placed if a home needed major repairs or other work that was not eligible for existing funding.

“This new weatherization readiness funding is an important piece of the comprehensive effort to accelerate long-term recovery and strengthen energy resilience in communities hit hard by Helene,” DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said. “These projects will drive down home utility bills and ensure safer, healthier and more energy-efficient homes for families who need it most.”

The installation is one of three that supplies renewable energy to the Rhode Island electric grid, in exchange for utility bill credits for regional housing authorities, lowering their operating costs and ultimately lowering energy prices for public housing residents. Announced in 2021, the construction of the project is now complete, and all three solar installations are supplying green energy to the Rhode Island electric grid.

The collaboration between PHARI, Nautilus and Veolia is a first of its kind in the nation encompassing multiple public housing authorities under a single renewable energy contract. The Exeter Mail installation is the largest of three contracted by the housing authorities.

Combined, the three sites exceed 13 MW, removing approximately 4,800 metric tons of greenhouse gases annually, the equivalent of taking more than 1,000 cars off the road. The market value of the generation from the three projects will be distributed among nine housing authorities in Rhode Island (Providence, North Providence, Newport, Cranston, Smithfield, Warwick, Warren, Bristol and Lincoln) in the form of utility bill credits. The credits will generate a discount against prevailing electricity supply rates, which lowers the operating budgets of the housing authorities in a region with some of the highest energy costs in the U.S. , benefiting both taxpayers and public housing families.

Located primarily in the towns of Exeter and Smithfield, the solar fields provide approximately 20 million kilowatt hours annually. The projects are estimated to save over $35 million in energy costs over the next 20 years.

Nautilus has overseen the development, permitting and construction of the solar installation. The company will now look after the ongoing management, maintenance and performance for the life of the projects, estimated at 25 to 30 years. Leveraging its deep knowledge of decarbonization, power optimization, and solar generation, Veolia was selected by PHARI to serve as a buy-side agent for the collaboration of housing authorities to manage the procurement effort, advise technically and manage the complexity of the vendor selection process.

The energy generated from the projects now feeds into the electric utility territory of Rhode Island Energy, a subsidiary of PPL Corporation. The completion of the Exeter Mail 6.5 MW field, the third of three that were contracted, marks the conclusion of this project.

Karin Hamel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Veolia's Sustainable Industries and Buildings business said: ""Veolia is proud to contribute to this transformative solar installation, which not only harnesses the power of renewable energy but also directly supports the well-being of thousands of low-income families in Rhode Island. This project aligns with Veolia's GreenUp strategy. Producing local, low-carbon energy is a critical growth booster for accelerating ecological transformation. This project is a perfect example of how green energy can be used for good.""

Jeffrey Cheng, Chief Executive Officer of Nautilus Solar said: ""This solar installation marks an important milestone in our mission to make clean energy more accessible. By delivering the benefits of community solar directly to public housing residents, we're pioneering a model that supports renewable energy goals while delivering long-term economic benefits to the local community. Rhode Island continues to be a key state for innovation in clean energy access, and we're proud to continue growing our investment in the state while building stronger, more resilient communities.""

Robert Coupe, PHARI Co-President and Executive Director of Cranston Housing Authority said: ""Every housing authority in Rhode Island is working to provide the highest quality affordable housing possible with limited budgets. Our partnership with Veolia and Nautilus dramatically reduces utility costs, freeing up valuable resources to invest in property maintenance, facility improvements and operational support. By supporting the growth of renewable energy projects, we are improving the quality of life for future generations while enhancing our ability to serve current residents.""

Many electric vehicle (EV) drivers choose their cars to see long-term savings from cheaper fuel and lower maintenance costs. But the upfront cost of the vehicle can be more pricey than gas cars.

If you’re going to be in the market for an EV, here are three affordable ones that experts told GOBankingRates will be cheaper than gas cars by 2026.

2027 Chevrolet Bolt

According to Justin Fischer, an automotive expert at CarEdge.com, two EV originators are making a comeback in 2026, and both will set the new standard for affordable electric cars moving forward.

“With an expected starting price around $30,000, native support for the Tesla Supercharger network and much faster charging than the last generation, the Bolt EV will be an incredible value that beats gas-powered competitors by a long shot when it comes to total cost of ownership,” Fischer said. “In a compact package, the Bolt EV is likely to score well over 110 MPGe in EPA testing. Even the most efficient hybrids can’t get anywhere near that.”

2026 Nissan LEAF

The 2026 Nissan LEAF is a complete reinvention of the model that brought EVs to the masses in 2011, according to Fischer.

“Everything from the electric powertrain to the exterior styling is reimagined for 2026,”Fischer said. “For anyone familiar with the older generation LEAF, that’s probably welcome news. What’s more surprising is the low price.”

According to Fischer, the 2026 Nissan LEAF will start at $29,990, even with huge upgrades across the board. For those who can charge at home or work at affordable rates, the 2026 Nissan LEAF will be a top-value EV from day one, per Fischer.

Tesla Model 3

According to Melanie Musson, an auto industry expert with AutoInsurance.org, the Model 3 isn’t the cheapest EV on the market, but when you compare it to similar gas models, it’s priced competitively.

“The Model 3 is renowned for its reliability, resulting in a low cost of ownership,” Musson said. “As a result, owners can start saving money after a couple of years of lower-cost driving.”",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tesla-model-3-charging-outdoors_iStock-2205601105.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 17:01:40.863072

Andrew Foster is product director at open edge data platform, IOTech.","Before operators can optimise assets, forecast performance, or coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) as part of a larger grid strategy, all that raw data must first be cleaned, contextualised and standardised. That may sound simple, but for many teams, this step remains one of the biggest time and cost sinks in modern renewables.

This is the messy middle that is holding up progress, and one that is now being tackled with a new tool: edge-based AI.

The hidden cost of unstructured data

Renewable energy assets are inherently distributed. Unlike centralised power plants, they are deployed across rooftops, utility-scale fields or integrated into community microgrids. Each asset might use a different vendor’s hardware, run slightly different firmware, or follow a slightly different naming convention for what appears to be the same data.

Even when asset owners are committed to aligning their systems with a standard like the SunSpec Alliance models for solar and storage, it is rarely a turnkey process. Getting a multi-vendor ecosystem to comply with these standards in practice involves hours of scripting, mapping, and manual tagging just to get a unified view.

That lack of structure has ripple effects across the ecosystem. Grid operators struggle to trust or ingest data that is inconsistent or incomplete. DERMS platforms and virtual power plant (VPP) aggregators spend weeks retrofitting each new site. Real-time analytics engines fail to generate meaningful insights without clean, labelled data. And project timelines are dragged down by the very thing meant to accelerate them: software.

The result is that messy data turns every clean energy deployment into a bespoke integration project. At scale, that is unsustainable.

Moving intelligence to the edge

To solve this, a new model is emerging, one where data is standardised before it leaves the site.

This is the promise of AI-driven semantic modelling at the edge. By embedding lightweight machine learning models into edge platforms located directly at or near the data source, renewable energy systems can now automatically identify, label and organise their data in real time.

Instead of sending raw data to the cloud for cleanup, edge AI infers what each data stream represents and aligns it with industry models such as SunSpec. This enables a new level of automation. Data arrives pre-structured, semantically tagged and immediately usable by upstream systems.

The shift from cloud-first to edge-first processing brings tangible benefits. Site deployment timelines shrink. Engineers spend less time writing custom integration scripts. DER fleets become easier to scale and manage.

A standards-based example: SunSpec at the edge

SunSpec is one of the most widely adopted standards in the solar and storage sectors. It provides a common information model for elements such as inverter status, power output, battery capacity and grid connectivity.

But aligning field data with SunSpec formats still requires manual work, especially when hardware diversity is high. Each device must map its native structures to SunSpec-compliant ones while ensuring that contextual metadata is properly attached. That is not a one-time task, either. It has to be maintained over time as systems evolve.

Edge AI offers a scalable alternative. With trained semantic models deployed on-site, edge platforms can:

Detect and classify incoming data streams from a variety of sources

Map values and fields to their appropriate SunSpec-defined representations

Normalise naming, structure and units across the board

This approach ensures that every new deployment speaks the same language as those before it. It reduces friction, speeds integration and delivers better data to the systems that rely on it.

Real-world impact across the renewable stack

The shift to edge-based data normalisation is already taking shape in renewable energy deployments, particularly in utility-scale solar and battery storage projects. These systems often span thousands of endpoints across a wide mix of vendors and configurations, making consistent data formatting a critical prerequisite for fast, scalable integration.

Operators are beginning to adopt edge AI techniques to automate semantic tagging and align operational data with models like SunSpec at the point of ingestion. This allows structured data to flow from edge devices into control systems and analytics platforms without requiring extensive post-processing.

Some edge platforms now embed this functionality out of the box, including commercial solutions based on open frameworks like EdgeX Foundry. For example, IOTech’s edge software includes built-in tools to support real-time data normalisation at scale, helping renewable energy providers manage diverse assets more efficiently while reducing integration time and manual effort.

By bringing semantic structure to the edge, these systems are enabling more reliable grid coordination, smoother DER integration, and faster onboarding across distributed energy fleets.

Why this matters now

The growth of renewable infrastructure is compounding the complexity of managing it. Operators are not thinking in terms of one or two assets. They are managing fleets. Aggregators are coordinating multi-site VPPs. Grid operators are dealing with bidirectional flows and unpredictable loads. In this landscape, data quality becomes a gating factor for innovation.

Without structure, interoperability breaks down. Without context, analytics falter. Without consistency, automation slows to a crawl.

That is why edge AI is such a timely advancement. It targets the problem where it begins, at the edge, and turns every data point into something trustworthy and usable from the start.

What comes next

The data challenges being addressed in solar and storage are not unique to renewables. The same fragmented, messy data problems appear in EV charging networks, smart buildings, and industrial facilities. The lesson is the same. Consistent, structured data is the foundation for everything else, including optimisation, forecasting, automation and compliance.

As the industry continues to coalesce around open models like SunSpec, Project Haystack and UNS/ISA-95, the question becomes how to apply these models at scale across heterogeneous environments.

Edge AI gives us a practical way to do that. Not as a bolt-on, but as a foundational capability of future energy infrastructure.

In 1H 2025, the sector installed 1 GW of solar installations, the largest first half ever.
Residential Solar Residential solar installations during Q2 were just over 1 GW, with high interest rates and economic uncertainty suppressing demand.
These costs increased in Q2 2025 following the government’s implementation of a 10% baseline tariff in April 2025.
The report’s base case broadly forecasts a 5% average annual decline in solar installations between 2025 and 2030, up from 2% in the Q1 2025 outlook.","The U.S. solar industry installed 7.5 GW of capacity in the second quarter (Q2) of 2025, a 24% year-over-year (YoY) and a 28% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) decline, according to Wood Mackenzie and Solar Energy Industries Association‘s US Solar Market Insight report.

The report stated that all segments, except commercial solar, saw capacity additions declining. The commercial solar segment witnessed a strong project pipeline that continued to come online under California’s former net metering regime.

Utility-Scale and Commercial Solar

In Q2 2025, installations in the utility-scale segment stood at 5.7 GW, declining 28% YoY and 33% QoQ. In 2024, average solar prices earned by projects in Texas, the largest utility-scale solar market, declined by 50% from 2023.

In 2024, average power prices earned by solar projects were down over 50% YoY. This decline affected the economic viability of new projects. Contracting across the U.S. also declined. The country signed 4.5 GW of new capacity in Q2, a 26% YoY.

Solar projects in New York supported contracted volumes. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority executed agreements for more than a dozen large-scale projects in May. These projects contributed to over 2 GW of clean energy across the state.

According to the report, the U.S. solar commercial market installed a capacity of 585 MW in Q2 2025, the second highest in history. States such as Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania recorded healthy volumes.

In 1H 2025, the sector installed 1 GW of solar installations, the largest first half ever. This increase was driven by projects under California’s NEM 2.0 program coming online. These projects accounted for over 90% of solar installations during this period.

Residential Solar

Residential solar installations during Q2 were just over 1 GW, with high interest rates and economic uncertainty suppressing demand. The bankruptcies of multiple solar companies also influenced the lower installation volumes.

The residential solar market added 1,064 MW of capacity, falling 9% YoY and 3% QoQ. The quarter witnessed the lowest capacity since Q2 2021, when it reduced to less than 1 GW. California, Florida, and Puerto Rico retained their lead in residential solar capacity rankings. California added approximately 275 MW, leading Florida by 200 MW.

In 1H2025, 33 states experienced a decrease in solar capacity from the previous year, resulting in a 12% YoY contraction.

Community Solar

The community solar segment installed 174 MW, a 52% YoY and a 34% QoQ decline, witnessing the lowest additions since Q1 2021. The segment’s volumes are reducing due to dwindling project pipelines in major markets with supportive policies. The report said no new markets are replacing these pipelines. Volumes for 1H 2025 decreased 36% YoY.

New York contributed heavily to the national contraction, with stagnating volumes during the quarter and capacities declining 56% YoY.

The report said that the U.S. has more than 9 GW of community solar in various stages of development as of Q2 2025. This development is likely to support the sector’s buildout through 2030.

Photovoltaic solar accounted for 56% of all new electricity-generating capacity additions in the first half (1H) of 2025. It remained the U.S.’ dominant form of new electricity-generating capacity.

OBBBA Impact

The OBBBA (Budget Reconciliation Bill), signed on July 4, 2025, introduced sweeping changes to the U.S. energy policy landscape. The report stated that changes to the tax credit across several technologies, along with the new Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) requirements, will be an inflection point for multiple power sector trends.

Under the new provisions, the solar sector will no longer have access to Section 48E and 45Y tax credits after 2027, or the Section 25D tax credits (for customer-owned residential solar) after 2025.

Currently, projects starting construction on or before July 4, 2026, must come online in four years to earn the tax credits. However, solar projects beginning construction after this date must be commissioned by the end of 2027 to qualify for the 48E and 45Y credits.

The project cost share not allowed for payment to entities of concern will be 40% in 2026 and will increase by 5% every year to 60% from 2030 onwards.

Guidance and Permitting Uncertainty

On July 15, the Department of the Interior issued a memorandum stating that the Secretary of the Interior would personally sign off on numerous types of federal permitting approvals for solar and wind projects.

On August 15, the Treasury issued new guidance changing the definition of “beginning of construction” for solar and wind projects that are utilizing federal tax credits.

Earlier, projects could begin construction in one of the following pathways under the previous definitions: incurring at least 5% of the project cost (Five Percent Safe Harbor) or commencing onsite or offsite “physical work of a significant nature” (Physical Work Test). Projects using either pathway had to be commissioned by the end of the calendar year, four years post the commencement of the project’s construction.

The new guidance, effective September 2, largely maintains these requirements. However, the guidance has now removed the Five Percent Safe Harbor criterion for projects with capacities over 1.5 MW. These projects must now adhere to the Physical Work Test.

The Physical Work Test offers fewer bright-line assessments compared to the Five Percent Safe Harbor. The reduced assessments can create uncertainties for solar projects with planned construction commencement post-September 2.

FEOC Effect on Solar Manufacturing

The solar industry continued to grow in Q2 2025, with module manufacturing capacity reaching 55.4 GW. This growth exceeds the yearly solar installations when the factories are running at full capacity.

The increasing cost from the tariffs and higher labor and utility costs mean the 45X tax credits are crucial for U.S. solar manufacturers. Even though the 45X tax credits were maintained, the recent FEOC mandates could pose a risk to these credits.

Rise in Solar System Pricing

Residential solar system pricing rose 2% YoY. These costs increased in Q2 2025 following the government’s implementation of a 10% baseline tariff in April 2025. Baseline tariffs remained in effect even while a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs was announced. This contributed to cost increases throughout solar market segments.

The anti-dumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) case on solar cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, beginning in April last year and finalized in May 2025, pushed module prices by 13% YoY across distributed generation segments.

In August this year, the U.S. also initiated AD/CVD investigations against imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules, from India, Indonesia, and Laos.

Prices of residential systems averaged $3.36/W, increasing 2% over the previous year. Commercial system costs stood at $1.57/Wd, rising 10% YoY.

In Q2, utility-scale fixed-tilt and single-axis tracking system prices increased 4% YoY, reaching $1.11/W and $1.25/W, respectively. Engineering, procurement, and construction overhead, permitting, logistics, and miscellaneous costs rose 30% YoY on average.

Total utility-scale project system costs increased during the quarter compared to Q2 2024, despite a yearly average decrease of 10% in solar module and inverter prices.

Five-Year Forecast

The report projects 246 GW of solar installations in the next five years.

New installations are projected to surge in 2027, with projects hurrying to meet the tax credit deadline.

Approximately 50 GW of solar installations are projected to begin construction before the end of 2025. Another 40 GW of projects are likely to start construction in 1H 2026.

The report’s base case broadly forecasts a 5% average annual decline in solar installations between 2025 and 2030, up from 2% in the Q1 2025 outlook.

Wood Mackenzie expects the OBBBA to also result in fewer new manufacturing facilities being commissioned in the coming quarters.

The residential solar segment is also expected to rush to install projects before the year’s end due to the expiry of 25D tax credits for it. However, the total installed capacity is unlikely to exceed the record-breaking volumes of 2024.

Commercial and community solar developers are projected to safe harbor equipment or commence physical work to the extent possible.

Between 2025 and 2030, the national commercial solar market is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 3%. Near-term growth is forecasted to remain steady through 2026 since most projects are already under construction or in interconnection queues.

States such as California, with its strong growth, is still witnessing projects under NEM 2.0 taking longer than initially forecasted to come online. Wood Mackenzie projects that the state’s commercial solar installations will continue to grow throughout 2025, with a dip in 2H 2026.

The report said the federal policy changes have reduced the community solar sector’s five-year outlook to 8% compared to Q2 2025.

The community solar market is forecasted to contract by an annual average of 12% through 2030. Multiple state markets have proposed community solar programs. However, stakeholders have struggled to finalize legislation so far. The early expiration of the Investment Tax Credit and the potential cancellation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion “Solar for All” funding are expected to further complicate the design of frameworks for community solar in these states.

Despite the continued growth of successful community solar programs in Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey, Wood Mackenzie projects a 29% market correction this year.

Wood Mackenzie’s base case projects 168 GW of added utility-scale solar capacity between 2025 and 2030.

Approximately 44 GW of planned capacity is projected to be affected by the DOI’s directive. States such as Arizona, California, Utah, and Nevada are likely to be the most impacted.

The report also presents a low-case solar development forecast in addition to its base-case forecast for the quarter to benchmark the possible outcomes of the recent policy developments. This forecast projects an 18% downside risk (44 GW).

In a more constrained permitting environment, the report forecasts a 30% decrease in the commissioning of solar projects in 2026 and 2027 compared to the base case scenario. The differential between the two forecasts reduces from 2028. In the low case, it averages 17% less capacity from this period onwards.

Increased demand for new energy supply and rising power prices are projected to strengthen market fundamentals in the long term. The report’s low case is 18% lower than the base case over the next five years.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Copy-of-Mercom-FI-2025-08-29T162119.578.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:40.759664

The Getting to Zero Coalition, an alliance of companies, governments and intergovernmental organizations, is asking member states of the International Maritime Organization to support adopting regulations to transition to green shipping, including the fee, when they meet in London next month. The statement was shared exclusively with The Associated Press in advance.

“Given the significance of the political decision being made, we think it is important that industry voices in favor of this adoption be heard,” Jesse Fahnestock, who leads decarbonization work at the Global Maritime Forum, said Monday. The forum manages the Getting to Zero Coalition.

The Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal before the IMO and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the major climate deal. The U.S. considers the proposed regulatory framework “effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable U.N. organization,” the U.S. Secretaries of State, Commerce, Energy and Transportation said in a joint statement last month.

U.S.-based shipping companies, however, have endorsed it. The Chamber of Shipping of America wants one global system, not multiple regional systems that could double charge vessels for their emissions depending on the route, said Kathy Metcalf, the chamber’s president emeritus.

Shipping emissions have grown over the last decade to about 3% of the global total as vessels have gotten bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fossil fuels. The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of a regulatory framework to impose a minimum fee for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above certain thresholds and set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels. The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but, in this case, had to vote. The United States was notably absent.

Now nations have to decide if the regulations will enter into force in 2027. If agreed upon, the regulations will become mandatory for large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, according to the IMO.

If nations don’t agree, shipping’s decarbonization will be further delayed and “the chance of the sector playing a proper and fair part in the fight to keep global heating below dangerous levels will almost certainly be lost,” said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and Ocean Conservancy shipping program director.

The U.S. secretaries said in their statement that “fellow IMO members should be on notice” the U.S. will “not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens” if they do not support the United States, against this action. They said ships will have to pay fees for failing to meet “unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets,” driving up costs, and the fuel standards would “conveniently benefit China.” China is a leader in developing and producing cleaner fuels for shipping.

While U.S. opposition and pressure cannot be taken for granted, it still appears as though a majority of countries currently support the regulations, said Faig Abbasov from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization. Abbasov said the deal reached in April was not ambitious enough, but this is an opportunity to launch the sector’s decarbonization and it can be strengthened.

Shipping companies want the regulations because it gives them the certainty needed to confidently make investments in cleaner technologies, such as fuels that are alternatives to fossil fuels and the ships that run on them. In addition to the Getting to Zero Coalition, the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, is advocating for adoption when nations meet at IMO Headquarters in London from Oct. 14 to 17.

By agreeing to curtail loads during peak demand, data centers can be granted faster interconnection approvals since they present less risk to overall system stability.
That shift could ripple across data center site selection, power purchase agreements, and the economics of interconnection.","Last month, Google signed agreements with two U.S. electric utilities, American Electric Power (AEP) utility Indiana Michigan Power and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), to reduce power consumption at its AI data centers to ease strain on the U.S. power grid during times of surging demand.

They’re the first formal agreements by Google in demand-response programs with utilities—a way to temporarily reduce electricity usage during peak hours—to temporarily curtail its machine learning (ML) workloads, a subset of AI.

AI data centers are flooding U.S. utilities with electricity requests, pushing demand beyond available supply in some regions. The resulting power strain is raising fears of higher bills for households and businesses, along with potential blackouts.

The demand/availability conflict also has complicated the technology industry's expansion of AI, which requires massive amounts of electricity quickly.

""It allows large electricity loads like data centers to be interconnected more quickly, helps reduce the need to build new transmission and power plants, and helps grid operators more effectively and efficiently manage power grids,"" Michael Terrell, Google Head of Advanced Energy said in an August 4 blog post.

“These agreements represent the first time we’re delivering data center demand-response by targeting machine learning (ML) workloads,” he continued. “This builds on our successful demonstration with Omaha Public Power District (OPPD), where we reduced the power demand associated with ML workloads during three grid events last year—paving the way for us to pursue opportunities at other locations.”

However, although this industry-leading strategy is innovative, not every task can be paused. Some critical functions, such as Google Search, Maps, and services used by healthcare or cloud customers, can’t be interrupted. Google representatives acknowledged that demand flexibility will only be implemented at certain locations, and only where service reliability won’t be compromised.

I&M serves more than 600,000 customers. The new contract is designed to support its capacity needs through clean power generation, supporting its ability to provide reliable service and help lower overall energy costs for customers.

AEP is one of the nation's largest electricity producers with approximately 29,000 MW of diverse generating capacity.

Transmission and Power Strategy

These agreements build on Google’s growing set of strategies to manage electricity needs.

In June of 2025, Google announced a deal with CTC Global to upgrade transmission lines with high-capacity composite conductors that increase throughput without requiring new towers. In July 2025, Google and Brookfield Asset Management unveiled a hydropower framework agreement worth up to $3 billion, designed to secure firm clean energy for data centers in PJM and Eastern markets.

Alongside renewable deals, Google has signed nuclear supply agreements as well, most notably a landmark contract with Kairos Power for small modular reactor capacity. Each of these moves reflects Google’s effort to create more headroom on the grid while securing firm, carbon-free power.

Workload Flexibility and Grid Innovation

The demand-response strategy is uniquely suited to AI data centers because of workload diversity. Machine learning training runs can sometimes be paused or rescheduled, unlike latency-sensitive workloads.

This flexibility allows Google to throttle certain compute-heavy processes in coordination with utilities. In practice, Google can preemptively pause or shift workloads when notified of peak events, ensuring critical services remain uninterrupted while still creating significant grid relief.

Local Utility Impact

For utilities like I&M and TVA, partnering with hyperscale customers has a dual benefit: stabilizing the grid while keeping large customers satisfied and growing within their service territories.

It also signals to regulators and ratepayers that data centers, often criticized for their heavy energy footprint, can actively contribute to reliability. These agreements may help avoid contentious rate cases or delays in permitting new power plants.

Policy, Interconnection Queues, and the Economics of Speed

One of the biggest hurdles for data center development today is the long wait in interconnection queues. In regions like PJM Interconnection, developers often face waits of three to five years before new projects can connect to the grid. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) filings show similar delays across multiple regions, as utilities and grid operators struggle to process unprecedented volumes of requests.

Demand-response agreements like Google’s offer a potential workaround. By agreeing to curtail loads during peak demand, data centers can be granted faster interconnection approvals since they present less risk to overall system stability. This demand flexibility can effectively “buy time” for utilities to complete needed transmission upgrades without forcing developers into indefinite delays.

The economics of such deals often involve capacity payments or bill reductions. In some cases, utilities compensate large customers for agreeing to be interruptible loads, either through reduced rates or direct payments during grid events. For Google, this creates both a cost-saving opportunity and a reputational benefit: helping the grid while accelerating the timeline for new capacity to come online.

Industry Implications

Google’s participation could set a precedent for how AI-driven companies interact with the grid. If hyperscale operators normalize demand-response as part of their standard operations, utilities may increasingly expect—or even require—similar commitments from other large energy users. That shift could ripple across data center site selection, power purchase agreements, and the economics of interconnection.

For now, Google’s agreements with I&M and TVA remain early pilots. But if they prove successful, they could reshape the conversation about balancing AI growth with grid reliability in the United States and beyond.","https://img.datacenterfrontier.com/files/base/ebm/datacenterfrontier/image/2025/09/68c841e499e9905b4cec0530-dreamstime_xxl_87755795.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-09-15 14:01:49.987798

Dive Brief:

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced Friday that the agency will propose a rule to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, or GHGRP, which requires over 8,000 companies and entities to calculate and annually report their greenhouse gas emissions for 47 source categories.

The agency estimated that the rule would save U.S. companies “up to $2.4 billion” in regulatory costs, according to the announcement. EPA said in a fact sheet that if the proposal is finalized, companies would not have to submit reports with 2025 data.

Zeldin previously telegraphed Friday’s proposal in the spring, when EPA announced a spate of climate and environmental rules it was planning to reconsider during a “day of deregulation” at the agency. Repealing the GHG Reporting Program could hurt the carbon capture industry and remove data that cities rely on to hold polluters accountable.

Dive Insight:

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program was established in 2009, after Congress mandated a GHG reporting rule in response to the appropriations act for the 2008 fiscal year, according to EPA. The program currently applies to certain large industrial facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent, as well as carbon dioxide injection sites and fuel and industrial gas suppliers, according to a March fact sheet.

EPA is proposing to rescind the GHGRP in accordance with executive orders President Donald Trump issued on his first day back in office. The agency said it plans to maintain its statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, but claimed in the release that the GHGRP “is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment,” unlike other mandatory data collection programs under the CAA.

Zeldin said in the Sept. 12 announcement that the program “costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities.”

The substance of the proposed rule would be an amendment to the program that removes “program obligations for most source categories,” according to the rule released for public inspection on Monday. The proposal, which would remove reporting requirements for carbon dioxide injection sites, “most large facilities” and all suppliers of fuel and industrial gas, will be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday.

The proposed rule would remove 46 of the 47 greenhouse gas source categories from the program. The agency would leave emissions reporting requirements for companies subject to the waste emissions charge, a methane emissions fee established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But, the recent Congressional Republican budget bill will delay data collection under that subsection for petroleum and natural gas systems — required to report under the CAA — until it reports on calendar year 2034.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/XtAzP_3TXhHmYqJGbKWtmqyhY-d7qxOTC_Do57KmKYY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzYwMjQxNzg2X3E3VWt0UnouanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-15 14:01:27.344312

U.S.-based shipping companies, however, have endorsed it.

Shipping companies want the regulations because it gives them the certainty needed to confidently make investments in cleaner technologies, such as fuels that are alternatives to fossil fuels and the ships that run on them.","Nearly 200 shipping companies said Monday they want the world’s largest maritime nations to adopt regulations that include the first-ever global fee on greenhouse gases to reduce their sector’s emissions.

The Getting to Zero Coalition, an alliance of companies, governments and intergovernmental organizations, is asking member states of the International Maritime Organization to support adopting regulations to transition to green shipping, including the fee, when they meet in London next month. The statement was shared exclusively with The Associated Press in advance.

“Given the significance of the political decision being made, we think it is important that industry voices in favor of this adoption be heard,” Jesse Fahnestock, who leads decarbonization work at the Global Maritime Forum, said Monday. The forum manages the Getting to Zero Coalition.

The Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal before the IMO and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the major climate deal. The U.S. considers the proposed regulatory framework “effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable U.N. organization,” the U.S. Secretaries of State, Commerce, Energy and Transportation said in a joint statement last month.

U.S.-based shipping companies, however, have endorsed it. The Chamber of Shipping of America wants one global system, not multiple regional systems that could double charge vessels for their emissions depending on the route, said Kathy Metcalf, the chamber's president emeritus.

Shipping emissions have grown over the last decade to about 3% of the global total as vessels have gotten bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fossil fuels. The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of a regulatory framework to impose a minimum fee for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above certain thresholds and set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels. The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but, in this case, had to vote. The United States was notably absent.

Now nations have to decide if the regulations will enter into force in 2027. If agreed upon, the regulations will become mandatory for large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, according to the IMO.

If nations don't agree, shipping’s decarbonization will be further delayed and “the chance of the sector playing a proper and fair part in the fight to keep global heating below dangerous levels will almost certainly be lost,” said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and Ocean Conservancy shipping program director.

The U.S. secretaries said in their statement that “fellow IMO members should be on notice” the U.S. will “not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens” if they do not support the United States, against this action. They said ships will have to pay fees for failing to meet “unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets,” driving up costs, and the fuel standards would “conveniently benefit China.” China is a leader in developing and producing cleaner fuels for shipping.

While U.S. opposition and pressure cannot be taken for granted, it still appears as though a majority of countries currently support the regulations, said Faig Abbasov from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization. Abbasov said the deal reached in April was not ambitious enough, but this is an opportunity to launch the sector’s decarbonization and it can be strengthened.

Shipping companies want the regulations because it gives them the certainty needed to confidently make investments in cleaner technologies, such as fuels that are alternatives to fossil fuels and the ships that run on them. In addition to the Getting to Zero Coalition, the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, is advocating for adoption when nations meet at IMO Headquarters in London from Oct. 14 to 17.

The project has been slated to begin construction in 2026. If completed, Maryland’s offshore wind project, developed by U.S. Wind, has the potential to power 718,000 homes. 2,680 new stable, well-paying jobs are also now in peril due to this announcement.

Despite multiple studies showing that states with the most renewable energy see the slowest—if any—rise in energy costs, the Trump administration has launched an all-out assault on offshore wind. In April, the administration issued a stop work order on the Empire Wind project in New York. This order was eventually reversed after costing the developer $50 million a week. Two weeks ago, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island received a similar order.

In response, Sierra Club Maryland Chapter Director Josh Tulkin issued the following response:

“The Maryland offshore wind project will provide good jobs, lower our energy bills, and help clean our air. By trying to derail this project, the Trump administration is withholding these benefits from Maryland families and residents, effectively leaving the solution to our energy and economic needs stranded in the water.

“The Atlantic coast has a wealth of wind waiting to be harnessed. We will continue to speak out and demand better for our state, championing clean, homegrown energy that prioritizes people over polluters.”

Sierra Club Senior Advisor Nancy Pyne added:

“Donald Trump is throwing a temper tantrum that's costing Americans cleaner air and lower electricity bills. Despite constantly talking about lowering prices for hardworking Americans and establishing energy dominance in the U.S., Donald Trump’s only real concern is how much profit fossil fuel companies are making. By attacking offshore wind in every way possible, Donald Trump is forcing Americans to rely on expensive and deadly gas and coal, while padding the profits of dirty polluters.

“Offshore wind development in the United States has already allowed hundreds of thousands of families to reliably and affordably power their homes without having to sacrifice their health. Sierra Club has been working to make offshore wind a reality in this country since day one—and we will keep on fighting until these windfarms are built.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-15 14:01:15.417624

That’s when Third Act Illinois and 350 Chicago are hosting a Solar Fest at Montrose Beach to celebrate the strides that clean energy has made in its fight against the fossil fuels industry.

It’s all a part of Sun Day, the first-ever nationwide day of action calling for the large-scale deployment of clean energy that is affordable, reliable, and ready to go.

Chicago’s Sun Day Solar Fest, near Montrose Beach from noon to 4 p.m., will include live demonstrations, valuable resources, dynamic speakers, live music, spontaneous flashmob dances, sing-alongs, a puppet parade, an electric vehicle show, and more.

Joining Third Act and 350 Chicago in supporting the event are more than 30 other organizations — including the Active Transportation Alliance — representing environmental and transportation action and justice, residential and community solar groups, as well as major universities and cultural institutions.

A CHANCE TO RISE UP FOR A SUN-POWERED PLANET

Timed to coincide with the fall equinox, Sun Day comes as the clean energy transition approaches a tipping point. Solar power is now the cheapest form of energy on the planet, clean energy jobs are growing rapidly, and communities across the country are experiencing the benefits of cleaner air and lower energy costs.

But powerful fossil fuel interests are working overtime to preserve the status quo. And the federal government has greatly reduced programs and incentives for solar, wind, and other renewable energy investments.

Bill McKibben, noted environmentalist, author, and a founder of Third Act and 350.org, reminds us that Americans have long thought of solar and wind as “alternative” energy, “the Whole Foods of energy: nice but pricey.” He says it’s time to think of it as “the Costco of energy: cheap, on the shelf, and available in bulk, ready to go.”

THE SUN CAN POWER THE WORLD, YOU CAN POWER A MOVEMENT

Solar power is affordable. It’s the cheapest way to power your home or business – most systems pay for themselves within a few years and can bring energy bills down.

Global solar capacity has grown more than tenfold in the past decade. It’s now the fastest growing energy source in the world.

The clean energy sector now employs millions of workers in the United States, creating sustainable jobs and economic growth in communities everywhere.

A solar system can provide your home with cheap and clean energy for decades. While traditional power grids fail during storms and emergencies, solar panels and the batteries they charge keep the lights on when you need them most.

Communities that get most of their power from solar energy report fewer asthma attacks, clearer skies, and quieter neighborhoods – clean energy improves lives in ways you can actually feel.

Installing solar roof panels is one of the best things you can do for your family’s health and future – they produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases during operation, improve local air quality, and reduce your carbon footprint.

So walk, run, bike, or CTA your way to the Sun Day Solar Fest on Sunday, September 21, at Montrose Beach near the dog park.

There you can take actionable steps toward supporting clean, sun-powered energy in your community. To RSVP or get more information, go to Sun Day Solar Fest.

On July 29, the EPA proposed to not only repeal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, but also to rescind the so-called ""endangerment finding""—the legal predicate for nearly all of the EPA's greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act. In this regard, the EPA is not seeking merely to undo regulations from the Obama and Biden administrations. It is also seeking to make it more difficult for future administrations to put such regulations back in place unless and until the EPA is instructed to do so by Congress. This is a high-risk strategy. . . .

The primary reason it is difficult to undo the endangerment finding is that the statutory standard is so easy to meet. For purposes of the Act, the question is not whether climate change is catastrophic, nor whether climate adaptation is preferable to mitigation, nor whether federal regulation of sector-specific emissions is rational or cost-beneficial, nor whether such regulations represent a serious or rational way to address the threat of climate change. Nor is the question whether the science is unequivocal, nor is it whether there is certainty about the likely effects of increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions over any given time period. Rather, the question is simply whether the EPA Administrator can ""reasonably anticipate"" that the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can have negative effects on health or welfare—effects which the Act defines to include the impact on climate, ""economic values,"" and ""personal comfort and well-being.""

While the EPA suggests that a less-alarmist interpretation of existing climate science is one reason to undo the endangerment finding, relying upon a draft report prepared for the Department of Energy, its primary argument is that the Clean Air Act ""does not authorize the EPA to proscribe emission standards to address global climate change concerns."" The problem is that this argument is almost certainly foreclosed by Massachusetts v. EPA, which expressly concluded that the Act ""authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a 'judgment' that such emissions contribute to climate change."" The EPA suggests one way to address this constraint is to note that domestic motor vehicle emissions are a small (and shrinking) share of global emissions, but Section 202 of the Clean Air Act (unlike some other provisions of the Act) conspicuously lacks any requirement that motor vehicle emissions contribute significantly to the problem.",https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cropped-rinsquareRGB-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-15 13:05:52.152238

“With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and powering the great American comeback is not a binary choice,” Zeldin added.

The agency said the mandatory collection of GHG emissions data from the approximately 8,000 facilities that had been subject to the reporting requirement was unnecessary because it is “not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.”

The agency’s action is the latest in a series of regulatory moves stemming from executive orders signed by President Donald Trump aimed at removing barriers to the development of the United States’ fossil fuel resources.

The EPA had previously announced its intention to repeal the so-called “endangerment finding” that enabled it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and other sources.

Currently, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requires 47 source categories covering 8,000 facilities and suppliers to calculate and submit their greenhouse gas emissions annually.

The government has been collecting the data since 2010, previously seeing it as a tool to track carbon dioxide, methane and other emissions believed to be accelerating climate change.

If the agency’s latest proposal is finalized, it would eliminate reporting obligations for all of these entities as well as CO2 injection sites.

More than a decade in the energy industry across the value chain and in companies such as ExxonMobil gave her insight into how energy companies operate – understanding which systems are critical and which create unnecessary bottlenecks.
“The key challenge facing oil companies today isn’t just optimizing current operations,” Sarah notes.
Sarah led the development of SaaS solutions and offshore applications, learning how to bridge traditional energy operations with digital technology.
Sarah’s background in both energy industry and strategic consulting gives her an edge when helping companies navigate major changes.","Global energy investment will reach a record $3.3 trillion in 2025, with clean energy spending hitting $2.2 trillion – more than double the $1.1 trillion projected for oil and gas, according to the International Energy Agency’s latest World Energy Investment report. This marks the first time clean energy investments significantly outpace fossil fuel spending. Solar power alone will attract $450 billion in investment, making it the single largest category. Meanwhile, upstream oil investment faces its first decline since the COVID crisis, dropping 6% due to lower prices and weakening demand expectations.

Major oil companies are responding with dramatic strategic shifts. Recent industry moves show the variety of paths being chosen: some companies are doubling down on traditional operations, other companies divest hydrocarbons assets to invest heavily in renewables, while others retreat from renewable commitments they made just years ago. Against this backdrop of industry uncertainty, Sarah Fluzin, a management consultant with deep energy sector expertise, recently completed a transformation project that will save a major oil company several billion dollars by 2030. The project focused on identifying operational inefficiencies that had accumulated over decades. Sarah’s team analyzed everything from maintenance schedules to supply chain logistics, finding that many processes were designed for favourable and steady market conditions. More than a decade in the energy industry across the value chain and in companies such as ExxonMobil gave her insight into how energy companies operate – understanding which systems are critical and which create unnecessary bottlenecks. This operational knowledge proved crucial when designing changes that wouldn’t disrupt production.

Multi-Billion Dollar Project

The upstream transformation required a complete redesign of operational models across several business units. For one of the largest Energy players worldwide, Sarah led analyst teams for nine months, identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies accumulated over decades. The project included an analysis of over 200 operational processes and an efficiency assessment of 20+ major production assets.

“We looked at everything from people and productivity to technology in operations and maintenance”, Sarah explains. “Many companies are still working in a way designed for oil at $100 per barrel while they would need to adapt to be profitable at $60 per barrel. The main savings generally come from productivity improvements, enabled by process optimization and technology”.

The savings target matches industry pressure to optimize operations.. Industry analysis shows companies increase focus on capital discipline and operational improvements to maintain profitability despite volatile oil prices.

Sarah’s approach goes beyond spreadsheet optimization. During her time at SBM Offshore, she led the development of an in-house application for managing offshore personnel. The system was needed because existing manual processes for tracking offshore workers certifications, shift schedules, and safety compliance were creating bottlenecks or potential safety risks during crew changes on offshore platforms.

Sarah developed a phased implementation plan that avoided operational disruptions during the digital transformation. Rather than implementing across all assets simultaneously, the team tested changes on two pilot facilities before scaling up.

Strategic Leadership Across Global Markets

Management consulting assignments took Sarah from Middle East to African private and public energy entities. One project involved helping a key GCC country develop a plan to hit ambitious renewable energy targets without hurting their oil-dependent economy. The challenge: how do you promise 50% renewable energy by 2030 when oil exports fund 80% of government spend?

“The key challenge facing oil companies today isn’t just optimizing current operations,” Sarah notes. “You need to build systems and capabilities that work across different price scenarios while preparing for long-term market shifts.”

Sarah’s work at AlixPartners, in the aeronautical sector acquisitions taught her to evaluate complex technical businesses quickly. When private equity firms consider buying aerospace companies, they need someone who can assess both the engineering capabilities and market positioning within weeks, not months.

One project involved due diligence for an aviation company with €800 million in revenue. Sarah analyzed strategy, operational and financial data, as well as market trends and competitor landscape. The work required understanding aviation regulatory requirements, manufacturing processes, and market dynamics – due diligence being a typical methodology that can be transposed to most industries, including the energy sector.

Having worked in multiple countries, gives Sarah insight into different business cultures. “In the Middle East, relationships have an important role to guarantee successful business partnership, then business,” she explains. “You could come up with a very sophisticated or efficient solution, but if you haven’t invested time in understanding local priorities and building trust with key stakeholders, the project might not reach the expected outcomes.”

The Gulf sustainability project took 18 months and required managing expectations from multiple entities. Sarah’s team had to balance ambitious environmental targets with realistic economic constraints. The final strategy included specific timelines, budget allocations, and performance metrics that satisfied both environmental advocates and economic planners.

From ExxonMobil to Management Consulting

Fifteen years in the Energy space gave Sarah a deep understanding of upstream and downstream operations before joining the consulting world. Her engineering degree provided technical foundations, while her MBA from HEC Paris added business strategy skills needed for senior consulting roles.

Sarah worked across the energy value chain, from Upstream to Downstream, the latter on refining operations and onshore mega projects.

The transition to digital project management proved crucial. Sarah led the development of SaaS solutions and offshore applications, learning how to bridge traditional energy operations with digital technology. This combination makes her effective at helping companies adopt new tools without disrupting critical operations.

Moving from operational roles to strategic consulting happened when Sarah saw the energy sector entering fundamental change. Companies needed advisors who understood both technical complexity and the business implications of transformation as well as the ability to contemplate innovative and inclusive business models, more aligned with environmental goals while leading on society major shifts such as AI.

“After 15 years in oil and gas, I felt I needed to renew myself and keep the learning going,” she explains. “I also assumed strict technical skills were not enough anymore. Companies needed people who could think strategically about business models, not just optimize existing processes. That’s why I decided to get an MBA – I needed to understand the businesses more holistically, think through new perspectives, understand how to think about transformations, prepare for the future versus solely applying skills to optimize operations and projects.”

Sarah managed operations teams of up to 50 engineers and coordinated brownfield projects worth several millions in capital expenditure. This experience with large-scale project management translates directly to her current consulting work, where she often leads transformation initiatives affecting thousands of employees.

Recognition and Market Impact

Sarah serves as a judge for Globee Awards, evaluating strategic excellence across different industries. This role positions her alongside other senior professionals who assess business transformation initiatives and innovative approaches to complex challenges.

A leading management consulting firm promoted Sarah to manager level after she demonstrated consistent results on complex projects. Top-tier consulting firms typically require 3-4 years of exceptional performance for such advancement. Sarah’s background in both energy industry and strategic consulting gives her an edge when helping companies navigate major changes.

Sustainability Focus

Sarah works on sustainability projects. She’s considering further academic studies in micro and nano-plastics – an area where she has strong interest.

Oil investment drops 6% this year, according to the IEA. Companies need to squeeze more profit from existing operations while preparing for an uncertain future. Sarah’s projects help them do both: optimize what they have now and build capabilities for whatever comes next.

Personal investments in environmental initiatives show Sarah understands where the industry is heading. Companies that ignore environmental requirements risk losing access to capital and markets in the coming years.

The sustainability work reflects broader industry recognition that environmental factors will increasingly drive business decisions. Sarah’s dual expertise in business optimization and sustainability strategy positions her uniquely for this evolving landscape.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/real_3beb2d4e-7ec4-4542-91e8-32e4800e6227.jpeg,N,,2025-09-15 13:05:04.394242

The 1.38-MWDC USS Golden Spike Solar project will lower electricity costs for three affordable housing providers and nearly 135 households, while providing clean electricity to the local grid.

“Golden Spike is a prime example of our efforts to make solar energy accessible while lowering burdensome electric costs for low-income households, renters, and small businesses,” said US Solar president Reed Richerson.

Golden Spike is located in Sauk Rapids, Minnesota, and has been seeded with native pollinator habitat to support critical pollinators like butterflies and bees.

While US Solar financed, developed, owns and operates Golden Spike, the company pioneered a new kind of working relationship for help reaching income-qualified households. By partnering with two Community Action Partners, Prairie Five and United Community Action Partnership (UCAP), US Solar was able to connect those households with energy savings. The partnership came together with the help of the Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA), a national nonprofit coalition of public agencies and organizations working to advance clean energy.

“At a time when more Minnesotans are struggling to pay their bills than ever, participating in programs like Minnesota’s LMIA CSG program is a vital way to reduce the energy burden,” said UCAP Executive Director Debi Brandt. “We’re thrilled to partner with US Solar and help the households we serve access the cost savings of community solar.”

Indeed, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a month later that the program was being frozen.

However, the program has been revised and stations are still being built under its purview.

It seems reasonable to assume that sometime between his January 20 executive order “Unleashing American Energy”—with its Section 1, “to eliminate the ‘electric vehicle mandate’ and promote true consumer choice”—and the end of EV tax credits after September 30, President Trump would have found a way to kill the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI) Congress adopted as part of President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure program in 2022.

Trump’s first-day EO prompted us to ask the Federal Highway Administration via email how many EV charging stations the NEVI program had built up to the point of that ominous executive order.

In May of the previous year, we reported that the program, then two years old, had yielded just eight chargers across the US.

As of August 27, there are 110 stations (about 500 charging ports) built by NEVI funding, as tracked in the station locater database according to the Federal Highway Administration.

That response came seven months after we asked the question.

“We’re going to see quite a flood of construction,” a person familiar with the program told Autoweek in September. This source believes the program will build a total of 200 stations by the end of the year, for about 1000 individual chargers.

After Trump’s January 20 EO, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in February announced the program was being frozen. In June, a federal judge ruled the Transportation Department had exceeded its authority in putting an end to the congressionally funded program.

That sort of judicial ruling hasn’t meant much elsewhere for the Trump White House. June also was the month when the House approved a $9 billion rescission package demanded by the president that included the high-profile cut of $1.1 billion to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for the current fiscal year and for 2026.

Instead of calling on Congress to do the same for NEVI, Trump jump-started NEVI last August 11, with Duffy saying, “if Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right.”

“Support from states that challenged the freeze also played a role in its prompting the restart and updated guidance,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, industry insights director and a specialist in the EV and electrified vehicle segments for Cox Automotive, told Autoweek.

The NEVI program requires states to supplement the federal funds allocated for EV charging station construction.

Duffy and the FHWA launched a review of the program’s guidance earlier this year to make NEVI more efficient. At the time, according to the FHWA, 84% of the NEVI Formula program funds remained unobligated, which the administration took as a “clear signal” of the program’s failure.

“NEVI was established to fund states’ deployment of EV charging infrastructure,” Duffy said, “but Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg added requirements that were difficult to understand and implement.”

The FHWA directs all states to submit updated plans, which once approved, can resume NEVI funding, the agency says.

This new guidance retains the $1 billion-per-year funding of the program through the current year and through 2026.

Six states already have federal approval for their plans to build more EV charging stations in 2026, according to the National Association of State Energy Officials’ (NASEO) EV States Clearinghouse.

According to NASEO’s EV clearinghouse, 44 states have issued at least one solicitation for federal funds, 38 states have issued awards to build stations, and 16 states have at least one operational station. States have awarded $544 million in funding to complement the $3.3 billion in federal funding allocated from 2022 to 2025.

While EV federal tax credits end September 30 (though the “leasing loophole” allows consumers to take delivery of an EV after that date and still get the tax credit if they make at least their first payment by then) the auto industry is not backing off a fossil fuel-free future.

Urgency over the end of the tax credit from the One Big Beautiful tax and spending bill passed early this summer has given a big boost to the EV segment. General Motors, the number-two EV purveyor in the US, said it sold a record 21,000 Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs in August, while Cox Automotive says strong EV sales from all brands in the US market in July and August will result in full third-quarter sales when September is counted that will easily break the current record of 356,000 sold in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The other significant rule of the “EV mandate” that Trump cut with his January 20 executive order is the Biden administration Environmental Protection Agency standard meant to boost electric vehicle sales to 30%-56% by 2030-32. While EV market share is very likely to be significantly lower than 30% in five years, the extension of the federal charging station program, which addresses a top concern of EV ownership by American consumers, should guarantee continued electric vehicle growth.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I4s4HuwCJDp5vwyjkQGp8A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autos.autoweek.com/7eb6c789e37190566e810c33000540e1,N,,2025-09-15 15:01:05.577132

This week, it passed legislation that will put it in the lead on school meals in yet another way – banning ultra-processed foods.
On Friday, California lawmakers passed a bill that will define, and then ban, ultra-processed foods from school meals.
This year, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Utah and West Virginia have all passed laws that will ban foods containing certain dyes and additives from school meals.
But implementing a ban on UPFs in California school meals will take more work than simply defining UPFs, food policy experts say.","California has long led the way on school meals. In 2022, it became the first state in the country to make school meals free for all students, regardless of income. Many districts have implemented farm-to-school programs to bring local foods into the cafeteria. And last year, months before the “Make America healthy again” movement would make its way to the White House, it became the first state in the nation to ban six synthetic food dyes from school meals.

This week, it passed legislation that will put it in the lead on school meals in yet another way – banning ultra-processed foods. On Friday, California lawmakers passed a bill that will define, and then ban, ultra-processed foods from school meals. The legislation, which must now be signed by the governor, Gavin Newsom, is believed to include the first statutory definition of ultra-processed foods in the world.

“We have so far found a formula that we think works and can help guide the national conversation on these issues,” said California state assembly member Jesse Gabriel, who sponsored the bill. That formula, he said, is “bipartisan, common sense, science-based”.

Ultra-processed foods, or UPFs, are industrially formulated products that are often high in fats, starches, sugars and additives, and make up 73% of the US food supply today. Think fast food, microwave dinners, sodas, chips, and even packaged bread and sweetened yoghurts.

Although nutritionists have been talking about UPFs for more than a decade, the US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr – a longtime pseudoscience proponent – made them a household term through his “Make America healthy again” coalition. While the federal government has yet to take any significant steps to rein in UPFs – Kennedy’s rhetoric, and growing concerns over the safety of the food supply, have spurred more states to begin assessing ways they can limit UPFs.

But much of that work began in California. In 2023, the legislature passed a first-in-the-nation law, also sponsored by Gabriel, to ban four chemicals already prohibited in the European Union and other nations.

“It really blew my mind how out of step the United States is with the rest of the world when it comes to food safety,” said Gabriel. “We don’t love our kids here in the United States any less than they love their kids in Sweden or Saudi Arabia or South Korea. So why is it that they are taking stronger measures to protect their kids than we are?”

More than 20 other states have copied California’s ban on those four chemicals, or its similar ban on six synthetic food dyes in school meals.

Although it’s the first state to define UPFs, California is far from the only one to consider ways to remove them from school meals and the broader food supply. According to researchers at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, lawmakers in at least 18 states have introduced more than 40 pieces of legislation that would restrict the sale of foods with certain additives. This year, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Utah and West Virginia have all passed laws that will ban foods containing certain dyes and additives from school meals.

“There’s something so interesting about California and West Virginia bookending the country both physically, but also with this issue around food safety,” said Bernadette del Chiaro, senior vice-president for California at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy group focused on environmental and agricultural policy, which has backed the California law.

Although Kennedy has spoken out against UPFs from his post in Donald Trump’s Republican administration, Democratic states and lawmakers have raised concerns about food safety as well. But red and blue states have taken different approaches to defining the UPFs they seek to ban.

“It is really hard to define an ultra processed food,” said del Chiaro. “We all kind of know what junk food is when we see it, but putting that definition in writing that has the force of law behind it is” more difficult.

Food policy experts have generally followed a system called the Nova classification to define UPFs, but even nutritionists sometimes disagree over what counts as a UPF. The Nova classification categorizes a product as “ultra-processed” if it’s industrially formulated to be “edible, palatable and habit-forming”. But because that definition is based on processing, not specific ingredients, it can be difficult to agree on exactly which foods fall into the category.

Lindsey Smith Taillie, a professor of nutrition and co-director of the Global Food Research Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said she and her colleagues have noted three different approaches states are taking to define the UPFs they seek to ban.

The most common definition of UPFs is foods that include any of about a dozen additives, “primarily artificial food dyes and then a couple emulsifiers or dough conditioners”, said Smith Taillie. A handful of other states, such as Texas and Louisiana, have used a definition that includes about 40 additives, she said, though there’s no clear through-line for why those additives were chosen, as they include some that have already been banned in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. California, she said, stands out for taking “the most rigorous approach to evaluating the science”.

“California is the state that is coming the closest so far to trying to actually take action on this concept of UPFs as it has been defined in the literature, which I think is important because that’s where the evidence of health harm is,” Smith Taillie said. “When we look at what a lot of these states are doing with a super-narrow definition of additive, there’s really no body of evidence that suggests that that’s going to make an impact on health.”

The text of California’s new law defines a UPF as any food or beverage that contains stabilizers, thickeners, propellants, colors, emulsifiers, flavoring agents, flavor enhancers, nonnutritive sweeteners or surface-active agents – and has high amounts of saturated fat, sodium or added sugar, or nonnutritive sweeteners.

Del Chiaro, of the Environmental Working Group, hopes California’s definition might lead the way for other states and school districts.

“Shifting the purchasing decisions of the fourth-largest economy in the world, and the most populous state in the country, I think will have an absolute, positive effect on the buying options that other school districts have,” she said. “I think there will be a snowball effect here that’ll help kids all across America.”

Dating back to the 1970s, scholars have described a “California effect” in which other jurisdictions or industries adopt the regulatory standards set by one region – often California – because it is more efficient to apply the same standards everywhere. The first of those regulations forced automakers to abide by the state’s clean air policies, and more recent ones have aimed to eliminate single-use plastics.

But implementing a ban on UPFs in California school meals will take more work than simply defining UPFs, food policy experts say.

Alternatives to UPFs “would require, by definition, more cooking”, said Smith Taillie. “The only way to really do that would be, you would have to increase labor cost.”

Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food policy at New York University, agrees.

“Taking UPFs out of school meals means providing kids with whole, not UPF, foods. These either have to come pre-prepared or cooked on site,” she said in an email. “USDA reimbursements have to cover not only the food; they also have to cover staff salaries, equipment and supplies.”

“Schools turn to UPFs because they are cheaper and save staff time,” she added. “Taking UPFs out of schools has to be coupled to higher reimbursement rates or it won’t work.”

In the process of passing this bill, Gabriel said many legislators had the same concern about cost. But what they found was that it’s often cheaper to eliminate UPFs. “What was very helpful to us there is that there are a number of districts in California that have already moved in this direction. And so we actually had food service directors come in and testify,” he said. “Not only had it not cost them more, but in many districts they had actually saved money by switching to healthier alternatives.”

He shares an example of switching from serving a syrup with pancakes that contains high fructose corn syrup, cellulose gum, caramel color and other hard-to-pronounce ingredients to one that solely contains maple syrup. In many cases, it’s not a change that is “necessarily gonna cost districts more”, he said.

Del Chiaro of the Environmental Working Group agrees that omitting UPFs doesn’t have to be expensive, and “isn’t likely to have a massive impact of any kind on school budgets”.

“This bill is not mandating that everybody buy organic $6-a-carton blueberries,” she said. “All we’re doing is getting rid of the particularly harmful ultra-processed foods on the lunch tray.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2d398896428d7b15a5baeaae07e8b3c5d10ff/110_0_3374_2700/master/3374.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04ca4663cbeb0562048f200f79e81a22",N,,2025-09-15 13:06:00.761121

OPINION – Following BOEM’s announcement canceling future offshore wind leases across the U.S., it’s important to remember that California still holds existing leases, including the wind area off the Central Coast. As an IBEW electrician, it’s clear to me that offshore wind is essential for our region’s future.

Having spent my career as an IBEW electrician on the Central Coast, specifically Morro Bay and San Luis Obispo, I’ve seen firsthand how this region has powered California, from Diablo Canyon to various fossil fuel operations. We understand the energy business, and frankly, it’s time for a change. As we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, offshore wind isn’t just a good idea; it’s the perfect solution for our community and our future.

The most immediate and tangible benefit of offshore wind is jobs. Good, union jobs. These aren’t temporary gigs; they are long-term careers that will provide stability and prosperity for families right here on the Central Coast. We’re talking about jobs in manufacturing, construction, operations, and maintenance – all roles where skilled tradespeople, like my IBEW brothers and sisters, will be in high demand. We’ve seen firsthand how a robust energy sector can support local economies, and offshore wind offers us a chance to revive that economic engine for generations to come.

Beyond job creation, offshore wind addresses a critical need for our region: energy infrastructure. The Central Coast is currently losing out on business opportunities because we simply don’t have the energy capacity to power new businesses that want to move to our area. This isn’t just an inconvenience, it’s a drag on our economic growth and a limit to our potential. Offshore wind provides a reliable, clean energy source that can directly power our local economy, ensuring that the energy we produce off our coast is used right here, creating a self-sufficient and resilient energy grid.

Furthermore, this is about building a secure and affordable energy future. Union members are committed to keeping California affordable, and that extends to the energy we produce. By investing in offshore wind, we are investing in a stable energy supply that will help regulate energy costs and provide a consistent source of power for our homes, businesses, and industries. This isn’t just about environmental stewardship, it’s about practical economics and ensuring a strong future for the Central Coast.

Now, let me be clear: supporting offshore wind doesn’t make me an environmentalist. I’m an electrician. My primary concern is providing reliable power and good jobs. My priority is ensuring that our nation remains strong, economically stable, and self-sufficient. For me, offshore wind is a common-sense solution to real-world problems.

Keeping America resilient means having a robust energy supply. It means creating and sustaining well-paying jobs for American workers. It means investing in infrastructure that supports our economy and allows businesses to thrive. It means adapting to new technologies and embracing innovation. Offshore wind does all of these things. It’s an opportunity to revitalize our manufacturing sector, train a new generation of skilled workers, and secure our energy independence. This isn’t about political ideology — it’s about pragmatism, progress, and powering our future.

The Central Coast has always been a place of innovation and hard work. Let’s continue that legacy by embracing offshore wind. It’s a win-win for our community, our economy, and our future.

General Motors, the number-two EV purveyor in the US, said it sold a record 21,000 Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs in August, while Cox Automotive says strong EV sales from all brands in the US market in July and August will result in full third-quarter sales when September is counted that will easily break the current record of 356,000 sold in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The other significant rule of the “EV mandate” that Trump cut with his January 20 executive order is the Biden administration Environmental Protection Agency standard meant to boost electric vehicle sales to 30%-56% by 2030-32. While EV market share is very likely to be significantly lower than 30% in five years, the extension of the federal charging station program, which addresses a top concern of EV ownership by American consumers, should guarantee continued electric vehicle growth.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-an-aerial-view-tesla-cars-recharge-at-a-tesla-charger-news-photo-1757948513.pjpeg?crop=0.984xw:0.719xh;0,0.176xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-09-15 12:05:32.646576

But the automotive gods have finally smiled on budget-conscious buyers: used EVs now cost less than comparable gas cars, flipping decades of conventional wisdom on its head.

The Great Price Reversal

Used EV values dropped 30-39% year-over-year while gas cars declined just 3-7%.

The numbers tell a story that would make any spreadsheet enthusiast weep with joy. Average used EVs hit $28,767 in May 2024, compared to $31,424 for used gas vehicles—a gap that widens monthly as inventory floods the market. This isn’t some statistical anomaly; it’s rapid battery innovation making three-year-old EVs feel ancient compared to today’s 300+ mile range models.

Federal Money on the Table

Up to $4,000 in tax credits sweetens deals on qualifying used EVs.

Uncle Sam wants you driving electric badly enough to subsidize your car payments. Qualifying used EVs under $25,000 earn buyers up to $4,000 in federal tax credits—essentially a government-sponsored discount that makes already cheaper EVs even more attractive. With 34% of used EV inventory now priced under $25,000, you’re looking at real money back at tax time.

Warranty Safety Net

Most used EVs remain under manufacturer coverage, eliminating battery replacement anxiety.

Here’s where the market gets interesting: 72% of used EVs are less than five years old, with 45% from 2023 or later. Translation? Your biggest fear about expensive battery replacement is largely unfounded. Most available models remain under partial warranty coverage, turning what was once a financial gamble into a calculated risk.

“The No. 1 thing we see time and time again is that the biggest factor is price. It’s not range anxiety or culture wars, it’s price,” according to Tom Narayan, auto industry analyst with RBC Capital Markets.

This window won’t stay open forever as federal incentives face expiration.

Continued dialogue between small business owners, business advocates, and policymakers is essential in fostering a business-friendly climate in the Detroit Region.","During the September 2025 Small Business and Policy event, business advocates and a local legislator spoke to small business owners at the Detroit Regional Chamber to engage with local businesses, hear about their challenges, and share opportunities for them to utilize, including the cross-functional partnerships fostered by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) and those within the city of Detroit, including the Buildings, Safety Engineering, and Environmental Department (BSEED).

The Value of Partnerships and Streamlining Assistance

Opening the conversation, MEDC’s Senior Vice President for Small Business and Talent, Amy Rencher, discussed the top three concerns of business owners she hears, with access to capital being a primary issue.

She explained the various programs available to support small businesses in their search for capital, including the State’s Small Business Credit Initiative and the Michigan Innovation Fund. Rencher noted that a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem and close collaboration among partners are key to driving the state’s economic growth.

“We have a standing network of hundreds of partners, and we really added on to that in the past couple of years through the [small business] support hubs work,” she said, noting that there are 27 across the state. Through what is dubbed the “hub and spoke” model, their network of partners ensures that both rural and urban communities are not left excluded.

“We have a very strong network of partners for entrepreneurs and innovation in the state,” Rencher said, emphasizing the importance of collaboration to achieve greater impact.

Rencher also spoke about PitchMI, a series of regional pitch competitions designed to support early-stage tech and high-growth companies across the state as part of a broader effort to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in Michigan. The regional competitions offer a total of $250,000 in prizes, with a grand prize of $1 million to be awarded in April 2026.

Removing Burdensome Regulation

State Rep. Joe Aragona (R-Clinton Twp.) spoke primarily on his dedication to reducing regulatory burdens for small businesses. With a background in small business himself, the Chairman of the Regulatory Reform Committee shared that he understands the challenges of owning and operating a small business firsthand.

“Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,” he said, adding, “Whatever we need to do is just get regulations out of businesses’ way.”

He also shared how small business regulation hinders other areas of Michigan’s economic development, including housing, and how small businesses face different requirements across municipalities, complicating the process.

“It’s amazing the different hoops you have to jump through. There’s one set of hoops through this municipality, one set of hoops through another, and they’re all completely different. And you’re building the exact same house,” he said, emphasizing how housing developers struggle to operate across communities in the same county. These regulatory challenges on a hyperlocal level can have a larger-scale effect on Michigan’s economy as new businesses look to move to Michigan.

Regulation and Compliance in Detroit

Arthur Rushin, the City of Detroit’s Chief Enforcement Officer of BSEED, shared how his program’s efforts to improve the licensing and compliance process for small businesses within Detroit have been successful.

He explained that one of the department’s most powerful tools is the Development Resource Center and its online zoning portal. By simply entering an address, business owners can instantly see whether their intended use for a location is permitted, restricted, or requires special approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals. The portal doesn’t just give a yes-or-no answer; it outlines the exact steps needed to move forward so owners can plan whether or not to move forward with their business there and the steps needed to do so.

“We are a resource,” Rushin said. “No project is too small. That’s one of the things we want to make sure we stress to the public… reach out to us first, and we are literally going to walk you through the process of how to get your business started, so that way you can avoid some of the pitfalls.”

Rushin’s advice to Detroit small business owners is clear: start with BSEED before you start your business, because you can get additional resources like a free preliminary plan review.

“You come to us and say, ‘This is what I want to do, I have part of the plan,’ and we will work with you,” he said. “The department partners with agencies like the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation and participates in compliance clinics across the city to help owners get into compliance [and] stay in compliance.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed ending its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program for power plant owners and other sources of carbon emissions — a move carbon capture advocates say would hurt efforts to develop the carbon capture and storage sector.

Parts of the EPA’s GHG reporting program are “inextricably” tied to the federal Section 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and storage, according to the Carbon Capture Coalition.

“Should this proposed rule be finalized as is, the fate of hundreds of announced carbon management projects nationwide and the billions of dollars in capital investments and corresponding jobs will be on the line,” Jessie Stolark, the coalition’s executive director, said Friday in a press release.

Treasury Department and IRS requirements for monitoring, reporting and verification programs for geologic carbon storage require taxpayers claiming the 45Q tax credit to show how much carbon they are storing by using the EPA’s GHG reporting program, according to the coalition.

Carbon management project developers have invested about $77.5 billion on existing and near-term projects, according to the coalition. “It is not an understatement that the long-term success of the carbon management industry — and the significant economic and environmental benefits it fosters across the country — rests on the robust reporting mechanisms in place through the U.S. EPA,” Stolark said.

The Carbon Capture Coalition supports policies that enable the commercial deployment of carbon management technology. Its members include unions, environmental groups and companies such as Calpine, DTE Energy, GE Vernova and NRG Energy.

Under the EPA’s GHG reporting program, initially mandated by Congress in 2008, organizations in 46 source categories are required to report their carbon emissions every year.

However, the EPA contends that the Clean Air Act doesn’t require GHG reporting for sectors outside the petroleum and natural gas source category, according to the proposal. For that category, the EPA proposed ending reporting requirements for natural gas distribution utilities and suspending them for the rest of the category until 2034, in line with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The EPA expects the proposal will save affected companies about $303 million a year, with the petroleum and natural gas industry saving $256 million annually, according to an agency fact sheet.

EPA will accept comments on the proposal for 47 days after it is published in the Federal Register.

“Congress and the Administration have made meaningful progress on this vital issue, and now is the time to finish the job by enacting bipartisan permitting reform legislation.

The report details the economic harm caused by unnecessary permitting delays, highlights recent progress through legislation and executive action, and offers a comprehensive set of reforms to accelerate project approvals across energy, transportation, technology and other critical sectors.

“The biggest lever to unlock America’s economic potential is modernizing our permitting process,” said Brendan Bechtel, Chairman and CEO of Bechtel and Chair of the Business Roundtable Smart Regulation Committee. “From delivering clean energy and AI data centers to meeting the President’s goal of ten new nuclear reactors by 2030, the United States cannot afford to let projects sit idle for years. The policies in this report would help break the logjam and unleash investment, innovation and job creation across every sector.”

“If we want to compete and win in the coming decades, America needs a permitting process that moves at the pace of our ambitions,” said Joshua Bolten, CEO of Business Roundtable. “Congress and the Administration have made meaningful progress on this vital issue, and now is the time to finish the job by enacting bipartisan permitting reform legislation. Without the comprehensive, durable improvements outlined in this report, the United States will continue to leave trillions in investment on the sidelines.”

Problems with America’s current permitting system:

Cumbersome and time-consuming – The federal permitting process takes four to five years on average, with some projects delayed further by litigation long after agency approval.

Costly to communities and the economy – An estimated $1.5 trillion in investment is currently awaiting federal permits, while the unrealized induced GDP impact of infrastructure projects now in federal review totals approximately $1.7 trillion to $2.4 trillion.

Fragmented and redundant – Multiple overlapping reviews across agencies and jurisdictions create unnecessary duplication and delay.

Vulnerable to legal gridlock – Lengthy litigation timelines leave projects in limbo, undermining environmental review certainty and economic planning.

Policy recommendations to build on recent meaningful permitting reforms:

Improve and focus environmental reviews – Limit National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews to impacts not already under another agency’s jurisdiction, require agencies to make permitting decisions within 90 days of issuing a final Environmental Impact Statement or Environmental Assessments and expand categorical exclusions.

Reform the NEPA litigation process – Specify a statute of limitations of no more than 150 days, expedite case schedules and limit injunctions that block construction after procedural compliance.

Increase domestic energy production and export – Accelerate permitting for all energy resources, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities, pipelines and carbon capture infrastructure.

Expand and improve transmission capabilities and capacity – Improve the speed of the interconnection queue process and support regional and interregional transmission planning.

Ensure secure supply chains – Facilitate responsible domestic mining, processing and recycling of critical minerals essential to semiconductors, defense and advanced manufacturing.

Modernize digital and AI infrastructure approvals – Codify NEPA categorical exclusions for new and existing facilities, allow a mutual recognition permitting approval process for federal, state and local applications, and require permitting authorities to establish a single point of contact.",https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2F679146658e6d45af922aa9d9409fb683%2Ffd27341a6ba7451dbe31fc8465d7c67b?quality=60&width=200&height=200,N,,2025-09-15 13:05:29.112903

Only machinery and vehicles — including German cars and industrial equipment — showed strength, with Europe’s surplus in that sector rising to 21.4 billion euros in July from 16.5 billion euros in June.","BRUSSELS (CN) — Europe’s trade advantage over the U.S. shrank by another $5 billion in July, data released Monday shows, as a monthslong shift continued with Europeans buying significantly more American goods while exports across the Atlantic fell.

The European Union’s trade surplus with the U.S. fell to 13 billion euros ($14.3 billion) in July from 18 billion euros ($19.8 billion) a year earlier, according to official EU data. The shift represents the largest monthly deterioration in the trade relationship since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.

The eurozone — the 20 EU countries that use the euro currency — showed similar patterns, with its global trade surplus falling to 12.4 billion euros from 18.5 billion euros a year earlier.

European imports of U.S. goods surged 10.7% to 31.2 billion euros, while U.S. purchases of European products dropped 4.4% to 44.2 billion euros. The diverging trends signal a fundamental shift in one of the world’s most important trade relationships.

For the first seven months of 2025, Europe’s overall trade surplus with the rest of the world plummeted to 91.8 billion euros from 108.9 billion euros in the same period last year — a decline of 17.1 billion euros, reflecting broader competitiveness challenges.

The deteriorating U.S. relationship drove much of that decline. European exports to the U.S. have fallen as the dollar strengthened and American consumers shifted purchasing patterns, while Europeans are buying more American energy, technology and agricultural products.

European chemical companies — which produce everything from plastics to pharmaceuticals — saw their global trade surplus collapse from 22.2 billion euros to 16.6 billion euros compared to July 2024, a 5.6-billion-euro drop that largely reflects reduced U.S. demand.

Other European-manufactured goods also struggled, with the trade deficit in that sector widening from 1.9 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros.

Only machinery and vehicles — including German cars and industrial equipment — showed strength, with Europe’s surplus in that sector rising to 21.4 billion euros in July from 16.5 billion euros in June.

The trade deterioration reflects broader economic weakness across Europe, where second-quarter growth of just 0.1% lagged far behind the U.S. robust 0.8% expansion. European business investment plunged 1.8% in the second quarter while retail spending declined, reducing demand for U.S. products even as Europeans continued buying essential energy and technology.

Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, contracted 0.3% in the second quarter despite modest annual growth, directly impacting the chemicals and manufacturing sectors that traditionally drive European exports across the Atlantic.

The July figures represent a continuation of trade pressures that began when Trump imposed 10% tariffs on most EU goods in April, with automotive duties hitting 25%. As tensions escalated through the spring, Trump threatened to raise tariff rates to 30%, creating uncertainty that deepened the trade damage.

In June, the EU’s trade surplus had already plummeted 61% year-over-year to just 8 billion euros as businesses braced for potentially devastating tariff increases, with European exports to America falling 10.3% while imports surged 16.4%.

The July data suggest the bleeding continued even as Trump and EU leaders worked toward the trade agreement they would eventually reach on July 27, capping most tariffs at 15%.

The trade shift comes as Trump has intensified pressure on European allies to stop buying Russian oil and gas as a condition for stronger U.S. sanctions against Moscow. On Saturday, Trump wrote on a Truth Social post: “I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA.”

European officials bristled at Trump’s latest public ultimatum.

“We’re not going to comment on social media posts by the U.S. president,” a European Commission spokesman said curtly Monday when pressed about Trump’s demands during a Brussels briefing. “The successive sanctions packages we have brought forward are working. The economic evidence shows that they are having an impact on the Russian economy.”

The tensions reflect broader disagreements over sanctions coordination, with Trump’s assessment that European sanctions against Russia aren’t “tough enough.”

Energy has become a major factor in the changing trade relationship, with the United States now supplying 50.7% of Europe’s liquefied natural gas needs and serving as the bloc’s largest oil supplier at 15% of petroleum imports. European purchases of American liquefied natural gas have surged 113.5% in volume since 2021, a dramatic shift from when Russia provided 48% of EU natural gas and 29% of petroleum oil imports, compared to just 12% and 2% respectively by mid-2025.

European energy purchases from the U.S. totaled $76 billion in 2024, and the July 27 trade agreement commits the EU to buying $250 billion annually in U.S. energy over the next three years — more than tripling current import levels.

However, Trump has warned that tariffs could rise to 35% if the EU fails to meet its commitments, including an additional $600 billion in U.S. manufacturing investments.

The economic slowdown is beginning to affect European job markets, with employment growth slowing to 0.1% in both the eurozone and EU, down from 0.2% growth in the first quarter. Annual employment growth also slowed to 0.6% in the eurozone and 0.4% in the EU compared to the same period last year, according to separate EU data released Monday. About 219.9 million people were employed across the EU in the second quarter, with 171.6 million in the eurozone.

The labor market weakness extended to job openings, with European companies posting fewer available positions. The job vacancy rate fell to 2.1% across the EU in the second quarter, down from 2.4% a year earlier. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, saw its vacancy rate drop from 3.1% to 2.5%, while manufacturing job openings fell to just 1.6% across the EU, suggesting businesses are becoming more cautious about expansion plans amid trade uncertainties.

Trade between EU member states remained strong, rising 2.9% to 349.2 billion euros in July, suggesting Europe’s internal market continues functioning smoothly even as external trade weakens.

The U.S. represents Europe’s largest trading partner outside the European continent, making the relationship crucial for both economies. The European Union — a 27-country economic bloc that includes Germany, France, Italy and other major economies — operates as a single market larger than the United States. Unlike individual U.S. states, EU countries surrender their trade policy to Brussels, which negotiates on behalf of all members.

Unlike other states, which have set targets to reduce traffic and expand public transit, Massachusetts has pinned its climate strategy on hopes that consumers will start buying more electric vehicles (EVs).
The state's official Clean Energy and Climate Plan, published in 2020, says that ""Massachusetts will need to deploy 750,000 to one million ZEVs (zero emission vehicles) by 2030.""
In July, the Republican Party's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" eliminated a $7,500 federal rebate for new electric car purchases.
Researchers from Princeton University predict that the repeal of those benefits will considerably depress the market share for new electric vehicles in the next few years.","Recent actions from the Trump administration and other Republicans in Washington have considerably slowed the rate at which car buyers are choosing electric vehicles – a trend that puts the Commonwealth's legally-mandated pollution reduction targets even further out of reach.

Roads and highways are the biggest remaining source of greenhouse gas pollution (and air pollution in general) in New England. Unlike other states, which have set targets to reduce traffic and expand public transit, Massachusetts has pinned its climate strategy on hopes that consumers will start buying more electric vehicles (EVs).

The state's official Clean Energy and Climate Plan, published in 2020, says that ""Massachusetts will need to deploy 750,000 to one million ZEVs (zero emission vehicles) by 2030.""

That plan isn't working. As of July, there were only 152,000 fully electric or plug-in hybrid cars registered in the Commonwealth.

Meeting the low end of the state's 2030 target for EV deployment would require roughly one in three new car sales to be EVs each year over the next 5 years.

But EVs currently make up around 11 percent of new car sales, and those sales have slowed considerably this year, driven by plummeting demand for Teslas over the winter and spring.

Meanwhile, gasoline consumption – and all the air pollution that comes with it – is continuing to increase.

And then came Trump

If the outlook for the state's EV market was discouraging before, it's deteriorated even further in the last few months.

In July, the Republican Party's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" eliminated a $7,500 federal rebate for new electric car purchases. That rebate will no longer be available after September 30th.

Researchers from Princeton University predict that the repeal of those benefits will considerably depress the market share for new electric vehicles in the next few years. With the tax credits, EVs were expected to make up 40 percent of new car sales by 2030; without them, they're expected to represent just 24 percent of new cars by the end of the decade.

Congress has also voted to eliminate the ""Advanced Clean Cars"" rule, a California clean-air regulation that Massachusetts and several other states have adopted to gradually phase out the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles.

California regulators are fighting that legislation in court, and Attorney General Andrea Campbell joined the lawsuit in June.

But in Massachusetts, it's a bit of a moot point. In deference to lobbying from car dealers and manufacturers, Governor Healey had already announced (in May) that her administration won't enforce the Advanced Clean Car rule for the next two years anyhow.

Massachusetts Democrats sit idly by

This spring, the Massachusetts legislature announced that it was launching ""Response 2025,"" which lawmakers described as ""a coordinated effort"" to counteract new policies from Washington with legislation at the state level.

""We are committed to protecting our residents, defending our values, and leading Massachusetts through the uncertainty of federal action,"" Senate President Karen E. Spilka said in an April 1 press release. ""The Senate will not sit idly by—we have heard the concerns of our residents, and we are prepared to act.""

StreetsblogMASS reached out to Sen. Cindy Friedman of Arlington, who's leading the ""Response 2025"" initiative, to ask whether she and her colleagues were discussing any ideas for putting the transportation sector back on track to meet the state's climate goals.

Stephen Acosta, a spokesperson for the Senator, wrote back to tell StreetsblogMASS that ""unfortunately, she's not available to speak on this.""

At a ribbon-cutting for a new e-bike charging station in Somerville last month, StreetsblogMASS put a similar question to the Commonwealth's Transportation Secretary Monica Tibbits-Nutt.

""We're keeping with pushing ahead,"" said Tibbits-Nutt. ""We have the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI), which is $65 million from the federal government which we have obligated.""

That federal program is also under fire from Washington's Republicans, but the funding will install new charging stations every 50 miles along the Commonwealth's major highways.

Still, without a major change in course in the Commonwealth's current laws and regulations, there won't be nearly enough electric vehicles using those stations to make a meaningful impact on air pollution.

Course correction

When we pressed Tibbits-Nutt to tell us what her agency would do to reduce the root cause of highway pollution – the excessive number of vehicles clogging the state's roadways – the Secretary cited the administration's efforts to fund the MBTA and increase funding for the state's Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs).

""For us it's always been the focus, on reducing VMT (vehicle miles travelled). One of the reasons I think the Legislature is with the record amount of transportation funding, especially to the MBTA, we're able to put more buses on the road and expand transit, so we can encourage people to that mode shift,"" said Tibbits-Nutt.

But the vast majority of the Legislature's budget increases for transit agencies this year is merely backfilling a decade's worth of cuts and deferred maintenance left over from Gov. Baker's administration. The T still has a multi-billion dollar shortfall for repair projects, and its most transformative plans to expand transit service remain unfunded.

Seth Gadbois, an attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation, says there's a fundamental gap in accountability between what lawmakers have promised in the Global Warming Solutions Act and what they fund in their budgets.

""States like Massachusetts not only have the space to act, they have a legal and moral responsibility to do so,"" Gadbois told StreetsblogMASS (editor's note: the Conservation Law Foundation is the fiscal sponsor of StreetsblogMASS, which means it administers our payroll and finances; it does not have any role in governance or editorial decisions).

Gadbois has been working with a handful of lawmakers, led by Sen. Cynthia Creem of Newton and Rep. Jack Patrick Lewis of Framingham, to pass what they're calling the ""Freedom to Move Act,"" which would require MassDOT to align its spending priorities with the pollution reduction mandates in the state's Global Warming Solutions Act.

Lawmakers in Colorado, Washington, and Minnesota have already passed similar laws.

""Right now we don’t have a check against whether our transportation dollars are helping or hurting our climate targets,"" said Gadbois. ""Freedom to Move aligns state level transport policy and spending with our climate obligations... It’s a big policy alignment shift that will ultimately expand the menu of options for how people get around.""

At the ribbon-cutting in Somerville last month, we asked Tibbit-Nutt whether she supported the Freedom to Move Act, or whether MassDOT had taken a position.

As economies and political arenas may vary, there are some common themes worth exploring:

Workforce: Policies outlining apprenticeships, careers in technical education (CTE), and grants driven by the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act (WIOA);

Capital-Investment: Incentives including equipment grants, refundable wage credits, and tax credits for clean-energy manufacturers; and

Regulation and Permitting: Deliberations on environmental and infrastructure priorities.

Below is a brief overview of each state’s relevant activities:

Operating on a biennial budget, Maine is focused on financing programs for farm equipment and state-administered incentives through entities like the Maine Technology Institute (MTI) among others. AEM’s Advocacy Team is following discussions on proposed fees and product-specific regulatory changes like Polyfluoroalkyl Substance (PFAS) policies post-ban. Forthcoming legislation will be monitored for anticipated equipment-related appropriations and repair measures that could affect local suppliers and dealers.

The recent 2024–28 workforce plan (mandated by Blanketed environmental rulemaking is affecting permitting timelines for heavy-equipment installers and outdoor operations. Monitoring workforce grants and EDIP eligibility as changes are discussed will be of central importance.

Recently enacted policies prioritized economic and workforce development (S.122/Act 65purchase funding, and grants for farm modernization and water infrastructure. While balancing new business resources with regulation and costs remain key, manufacturers that sell to farms should track VEGI eligibility and capital grants.

Local-aid and business tax credits were center stage this year. AEM’s Advocacy Team is focused on expanded workforce funding, targeted tax-credit programs, and ongoing incentive language that can influence site-selection and workforce pipeline development. Municipal procurement and local permitting reforms being discussed by the municipal associations are impacting installers and on-site equipment businesses and should continue to provide insight on opportunities.

Boosting direct manufacturing supports like the Manufacturing Equipment Grant Program reimbursing up to 50% of equipment purchase or down payment was the focus. There were also some adjustments to taxes and fuel fees aimed at lowering the near-term capital cost of buying machinery and encouraging tech upgrades in small- and mid-sized shops. AEM’s Advocacy Team will continue engaging on program details and scoring criteria for equipment grants.

Site readiness, broadband, and targeted capital financing being provided by the Council on Development Finance is through loans and grants. These loans and grants can also be leveraged for factory modernization. The new administration has touted less reliance on traditional grants and revamping existing policies. AEM’s Advocacy Team will be monitoring any changes to incentive structures and forthcoming bond/capital projects legislation.

Recent policies expanded business incentives, jobs retention and training credits, resiliency programming, and clean-energy procurement preferences, while modernizing manufacturing support for sectors like semiconductor and advanced-manufacturing. State-level clean energy and solar program funding changes are affecting supply chains for equipment makers in the state by redistributing incentives. This creates the need to review tax-credit policy as it is implemented with a focus on manufacturing wage/training credits.

Benefitting from a proposed increase in funding for vocational education, apprenticeships, and advanced-manufacturing workforce grants; equipment manufacturers could also see scaled tech training. Workforce pipeline investments that improve access to skilled operators/technicians and job retention credits for site expansions are being prioritized in the budget proposal also. The budget process currently lies with the General Assembly awaiting votes for final passage.

New Jersey

Last month the Governor signed a significant manufacturing tax-credit package: $500 million to expand tax credits for manufacturers who locate or grow their business in the state. From that, $200 million is being dedicated over the next two years for clean-energy product manufacturers (solar, geothermal, green hydrogen).

Analysis by financial advisory Lazard found that solar levelized cost of electricity beats the lowest-cost fossil fuel for new-build projects, even without tax credits.","The U.S. solar industry is grappling with heavy changes to energy industrial policy, as federal legislation removes incentives that were designed to accelerate the transition to renewables.

On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump voiced support for an “all the above” approach to energy policy. However, the second Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress have come down hard on solar, wind, and electric vehicles via Congressional budget changes and executive actions.

Chief among the changes within the OBBBA are the early phase-outs of the 48E Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC). Both credits are demand-side incentives that have been instrumental in speeding up the energy transition.

The early loss of tax credits is expected to deal long-term damage to the industry. Wood Mackenzie forecasts that 10-year installations could decrease 17%, reaching volumes as low as 375 GW.

Crunch time

Following a predicted boom to meet deadlines for accessing the PTC and ITC, U.S. clean-energy installations could plunge 41% after 2027, according to a forecast from BloombergNEF (BNEF).

Previously, the 48E and 45Y tax credits were to be available to projects until the United States achieved a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2022 levels. These credits were made available via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.

Now, under the OBBBA, solar and wind projects that begin construction more than 12 months after the July 4 enactment must be “placed in service,” meaning reaching commercial operations, by Dec. 31, 2027, to qualify for credits.

Projects that begin construction within 12 months of enactment can be eligible for tax credits if a “substantial portion” is built. These projects are “safe harbored” and can gain the tax credit if they are placed in service by mid-2030.

“Solar installations are expected to increase in 2025-26 as developers rush to meet deadlines,” said Wood Mackenzie. “Permitted projects are well-positioned, but unpermitted developments face growing uncertainty as permitting bottlenecks threaten to push completion dates outside eligibility windows.”

Keith Martin, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright, said projects will likely need to “incur” at least 5% of their cost to qualify for safe harbor designation. “Costs are usually incurred only as the developer takes delivery of equipment or services, with one exception. A payment for specific equipment or services by the deadline counts if delivery is reasonably expected within 3.5 months. There are nuances about counting payments for services,” said Martin.

The other path to qualification, he said, is to start “physical work of a significant nature” at a project site on portions of an installation eligible for the 48E credit.

“In the short term, we’re all going to be extremely busy trying to get projects going at the outset of July 4, 2026,” said Martin, appearing on the “Currents” podcast hosted by law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. “After that, I think people will have their heads down trying to develop and build these projects, finance them. There’ll be a distant place and service date for those.”

“So I think we’ll do fine,” said Martin. “Eventually there will be a new administration. Maybe people will be more concerned about climate change. We’ve seen this play before. These tax credits started in 1992 and they have expired, been restored, expired, been restored. So it’s perfectly possible we’ll see that again.”

The storm is surely in sight. In July, shortly following passage of OBBBA, New Leaf Energy, a community and utility-scale project developer, laid off about one-fifth of its workforce – 41 out of 217 employees. “The pathway to developing clean energy projects has narrowed, but it has not vanished; reducing the size of the company is intended to provide stability and free cash while the company adapts to a changed market for the long term,” said New Leaf Energy in a statement.

Unlike solar and wind, grid-scale energy storage will remain eligible for the ITC and PTC under its original schedule. The 48E and 45Y credits for storage projects will phase out by 25% each year starting in 2032 until Dec. 31, 2035, when the credits will expire entirely.

What’s more, projects are facing tightened restrictions on components and materials sourced from “Foreign Entities of Concern” (see pp. 10-12).

Residential pressure

The window is even tighter for residential solar. While lobbying was successful in preventing a near-instant phase-out of the 48E ITC, the 25D tax credit for residential solar projects, paid directly to individuals who purchase home solar with a loan or cash, is phased out for projects not installed by the end of 2025.

The cuts to credits come at a particularly hard time for U.S. residential solar. Installations declined 31% in 2024, according to Wood Mackenzie. Over the last year, industry titans like SunPower, Sunnova, and Mosaic Solar have filed for bankruptcy. The industry historically has leaned on the value proposition of lowering customer electricity bills and providing predictable costs for the long term. However, that value has been increasingly difficult to provide.

Gone are the days of low interest rates enabling attractive finance terms for loans or leased systems. In many major markets, such as California, net metering rates for sending excess electricity to the grid have been slashed by 75% or more. One pathway to continuing to drive customer value is pursuing lower soft costs – expenses not tied to hardware.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said more than 65% of the cost to install residential solar is related to soft costs like paying sales teams, securing permits, and grid connection costs. The United States may find a path forward by pursuing market conditions like Australia, where over 40% of homes in some regions have rooftop solar. Soft costs are far lower in the nation, with an average residential solar installation cost of AUD 0.89/W ($0.58), according to a January 2025 report from price comparison website Compare the Market – more than AUD 2.00/W cheaper than in both Canada and the United States.

Underlying strength

Since long-term federal tax credits were enacted by the IRA, about 80% of investment announcements were in Republican-led districts. More than 224 projects totaling nearly $110 billion in investment and leading to more than 83,000 jobs were announced in Republican voting districts, according to E2. Even before the OBBBA was passed, the looming threat of cuts led to billions of dollars in project and factory cancellations and the loss of tens of thousands of expected or existing jobs in these districts.

However, the fundamentals for solar remain strong. Analysis by financial advisory Lazard found that solar levelized cost of electricity beats the lowest-cost fossil fuel for new-build projects, even without tax credits. Solar represented 78% of new capacity added to the grid in 2025 through April, according to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission data. With electricity demand expected to rise 2% per year and 50% cumulatively by 2050, according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, demand for projects that can be added to the grid quickly will remain robust.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Solar_installation_technician_on_rooftop_5392894792-1536x865-1-1200x676.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:05:46.502426

Alternative energy truck maker ZM Trucks cut the ribbon on its U.S. headquarters and assembly plant last month in Fontana, California — launching its expansion just as federal EV tax credits wind down, emissions rules shift and charging infrastructure remains uneven.

Even so, the company says policy headwinds won’t deter it from competing in the North American market.

“ZM Trucks has never relied on federal incentives as part of our go-to-market strategy,” a spokesperson for the OEM said in an email to Trucking Dive on Sept. 9. Instead, the company focuses on state-level programs in key markets, such as New York, New Jersey, Texas and California — along with plans for Nevada and Washington.

A subsidiary of Japan-based ZO Motors, ZM Trucks has the benefit of a global perspective when it comes to its customers’ potential charging concerns. ZO Motors has plants in Japan and Cambodia, producing both electric- and hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles.

“Our experience has shown that establishing ‘behind-the-fence’ charging is critical for a successful transition to electric powertrains,” ZM Trucks said via email. “Relying on public charging as a primary solution is cost-prohibitive in the U.S. While it’s useful as a backup in emergencies, it doesn’t support a sustainable business case on its own.”

With infrastructure seen as a limiting factor, ZM Trucks is turning attention to what it can control: production.

At its 210,000-square-foot facility in Fontana, ZM Trucks currently has 39 employees on its pilot line, where it plans to build two models:

The battery-electric T75, a heavy-duty vehicle built for ports, warehouses and distribution yards with a 75-mile range

The battery-electric ZM8, a short-wheelbase model designed for urban delivery and upfit applications with an estimated 165-mile range

So far, the ZM8 has found its largest base among final-mile delivery companies and small businesses, while the T75 is currently used exclusively in port operations. The company did not disclose customer names.

Notably, the factory was designed to build ZM Trucks’ T75, ZM8 and future models all on the same line. Once the line is fully operational, it will be tooled to produce three trucks per hour, the company said.

“With our current tooling investment, we can support three jobs per hour on a single shift — giving us ample production capacity to meet future demand,” ZM Trucks said, noting production is constrained by supply chain lead times, rather than its ability to scale internally.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/dooKGyzDOaKkvv-Aqa401oke3OYPeyw2ImG0pgFXG5U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9aTVRydWNrc0V2ZW50MjAyNTQ1LnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-15 12:05:49.922524

Researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and LG Energy Solution have developed a ""cohesion-inhibiting new liquid electrolyte"" that effectively solves the dendrite problem that has long plagued lithium-metal batteries. This innovation enables remarkable performance metrics that could transform the EV landscape: 800km range on a single charge, a lifespan exceeding 300,000km, and most impressively, a super-fast charging time of just 12 minutes.

The dendrite challenge is solved

Lithium-metal batteries, which replace the graphite anode found in conventional lithium-ion batteries with pure lithium metal, offer significantly higher energy density. However, they've been hampered by the formation of dendrites—tree-like lithium crystal structures that grow on the anode surface during charging, particularly during rapid charging cycles.

The research team identified that non-uniform interfacial cohesion on the lithium metal surface is the fundamental cause of dendrite formation during rapid charging. Their solution employs an anion structure with weak binding affinity to lithium ions, which minimizes interface non-uniformity and effectively suppresses dendrite growth even under fast-charging conditions.

""This research has become a key foundation for overcoming the technical challenges of lithium-metal batteries by understanding the interfacial structure,"" stated Professor Hee Tak Kim from KAIST's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. ""It has overcome the biggest barrier to the introduction of lithium-metal batteries for electric vehicles.""

The study was published in Nature Energy on September 3, 2025, with Hyeokjin Kwon as the first author.

This breakthrough joins a wave of recent advancements in fast-charging battery technology that we have been featuring in recent months:

In May 2025, CATL unveiled its Ultra-Fast battery technology, which can provide enough charge for 75km of driving in mere seconds. CATL's second-generation Shenxing battery technology aims to deliver charging speeds comparable to refueling a gasoline vehicle, potentially accelerating mass EV adoption.

The CATL Shenxing Pro battery employs several innovative approaches to achieve its remarkable charging speeds. As we reported, the Shenxing Pro batteries feature a 758 km WLTP range and are specifically designed for Europe's growing EV market with fast-charging capabilities.

According to Inside EVs, CATL claims this is ""the world's first LFP battery featuring both an 800 km range and a 12C peak charging rate,"" making it one of the most impressive advancements in LFP battery technology to date.

Industry implications

The IEA Global EV Outlook 2025 report highlights that fast-charging infrastructure is rapidly becoming essential for EV adoption worldwide. According to our cousins at EV Infrastructure News, global fast charging capacity is projected to grow more than tenfold by 2030, keeping pace with the growing EV market that exceeded 17 million sales globally in 2024.

Leawat has also entered the ultra-fast charging space with their 46-Series cylindrical batteries featuring 20% reduced internal resistance, 5% higher energy density, and an impressive 50C discharge rate, as announced at The Battery Show Europe 2025.

The KAIST/LG Energy Solution breakthrough represents a significant leap forward, as their 12-minute charging time for an 800km range battery would effectively eliminate range anxiety and charging concerns for most consumers.

Associated Press

The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency’s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.

“It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,” he said. “With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.”

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

By hiding pollution information from the public, “Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,” Goffman said, calling the plan “yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal “a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don’t know who the polluters are, they can’t do anything to hold them responsible.”

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers “have depended on this data” for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

“Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency’s statutory obligations,” he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25255740590738.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:06:31.001258

As one of the hottest topics in boardrooms and for governments, it is the subject of a key panel at Sustainability LIVE: Climate Week NYC on 22 September at Convene, 360 Madison Avenue, NYC.

Hundreds of c-suite sustainability leaders will gather for the landmark event, hoping for new ideas on how to accelerate the energy transition.

The Future of Energy Transition, sponsored by Siemens

Automation Machinery Manufacturing giant Siemens is sponsoring the panel, which will be introduced with a keynote by Stacy Mahler, US Head of Sustainability.

Stacy has more than 15 years of experience in the industrial and energy sectors.

As Head of Sustainability for Siemens Smart Infrastructure (SI) in the US, she engages organisations on their sustainability journey.

Her work includes helping them with infrastructure enhancements that improve energy efficiency, integrate renewable energy and enable electrification of transportation and facilities.

Stacy also supports the carbon reduction roadmap for Siemens SI’s carbon footprint in the US.

She holds a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Florida and an MBA from Northwestern University.

Three major themes

While the panellists are likely to cover a broad range of aspects to the energy transition, three in particular are expected to feature:

Decentralisation of energy systems

The future of energy is moving from centralised, fossil-fuel power plants to decentralised networks of renewable generation.

Solar rooftops, wind farms, microgrids and virtual power plants (VPPs) are among the technologies designed to increase resilience against blackouts, reduce transmission losses and democratise access to clean energy.

Companies are pioneering distributed solutions, while governments are updating regulations to accommodate peer-to-peer energy trading.

Decentralisation also supports rural electrification, particularly in emerging economies, where microgrids can leapfrog traditional grid infrastructure.

Electrification of transport and industry

Hard-to-abate sectors transport and heavy industry are attempting to electrify to cut reliance on oil, coal and gas.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are scaling rapidly, with many global automakers committing to phase out combustion engines.

In heavy industry, processes including steelmaking and cement production are increasingly using renewable power.

The challenge lies in ensuring that grids can handle increased demand without compromising reliability – meaning energy storage, demand response and grid modernisation will be crucial.

Green hydrogen and alternative fuels

Green hydrogen, produced through renewable-powered electrolysis, is emerging as one of the keys of the energy transition.

It offers a solution for sectors where direct electrification is difficult, such as aviation, shipping and heavy industry.

Companies including Air Liquide, Siemens Energy and bp are investing heavily in hydrogen infrastructure.

Alongside biofuels and synthetic fuels, hydrogen promises to help decarbonise global trade and transport. But scaling requires massive investment, cost reductions and supportive policies.

Leaders from NVIDIA, Oracle and EEI

Stacy will be joined on the panel, moderated by BizClik Group Broadcast Director Neil Perry, by:

Josh Parker, Head of Sustainability, NVIDIA

An engineer and a lawyer, Josh believes following the data wherever it leads is critical for an effective sustainability programme.

He previously led sustainability at Western Digital, a computer storage company, and practised patent law at the law firm Baker Botts.

Jennifer Ruch, Energy & Sustainability Director, Oracle

Jennifer is an energy strategy and sustainability leader focusing on cloud and hyperscale data centre deployments globally.

She is responsible for elevating energy strategy, renewable energy procurement and sustainability globally at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

Jennifer also leads efforts to embed sustainability in site selection, portfolio management and data centre design.

These include a deal between X-Energy and Centrica, with plans to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool.
This would cut nuclear approvals for advanced designs, such as the Rolls-Royce SMR, from three to four years to just two.

These include a deal between X-Energy and Centrica, with plans to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. This would generate enough power for 1.5 million homes, and create up to 2,500 jobs. The project, the companies noted, could be worth £40bn in economic value, with £12bn of value within the North East of England alone.

The suite of deals would also include an £11bn project between Holtec, EDF and Tritax creating advanced data centres powered by small modular reactors in Nottinghamshire, and a project between Last Energy and DP World, backed by £80m in private investment, to establish one of the world’s first micro modular nuclear power plants.

It also includes a £4m deal between Urenco and Radiant to supply advanced HALEU fuel to the US market, and a plan between TerraPower and KBR to conduct studies and evaluate UK sites for the deployment of the Ntrium advanced reactor technology, with each reactor supporting around 1,600 construction jobs and 250 permanent jobs.

Under the deal, the US and UK could fast-track reactor design checks for those reactors already rigorously checked in one country to avoid duplication of work. This would cut nuclear approvals for advanced designs, such as the Rolls-Royce SMR, from three to four years to just two.

The deal has the potential to create around 2,500 jobs in Teesside, going beyond the already 11,000 jobs created in 2025 through government-led investment, according to Nuclear Industry Association statistics.

The partnership also extends to fusion energy through co-ordinated experimental programmes, in which AI technology is used to create advanced simulation tools. Following this, a global fusion energy policy summit will be co-hosted in the US in 2026, to strengthen international cooperation on fusion energy.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “This landmark UK-US nuclear partnership is not just about powering our homes, it’s about powering our economy, our communities, and our ambition. These major commitments set us well on course to a golden age of nuclear that will drive down household bills in the long run, while delivering thousands of good jobs in the short term.

“Together with the US, we’re building a golden age of nuclear that puts both countries at the forefront of global innovation and investment.”

Prior projects

Expanded nuclear power is central to the UK Government’s clean energy mission, part of the UK’s drive to build more clean power for improved energy security.

This deal is part of what has been described by the UK Government as a ‘golden age’ of nuclear, and follows a £38bn investment in the Sizewell C nuclear power plant by investors including the UK Government, Canadian multinational La Caisse, British energy giant Centrica, EDF and Amber Infrastructure.

The Sizewell C plant will have an operating lifespan of at least 60 years. While project costs have grown from £20bn over the years, partly due to inflation, the UK Government maintains that it represents value for money, with £2bn of avoided annual electricity system costs predicted compared to renewables.

Critics of the nuclear power drive have raised objections that the nuclear fuel cycle produces significant volumes of dangerous waste, some of which remains radioactive for thousands of years. However, proponents highlight nuclear power’s low-carbon nature and ability to reliably generate energy at any time of day, at scale.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated: “We’re kickstarting a golden age of nuclear in this country, joining forces with the US to turbocharge new nuclear developments and secure the technologies of the future.

“Nuclear will power our homes with clean, homegrown energy and the private sector is building it in Britain, delivering growth and well-paid skilled jobs for working people.”",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/full_42080.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:06:09.665807

The likely tradeoff, of course, is thinner margins on the inventory that's being cleared out. According to a report from StoneEagle, front-end gross profits on leases – all leases, not just EVs – turned negative in July for the first time since early 2020.

""Our data shows that dealers leaned on aggressive lease strategies, particularly in EVs, to clear aging inventory ahead of expiring EV tax incentives,"" Allen says.

Deadline Essentially Extended

Some context: The earlier expectation was that EV buyers had to take actual delivery by Sept. 30, when the $7,500 EV tax break is set to expire. But on Aug. 21, the IRS published guidance that says EV buyers still qualify for the incentive as long as they get their orders in by the deadline, even if actual delivery takes place later.

The actual wording is trickier. The IRS says that to qualify for the tax incentive, the buyer has to ""acquire"" an EV by the deadline. But in a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" section of the notice, the IRS states, ""a vehicle is 'acquired' as of the date a written binding contract is entered into and a payment has been made. A payment includes a nominal down payment or a vehicle trade-in.""

With the deadline approaching, manufacturers are making ""call to action"" appeals to likely EV consumers. ""Federal Tax Credit Expires in Three Weeks,"" says the subject line of an email Tesla sent out Sept. 9 to consumers who had expressed an interest in the brand.

EV buyers are responding, often through leases, says Melinda Zabritski, head of Automotive Financial Insights for Experian Automotive, tells WardsAuto.

According to the Experian State of the Automotive Finance Market report for the second quarter, published on Aug. 28, leases account for 57.7% of EV financing, up from 47% a year ago.

The installation is one of three that supplies renewable energy to the Rhode Island electric grid, in exchange for utility bill credits for regional housing authorities, lowering their operating costs and ultimately lowering energy prices for public housing residents. Announced in 2021, the construction of the project is now complete, and all three solar installations are supplying green energy to the Rhode Island electric grid.

The collaboration between PHARI, Nautilus and Veolia is a first of its kind in the nation encompassing multiple public housing authorities under a single renewable energy contract. The Exeter Mail installation is the largest of three contracted by the housing authorities.

Combined, the three sites exceed 13 MW, removing approximately 4,800 metric tons of greenhouse gases annually, the equivalent of taking more than 1,000 cars off the road. The market value of the generation from the three projects will be distributed among nine housing authorities in Rhode Island (Providence, North Providence, Newport, Cranston, Smithfield, Warwick, Warren, Bristol and Lincoln) in the form of utility bill credits. The credits will generate a discount against prevailing electricity supply rates, which lowers the operating budgets of the housing authorities in a region with some of the highest energy costs in the U.S. , benefiting both taxpayers and public housing families.

Located primarily in the towns of Exeter and Smithfield, the solar fields provide approximately 20 million kilowatt hours annually. The projects are estimated to save over $35 million in energy costs over the next 20 years.

Nautilus has overseen the development, permitting and construction of the solar installation. The company will now look after the ongoing management, maintenance and performance for the life of the projects, estimated at 25 to 30 years. Leveraging its deep knowledge of decarbonization, power optimization, and solar generation, Veolia was selected by PHARI to serve as a buy-side agent for the collaboration of housing authorities to manage the procurement effort, advise technically and manage the complexity of the vendor selection process.

The energy generated from the projects now feeds into the electric utility territory of Rhode Island Energy, a subsidiary of PPL Corporation. The completion of the Exeter Mail 6.5 MW field, the third of three that were contracted, marks the conclusion of this project.

Karin Hamel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Veolia's Sustainable Industries and Buildings business said: ""Veolia is proud to contribute to this transformative solar installation, which not only harnesses the power of renewable energy but also directly supports the well-being of thousands of low-income families in Rhode Island. This project aligns with Veolia's GreenUp strategy. Producing local, low-carbon energy is a critical growth booster for accelerating ecological transformation. This project is a perfect example of how green energy can be used for good.""

Jeffrey Cheng, Chief Executive Officer of Nautilus Solar said: ""This solar installation marks an important milestone in our mission to make clean energy more accessible. By delivering the benefits of community solar directly to public housing residents, we're pioneering a model that supports renewable energy goals while delivering long-term economic benefits to the local community. Rhode Island continues to be a key state for innovation in clean energy access, and we're proud to continue growing our investment in the state while building stronger, more resilient communities.""

Robert Coupe, PHARI Co-President and Executive Director of Cranston Housing Authority said: ""Every housing authority in Rhode Island is working to provide the highest quality affordable housing possible with limited budgets. Our partnership with Veolia and Nautilus dramatically reduces utility costs, freeing up valuable resources to invest in property maintenance, facility improvements and operational support. By supporting the growth of renewable energy projects, we are improving the quality of life for future generations while enhancing our ability to serve current residents.""

The Scale of the Problem

Food waste in the United States is staggering. According to a 2025 EPA report titled, “Estimating the Cost of Food Waste to American Consumers,” Americans collectively throw away more than 133 billion pounds of food annually. That translates into over $400 billion in lost value and makes food waste the single largest component of municipal landfills. On an individual level, the cost is equally striking – consumers lose an estimated $728 per person each year, or nearly $3,000 for a family of four. These losses represent roughly 11 percent of household food spending.

Beyond the financial implications, wasted food carries environmental and human costs. Decomposing food in landfills generates methane – a greenhouse gas significantly more potent than carbon dioxide. At the same time, millions of American households are food insecure, highlighting the disconnect between food supply and food access.

Feed It Onward is a voluntary program connecting farms, restaurants, grocery stores, food brands, military bases, and nonprofits already engaged in “food recovery efforts” to minimize food waste. By providing a national platform, EPA hopes to amplify success stories, promote collaboration, and inspire replication across communities.

The program reflects the values of America’s 250th anniversary celebration – generosity, grit, and community – by showcasing how everyday Americans are turning food waste into opportunity. Its launch event included a tangible example – Frey Farms delivered a truckload of fresh produce that would have otherwise gone to a landfill, providing meals for military families at Scott Air Force Base.

EPA has long emphasized waste reduction and sustainable materials management. While Feed It Onward does not create new legal mandates, it sits within a larger policy landscape where federal, state, and local governments regulate waste disposal, landfill management, and greenhouse gas emissions.

The voluntary nature of the initiative makes it more of a public-private partnership platform than a regulatory program. However, businesses and institutions that participate may benefit indirectly from reduced disposal costs, enhanced compliance with state-level waste diversion requirements, and improved ESG performance.

Aligning with EPA’s national platform can also provide reputational benefits. For companies navigating tightening state food waste laws – such as mandatory organics recycling requirements in California and New York – voluntary engagement with Feed It Onward can complement compliance efforts and demonstrate proactive corporate responsibility.

Feed It Onward underscores the intersection of environmental protection, economic efficiency, and community well-being. By offering a national platform for voluntary collaboration, EPA is positioning the program as both a celebratory initiative for America’s 250th anniversary and a practical response to one of the country’s most persistent waste challenges.

For businesses, nonprofits, and communities, participation represents not only an opportunity to reduce waste but also to strengthen relationships, improve environmental outcomes, and enhance resilience. While voluntary in design, the program may shape the broader policy conversation around food waste, sustainability, and corporate responsibility in the coming years.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.11157_2634.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:03:26.643810

This track record reflects a conservative capital allocation strategy that prioritizes reliability—a critical factor in the utility sector, where earnings stability is paramount.

MGE Energy's recent financial performance further reinforces its value proposition. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, the company has maintained a consistent dividend policy and demonstrated operational efficiency, as evidenced by its recognition as the most reliable electric utility in the United StatesHome - MGE Energy, Inc. - Madison, Wisconsin, [https://www.mgeenergy.com/][ 2 ]. These accolades are not merely symbolic; they translate into customer retention, regulatory favor, and investor confidence.

Risks and Considerations

No investment is without risk. MGE Energy's reliance on state-level regulatory approvals means its clean energy projects could face delays or cost overruns. Additionally, while its methane reduction goals are ambitious, achieving net-zero emissions will require sustained capital expenditures and technological innovation. However, the company's track record of prudent investment and its alignment with national decarbonization goals suggest these challenges are manageable.

Conclusion: A Model for the Future of Utilities

MGE Energy exemplifies how a traditional utility can evolve into a clean energy leader without sacrificing shareholder value. By investing in solar, wind, and storage infrastructure, targeting emissions reductions, and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation, the company is well-positioned to thrive in a low-carbon economy. For investors seeking exposure to the energy transition while preserving income and capital appreciation, MGE Energy offers a compelling case study in strategic resilience.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757945900897.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-15 15:01:30.723117

Why Battery Recycling Matters

From smartphones and laptops to e-scooters and power tools, batteries power nearly every part of daily life. Most of these rechargeable devices run on lithium-ion batteries made up of limited resources like lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese. When batteries are recycled, these valuable materials can be recovered and repurposed domestically, reducing reliance on global supply chains, preventing safety hazards, and strengthening America's energy future.

That mission is at the heart of Batteries Plus, which recycles more than 52 million pounds of batteries each year. By keeping thousands of tons of these materials out of landfills and in circulation, the brand helps prevent dangerous battery-related fires in waste facilities while securing critical minerals for reuse. With 730+ locations nationwide and more than three decades of recycling expertise, Batteries Plus is leading the effort to make battery recycling a simple, safe, and repeatable habit for communities everywhere.

Road ahead The IEA stresses that achieving net-zero scenarios would require green hydrogen to make up 65 per cent of global hydrogen output by 2035, up from just 1 per cent today.","Global hydrogen deployment is gathering pace, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned in its Global Hydrogen Review 2025 that stronger policy support, investments and infrastructure are vital to meet net-zero goals, even as India emerges as one of the fastest movers with plans to produce 5 million tonnes (mt) annually by 2030.

The report highlights that hydrogen demand worldwide is set to rise from about 95 million tonnes (mt) today to over 180 mt by 2030, driven largely by decarbonisation commitments in heavy industry, long-haul transport and power. Yet, most of the growth so far has come from fossil-based hydrogen, and low-emission hydrogen accounts for less than 2 per cent of production.

“Hydrogen is no longer a niche discussion — it is becoming a central pillar of clean energy strategies worldwide,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “But we need to close the gap between ambition and action.”

Clean hydrogen capacity surges but lags targets

Globally, more than 220 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyser capacity is in various stages of planning, with about 15 GW operational or under construction — a sharp increase from under 1 GW just three years ago. Electrolysers use renewable electricity to produce green hydrogen, which can slash lifecycle emissions by over 90 per cent compared to fossil hydrogen.

Still, the IEA warned that only a fraction of these projects is progressing to final investment decisions (FIDs). Supply chain constraints, permitting delays, and uncertain demand visibility are slowing momentum.

“Announced projects could deliver the volumes needed, but the reality is that too few are reaching the construction phase,” the report cautions. “Clear long-term policy signals are vital to unlock private capital.”

Investment and policy landscape strengthening

Over 50 countries now have national hydrogen strategies, while dedicated public funding pledges have crossed $280 billion through 2030. The European Union, United States, Japan, and South Korea are leading on subsidy frameworks, carbon contracts for difference, and production tax credits.

The U S Inflation Reduction Act has emerged as a game changer, offering up to $3 per kg of green hydrogen produced, while the EU has launched its Hydrogen Bank to support early projects and import corridors.

“Stable revenue mechanisms and coordinated infrastructure planning are now the decisive factors for market take-off,” the IEA said.

India ramps up Green Hydrogen ambition

Meanwhile, IEA noted that India is among the fastest movers, with the National Green Hydrogen Mission, aiming to produce 5 mt of green hydrogen annually by 2030, supported by an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore.

India is racing to establish a fully indigenous solar manufacturing ecosystem by 2028, with plans to produce not just solar modules but also cells, wafers and ingots domestically to slash import dependence, create jobs, attract investments and position India as a global clean energy powerhouse, Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi announced on September 11, 2025.

India has already crossed 251.5 GW of non-fossil installed capacity — achieving over half of its 2030 target of 500 GW — and hit 50 per cent of total installed power capacity from non-fossil fuels five years ahead of schedule.

The country has already notified incentives for electrolyser manufacturing and green hydrogen production, while state governments such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Odisha are rolling out policies for dedicated renewable zones and port-based hydrogen hubs.

“India has the dual advantage of abundant renewable potential and a fast-growing industrial base,” the report observes. “If it succeeds in lowering production costs, it could become one of the world’s largest exporters.”

Companies like Reliance, Adani, NTPC, and Indian Oil have announced multi-gigawatt projects, while ports such as Mundra and Vizag are positioning to export green ammonia to Europe and Asia. However, the report warns that cost competitiveness hinges on scaling electrolysers rapidly and reducing renewable power tariffs.

Road ahead

The IEA stresses that achieving net-zero scenarios would require green hydrogen to make up 65 per cent of global hydrogen output by 2035, up from just 1 per cent today. This demands faster permitting, better infrastructure planning, and robust demand-creation policies in steel, fertilisers, shipping, and aviation.

“Hydrogen is essential to decarbonise the toughest sectors,” Birol said. “But without faster progress this decade, we risk missing our climate targets.”

The review concludes that coordinated international efforts, carbon pricing, and trade rules are critical to accelerate the clean hydrogen economy — and that India, if it executes its plans, could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this global shift.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-09-15%2F58bqyuxi%2FHydrogen.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-15 12:07:28.037834

The British government is hopeful that reaching a deal with the United States will speed up what has, so far, been a halting effort to build nuclear plants in Britain. “Together with the U.S., we are building a golden age of nuclear,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement on Monday.

Mr. Starmer’s government favors construction of more nuclear plants despite their drawbacks. These facilities come with huge price tags and other risks, but they produce large volumes of steady energy with low emissions.

The industry’s advocates say that the benefits of having large domestic sources of power generation outweigh the negatives. “Replacing reliance on imports with domestic carbon-free power will contribute significantly to the U.K.’s energy security,” said Vincent C. Zabielski, a partner at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman in London who works on nuclear issues.

Building nuclear stations also creates jobs, an important consideration for the government, which is aligned with the trade unions. About 98,000 people already work in the industry in Britain, constructing, operating and decommissioning plants, according to the Nuclear Industry Association, a trade group.

Britain’s existing nuclear plants are gradually reaching the end of their lives, and the country is struggling to add new ones. The last nuclear station to be completed, Sizewell B in Suffolk, began generating electricity in 1995.

Given how quickly the political winds on clean energy have shifted in the U.S. over the past year, it’s easy to lose sight of the continued momentum.

But focus on the facts, not the rhetoric, and you see the real story. Investors and companies are making choices driven by innovation, efficiency, opportunity, and profitability. And I, along with many of these leaders, will be at Climate Week in New York City next week, underscoring how seriously they’re pursuing these opportunities.

The headwinds are real, with the federal government actively opposing clean energy. And with special interests waging a politically driven campaign to force investors to ignore climate risks, introducing hundreds of state laws to control private investment strategy.

But alongside this turbulence, the market forces driving the clean economy remain undeniable. Rising energy demand and spiking costs. Weather damage topped $93 billion in just the first half of this year. Fierce global competition in markets from batteries to sustainable agriculture. And an urgent need to cut pollution and safeguard natural resources that businesses rely on.

Opportunities and choices

These forces bring both opportunities and choices for investors and businesses to double down, shape policy, and accelerate cost reductions and innovation that benefits consumers and creates good paying jobs.

They are why solar investment—the most cost effective and faster energy to deploy in the U.S. held steady this year this year in the U.S. despite federal backsliding and why more solar and battery capacity is expected to be installed in the U.S. over next three years than at any other time in the past. Texas leads the nation, ranking first in both utility-scale solar and land-based wind capacity. Globally, clean energy and grid investments are projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025—twice the amount expected to flow into fossil fuels this year

They are reflected in the strategic planning and capex decisions companies are making to compete in an advanced global economy and deliver returns for their investors. According to PWC, 84% of corporations are standing by their goals for cutting carbon pollution, and 37% are increasing their ambitions, because they know that climate solutions are good for business. A Morgan Stanley survey finds that 88% of companies see sustainability as a driver of long-term value, and more than 80% can track measurable ROI on their projects. Sustainability is no longer about compliance—it's about profit and resilience.

Risk management tells the same story. Some 61% of business leaders expect rising climate disruptions to create costs, with over half building adaptation and resilience into strategies. And 92% of businesses say the cost of inaction to their business will be higher than the cost of transition, compounding risk and hindering growth.

Winners and Losers

Right now, the U.S. federal government is in retreat, ceding the lead to other countries, China chief among them. The setback threatens American companies’ ability to compete and scale homegrown manufacturing in growing markets, from batteries to electric vehicles. It also creates harmful friction for utilities eager to adopt the cheapest, most readily available energy to power AI—just when the technology’s expansion depends on speed and competing demand is driving energy costs up.

Momentum alone won’t secure America’s leadership. What happens next depends on choices—by businesses and investors to press for smarter policy, expand markets, and prove that clean energy is the most competitive path forward.

Lean into the states

The biggest opportunity to sustain the clean energy boom and reduce pollution lies with the states, where forward-looking policies can help companies, investors, and consumers. For example, more than 40 businesses, including IKEA U.S, Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, and REI Co-op, are urging California to strengthen its cap-and-trade program. This market-based approach, long recognized as the most efficient and affordable way to cut carbon pollution, has fueled private investment, created good-paying jobs, funded programs that lower energy bills, and kept California competitive as the world’s fourth largest economy.

Continue championing efforts to protect core American freedoms

Since 2023, more than 400 bills have been introduced to ban investment and business strategies that consider all financial risks and opportunities in decision-making, including those related to climate risks, supply chains, and governance. Fewer than 8% have passed—largely due to fears of market distortion, higher costs, and dangerous precedent. But the push continues and so does the need to aggressively counter it.

Keep engaging on federal policy

Federal backsliding is a material setback not just for U.S. clean energy growth, but the government’s own security, energy, and manufacturing goals. Over the next year, the private sector can continue laying out this reality to Congress[SS1] . Businesses are already mobilizing to push for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to uphold the greenhouse gas Endangerment Finding to protect the stable policy environment that businesses need to invest confidently in critical 21st industries. And with Trump’s budget bill now passed, members of Congress are already acknowledging they will need to address surfacing problems.

Industry leaders can help shape solutions by advocating for policies that meet rising energy demand and combat rising electricity prices through new transmission infrastructure and permitting that includes clean energy. And by extending and simplifying wind and solar tax credits, which President Trump’s budget bill sharply curtailed.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68c81957d1860af8beb31c15/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-15 11:01:55.598611

The Roots of Imbalance: Oversupply, Storage, and Infrastructure

Negative prices typically arise when supply outstrips demand and storage capacity reaches saturation. Texas, with its sprawling Permian Basin and prolific shale production, has long been a bellwether for such imbalances. In 2019, for instance, the Henry Hub in Louisiana—a key pricing point—saw prices dip into negative territory as a cold snap froze pipelines, stranding supply and overwhelming storage facilities: Texas.gov | The Official Website of the State of Texas[ 1 ]. While Texas's own grid (managed by ERCOT) is geographically and politically isolated, its natural gas infrastructure faces similar constraints.

The state's reliance on just-in-time delivery systems, rather than robust storage infrastructure, exacerbates volatility. According to a 2023 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Texas's natural gas working gas in storage remains below the five-year average, leaving the system vulnerable to sudden shifts in supply or demand. This fragility is compounded by the rapid growth of renewable energy. Wind power, which accounts for over 40% of Texas's electricity generation during peak periods, can lead to sudden surges in energy supply, further depressing gas prices when grid flexibility is insufficient to absorb the excess.

Infrastructure Bottlenecks: A System in Perpetual Strain

Texas's energy infrastructure, though historically robust, is increasingly strained by its own success. The state's “energy-only” market model, which relies on short-term price signals rather than long-term investment incentives, has left critical bottlenecks unaddressed. For example, the lack of interconnections between ERCOT and neighboring grids limits the ability to export surplus energy during periods of oversupply. A 2024 analysis by the Rhodium Group noted that such isolation amplifies price distortions, as Texas cannot easily balance its market with broader regional trends.

Pipeline constraints further compound the issue. The state's natural gas gathering and transmission systems, while extensive, were not designed for the scale of production seen in the 21st century. During periods of high production, especially in regions like the Permian, the cost of transporting gas to market can exceed its value, leading producers to curtail output or, in extreme cases, pay buyers to take the gas. This dynamic, as highlighted by BloombergNEF in 2023, is a harbinger of systemic risk: when infrastructure lags behind production, the entire market becomes prone to cascading failures.

The Tipping Point: Policy and Investment Imperatives

The question is no longer whether Texas will face another episode of negative pricing but when—and how prepared the system will be. The 2021 winter storm Uri, which caused catastrophic power outages, exposed the state's vulnerability to extreme weather and inadequate infrastructure hardening. Yet, as of 2025, progress on long-term solutions remains uneven.

Investors must weigh the risks of continued underinvestment in storage, grid interconnections, and demand-side management against the potential for regulatory intervention. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has signaled growing concern over regional market imbalances, with a 2024 order urging states to adopt more resilient market designs. However, Texas's political landscape, which resists federal oversight, complicates such efforts.

Conclusion: A Call for Systemic Resilience

Negative natural gas prices in Texas are not an isolated event but a warning shot for the U.S. energy sector. They underscore the urgent need to align infrastructure investment with the realities of a decarbonizing, digitizing, and increasingly volatile energy landscape. For investors, the lesson is clear: portfolios must account for the interplay of market design, physical infrastructure, and regulatory inertia. Without systemic reforms, the next tipping point may not be a question of if, but how severely the system will falter.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757944331070.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-15 14:02:04.034969

India stands at the crossroads in its path to energy sovereignty with fossil fuels continuing to contribute 68 per cent to electricity production. In 2024 alone, the electricity sector released over 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 and the nation spent almost $60 billion importing petroleum. Simultaneously, India has become a clean energy global leader with more than 135 GW of solar and 50 GW of wind capacity having been installed by March 2025. Wind installations contributed 1.8 GW during Q1 FY 2025, solidifying the country’s position as the world’s fourth-largest market in the space. To remain a global energy leader, it needs to ramp up the capacity to 100 GW of wind and 500 GW of non-fossil fuel by 2030.

The key is scaling up renewables and creating a strong, resilient, future-proof power system that incorporates wind, solar, storage, and smart grids to meet industrial, commercial, and domestic demand — 24/7. It is not just about increasing the capacity but also about providing clean, dependable, affordable power that powers industries, homes, and growth.

Clean energy is now cheaper and smarter

The energy economics have shifted. The cost of wind power is now Rs 3.17 per kWh, lower than coal-powered electricity, which is at Rs 3.50 per kWh. The cost of solar power is lower in many states. With hybrid technologies that integrate wind, solar and storage, renewable energy (RE) now offers firm dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE) that matches fossil fuels on both cost and reliability parameters.

India’s commercial and industrial (C&I) sector, which consumed USD60 billion of fossil fuels in FY 2024, is proactively switching to renewables in order to reduce emissions and manage fuel price volatility. With C&I electricity demand expected to grow 40 per cent by 2040, the transition to green power will be imperative. Enhancing the share of FDRE can reduce 95 million tonnes of CO2 a year, help in complying with international decarbonisation requirements, such as the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and make Indian exports competitive worldwide.

Addressing the grid and storage gaps

As capacity generation increases, bottlenecks continue to persist. Grid congestion, land acquisition delays, and slow approvals continue to hold back RE deployment. In light of this, India’s high-renewable energy states need transmission upgrade urgently, catalysed by schemes such as the Green Energy Corridor.

The new frontier is energy storage. India is planning to install 50 GW of storage capacity by 2030 using battery energy storage systems (BESS), pumped hydro, and innovative green hydrogen solutions. These technologies are key to spanning intermittency and ensuring 24/7 green power for industry.

Digitalisation is also critical as AI-driven forecasting applications that can reduce land acquisition timelines by 30 per cent and intelligent grid systems that provide real-time load balancing and demand response.

Wind, solar, offshore and repowering

India holds 695 GW of wind potential at 120m hub height, including 174 GW offshore in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. A planned 100 MW offshore pilot by 2027 can unlock a new frontier. Repowering old wind sites alone could yield 25 GW of new capacity. New low-wind speed turbine technology is making previously unviable geographies viable, while floating solar and canal-top installations are optimising space use.

A thriving domestic ecosystem and global backing

The country’s renewable energy push is backed by a robust domestic manufacturing base, now producing 25 GW of solar modules and 20 GW of wind turbines annually. This not only reduces import dependence but also creates jobs. The wind sector alone added 90,000 jobs in FY 2025, with over 360,000 clean energy jobs expected by 2030.

India is also attracting serious global capital. In June 2024, the World Bank approved USD1.5 billion to support its clean energy transition, underlining international confidence in the roadmap.

The road ahead: Integration, not isolation

The future isn’t wind versus solar or fossil versus renewable – it is integration. Powering a USD5 trillion economy requires a systemic approach that combines generation, storage, transmission, and digital intelligence.

India has the scale, the market, and the will. What it needs now is speed: fast-tracked tenders, plug-and-play industrial green zones, forward-looking policies, and agile execution. We can either retrofit yesterday’s systems or build tomorrow’s power architecture today, rooted in clean, firm and sustainable energy.

Richard Zdunkewicz is CEO of Distributed Energy Clearinghouse®, a provider of next generation analytics for the distributed energy value stack and DER investments in all markets across the United States.","The term “value stack” refers to the combination of economic, reliability, and sustainability benefits that DERs provide. Unlike centralized power plants, which generate value primarily by selling electricity into wholesale markets, DERs deliver multiple benefits simultaneously.

One of the most immediate sources of value is energy cost savings. By generating electricity on-site with solar or by reducing consumption through efficiency, customers can reduce their reliance on utility-supplied power. This offsets retail consumption and reduces overall energy bills. Closely tied to this are demand charge reductions, particularly for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers who are often billed based on their peak demand. By lowering peak load through demand management and storage, businesses can avoid substantial charges.

Financial incentives and tax benefits further strengthen the economics of DERs. Federal tax credits, state renewable energy incentives, and accelerated depreciation can all reduce the effective cost of projects, making them more attractive to buyers. Beyond customer-level economics, DERs can also participate in grid services and wholesale markets. Batteries, flexible loads, and aggregated resources can provide valuable services such as frequency regulation, capacity, and ancillary support that help stabilize the grid. As battery storage technologies improve yielding faster charge times and longer durations, the market will increasingly accept batteries as reliable resources and value them accordingly.

Another essential layer of the value stack is resilience and reliability. For many buyers, especially those operating hospitals, data centers, or manufacturing plants, the ability to keep operations running during an outage can outweigh traditional financial considerations. Though difficult to quantify, the avoided cost of downtime can be significant. Finally, sustainability and ESG goals are increasingly part of corporate strategies. DERs contribute directly to decarbonization, help companies comply with regulatory mandates, and support brand reputation by demonstrating environmental leadership.

The precise makeup of the value stack varies widely depending on region, utility rate design, policy framework, and the specific load profile of each customer. A battery in one market may generate wholesale market revenues through frequency regulation, while in another, the very same battery might deliver greater value through demand response and enhanced resilience.

Rapid evolution

Over the past decade, DER economics shifted from simple payback calculations to complex, multi-dimensional revenue models. This evolution has been driven by a combination of regulatory shifts, expanded market opportunities, technological advances, and changing customer priorities.

From a regulatory perspective, many states are transitioning from net metering to net billing. Under net metering, exported solar energy was often compensated at the full retail rate, but under net billing, exported energy is valued at avoided cost or wholesale market rates. This shift reduces the economics of solar-only systems and elevates the importance of storage and demand management. Similarly, the introduction of dynamic tariffs such as time-of-use pricing and real-time pricing creates both risks and opportunities, rewarding those who can shift load or store and dispatch energy strategically.

Market participation has also expanded. FERC Order 2222 opened wholesale markets to aggregated DERs, allowing distributed resources to compete alongside centralized generation. This has paved the way for the rapid rise of VPPs, which pool together DERs from multiple sites to deliver system-level services. These market structures are still in development, but they signal a fundamental shift in how distributed resources are valued.

Technological advances have accelerated this evolution. Forecasting capabilities, AI-driven optimization, and cloud-based platforms make it possible to model DER performance with unprecedented precision. These tools enable simulations of different scenarios, quantify risks, and optimize dispatch strategies across multiple value streams simultaneously.

Finally, customer priorities are changing. For critical facilities, resilience and reliability have become top priorities, sometimes even surpassing economic savings. At the same time, sustainability is no longer a peripheral concern but central to corporate decision-making. Many companies are setting carbon reduction targets and using DERs as a strategy to achieve them. The result of all these forces is a DER value stack that is dynamic, region-specific, and increasingly sensitive to regulatory and market conditions.

Transparency

In today’s complex DER markets, sellers cannot rely on black-box sales pitches. Without transparency, three main risks emerge. First, mismatched expectations can occur when buyers overestimate savings or underestimate risks. This leads to disappointment, erodes trust, and can damage seller reputations. Second, investors may deploy capital into projects with inflated forecasts, resulting in inefficient allocation of resources and weakening overall confidence in the sector. Third, overstated claims about project returns could invite regulatory scrutiny, slowing down innovation and increasing compliance costs.

Transparency is the antidote to these risks. Robust tools and transparent methodologies allow sellers to show their work by making assumptions explicit and disclosing the models behind their projections. Transparency also enables sellers to highlight risks proactively, including tariff changes, performance degradation, or the expiration of incentives. Equally important, transparency provides buyers with a basis for comparability, making it easier to evaluate competing offers on equal terms. In a crowded and competitive market, transparency is no longer just good practice; it is a competitive advantage and the foundation for building long-term trust.

Buyers benefit

For commercial and institutional customers, understanding the DER value stack enables more informed and resilient decision-making. By demanding transparency, buyers can require detailed breakdowns of projected savings, revenues, and risks. This ensures that sellers cannot gloss over unfavorable assumptions and creates accountability in the sales process.

Buyers who take the time to stress-test assumptions gain further advantages. By evaluating what happens under different scenarios — such as changes to tariff structures, the reduction of incentives, or underperformance in wholesale markets — they can better understand the range of possible outcomes and reduce exposure to downside risks.

Moreover, a focus on the value stack allows buyers to think beyond simple payback metrics. DERs can provide substantial value through enhanced resilience, contributions to ESG goals, and participation in new markets that may open in the near future. By aligning DER investments with broader corporate priorities such as carbon neutrality, cost stability, and operational resilience, buyers ensure that energy projects serve both financial and strategic goals.

Finally, many buyers benefit from leveraging advanced analytical tools or advisors who can model projects rigorously. These tools provide clarity and help uncover value streams that might otherwise be overlooked. When buyers understand the value stack, negotiations shift from vague promises to data-driven clarity, leading to better outcomes and fewer surprises.

Continued evolution

The next decade promises even greater complexity and opportunity. Several developments are likely to define this period. First, the value of grid services is expected to increase as renewable penetration grows and flexibility becomes more important. DERs that can provide fast, dispatchable services will play a critical role in stabilizing the grid.

Second, VPPs will become more widely deployed and more deeply integrated into capacity planning and reliability markets. As market operators become more comfortable with aggregated resources, VPPs will transition from pilot projects to core components of the energy system.

Third, carbon valuation will become a significant factor. Whether through explicit carbon pricing mechanisms or implicit valuation via ESG reporting requirements, carbon attributes will be monetized and included in project valuations.

Fourth, electrification across sectors will create new opportunities. The adoption of electric vehicle fleets, the electrification of heating, and increased industrial electrification will introduce new sources of flexible demand that DERs can integrate with.

Finally, digitalization will advance, with AI-driven optimization becoming a standard tool for unlocking value streams that were previously too complex to access. Together, these trends make clear that the value stack is a moving target that will expand and diversify, requiring increasingly sophisticated analysis.

Flexibility, resilience, carbon reduction

The future sources of value will extend well beyond today’s bill savings. Flexibility markets will reward DERs that can deliver fast, dispatchable balancing services, helping grid operators manage variability from renewable generation. As climate and cyber risks continue to rise, resilience premiums will grow. For many businesses, the ability to maintain operations during an outage will become more valuable than simple energy savings.

Carbon credits and reporting value will also expand. As decarbonization goals become mandatory in more sectors, companies will increasingly monetize carbon reductions through voluntary or regulated markets. DERs that can demonstrate carbon benefits will be particularly attractive. In addition, DERs will contribute to community-scale value. Microgrids, peer-to-peer trading, and resilience hubs will provide shared benefits at the local level, further broadening the appeal of distributed energy solutions.

Finally, integrated load management will emerge as a frontier for value creation. By coordinating DERs with electric vehicles, smart buildings, and industrial processes, system operators and customers alike will unlock new efficiencies. These emerging layers of value reinforce the importance of robust modeling and transparent methodologies, as the risks of mispricing and overestimating benefits will only grow with increased complexity.

Support to navigate complexity

Navigating the DER landscape can be daunting, but new platforms and services are rising to meet the challenge. Advanced software tools such as that offered by Distributed Energy Clearinghouse® can now model complex tariffs, simulate wholesale market participation, and assess risks with increasing accuracy. The DECH platform features intuitive dashboards and scenario modeling, making it easier for decision-makers to interpret results.

Independent consultants continue to play a vital role by bringing expertise in energy economics, regulatory frameworks, and project finance. Buyers who lack internal expertise can rely on these advisors to ensure projects are evaluated rigorously. Industry associations and standards bodies are also contributing by publishing guidelines and methodologies that promote consistent valuation practices. Finally, collaborative marketplaces are emerging as trusted environments where buyers, sellers, and investors can transact with greater transparency and comparability.

For buyers, the key takeaway is to insist on open, transparent methodologies. For sellers, the imperative is to adopt tools and practices that foster comparability and trust. Together, these actions will strengthen the market and ensure that the full potential of DERs is realized.

Conclusion

The DER value stack has matured into a sophisticated, multi-dimensional framework that continues to evolve alongside the global energy transition. Transparency is now the critical ingredient that aligns buyers, sellers, and investors. Sellers who adopt robust, transparent tools will differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive marketplace and build long-term customer relationships. Buyers who demand transparency will capture greater value and future-proof their organizations against uncertainty.

The future of the DER value stack is one of expansion, complexity, and opportunity. Those who embrace transparency today will be best positioned to capture tomorrow’s benefits.

EV Credits Almost Gone

The IRC § 25E Previously-owned Clean Vehicles Credit and the IRC § 30D New Clean Vehicle Credit both terminate September 30, 2025, meaning neither credit will be allowed for vehicles acquired after that date.

Originally set to expire after 2032, the OBBBA signed July 4 expedited the sunset of the clean vehicle credits, or the ‘EV’ credits as they are often referred to. Amended by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, the credits served to incentivize car buyers to go in an eco-friendlier direction but came with detailed eligibility requirements.

The Section 30D EV credit provides up to $7,500 for the purchase of qualifying new plug-in EVs and fuel cell vehicles. But it is split into two $3,750 components: one for meeting a critical minerals requirement and one for meeting a battery component requirement.

Eligible vehicles must have a battery capacity of at least 7 kWh, be manufactured by a qualified manufacturer, have final assembly in North America, and not exceed certain MSRP thresholds ($80,000 for vans/SUVs/pickups; $55,000 for other vehicles).

The used vehicle credit under Section 25E provides up to $4,000 (or 30% of the sale price, if less) for the purchase of eligible used electric or fuel cell vehicles from a dealer for $25,000 or less.

It is subject to income limits and other eligibility requirements for both the vehicle and the buyer. Both credits are non-refundable and must be claimed on Form 8936, Clean Vehicle Credit.

Economic Impact

According to Baker Tilly Principal Michael Mader, July and August were “very strong EV sales months” because of the OBBBA’s change to the credits’ expiration date. Customers are hurrying to buy eligible vehicles before the end of September, while dealerships are working to move their inventories and keep pace with this temporary spike in demand, Mader told Checkpoint.

With the deadline less than three weeks away, dealerships are using the credits to bring in foot traffic to showrooms, although customers basing their decision to buy around the expected value of a credit will not need convincing.

He noted that the new vehicle credit has a cap of $80,000 while the used vehicle credit maximum is $25,000. “A customer that was going to buy an EV used needs to find one that’s priced at $25,000 and they’re going to pay [$21,000]” if they buy this month.

Afterwards, “they’re going to pay $25,000 for that vehicle, because that credit’s not there.”

This will trigger a “shift in the market,” said Mader. “There’s going to be a drop after September 30, and then it’s going to come back to normalization again.”

Tips for Taxpayers

While buyers may have several questions about the credits, their worth, and how to claim them, Mader said it is ultimately the taxpayer’s responsibility to “educate themselves on the EV that they are considering, and what are their proximities to charging stations.” And, he continued, if there are charging stations, are they compatible? “Because some vehicles take special charging hookups and some don’t.”

Prospective buyers should also factor in how long they plan on owning the vehicle and if the value of the credit is worth it right now. While waiting will cause a taxpayer to miss out on these credits, Mader said the EV technology may improve down the line and become more attractive to that customer later.

But for those who are ready to buy now and have done their homework on eligibility, the advice is: “Don’t hesitate.”

The IRS in recently issued FAQs (FS 2025-05) seemed to indicate that “it’s possible you could take delivery after September 30 to get the credit” so long as the payment was made and the contract was signed beforehand. But Mader suggested that taxpayers not take the risk on possibly losing out on a credit, just in case.

Other advice Mader had for those considering an EV included ensuring the dealer is registered to the IRS portal for submitting documentation. Taxpayers cannot claim the credits if the dealership is not registered.

“You need to have [a Form 8936] and the time of sale report,” he said. “Make sure when you walk out of the dealership, you’ve got your time of sale report.”",https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/wp-content/themes/tac/assets/media/favicon.png,N,,2025-09-15 11:03:30.683961

Its policy moves are slowing the momentum of solar energy and may result in increased costs and security risks.

What's happening?

As EnergySage reported, solar power is affordable and scalable despite the federal government subsidies expiring at the end of the year. EnergySage is an objective, independent source of solar industry expertise, offering free tools to compare quotes and receive quick installation estimates.

A Lazard report revealed that solar and wind energy are the most affordable sources of new electricity in America. Meanwhile, gas costs are increasing, and the cost of building a new gas-powered plant is significantly higher than that of a new solar-powered one.

""Lazard's latest Levelized Cost of Energy+ analysis found that gas plant construction is at its most expensive point in a decade, driven by record-high electricity demand and a growing shortage of equipment like turbines,"" EnergySage's Casey McDevitt wrote.

EnergySage also highlighted the fact that America's backtracking on clean energy puts the country at a competitive disadvantage to China. With increasing energy demands resulting from the growth of artificial intelligence and data centers, the U.S. could miss opportunities to advance the latest technologies because of grid limitations.

Meanwhile, clean power is essential to energy independence and less reliance on foreign providers. National security and economic competitiveness are at stake for nations that fail to adopt energy solutions that are cheaper and quicker to build than gas and other pollution-heavy energy sources.

Why is reverting to gas problematic?

Curbing and reversing progress on clean energy momentum is concerning because the alternative is reverting to outdated, nonrenewable resources that harm the environment.

Gas emits high rates of methane and pollution when burned, exacerbating our climate crisis. It relies on aging infrastructure, is becoming more expensive to use, and makes the U.S. less secure and competitive.

Clean, renewable energy sources have been growing steadily, benefiting both people and the planet. However, recent political actions risk reversing that progress by ignoring promising innovations and halting large-scale projects that could put the country in a more sustainable position.

What's being done to advance the clean energy transition?

Despite what is happening at the federal level, there are still many things that you can do to live a sustainable life and set an example for people around you.

For example, you can reduce your personal reliance on the grid by installing solar panels on your home and pairing them with a backup battery system. EnergySage provides a mapping tool to help you maximize the benefits of all available solar incentives tailored to your location.

To take it a step further, you can pair solar panels with energy-efficient home appliances and a heat pump to lower your utility bills and reduce household pollution.

You can also set a positive example for others by driving a clean energy vehicle and using public transportation when possible.

When local and state elections are coming up where you live, step up to be an advocate for clean energy policies and influence legislation from a grassroots level. In many places, pro-climate lawmakers are still working hard to advance the clean energy transition for the benefit of our people and the planet.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oUL5BnBNp3l8o95lTIMZoQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/4ac5145e4a25beb21b87587ae55b4265,N,,2025-09-15 11:02:58.587168

Lithium, the cornerstone of battery production for electric vehicles (EVs), has become a strategic asset, with the U.S. government prioritizing domestic production to reduce reliance on foreign imports. At the forefront of this effort is Lithium Americas, whose Thacker Pass project in Nevada has emerged as a linchpin in the Biden administration's push for energy independence. With a production target of 40,000 tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate annually by late 2027, the project could redefine the U.S. lithium landscape—if it meets its ambitious timelines and cost projections.

Strategic Funding and Partnerships: A Blueprint for Scale

Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass project has secured a robust funding package, reflecting both private-sector confidence and federal support. The company recently finalized a $250 million investment from Orion Resource Partners LP, structured as a mix of convertible debt, production-linked payments, and a delayed draw facility Lithium Americas Reports 2024 Full Year Results, [https://www.lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2025/Lithium-Americas-Reports-2024-Full-Year-Results/default.aspx][ 1 ]. This is complemented by a landmark $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), with the first draw anticipated in Q3 2025 Lithium Americas Secures Full Funding for Thacker Pass, [https://www.stocktitan.net/news/LAC/lithium-americas-reports-first-quarter-2025-f1kfc57u9qyp.html][ 2 ]. Such backing underscores the project's alignment with national priorities, particularly the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which allocates billions to decarbonize transportation and strengthen domestic mineral processing.

Equally significant is the partnership with

(GM), which has committed $100 million to the project as part of a final investment decision (FID) agreement. This collaboration not only de-risks capital expenditures but also ensures a stable off-take agreement for a key U.S. automaker. By 2027, when production is slated to begin, GM's EV ambitions will require a reliable domestic lithium supply chain—a need Thacker Pass is uniquely positioned to fulfill.

Production Capacity and Economic Impact

With a projected output of 40,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate annually, Thacker Pass could account for a substantial share of U.S. demand. While exact figures for domestic consumption are not publicly available, industry analysts estimate that achieving 40,000 tonnes of annual production would cover a significant portion of the lithium required for EV battery manufacturing in North America. This scale is critical: the U.S. currently imports over 90% of its lithium, with China dominating processing and refining. Thacker Pass's success would reduce this dependency, insulating the U.S. from geopolitical volatility and supply bottlenecks.

Economically, the project is expected to create thousands of jobs during construction and hundreds of permanent roles in operations. Nevada, already a hub for mining and renewable energy, stands to benefit from a new industrial ecosystem centered on lithium processing and battery manufacturing. The state's political leadership has actively supported the project, recognizing its potential to diversify the economy and align with federal clean energy goals.

Challenges and Strategic Risks

Despite its promise, Thacker Pass faces hurdles. Environmental permitting delays and community concerns over land use have historically plagued large-scale mining projects in the U.S. While Lithium Americas has navigated these challenges thus far, any setbacks could push back the 2027 timeline or inflate costs. Additionally, the project's reliance on federal loans exposes it to policy shifts—though the bipartisan nature of the Infrastructure Law suggests long-term stability.

From a market perspective, the project must also contend with global oversupply risks. As Australia, Chile, and Argentina expand production, lithium prices could face downward pressure. However, the U.S. market's unique demand dynamics—driven by EV adoption and regulatory mandates—may insulate Thacker Pass from broader price swings.

A Model for U.S. Self-Sufficiency

Thacker Pass represents more than a mining operation; it is a test case for whether the U.S. can build a vertically integrated lithium supply chain. The project's alignment with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, coupled with strategic partnerships and federal financing, positions it as a blueprint for future mineral projects. If successful, it could catalyze further investments in processing and refining, closing the loop on a supply chain that has long been fragmented.

For investors, the stakes are high. Lithium Americas' ability to execute on its timeline and cost estimates will determine whether Thacker Pass becomes a cornerstone of U.S. energy security—or a cautionary tale of overambitious green energy bets.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757942920855.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-15 13:05:01.619662

It ​“was the perfect project to show the art of what’s possible,” said Dennis Pietrocola, director of operations services at the Port Authority.
The Port Authority didn’t use any incentives to cover the expenses, in part because the team needed to act quickly to replace the building’s worn-out systems.
Pietrocola plans to apply the lessons learned at Building One to other Port Authority structures as their fossil-fueled systems age out, he said.
Decarbonizing buildings ​“is a very important cause to me, personally and professionally,” Pietrocola noted.","The first passenger terminal for air travel in the U.S. was an Art Deco celebration of aviation. In 1935, the fearless Amelia Earhart dedicated the building at the busy airport now known as Newark Liberty International, and within a few years, hundreds of thousands of passengers were hurrying through its marble-and-terrazzo lobby to catch commercial flights.

Now an administrative center called Building One, the former terminal has made history for a new reason: It’s the first edifice owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a bistate transportation agency, to undergo an all-electric retrofit.

“It’s so exciting to see [this kind of] reinvestment and making things new again,” said James Lindberg, senior policy director at the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation, who wasn’t involved in the project. ​“Energy efficiency and decarbonization is part of that. … We know how to do it — we just need more of it.”

Buildings account for a whopping one-third of the nation’s carbon pollution. Every building — even the 80,000 structures that, like Building One, are listed in the National Register of Historic Places — must break up with fossil fuels to align with a cooler climate future.

Retrofitting any existing structure is going to be tougher than going with all-electric systems from the start. But engineers looking to upgrade historic buildings are doubly constrained by the need to maintain their charges’ distinctive architectural features; you can’t just tear down the walls of a landmark.

The Port Authority’s Building One is an early example demonstrating that storied buildings can be electrified — all while keeping their vaunted status intact.

It ​“was the perfect project to show the art of what’s possible,” said Dennis Pietrocola, director of operations services at the Port Authority. ​“If we were able to undergo an electrification transformation to Building One” — among the most challenging of the Port Authority’s structures — ​“then it sets the stage for [decarbonizing] the rest.”

That’s coming. The Port Authority aims to be carbon neutral by 2050, a goal that includes its entire portfolio of more than 1,000 buildings — from storage and parking structures to terminals to offices — at its airports, bridges, tunnels, railways, bus stops, and shipping ports.

Heat pumps, electric boilers, and more

Building One is the bustling home base of 190 Port Authority employees, including operations and maintenance workers, police, and firefighters. In 2023, the building’s gas-fueled equipment was ready to conk out, making it a prime candidate for a decarbonization retrofit. Pietrocola and his colleagues carefully planned a series of cost-effective electrifying updates and hired an experienced general contractor, Constellation NewEnergy, to carry them out.

The team installed five large heat pumps on the roof to provide zero-emissions heating and cooling. They put in an energy-recovery system to recycle waste heat from the locker and IT rooms. The crew added a system that can dial down power use when the grid is strained by high demand. And in the parking lot, workers installed 29 new charging ports for electric vehicles.

The team also swapped the building’s gas boilers with electric-resistance ones. Operating with the same physics as big electric tea kettles, these provide an extra boost as needed to the building’s water-based heating system. Pietrocola had considered using heat-pump boilers instead, which can be twice as efficient because they move heat instead of making it, but he nixed the idea because it would’ve meant replacing the hydronic system’s distribution pipes with bigger ones.

Workers also made some more staid updates to lower energy costs: weatherizing the building, applying heat-blocking films on the windows, and replacing more than 1,500 light fixtures with ultra-efficient LEDs.

In total, the project took 18 months and cost about $15 million — $3 million more than it would’ve had the Port Authority stuck with gas-fired equipment, according to Pietrocola.

The Port Authority didn’t use any incentives to cover the expenses, in part because the team needed to act quickly to replace the building’s worn-out systems. But federal and state tax credits are available to private entities and public-private partnerships to electrify operations as part of renovation projects, Lindberg pointed out. Unlike the consumer credits for heat pumps, EVs, and other clean energy tech, the Rehabilitation Credit was left unscathed by Republicans’ federal budget law enacted this summer, he said.

Building One’s retrofit has slashed energy use by about 25%, Pietrocola said. Still, due to the area’s relatively high cost of electricity, he doesn’t expect the structure’s utility bills to fall.

Pietrocola plans to apply the lessons learned at Building One to other Port Authority structures as their fossil-fueled systems age out, he said. He’ll approach each project with a fresh eye to the building’s particular needs and the technology available. Next time, he added, the agency may go with hydronic heat pumps instead of the electric-resistance boilers.

Decarbonizing buildings ​“is a very important cause to me, personally and professionally,” Pietrocola noted. Recently, he worked with his 14-year-old daughter, Kayla, on a climate-change science project. ​“It made me realize, well, I’m part of the problem — the way I’ve operated facilities [in the past], perhaps with a closed mind.” After guiding the electrification of one of the country’s most storied structures, he feels like he’s become part of the solution.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/image.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=580bbe9fe179523053d193a1379689af,N,,2025-09-15 12:05:59.545237

Solar Energy UK has also stepped up, with the formation of the Solar Careers UK initiative, which will provide information and guidance on what skills and competences are needed for jobs in the sector and how to attain them.
Solar Energy UK will work with other trade bodies on how to attract and retain newly trained installers and prepare teaching materials for schools.
Solar Energy UK has committed to working with the planning profession to ensure that training is fit for purpose.","A new era of clean energy independence dawned in early July, with the publication of the UK’s highly anticipated Solar Roadmap [1].

The government-industry paper describes 62 practical measures to boost the supply of cheaper and more secure power, deliver new industries and create skilled jobs – all while providing significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and gains in biodiversity. By addressing issues such as the electricity grid, supply chain, skills and planning, it will play a major role in delivering the British Labour government’s mission for the UK to become a clean energy superpower and meet – or potentially exceed – the capacity goals set out in December’s Clean Power 2030 Action Plan.

By then, we could see around 9 million small-scale rooftop installations, up from 2 million now, with the sector supporting 35,000 jobs – almost twice the number of today. Meanwhile, solar farms would still take up a tiny amount of the country, put at significantly less than 1% of farmland.

The roadmap was produced over two years and two governments by the Solar Taskforce, led by secretary of state for energy security and net zero, Ed Miliband, and Solar Energy UK, and supported by leading figures from across the solar industry and related sectors. The taskforce will shortly transition into the Solar Council, set to drive future progress and guide the implementation of the plan.

Writing in a foreword to the roadmap, the secretary of state wrote: “This is an incredibly exciting time for solar in our country. More than 1.5 million homes across Britain now have solar installed, and since this government came to office my department has consented almost 3GW of nationally significant solar projects – nearly three times as much as the previous 14 years combined. But we know we need to go further to deliver our goals for clean power by 2030 and beyond

“Solar offers huge potential to boost our energy independence, bring down bills and tackle the climate crisis. It also presents significant economic opportunities; we estimate that around 35,000 jobs supported by solar will be needed by 2030, a doubling of today’s number.”

Added to those reflections, solar energy is among the lowest-cost and most popular forms of power generation in the UK. Unlocking its potential will increase Britain’s energy security, drive down bills and be a major contributor to preventing dangerous climate change. The fact that it can be deployed rapidly in so many ways, from household rooftops to warehouses to reservoirs and large-scale solar farms, is the key ingredient to this potential.

Rooftop

Despite enormous cost reductions over recent years, one key barrier to more widespread adoption of rooftop photovoltaics remains their upfront cost. So, the government will work with the Green Finance Institute, the finance sector, consumer bodies and the solar sector itself to provide financial solutions for all customers.

The taskforce also identified an ongoing lack of awareness of the benefits of both domestic and commercial solar energy as a further obstacle, with potential buyers unaware of trusted sources of information. Accordingly, the government will update its Energy Efficient Home website to promote solar deployment. Meanwhile, the UK Warehousing Association has agreed to develop a toolkit for the commercial-scale market, including how to obtain a power purchase agreement.

How solar is reflected in energy performance certificates will be updated next year, and incentives to install solar energy will be considered for social landlords. Meanwhile, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors will ensure that the value of solar homes is assessed properly, while incentives to install solar power on social housing will be considered.

As may be expected, the paper also mentions the recently confirmed Future Homes Standard. This should, alongside the forthcoming Future Buildings Standard, virtually mandate solar on new properties. In due course, retrofit customers will benefit from a review of consumer protections, so they can have confidence in the quality of work when upgrading their homes.

Warehousing has huge potential to expand solar generation but faces many barriers [2]. To resolve these, the UK Warehousing Association will collaborate with the real estate and solar sectors to overcome problems with building leases, develop standard contracts for landlords and tenants and develop a standard approach for building valuation. The connection processes of independent distribution network operators (DNOs), which often operate power systems in business parks, will be reviewed and the regulation of the sector reconsidered by the regulator, Ofgem.

According to government estimates, only around one in five schools have solar panels, leaving them paying for power rather than investing in the nation’s youth. To help remedy this, the government will commit to supporting schools to deploy the technology, possibly through the DESNZ’s ‘one stop shop’ Net Zero Accelerator Service, building on the newly founded, publicly funded clean energy company GB Energy’s recent investment in 200 schools, in which it plans to spend £180 million on investing in 70-100MW of PV on schools and hospitals.

Supporting its anticipated Local Power Plan, GB Energy will provide “funding, capacity and capability support at all stages of project development”, to drive the growth of community energy, building on the Local Net Zero Hubs Programme. In parallel, the National Wealth Fund also offers free advice and low-cost, long-term finance to local authority infrastructure projects that align with net-zero and economic growth mandates, which includes the development of solar projects.

Meanwhile, the National Wealth Fund will “explore potential structures to finance solar projects or portfolios”. The Department of Business and Trade will coordinate a cross-government steering group to “consider potential government intervention” to promote corporate power purchase agreements – buying power directly from solar farms, at a significant discount from the grid.

A study into the safety of small-scale solar energy systems that can be plugged directly into the domestic mains supply will also commence. Current UK regulations forbid them, although they are increasingly popular on the Continent.

Grid access

Excessive waiting times for electricity grid connections have long been the bane of the solar industry, for both ground-mounted and large-scale rooftop systems.

The Solar Roadmap spells out a series of measures to address the issue, in parallel with reforms arising from the Winser Review and raising transmission impact assessment thresholds. These include adopting a common definition of commercially sensitive data, which should provide a better understanding of which projects are most likely to proceed. Ofgem will also consider introducing standards to improve levels of service after grid connections are accepted, with the UK’s National Energy System Operator (NESO) conducting a series of technical measures to improve transmission impact assessments.

As things stand, solar projects above 3.68kW, corresponding to 16 amps per phase, must receive approval from DNOs. This red tape can encourage installers to limit system capacity below the threshold, though one operator has raised the threshold to 5kW, encouraging larger residential installations. Those under 14.72kW are now subject to a fast-track process, with responses due within ten working days.

The roadmap also indicates that high-voltage overhead power lines over 2km long mounted on wooden poles will no longer be considered nationally significant infrastructure projects due to their low visual impact.

One of the most welcome aspects of the package concerns the treatment of battery energy storage systems (BESS), commonly co-located with solar farms. BESS are currently considered a hindrance to the electricity system, rather than providing the benefits of absorbing excess power and supplying it during periods of peak demand. New and harmonised modelling procedures will be introduced in response.

Reforming who pays for new high-voltage supergrid transformers, which the roadmap describes as a “postcode lottery”, is also expected.

Ground-mount solar

The roadmap endorses Solar Energy UK’s Community Engagement Good Practice Guidance [3]. Aside from supporting developers, operators and the supply chain, it is equally “useful to local authorities and communities as a referencing material for engaging with solar industry developers and operators”, says the paper.

The association has also committed to developing a template for developers to use for stakeholder mapping and a communications toolkit for conveying the benefits of solar power when engaging with local communities.

In parallel, the provision of community benefits has a vital role to play, and it is the subject of an ongoing DESNZ consultation [4]. While the Government’s position is being considered, Solar Energy UK will publish a voluntary protocol and guidance for community benefits later this year, covering installations over 5MW (other than rooftop, ‘behind the meter’, community-owned or community-led solar farms).

Scotland is consulting on refreshing its principles for community benefits, while the Welsh Government has already issued guidance [5, 6].

Supply chain

The roadmap represents a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to grow the solar supply chain and manufacturing capacity in the UK”. While economics exclude the manufacturing of conventional silicon-based panels, there is scope to grow the production of transformers, inverters, switchgear, supporting bracketry and cabling, it says, not to mention batteries and R&D, particularly for lightweight and cutting-edge perovskite PV technology.

Accordingly, the government will consider supporting companies looking to scale up production of innovative solar technologies, processes and associated equipment, alongside the development of standards and testing facilities for next-generation solar technologies.

The roadmap also details the government’s support for the “world-leading” Solar Stewardship Initiative, intended to prevent the procurement of solar panels produced with raw materials coming from forced labour. This comes after confirming that the system will be used by Great British Energy.

“The UK Government is clear that there should be no procurement of solar panels where there is evidence of forced labour. Government will empower contracting authorities to exclude suppliers from government contracts who have committed labour market misconduct and/or environmental offences in the UK or overseas… The UK solar sector has been proactive in its response to this issue,” says the roadmap, noting Solar Energy UK’s Supply Chain Statement and Responsible Sourcing FAQ [7, 8].

Skills development

The rapid growth of the UK solar industry, expected to expand by up to 17% this year, “offers a generational opportunity to create a wealth of high-quality jobs. At this crucial juncture, we must put the structures in place to build the skilled workforce needed now and in the decades to come,” the roadmap says.

Without action, there is a risk of skilled labour shortages, skills gaps, loss of key skills “and potentially costly, urgent intervention further into the future,” it warns.

Solving the problem will require intervention from across government, including the National Wealth Fund, GB Energy, Skills England, the Office for Clean Energy Jobs and the devolved administrations. Solar Energy UK has also stepped up, with the formation of the Solar Careers UK initiative, which will provide information and guidance on what skills and competences are needed for jobs in the sector and how to attain them. It has already held its first careers fair and is continuing to expand engagement.

The roadmap itself offers no fewer than 11 actions on skills, including improving the provision and effectiveness of training, mapping the routes to competence for core occupations and connecting colleges and businesses. Solar Energy UK will work with other trade bodies on how to attract and retain newly trained installers and prepare teaching materials for schools.

Planning

In the case of development planning, much of the action needed to help the sector has already been undertaken or is underway. This includes raising the threshold for solar farms to be considered ‘nationally significant infrastructure projects’ from 50MW to 100MW, in force from the end of the year, and the recruitment and training of new planning officers.

The Planning and Infrastructure Bill currently proceeding through parliament will simplify the consenting process for major infrastructure projects and require national policy statements to be reviewed every five years. The environmental impact assessment system is also being streamlined, and the first Spatial Energy Plan and Land Use Framework are being developed.

The National Planning Policy Framework has been reformed to give greater weight to the benefits of renewable energy and proposals’ contributions to meeting net zero, and a consultation on the National Policy Statement for Renewable Energy was held recently [9].

But there is still more to do. Solar Energy UK has committed to working with the planning profession to ensure that training is fit for purpose. It will also produce factsheets to advise planners and councillors, plugging the gap in the expertise needed to assess solar applications effectively. We also intend to engage with any regional mayor or combined authority interested in driving forward solar developments in their area.

There is also work to do in relation to floating solar, which has significant potential but currently faces higher costs than deployment on the ground. Reforms to support the nascent sector will be considered under the planning regime and potentially via the Contracts for Difference system.

Solar Energy UK would like to extend our sincere thanks for the work of the former co-chairs of the taskforce, Andrew Bowie MP and Graham Stuart MP, alongside the members of its five sub-groups on networks, skills, supply chain and innovation, rooftop solar and communications. We are also grateful to former MP Chris Skidmore, who suggested the taskforce’s formation in his 2023 Review of Net Zero.

The clean energy industry is thriving nationally, though it will be slowed once tax breaks and other incentives expire in 2026, Kalland said.
In practice, making it harder to expand clean energy will undermine Trump’s push to expand U.S. manufacturing.","President Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” will limit the development of solar and wind power at a time when they offer the fastest and cheapest ways to meet a rising demand for electricity.

The new law phases out tax credits and other incentives for producing and using renewable energy that were adopted under former President Joe Biden.

The timing is particularly bad for North Carolina, where growth in population and manufacturing are increasing the demand for energy.

While Trump is stifling clean energy, there are also setbacks at the state level. The legislature has dropped interim targets for sharply reducing utilities’ carbon emissions by 2050, and the state’s largest utility, Duke Energy, has put off plans to tap the state’s bountiful offshore wind resource.

To check on how these developments are affecting clean energy in North Carolina, I spoke with Steve Kalland, executive director of the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center at N.C. State University. He had just finished attending last week’s renewable energy trade show in Las Vegas, which drew more than 40,000 participants and 1,300 exhibitors.

The clean energy industry is thriving nationally, though it will be slowed once tax breaks and other incentives expire in 2026, Kalland said.

In practice, making it harder to expand clean energy will undermine Trump’s push to expand U.S. manufacturing. It will actually limit the ability to quickly increase the electricity supply, drive up energy costs and slow the emergence of industries built around renewable energy, a growing part of the North Carolina economy.

“In general, it does seem counterintuitive that the attacks on clean energy — which are clearly and demonstrably the lowest-cost options right now — just seem to run directly in the face of the goals of the administration, which is to cut energy costs and make America energy dominant,” he said.

Utilities say they can meet increasing electricity demand with new natural gas-powered plants and smaller-scale nuclear units, but Kalland said bringing those power sources online can take five years or more while the demand is rising now and expanding clean energy can happen quickly.

“So the expectation is that either we are going to build solar and wind over the next five to seven years nationally and in North Carolina in order to meet increasing demand, or we are not going to meet increasing demand, which is going to be a problem,” he said.

As demand presses the energy supply, prices are rising, he said.

“We’re seeing energy prices climb faster than the rate of inflation. In some places maybe as much as twice the rate of inflation,” he said. “That’s not a good sign for anything because energy touches every single part of the economy.”

Kalland is worried by legislation passed this year that removed the 2030 carbon emissions reduction target for North Carolina utilities, though the goal of achieving net zero emissions — an even balance between emissions released and emissions reduced — by 2050 remains.

“If people are not working steadily toward that 2050 goal, it creates an opportunity for folks to not be making the steady progress that’s necessary because they think some new technology will come in,” he said. “Because of that, we could easily wind up at 2045 with a fairly sizable distance to go.”

Not committing to offshore wind power is also a setback, he said. “The offshore wind thing may be the biggest loss for North Carolina’s economy because we really had just started to capture it. It was really coming,” he said.

Disruptions in the advancement of clean energy are hardly new. Kalland has witnessed the ups and downs since began working with solar power in 1993. “We affectionately call it ‘the solar coaster,’ “ he said.

Kalland said the clean energy industry will rebound from the loss of incentives.

“I think that there is hope that once everybody lets the dust settle from what’s going on with the ‘big’ – it’s hard for me to call it the ‘beautiful bill’ – once that dust settles I think the industry will evaluate where things stand, get out their spreadsheets and come up with a new way of doing things. It will be slower but it will continue to go forward.”",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/public/incoming/y0rp63/picture312047442/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/fd91329d-5cee-4c7b-9f34-36ed321a5fbd,N,,2025-09-15 09:59:49.926655

By Eric Brophy and Patrick O’Reilly

When New Jersey celebrates “Made in New Jersey” Manufacturing Day on October 3, 2025, industry leaders will have no shortage of topics to discuss. Chief among them is Governor Phil Murphy’s recent signing of the Next NJ Manufacturing Program (A5687/S4407) into law on August 13. The initiative, housed within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA), is designed to sharpen the state’s competitive edge by driving new investment, capital expansion, and job creation across the manufacturing sector.

The program allocates $500 million in targeted tax credits exclusively for qualifying manufacturing businesses, with a dedicated $100 million carve-out for clean energy manufacturing. By reserving a significant portion of funds for firms building renewable and sustainable products, Trenton is signaling that advanced and green manufacturing are central to the state’s long-term growth strategy.

In addition, the program allows for certain qualified businesses, such as Minority and Women Business Enterprises, located in Opportunity Zones or those businesses with collective bargaining agreements or labor harmony agreements to receive bonus credit awards. This program is just the latest of many incentives programs the NJEDA has rolled out to spur economic development and job creation as part of Governor Murphy’s dedication to creating an innovation economy.

A Broad Incentive Strategy

The manufacturing initiative builds on a framework of business support programs that have been introduced or expanded during Governor Murphy’s term. The Emerge Program provides tax credits tied directly to job creation and capital investment, rewarding companies that commit to staying and growing in New Jersey. The Aspire Program supports real estate and redevelopment projects, helping attract commercial tenants while breathing new life into New Jersey’s urban centers.

Fueling Innovation and Startups

Governor Murphy has consistently tied economic development to innovation. For example, the New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund (NJIEF) is a flagship program that combines public and private capital to fund promising startups. By auctioning state tax credits to established companies and reinvesting those proceeds in young firms, NJEDA is fostering both capital flow and corporate mentorship for emerging entrepreneurs.

Complementing this is the long-standing Net Operating Loss (NOL) Program, which allows early-stage tech and life sciences companies to sell operating losses for immediate cash. Expanded in recent years, it now makes New Jersey one of the most attractive states for research-driven startups.

Targeting Strategic Industries

The state has also invested heavily in clean energy, film, and advanced manufacturing. The Film and Digital Media Tax Credit Program has lured major productions to the state, creating jobs and boosting local economies. In 2023, the state saw nearly $600 million in qualified film spend. And, in 2025, “Happy Gilmore 2” spent over $152 million on just one film.

Balancing Costs with Opportunity

New Jersey is an expensive state to start and build a business. But officials are betting that targeted, imaginative, tax credits and incentives will offset those costs and attract new companies while at the same time keeping others rooted in the Garden State. The Next NJ Manufacturing Program underscores that strategy: making long-term investment in New Jersey more attractive, while reinforcing the state’s position as a center for innovation, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing.

Voters are especially concerned about rising insurance rates, and many also expect climate change to impact everyday costs like utilities and groceries.
Against this backdrop, voters overwhelmingly support requiring oil and gas companies to pay their share of climate damages, including through a climate superfund law, and are more likely to support candidates who back those measures.
Under the cost-sharing frame, 77% of voters express support, including 89% of Democrats, 78% of Independents, and 64% of Republicans.
Voters also say that support for a climate superfund bill could influence their choices at the ballot box.","This year has brought record-breaking heat domes across the central and eastern U.S., catastrophic flash floods in Texas that swept away homes and RVs, and devastated a summer camp community, and destructive wildfires in Southern California that leveled thousands of homes. These disasters are becoming more frequent and are driving up costs that average people are forced to bear. As families across the U.S. shoulder this financial burden, states like New York and Vermont have passed “climate superfund” laws, and several others have introduced similar proposals — measures that require polluting industries to pay for a share of climate damages caused by their emissions. Now, these laws face opposition from the federal government, which is moving to strike them down or otherwise shield polluters from legal accountability. Despite these developments, polls consistently show voters overwhelmingly support efforts to hold polluters accountable for mounting climate damages.

In a new poll of national likely voters, Data for Progress and Fossil Free Media find that nearly half of respondents say they or someone they know has personally experienced extreme heat waves in the past five years, and most believe these events are becoming more frequent. Voters are especially concerned about rising insurance rates, and many also expect climate change to impact everyday costs like utilities and groceries.

Against this backdrop, voters overwhelmingly support requiring oil and gas companies to pay their share of climate damages, including through a climate superfund law, and are more likely to support candidates who back those measures. These views are consistent with earlier polling and, in several cases, reflect increased levels of concern and support over time. This support is broad across demographics and partisan lines, including with majorities of Republicans who back polluter accountability, suggesting that public appetite for such action is durable and growing.

When asked about extreme weather, nearly half of voters (45%) report that they or someone they know personally has experienced extreme heat waves in the last five years, while about 3 in 10 say the same about flooding or flash flooding. In states that were oversampled for this survey, the toll is especially stark: About half of North Carolina and Texas voters report experience with flooding, nearly 4 in 5 Floridians and 3 in 5 North Carolinians say the same about hurricanes or tropical storms, and in every state, at least 2 in 5 voters report that they or someone they know has experienced extreme heat waves.

Looking more broadly, a majority of voters believe both climate change (56%) and fossil fuel pollution (52%) will directly affect their household finances, views consistent with an earlier poll from this year. Views follow clear partisan patterns: More than two-thirds of Democrats and just over half of Independents expect financial impacts, while a majority of Republicans say these factors will have little to no effect.

State results mirror these partisan divides. In bluer states like Illinois and Virginia, voters are far more likely to expect financial impact; two-thirds in Illinois (66%) and nearly 3 in 5 in Virginia (59%) say climate change will affect their household finances. In more conservative states such as Texas, Florida, and North Carolina, voters are more split, with about an equal share saying climate change will have an impact on their finances as those who say it will have little or no impact. The same pattern holds for fossil fuel pollution: Majorities in Illinois and Virginia expect financial effects, while respondents are generally split in the more Republican-leaning states.

Among voters who do expect financial effects, large majorities point to higher utility bills (73%), grocery bills (68%), and gas prices (65%). Many also anticipate increases in health care costs, housing costs, and property maintenance expenses.

This broad consensus translates directly into support for legislative action. In an A/B split sample, voters were asked about a proposed “climate superfund” bill in two different ways: One framing emphasized requiring oil and gas companies to pay a share of the cost of damages caused by their pollution (Split A), while the other emphasized requiring them to pay into a fund that would help communities recover from climate disasters (Split B).

In both cases, support is overwhelming. Under the cost-sharing frame, 77% of voters express support, including 89% of Democrats, 78% of Independents, and 64% of Republicans. Under the recovery fund frame, support remains nearly identical at 78% overall, and 89%, 80%, and 66% among Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, respectively.

State-level results reinforce the breadth of this support. In both Illinois and North Carolina, 78% of voters back the recovery fund framing, while support in Florida (75%), Texas (73%), and Virginia (79%) is also strong. Under the cost-sharing framing, support is highest in Florida (80%) and Texas (78%), with majorities in all oversampled states backing the measure.

Across both split sample groups, there is a marked increase in climate superfund support when compared with polling from 2024, when 66% of voters said they would support a ""climate superfund"" bill that would require oil and gas companies to pay a share of the cost of climate damages caused by their pollution.

Voters also say that support for a climate superfund bill could influence their choices at the ballot box. Sixty-one percent report they would be more likely to support a candidate who backed such a measure, compared with just 16% who say they would be less likely. This includes nearly 4 in 5 Democrats (78%), about 3 in 5 Independents (59%), and nearly half of Republicans (47%).

State-level results are consistent: In each of the oversampled states, large majorities say they would be more likely to support a candidate who favored a climate superfund bill.

Compared with April 2024, when 50% of voters said they would be more likely to support a candidate who backed a superfund bill and 22% said they would be less likely, the latest results point to a clear increase in support. Because the earlier poll included a “don’t know” option, some of that change reflects differences in question design, but the overall movement still indicates real growth in support for candidates who support these efforts.

Together, these results show that supporting polluter accountability carries broad electoral appeal, with significant support even among Republican voters typically seen as more aligned with the oil and gas industry.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5aa9be92f8370a24714de593/t/68c48193ca6e662c7fdb2c2f/1757708691445/Poll+LA+Strong+Majority+of+Voters+Believe+Congress+Shouldn%E2%80%99t+Fund+AI+Innovation+Until+It+Passes+AI+Consumer+Protection+Laws+%2873%29.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-09-15 12:07:55.137960

Under the deal, both countries will be able to fast-track reactor design checks, meaning if a reactor has already passed rigorous safety checks in one country, this work can be used by the other to support its assessment, avoiding duplicating work.

It is also expected to unlock billions in private investment, accelerating the development of clean energy projects and boosting the UK’s position as a global leader in nuclear energy.

Major deals include an £11 billion small modular reactor (SMR) at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire, 12 advanced reactors in Hartlepool, and micro-reactors for London Gateway port’s £1 billion expansion.

These projects promise to boost energy security, create jobs – including 2,500 in Nottinghamshire – and stimulate regional growth.

Those announced so far feature partnerships between Holtec, EDF and Tritax, X-Energy and Centrica, Last Energy and DP World, Urenco and Radiant, and TerraPower and KBR.

Simon Bowen, chairman at Great British Energy – Nuclear said: “The UK-US commitment to nuclear energy sends a clear signal – this is a pivotal moment for energy security and clean growth.

“There is enormous potential to unlock investment in the UK’s nuclear sector – supporting high-quality jobs, regional growth, and the development of a resilient, capable supply chain.”

According to the Nuclear Industry Association, the sector has already seen 11,000 new jobs created this year following government-led investment.

powering clean technologies—rare earths, aluminum, and copper—are becoming scarcer as demand surges. Primary extraction is no longer sufficient to meet global decarbonization goals, nor is it sustainable. Recycling, once a niche activity, is now a strategic imperative. By 2025, the race to close the rare earths scrap gap has intensified, with recycling pioneers emerging as linchpins of supply chain resilience and environmental stewardship. For investors, this shift represents a unique opportunity to capitalize on an undervalued asset class at the intersection of sustainability, geopolitics, and technological innovation.

The Market Dynamics of Secondary Metal Supply Chains

The urgency to scale recycling is driven by three forces: sustainability mandates, supply chain security, and technological breakthroughs. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, global demand for rare earths is projected to grow by over 1,000% by 2050, driven by electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, and grid infrastructureThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. However, primary mining remains concentrated in China, which controls 60% of global rare earth processing capacityThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. This concentration has spurred a strategic pivot toward recycling, particularly in countries like India and the U.S., where policy incentives and domestic manufacturing mandates are reshaping the landscape.

China's dominance in the sector is not just a function of scale but of policy. The country has invested heavily in urban mining—extracting metals from discarded electronics, batteries, and industrial waste—while imposing stricter export controls on raw materialsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. Meanwhile, India's early achievement of its 2030 renewable energy targets has created a surge in decommissioned solar panels and wind turbines, fueling a nascent but rapidly growing recycling industryThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These developments underscore a broader trend: recycling is no longer a supplement to primary supply but a core component of national energy strategies.

Technological Innovations and Policy Catalysts

Advancements in recycling technologies are closing the efficiency gap between primary and secondary production. For example, hydrometallurgical processes now enable the recovery of over 95% of rare earths from neodymium magnets in EV motorsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. Similarly, innovations in aluminum and copper recycling have reduced energy consumption by 90% compared to smelting, aligning with corporate net-zero commitmentsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These technologies are being scaled by startups and traditional recyclers alike, creating a fragmented but dynamic market ripe for consolidation.

Policy shifts are amplifying this momentum. The U.S.-China trade dispute in 2025, for instance, highlighted the strategic value of copper and rare earths, prompting both nations to partially roll back tariffs on key commoditiesTracking tariffs: Key moments in the US-China trade dispute[ 3 ]. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for recycled materials have incentivized automakers and grid operators to prioritize secondary supply chainsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. The European Union's Circular Economy Action Plan, meanwhile, mandates a 70% recycling rate for critical raw materials by 2030These are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These regulatory tailwinds are creating a “policy premium” for companies that can demonstrate circularity in their operations.

The Investment Thesis: A Gold Rush for Circular Assets

The convergence of these factors positions recycling as a high-conviction investment theme. Unlike traditional commodities, secondary metal supply chains offer dual value propositions: environmental impact and geopolitical diversification. For example, a company specializing in rare earth recovery from electronic waste not only mitigates supply risks but also aligns with ESG benchmarks, attracting capital from institutional investors and green bonds.

Emerging business models further enhance the sector's appeal. “Urban mining” platforms, which aggregate scrap from consumers and industries, are leveraging AI and blockchain to optimize collection and traceabilityThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. Partnerships between recyclers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are also gaining traction, with

and Siemens now sourcing 30% of their copper and rare earths from recycled streamsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These collaborations create sticky, long-term revenue streams and reduce exposure to volatile primary markets.

Risks and the Path Forward

While the sector's potential is clear, risks remain. Recycling technologies are capital-intensive, and scaling them requires upfront investment. Regulatory uncertainty—such as fluctuating tariffs or inconsistent global standards—could also disrupt margins. However, these challenges are surmountable. Investors with a long-term horizon can mitigate risk by targeting companies with proprietary technologies, strong policy alignment, and diversified feedstock sources.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd2643784bc002.png,N,,2025-09-15 16:01:17.510183

“Clean hydrogen is poised for significant growth in the years ahead,” Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s CEO, said in a statement.
“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said.
“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said.
“The idea of this deal is that it helps them become a developer of hydrogen projects, and they’ll be the ones buying their own electrolyzers.","Last week, electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen bought the hydrogen developer Ambient Fuels. The deal was backed by $400 million from the investor Generate Capital to finance projects all over the world that use the zero-carbon version of the fuel.

It’s part of what analysts say is a forthcoming wave of consolidation as an industry that expanded quickly grapples with limited near-term demand for its fuel.

“You’ve got way too much potential supply out there,” Martin Tengler, the head of hydrogen research at the consultancy BloombergNEF, told Latitude Media. “We count more than 100 manufacturers and not enough demand for the electrolyzers they produce. That naturally leads to attrition.”

In some cases, that means mergers. In July, for example, oil and gas giant Baker Hughes bought hydrogen heavyweight Chart Industries. In others, it means going bust. In May, the French hydrogen stripe McPhy collapsed into insolvency, with a court overseeing the sale of its parts.

If all the green and blue hydrogen projects announced worldwide came to fruition, the industry would generate 200 million metric tons of fuel from renewably-powered electrolyzers and carbon capture-equipped gas per year, Tengler said. That’s double the global supply of gray hydrogen, the version of the fuel made with unmitigated gas.

Yet only 6% of those green and blue hydrogen projects have identified offtakers to buy the fuel, which is far more expensive than the dirty alternative. Of that 6%, just 13% have binding offtake agreements.

“So, less than 1% of this 200 million tons have secured a binding agreement where the buyer must buy,” Tengler said. “If you don’t have that kind of offtake agreement, it’s going to be hard to find a banker to finance the project.”

Electric Hydrogen appears to be betting it can capture more of the market by vertically integrating its equipment with the projects deploying it.

“Clean hydrogen is poised for significant growth in the years ahead,” Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s CEO, said in a statement. “We believe this new integration will both enable the industry to scale faster and give Electric Hydrogen even more ways to serve our diverse array of customers — from those who want to do it all themselves, from power procurement all the way to the finished clean-fuel — to those who prefer a partner to finance and develop the hydrogen plant so they can remain focused on their business outcomes.”

In other words: Electric Hydrogen wants to seize as much of the demand in the market as possible. It’s an extension of the company’s enduring tactic of scaling up manufacturing even through a downturn, as Garabedian explained on a March episode of the Green Blueprint podcast.

For more on Electric Hydrogen’s strategy, listen to Raffi Garabedian on the Green Blueprint:

But until now, Electric Hydrogen’s approach has solely been to build large-scale, 100-megawatt electrolyzer plants for industrial projects; the company has never itself been a hydrogen producer. With the Ambient acquisition, Electric Hydrogen is expanding its potential customer base to include hydrogen end users — as well as the ammonia plants or SAF facilities that have already been buying the company’s electrolyzers to make hydrogen of their own.

“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said. “The idea of this deal is that it helps them become a developer of hydrogen projects, and they’ll be the ones buying their own electrolyzers. If they can find a buyer for the hydrogen, then that seems like an interesting move.”

The shifting policy landscape

The acquisition comes as the hydrogen industry leans into something it hasn’t had for years: relative policy certainty.

The 45V tax credit enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act was just the start of a regulatory rollercoaster. The months that followed the law’s passage in 2022 brought fierce debate over how the Treasury Department should define eligibility for the credit — and by extension what kind of hydrogen could be considered “clean.” The fairly strict initial proposal included three pillars — additionality, deliverability, and hourly matching — and prompted intense pushback from certain segments of the industry.

Ambient, for instance, planned to build a major project in Texas “smack dab in the middle” of six refineries currently running on gray hydrogen, and there wasn’t enough physical space to add new batteries big enough to deploy solar panels and wind turbines and allow those refineries to run 24/7 — as the draft guidance would have required for eligibility for 45V credits.

“We wanted to be the billboard for the next generation of carbon-free hydrogen, right in the middle of all that heavy industry, all that refining,” Ambient CEO Jacob Susman told Latitude Media last year. “In making that choice, we put ourselves at risk. If you were required to have this hourly matching, it might make more sense to be sitting right next to the solar plant or the wind farm.”

The debate over the Treasury guidance persisted well into last year. The industry finally got clarity on how the tax credits would work in December 2024, mere weeks before the Trump administration took office. The final rule added some flexibility, providing carve-outs for nuclear plants that would have been excluded under the additionality requirement, and for projects in states with high amounts of renewables.

When President Donald Trump took office pledging to rescind much of the IRA, the fate of the policy was once again thrust into uncertainty. But lobbying by powerful Trump allies, including some representatives of the oil and gas industry, helped preserve the tax credit in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that largely replaced the IRA. The turnaround helped ensure that certain projects would pencil out beyond a single year.

This was roughly what Susman predicted last fall, telling Latitude Media: “We don’t think they’re coming for hydrogen first.”

If the industry can manage to find enough buyers for green hydrogen now, Tengler said, a tie-up between Ambient’s projects and Electric Hydrogen’s electrolyzers may help produce a giant in the space that can compete with the Chinese manufacturers currently dominating the market.

“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said. “The idea of this deal is that it helps them become a developer of hydrogen projects, and they’ll be the ones buying their own electrolyzers. If they can find a buyer for the hydrogen, then that seems like an interesting move.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-12T182829.060.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-15 11:03:41.132995

Australia’s roughly 11 million households have the world’s highest level of solar installations, helping to drive the nation’s transition away from its aging fleet of coal-fired power generators. The government is eager to tap that enthusiasm as it seeks to meet an ambitious target to more than double renewable generation by 2030, and in July launched a program to cut upfront costs of home batteries.

Residential battery sales almost tripled in the first half of 2025 from a year earlier in the lead up to the program, the CEFC said. Meanwhile, about 1.1 gigawatts of rooftop solar was installed, surpassing the 1 gigawatt of commissioned large-scale renewable energy projects.

A weak grid, limited interconnector capacity between states and the slow rollout of key transmission projects pose big risks for new large renewable energy developments, according to BloombergNEF, which forecasts Australia won’t meet its goal for renewables to supply 82% of electricity until 2036. Many flagship emissions-reduction projects — including green hydrogen and offshore wind — have faced setbacks.

As nuclear power projects falter under the weight of escalating costs and operational delays, investors are increasingly turning their attention to renewable energy as a more resilient and scalable alternative. This shift is not merely a response to environmental imperatives but a strategic recalibration driven by hard financial realities. The recent failures of flagship nuclear projects, such as the Vogtle plant in Georgia and the Olkiluoto 3 reactor in Finland, underscore the systemic risks of capital-intensive nuclear energy. In contrast, renewable energy technologies—bolstered by technological innovation and agile deployment strategies—are outpacing traditional models, offering investors a clearer path to long-term value.

The Financial Quagmire of Nuclear Projects

The Vogtle nuclear project in the United States epitomizes the financial instability of modern nuclear energy. Originally budgeted at $14 billion for two reactors, the project's costs ballooned to over $31 billion, with additional penalties pushing the total to nearly $35 billion Vogtle Electric Generating Plant - Wikipedia[ 1 ]. Delays spanning over a decade, coupled with the bankruptcy of its contractor, Westinghouse, have left ratepayers and shareholders bearing the brunt of these overruns Vogtle Electric Generating Plant - Wikipedia[ 1 ]. Similarly, Finland's Olkiluoto 3 reactor, initially projected to cost €3 billion and come online in 2009, faced 14 years of delays and €11 billion in costs before commencing operations in 2023 HS: Olkiluoto 3 has been a financial catastrophe for Areva, Siemens[ 3 ]. These cases reveal a pattern: nuclear projects are prone to cost overruns, regulatory hurdles, and technical complexities that erode investor confidence.

The risks are not confined to individual projects. A 2023 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) noted that global nuclear capacity additions have stagnated since 2010, with only 15 reactors under construction as of 2023—far below the 150 needed to meet net-zero targets by 2050 Azure Data Factory CI/CD with GitHub Actions[ 5 ]. This stagnation reflects a broader market skepticism, as investors increasingly view nuclear energy as a high-risk, low-liquidity asset class.

The Resilience of Renewable Energy

Renewable energy, by contrast, offers a compelling counterpoint. Solar and wind power have seen their costs plummet by over 80% and 60%, respectively, since 2010, making them the cheapest sources of new electricity generation in most regions Renewable energy explained - U.S. Energy Information[ 2 ]. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), renewables accounted for 9% of total U.S. energy consumption in 2023, with projections suggesting they could supply over 45% of global electricity by 2030 Renewable energy explained - U.S. Energy Information[ 2 ]. This growth is driven not only by falling hardware costs but also by advancements in energy storage, smart grids, and digital analytics.

The scalability of renewables is further enhanced by their modular nature. Unlike nuclear plants, which require years of planning and billions in upfront capital, solar farms and wind parks can be deployed incrementally, allowing investors to adapt to market conditions. This agility mirrors the principles of software development: just as JavaScript's object model enables rapid prototyping and iterative updates, renewable energy systems can be scaled and reconfigured to meet evolving demand Get Started - Handbook - Apache ECharts[ 4 ].

Tech-Enabled Energy Systems: A New Paradigm

Modern energy systems are increasingly underpinned by technologies that mirror the flexibility of software development. For instance, Git's branching strategies—used in open-source software to manage parallel development streams—offer a useful analogy for renewable energy deployment. Just as Git allows developers to test and refine code in isolated branches before merging them into a stable release, renewable projects can be piloted in small-scale trials before full-scale rollout. This reduces risk and accelerates innovation, much like how GitHub Actions automate testing and deployment in software workflows Azure Data Factory CI/CD with GitHub Actions[ 5 ].

Power BI's dynamic data integration further illustrates the power of tech-enabled energy systems. By aggregating real-time data from distributed solar arrays, wind turbines, and battery storage units, Power BI dashboards provide stakeholders with actionable insights into energy production and consumption patterns. This mirrors the role of ECharts, a JavaScript-based visualization library, in creating interactive energy analytics platforms Get Started - Handbook - Apache ECharts[ 4 ]. Such tools enable investors to monitor performance, optimize asset allocation, and respond swiftly to market shifts—a stark contrast to the rigid, data-scarce environments of traditional nuclear projects.

Strategic Capital Reallocation: A Call to Action

The case for reallocating capital from nuclear to renewable energy is both economic and technological. Nuclear projects, with their long lead times and high fixed costs, are ill-suited to a world demanding rapid decarbonization and grid flexibility. Meanwhile, renewables—supported by scalable infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and digital innovation—are positioned to dominate the energy transition.

Investors must act decisively. The window for capturing value in renewables is narrowing as policy frameworks solidify and competition intensifies. For example, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (2022) has already spurred $369 billion in clean energy investments, with tax credits favoring projects that demonstrate technological agility Renewable energy explained - U.S. Energy Information[ 2 ]. Those who delay risk being left with stranded assets in an energy landscape increasingly defined by speed, adaptability, and data-driven decision-making.

Conclusion

The energy transition is no longer a distant horizon but an unfolding reality. As nuclear projects like Vogtle and Olkiluoto demonstrate the perils of capital-intensive, inflexible infrastructure, renewables are proving their mettle through scalability, innovation, and investor returns. By embracing the agility of JavaScript-driven analytics, Git-style deployment strategies, and Power BI-powered insights, the renewable sector is not just competing with traditional energy—it is outpacing it. For investors, the message is clear: the future belongs to those who prioritize resilience over rigidity, and adaptability over obsolescence.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd380f29cbc002.png,N,,2025-09-15 12:07:38.141947

Members of the World Economic Forum's Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders have devised a checklist that is helping to drive scope 3 action.

Companies that act today, guided by this checklist, will lead tomorrow in climate performance, resilience, profitability and long-term success.

Sustainability is a shared responsibility that demands coordination, collaboration and bold action. Success isn’t about isolated efforts; it involves aligning strategies, working with partners and taking meaningful steps toward lasting change. So, how do we clean up global value chains while keeping businesses thriving?

Value chains span the entire product lifecycle — from raw materials to customer use — impacting the economy, environment and society at each stage. Addressing scope 3 emissions means engaging with the entire ecosystem. Companies, however, have been slow to adopt scope 3 targets, providing a number of excuses for this, ranging from a lack of data and regulatory clarity to infrastructure problems.

In a fast-changing climate and regulatory environment, however, perfection isn’t the goal — progress is. A report by the World Economic Forum's Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders highlights a 10% aggregated emissions reduction between 2019 and 2022. This achievement demonstrates that sustainable growth is a tangible business value driver.

So, how do we move from theory and ambition to action? Achieving this kind of progress requires not only strategic alignment, but also co-creating solutions with stakeholders and fostering lasting behaviour change. Incorporating elements, such as gamification, can help engage teams and partners more deeply, making sustainability efforts more tangible, motivating and enduring. When members of the Alliance, including Philips, AVEVA, DHL and ManpowerGroup, met with sustainability experts from across various industries and non-profit organizations, such as Games for Health, We Mean Business Coalition and UN Global Compact, they devised the following checklist to drive scope 3 action immediately:

1. Sustainability offers a competitive advantage

Sustainability leaders capture market share, improve customer retention and build resilient operations. DHL’s GoGreen Plus service, for example, enables its corporate customers to track and reduce their logistics emissions, positioning DHL as a strategic sustainability partner. AVEVA’s industrial software enables its customers to reduce their energy waste and carbon footprint, while increasing efficiency. Philips strengthens long-term relationships through circular business models, offering customers lower operational costs and access to the latest technology.

“

The green transition must create a path to prosperity for the many, not the few. That's why we take a people-centric approach. Investing in industry-specific reskilling ensures workers see opportunity, not threat, in the shift to sustainability.

—Frits Scholte, Senior Vice President, ManpowerGroup”

— Frits Scholte, Senior Vice President, ManpowerGroup

ManpowerGroup attracts top talent by aligning corporate values with sustainability-driven career paths, giving Gen Z and millennial workers a compelling reason to join. But, the talent shortage is real — 94% of employers globally say they lack the skilled talent to achieve their environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, while 70% are urgently recruiting green talent, particularly in renewable energy, manufacturing, operations and IT.

2. Digitalization, data and transparency accelerate supply chain resilience

Good intentions don’t cut emissions. Data does. Data-driven emissions tracking and real-time insights help companies find faster, smarter ways to reduce emissions, increase efficiency and cut costs. Successful sustainability leaders are rapidly pivoting sustainability to a business enabler, rather than treating it as a compliance checkbox or reporting exercise.

DHL’s GoGreen Plus solution provides customers with monthly high-quality reports with individualized emissions audited by an external auditor, ensuring in-depth analysis and official reporting.

“

There is a lot of insecurity about the path forward out there and it is our time as industry leaders to move ahead and boost scalability in this field. We will benefit tremendously from sharing our approaches and learning from each other.

For DHL operations, smart charging for EVs, energy and building management and AI-related route optimizations for fleets are all key drivers. AVEVA’s AI-driven analytics helps companies predict equipment failures, reducing unplanned asset downtime and energy consumption. Philips offers digital monitoring solutions for hospitals that optimize energy usage without compromising patient care. Then there’s the human side of data. ManpowerGroup uses workforce analytics to identify skills gaps in sustainability-related roles and helps companies integrate sustainability into daily operations.

3. Collaboration and leadership support systemic change

Too often, companies focus on internal sustainability efforts while overlooking the broader value chain. The key to delivering systemic change lies in collaboration, with cross-industry partnerships, supplier engagement and leadership that balances long-term sustainable value creation with short-term gains being crucial to succeed.

Philips is helping customers with easy software upgrades and equipment returns, shifting from traditional product sales to service-based models, cutting waste and creating long-term value along the way. DHL adopts a similar mindset. Recognizing that transport emissions go beyond its own fleet, DHL supports subcontractors in transitioning to cleaner vehicles by offering attractive financing conditions from OEMs, access to DHL's gas station infrastructure and a strong partnership.

4 . Sustainability as a profit generator, not a company expense

Sustainability is often perceived – and misconceived – as an added expense, with traditional financial models overlooking hidden environmental costs, such as emissions and resource depletion. Additionally, as regulation evolves — in the EU in particular — businesses must adapt to pricing and investment strategies that reflect the true cost of environmental impact.

Companies embedding sustainability into their core strategies are creating strategic advantages. They consistently reduce operational costs, attract investors and increase resilience.

Philips links its cost of capital to environmental performance through sustainability-linked financing. DHL reduces logistics costs by, e.g. investing in compressed natural gas (CNG) trucks and infrastructure, EVs for pick-up and delivery services and photovoltaic.

“

The industrial sector has a huge role to play in decarbonization and data is the foundation. AI and automation can help businesses find and fix inefficiencies before they become major issues.

AVEVA develops AI-infused software to optimize the use of critical resources, transforming sustainability from a cost into a savings driver by reducing waste, lowering operational expenses and enhancing industrial performance. ManpowerGroup helps companies track green job trends and align talent development with future business needs.

5. Train and upskill workforces to drive a sustainable future

Finally, beyond innovation, differentiation and financial incentives, scaling sustainability across value chains can only succeed if people are equipped to lead it. Every function must build sustainability into its mindset and skillset.

As more companies transition to low-carbon business models, demand for green skills in engineering, supply chain management and digital transformation is skyrocketing. Yet, this presents an opportunity and a challenge. While the green economy promises new roles, without proper support for reskilling, many workers fear these shifts could leave them behind, rather than open new doors. ManpowerGroup addresses this through targeted reskilling initiatives that ensure people see their place in the greener future, while companies get the critical talent they need to achieve their sustainability plans. DHL and Philips train employees in sustainability best practices, ensuring all teams – from managers to drivers to sales and procurement teams – can contribute to corporate climate targets.

Start by taking action

The data is compelling: studies from Morgan Stanley, NYU Stern and Oxford’s Smith School show that sustainable businesses outperform peers in efficiency, resilience and risk mitigation. Companies aligning sustainability with business goals gain a competitive edge in a changing economy.

True sustainability activates the entire ecosystem, well beyond scope 3 emissions reporting alone, to help equip partners to reduce them. Companies that act today will lead tomorrow in climate performance, resilience, profitability and long-term success. Whether through smarter data use, stronger partnerships, financial innovation or workforce training, the tools to act are already here. Philips, DHL, AVEVA and ManpowerGroup demonstrate the possibilities when sustainability drives strategy and is not an afterthought.

This is the decade of delivery. Action is the only metric that counts. Supply chain transformation is already happening. Are you ready to lead it?",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_LkGuaXpaxu1xIDKzYYv5GyYW834BQnVitAcBJR5tF2U.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:02:31.686559

That, analysts warned, could raise the risk of a “back door” entry into the U.S. market.","Investing.com -- Europe’s embrace of Chinese EVs is fueling speculation over when those brands will challenge the U.S., according to analysts.

At this year’s IAA Mobility show, “over a dozen Chinese car brands and, by our count, over 50 Chinese models had a presence,” UBS analysts said.

Their footprint in Europe is growing fast, with JATO data showing that Chinese brands captured 5.1% of new car registrations in the first half of 2025, nearly double from a year earlier.

Another 2.9% came from Chinese-owned brands, much of it focused on battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

, for example, now offers 13 models in Europe, up from six just two years ago, and plans to operate more than 1,000 stores across 32 countries by year-end. It aims to produce all of its European EVs locally by 2028, starting with its Surf model from a Hungarian plant.

Other brands are following similar paths. Hongqi is targeting 15 model launches in Europe by 2028, while has entered 10 European markets and is opening an R&D center in Germany.

“Everything we do starts with the needs of European users,” said an executive at GAC Group, another Chinese carmaker, and highlighted “accelerating steps towards localized production.”

The competitive dynamic in Europe has important implications for U.S. automakers and suppliers. Analysts warn this could echo what happened in China, where global suppliers underperformed as customers lost share to domestic players.

European incumbents like , , and Renault (EPA:RENA) could face pressure if Chinese brands succeed, while suppliers such as Mobileye Global (NASDAQ:MBLY), , , Lear Corporation (NYSE:LEA), and all have significant exposure to Europe.

For now, U.S. policy provides more insulation. UBS points out that the American market is “effectively closed,” helping protect Detroit’s automakers and their suppliers.

Still, U.S. executives are watching closely. CEO Jim Farley has praised the Xiaomi SU7, remarking that “we see the Chinese, companies like and BYD” as the real competitors for the next generation of EVs.

CEO RJ Scaringe was even more blunt, saying Chinese “cars are actually better” and that the industry should prepare for their eventual arrival.

Mexico’s recent move to impose a 50% tariff on Chinese vehicle imports adds another layer of complexity.

While the measure is seen as protecting local production and aligning with U.S. preferences ahead of USMCA renegotiations, it could encourage Chinese firms to build plants in Mexico. That, analysts warned, could raise the risk of a “back door” entry into the U.S. market.

“Separately, we note that as it stands, a 50% tariff from China into Mexico could impact who we believe imports ~125k units, though we do wonder if there could be exemptions for GM,” the analysts added.

But at the same time, the analysts view this “as an opportunity for GM to “backfill” some of their Mexican footprint that may come available as they resource some production to the U.S.”

In sum, while Chinese EVs may not flood U.S. showrooms soon, “better product, particularly if it’s cheaper, tends to find a way into the market,” the analysts stressed.

U.S. policy shields the domestic market for now, offering protection to local automakers, as well as suppliers tied closely to the Detroit Three and truck production, though how long that insulation lasts remains a question.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEE5R0P9_L.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 09:59:24.956853

Amazon confirmed in a statement to Bloomberg that it was testing the vehicles. “We’re committed to having 100,000 electric delivery vehicles on the road by 2030, and we regularly test various vehicle options — including a small number of Chevrolet BrightDrops in our fleet,” Steve Kelly, a company spokesperson, said in an emailed statement.

The pilot, though modest – about 12 vehicles, according to Amazon — places the GM vans among a fleet that also includes vehicles built by Ford Motor Co., Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Stellantis NV, as well as Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric vehicle startup Amazon backed with a massive investment and an order for 100,000 electric vans to be delivered by 2030.

The partnership with Rivian and the rollout of its bug-eyed vans have featured heavily in Amazon’s sustainability marketing, but the company still makes many deliveries from gasoline-powered vehicles like Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster vans. Rivian has cut jobs and vehicle delivery targets as it works to bring new consumer models to market and contends with President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the looming expiration of the US EV tax credit.

A GM spokeswoman said the automaker sold Amazon a small batch of vans in 2023. Getting in the door with Amazon could be a win if the Detroit automaker can build on the relationship and push beyond a pilot program. GM launched BrightDrop in 2021 as a new business unit to target fleet customers, with the goal of also supplying them with software to track shipments and deliveries.

The division struggled to gain traction and, by August 2024, GM folded it into GM Envolve, its fleet business division. GM electric van sales are growing but remain tiny. Chevy sold just under 1,600 of them in the first half of the year. By comparison, GM sold more than twice as many electric Cadillac Escalade IQs. GM even idled the van plant in April amid slow sales.

Amazon buys vans in bulk and, through fleet management companies, leases them to its network of contract delivery firms. The company has tested more than 15 EV models and has more than 31,000 on the road, including over 24,000 Rivian vans. Substituting electric vehicles for gasoline-powered ones is a cornerstone of Amazon’s effort to reduce carbon emissions.

The company’s contract delivery firms also use their own vehicles, including BrightDrop vans they’ve leased themselves.

Year after year, the 5,000-odd residents of the barrier island on Florida’s Gulf Coast wrote checks for their home and flood insurance policies, but rarely filed claims. Insurers collected over $10 in premiums for every dollar they paid out, a remarkable return on their business.

Then, in September 2022, Ian, a bruising Category 4 hurricane pushed up to 12 feet of water across the low-lying island, collapsing part of the only causeway on and off Sanibel, flooding thousands of single-family homes and condominiums with brackish water, and forcing some year-round residents into exile for over a year. Two more hurricanes, Helene and Milton, in 2024 added to the island’s misery.

The damage was both staggering and surprising. It had been years since Sanibel experienced a hurricane of any consequence. Officials had also taken steps to reduce their risks, limiting development to a third of the 12-mile-long island and setting aside land for a federal wildlife preserve. Still, Sanibel is only a few feet above sea level and many older homes are at ground level.

“We had so many good years, 30 or 40 years, we were spoiled,” said Daniel Moore Thompson, whose two-bedroom house and gift shop flooded. “And then Ian happened, and it was like we lost our innocence. I basically lost everything except my Jeep and dog.”

“The insurance crisis in the U.S. is the canary in the coal mine, and the canary is dead,” says a former California official.

In a matter of hours, Sanibel went from being an insurer’s dream to a financial nightmare. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which sells most flood policies, was hit with $620 million in claims, a nearly hundredfold increase from the total that it had paid Sanibel homeowners over the previous four decades.

But Sanibel wasn’t the only Southwest Florida community to suffer a dramatic reversal of fortune. Homeowners in Fort Myers Beach, Cape Coral, and Punta Gorda received over $1 billion in flood payouts, records show. Meanwhile, property insurers covering wind and other damages paid billions more, helping to make Ian one of the costliest hurricanes in history.

For insurers, the three hurricanes were a rude awakening. After years of underestimating risks posed by climate-fueled storms, wildfires, and other natural disasters, the industry now faces a perilous future. Old models based on stable climates are being challenged by more frequent, extreme, and damaging events — from searing wildfires in the coastal canyons of California, to hail and torrential rain in the Midwest, to explosive hurricanes such as Ian in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. Now, as sea levels rise, drenching rain storms swell rivers, and hail the size of baseballs pound roofs and cars, the increased costs are pushing insurers to the limit, upending housing markets, and even reshaping the makeup of some communities.

“The insurance crisis in the U.S. is the canary in the coal mine, and the canary is dead,” said Dave Jones, the insurance commissioner of California from 2011-2018 and now director of the Climate Risk Initiative at the Center for Law, Energy and Environment at the University of California, Berkeley. During his time as commissioner, wildfires exploded in Paradise and Malibu, resulting in billions in damages. Coupled with the Trump administration’s aggressive moves to roll back climate initiatives, Jones fears: “We are marching toward an uninsurable future in this country and across the globe; marching into the abyss.”

Jones isn’t alone in such dire warnings. Testifying this February before the Senate Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell predicted that “in 10 or 15 years there are going to be regions of the country where you cannot get a mortgage [because insurance isn’t available].”

Even more recently, the economists and climate analysts Carolyn Kousky, Spencer Glendon, and Barney Schauble raised the idea that the future may be uninsurable. “As natural disasters grow more frequent, extreme, and damaging, more people and businesses are struggling to afford — and even get — insurance,” they wrote in a recent article. “In places of increased climate risk from disasters such as fires and storms, insurance has gone from an afterthought to a source of concern, dismay, and anger.”

In a five-year period, insurers canceled nearly two million homeowner’s policies in the face of rising climate risks.

The markets for property and flood insurance are already in crisis, and in some high-risk areas, are broken, analysts say. Dozens of insurers in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and California have collapsed or been declared insolvent following searing wildfires and catastrophic hurricanes. Meanwhile, prominent national insurers, including Progressive, Allstate, and State Farm, have fled high-risk states or scaled back on writing new policies. In one five-year period, 2018-2023, insurers canceled nearly 2 million homeowner’s policies in the face of rising climate risks — over four times the number that would normally be expected in a year. Many of the notices came with little warning or explanation, leaving homeowners scrambling to find new coverage, no longer a given, and likely at a sharply higher price.

Deborah Brown received notice in 2017 that her family homeowner’s policy was being canceled after years with the same insurer. Her home was 10 miles inland, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, but insurers considered it to be high risk. When she looked for a new policy, she was quoted a figure of $8,000, Brown recalled, double her last policy, and over three times the national average, about $2,300. “That was the straw that broke our back,” Brown said. She and her husband sold their house and are now splitting their time between an RV and their daughter’s home upstate.

Florida and other high-risk coastal states have the highest rates of non-renewals, data prepared by the U.S. Senate Budget Committee show. However, there are signs that the trend — while not as pronounced — is spreading inland to Iowa, Oklahoma, and other states.

“People always question: Is insurance going to break?” said Benjamin Keys, a Wharton School economist who has written extensively about the impacts of climate change on real estate. “Well, it already broke a long time ago. Private insurers don’t want to write in the riskiest areas. The Florida insurance market has been broken for a long time.”

In 1992, after Hurricane Andrew caused billions in damage in southern Florida, and several companies collapsed or stopped writing policies, the state created Citizens Property Insurance Corporation to act as an insurer of last resort. Although never intended to compete with private companies, Citizens has since grown to become one of the largest insurers in Florida, with as many as 1.4 million policies at one point. Concerned about its growing financial exposure in the wake of Ian, Citizens began “depopulating” its rolls and transferring policies back to newer, smaller private insurers that have entered the chaotic Florida market.

Since 2000, Florida has had 36 presidential disaster declarations, with damages in the last seven years exceeding $300 billion.

More than 30 states have followed Florida’s path and created their own so-called FAIR plans to fill gaps in the private market. In California, hundreds of thousands of homeowners flocked to the state plan when insurers canceled their policies or stopped writing insurance in the wake of devastating wildfires. But the state policies do not come cheaply, and analysts worry that the small insurers do not have sufficient reserves and reinsurance to cover catastrophic disasters. In 2023, Louisiana was forced to raise the rates of its FAIR plan by over 60 percent in the wake of back-to-back hurricanes Laura and Ida.

Some analysts believe the federal government may have to step in to prop up the wavering market for home insurance, the way it did decades ago when it created the federal flood insurance program after private insurers abandoned the market. But the federally subsidized flood insurance program has lost billions over the years and currently is about $20 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury (that’s after the government already forgave $16 billion of its debt). The troubled NFIP recently increased prices, with the average policy expected to double in five years. Tens of thousands of homeowners have canceled their policies in response, and many more are expected to follow.

“I don’t think the story is insurance won’t be available,” said Keys. “I think the question is affordability and what is the price going to be. For wealthy owners, that may not be a deal-breaker. But others will have to bear more of the risk themselves, either out-of-pocket or by taking out higher deductibles.”

Keys and other analysts estimate that the average cost of a homeowner’s policy nationally has risen between 30 to 40 percent in the last five years — more in high-risk states such as Florida, where there are few regulatory caps and the average premium increased by $1,450 between 2020-2023. Overall, Florida is the most expensive state for homeowner’s insurance, with rates up to four times the national average and painfully high deductibles costing homeowner’s thousands of dollars more.

The risks associated with our hotter, wetter world are growing as natural disasters become more damaging. Ten of the 20 largest wildfires in California have occurred in the last five years, including the devastating 2025 L.A. fires, while hurricane damages and flood losses have soared to all-time highs.

Since 2000, Florida has had 36 presidential disaster declarations, with damages from just the last seven years exceeding $300 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Florida, Louisiana, and Texas alone account for about two-thirds of all hurricane and flood losses.

For example, between 1979-2003, Florida homeowners filed $1.52 billion in flood claims, data show. Then, in 2004, four large hurricanes struck the state, followed by a string of other storms and floods, including Ian and five other major hurricanes. Flood claims have since swelled to $18.9 billion. Most are in coastal counties along the Gulf of Mexico, including Lee County, home to Sanibel Island.

Keys said the rising costs associated with sea level change, hurricanes, and other natural disasters should be sending “a loud and booming signal” to the housing market. “There is a certain portion of the population that has been skeptical of climate risk, but when it hits your pocketbook you take it seriously,” he said.

Potential buyers have begun asking about climate risks and demanding discounts on homes located in coastal floodplains, known as Special Flood Hazard Areas, with a 1 percent annual chance of a 100-year storm. The sharp uptick in the cost of home and flood insurance is also dampening demand for homes, with tens of thousands of houses sitting unsold and some buyers avoiding high-risk areas entirely.

Potential buyers are factoring climate risks into their purchasing decisions, notes Selma Hepp, an economist at the research firm Cotality (formerly CoreLogic). “They’re pricing in insurance premiums, future storms, and the potential for resale challenges,” she said.

The challenges are especially acute in storm-prone Florida, with 1,350 miles of coastline and millions of houses and condominiums perched along shorelines, lagoons, and canals. Now, following three major hurricanes in two years, the housing boom there shows signs of stalling, or even becoming a bubble.

On Sanibel Island, with three hurricanes since 2022, scores of properties have been on the market for months or longer.

“In Fort Myers and Cape Coral, we have 12,000 properties for sale. Five years ago, maybe there would be 30,” real estate agent Susanne Perstad told The Times of London in April. “There’s so much property for sale — maybe five or six houses on every street — and nothing sells. It’s insane.”

Back on Sanibel Island, scores of homes and condominiums have been on the market for months, or longer, and owners are offering discounts up to $100,000 to lure buyers.

During Covid, demand for homes soared across Florida, but especially along the Gulf. “There was so much demand, we ran out of inventory, and you could sell anything for whatever you wanted,” said Eric Pfeifer, who owns a popular real estate agency on Sanibel. The median sales price soared to $1.3 million, but has since dropped to pre-Covid levels, about $830,000. “It was unsustainable,” Pfeifer said. “People weren’t thinking about sea level rise and climate change. In hindsight, it appears unfortunate.”

Thousands of Sanibel homes have been repaired three years after Ian. But a surprising number haven’t been elevated, and with the island less than five feet above sea level, those properties remain vulnerable to future hurricanes and floods. In Ian, older properties, including many at ground level, accounted for about 70 percent of $620 million in flood losses.

Under an NFIP regulation known as the 50 percent rule, if a house is damaged by half or more of its market value, it is required to elevate in order to keep its flood insurance. But some Sanibel homeowners avoided that requirement by requesting new assessments. The new, higher valuations make it less likely damages reach the 50 percent threshold.

Daniel Moore Thompson said he applied for a state grant to help raise his two-bedroom, two-bathroom house located near Blind Pass, where Sanibel merges with Captiva Island. But he was turned down after the state program ran out of money. “It costs $100,000 or $200,000 to elevate on Sanibel. I didn’t have that with all the other costs I had.”

Thompson got a new, higher assessment, which allowed him to stay on the ground for now. But he still plans to elevate. “It just kind of has to wait until I have the money.”

The federal flood program paid him the maximum $250,000 to cover Ian’s flood damage to his house, plus $75,000 for contents. “I still have my same homeowner’s insurance, and it only went up about 30 percent,” he said. “When I heard some of the horror stories from my friends, who had to fight their insurers or had their policies canceled, I was lucky.”

Thompson’s gift shop, Suncatchers, didn’t have flood insurance, and he estimated he lost about $1 million worth of inventory. He has since relocated to an elevated commercial mall on Periwinkle Way.

Even with the challenges, Thompson plans to stay on Sanibel “as long as nature” allows him. “I moved here from Western Pennsylvania. When I saw the nature and the water, I knew this is where I was meant to be. I get up in the morning, walk out my door and fish. I mean who doesn’t want to live by the water?”",https://yale-threesixty.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/Sanibel-House_AP-HEADER.jpg?w=1200&q=60&auto=format&fit=max&dm=1757690272&s=7567ef0d93cb4ab1d9db7b58dc304216,N,,2025-09-15 07:00:07.247341

Volkswagen appears keen to deliver on its promise to bring 8 affordable electric vehicles (EVs) to market by 2027, including a €20,000 euros (about $23,500) model.

At the International Mobility Show in Munich, Germany, the automaker showcased the tech that should make this feat a reality: It has developed a “unified cell”, a kind of lego-shaped battery cell design which can either be filled with NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) for long-range, premium EVs, or with LFP (lithium iron phosphate), for low-cost models.

The unified cell tech gives batteries the capacity of fast charging from 10% to 80% in under 25 minutes and a driving range of up to 280 miles.

Two of VW’s upcoming small and affordable EVs, the ID. Polo and the ID. Cross, will feature the new battery tech. (These models seem to already be creating quite a buzz for another reason: VW seems to have listened to customer feedback and has ditched a number of disruptive haptics controls to return to manual buttons).

But one thing is for sure: VW has hit the nail on the head by investing in battery tech. According to a Gartner study, battery costs represent close to 40%, or the biggest manufacturing expense, in the production of an EV.

The good news: Battery prices, mainly LFPs, have plummeted over the past 10 years to the point that EVs are expected to be cheaper to produce than regular cars by 2027.

Are expensive electric trucks on the way out?

Which brings us to another major EV news story, this time in the U.S.: After much raised expectations, and many delays, giant automaker Stellantis has decided to cancel what was supposed to be Ram’s first-ever electric pick-up truck. The official reason cited: Slowing demand.

The move wasn’t completely unexpected, with Stellantis having already postponed the launch several times, noting that there was more interest in its upcoming Ramcharger plug-in hybrid (PHEV). But the RAM electric truck, expected to be a direct competitor to the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the Ford F-150 Lightening, might have suffered from more than the changing whims of consumer: Its hefty price: Kelley Blue Book estimated the truck would be priced at around $58,000 for a basic model, with fully loaded versions likely topping $100,000.

And its battery? The very expensive NCM lithium ion type. The Ram electric truck’s estimated retail price was right in line with those of competitors – but that might be part of the problem: Sales of Ford and GM electric trucks have softened.

Kelley Blue Book notes that consumers are feeling more and more inflation pressures, with car prices having increased by about $12,000 to $15,000 on average over the past ten years.

GM, Ford commit to LFP batteries

Both Ford and GM have invested in LFP chemistry for their batteries. GM has partnered with LG Energy solutions to produce cheaper batteries. In Ford’s case, its newly announced next-gen platform is also geared towards more efficient, and therefore less costly, car production. But no doubt, its commitment to LFP batteries is a huge factor in its goal to produce EVs, including small trucks, priced closer to $25,000.

Newcomers in the robotaxi space

We recently reported that Stellantis is also backing away from self-driving technology, citing “limited demand” and high costs.

Meanwhile, the expansion of robotaxi services seems far from over in the U.S., starting with Lyft, which is attempting to catch up with Uber and Waymo.The ride-hailing company just launched robotaxi services in Atlanta in partnership with May Mobility. The service is still in pilot phase involving human safety operators in the front seat of Hybrid Toyota Sienna Autono-Maas vehicles. Both Waymo and Uber have already started delivering driverless rides since the beginning of summer.

Amazon-backed Zoox also kicked off its robotaxi service offering free rides in a number of locations in Las Vegas. A San Francisco launch is expected before the end of the year, to be followed by Austin and Miami.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1,N,,2025-09-15 06:01:47.721247

Most Virginia campaigns are won or lost on hot-button issues like taxes, education, reproductive rights, guns and gay marriage, so everyone who runs for office has a position on these questions. This holds true for candidates in this year’s high-stakes races for the state’s executive branch and all 100 House of Delegates seats.

Inevitably, though, there are topics the average candidate doesn’t completely grasp. Some are narrow and – thankfully – nonpartisan. Where do you stand on Sunday hunting? Should I-81 have more lanes? How do you feel about skill games? Will you vote to save the menhaden, whatever a menhaden is? (It’s a fish, and I encourage you to say yes.)

Other topics affect the lives of every Virginian, but they are, frankly, complicated. One of these is energy. Not only is it hard to get up to speed on energy issues, but technology is changing so rapidly that keeping abreast of developments would be a full-time job. Who would spend that kind of time on such a dreary topic?

Uh, that would be me.

So here we go: I’m going to cover five things political hopefuls need to know about energy in Virginia before you get to the General Assembly and start passing laws that affect your constituents’ wallets and futures. And for voters, these are things you should ask candidates about before they earn your vote.

First up:

If you are going to talk about energy, you have to talk about data centers

By now you surely know that Virginia has embraced the most energy-intensive industry to come along since the steam engine launched the Industrial Revolution. Northern Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, which already consume an estimated 25% of the state’s electricity, with massively more development planned. The reason isn’t vacation photos or Instagram cat videos; it’s the competition to develop artificial intelligence (AI).

After putting tax incentives in place to attract the industry 15 years ago, the General Assembly and the current governor have rejected all attempts to put guardrails on development or make data centers more energy efficient. The subsidies now cost taxpayers a billion dollars per year (and counting). Virginia asks for almost nothing in return.

Under the best of circumstances, the skyrocketing demand for electricity would put upward pressure on energy prices. But our situation is even worse: Virginia already imports about half our electricity from other states, and the regional grid that we’re part of faces its own energy crunch.

Grid manager PJM has been so slow to approve new generation that governors from member states, including Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, wrote a letter taking PJM to task and urging it to move faster. But the damage has been done. Supply is tight, electricity prices have risen, and prices will continue to rise unless and until supply catches up.

PJM has decided to fast-track new high-cost, gas-fired generating plants ahead of the cheaper renewable energy projects that make up 95% of the queue. It’s a much-criticized move and seems more likely to increase costs. Once built, fossil gas plants burn a fuel that has doubled in price just over the past year, threatening a repeat of the post-pandemic price surge that Virginia ratepayers are still paying for. And there is no relief in sight, with utilities now having to compete with a doubling of U.S. natural gas exports.

Short of unleashing all the renewable energy stuck in the queue, there is no easy way to protect Virginia residents from higher electricity costs. Dominion Energy, Appalachian Power, and at least one of the electric cooperatives have proposed special rate classes for large-load customers, but that would shield residents from only some of the costs of serving the data centers.

Utility bills are going up. Dominion Energy is seeking hefty rate increases that would push up residential bills by an average of more than $10 per month in base rates plus almost $11 per month in fuel costs, primarily due to those higher natural gas prices. Coal-heavy APCo has seen even steeper rate increases in the past few years.

Dominion proposes higher utility rates, new rate class for data centers

Virginia needs new legislation ensuring data centers bear the full expense and risks of serving Big Tech, and they should be required to source their own clean energy. Localities, meanwhile, must be required to evaluate the costs to all Virginians before they issue permits to data centers, including considerations like where the energy will come from, water impacts, and the siting of transmission lines.

You can’t get from here to there without solar

Virginia wasn’t producing all of its own energy even before the data center rush, and PJM’s problems are now pushing us into a crisis. Our near-term options are limited; new data centers are breaking ground at a breathtaking rate, and only solar can be installed on the timeline needed to prevent an energy shortfall. Even if we were willing to pay for high-priced gas or nuclear plants, developers face a backlog of as long as seven years for gas turbines, and advanced nuclear is still not commercially viable.

Fortunately, solar is not just the fastest energy source to deploy, it’s also the cheapest and cleanest. Though President Donald Trump blames rising electricity prices on renewable energy, that’s false, just one of many myths the fossil fuel industry has propagated against solar. Nor is solar unreliable, another myth. When solar is paired with battery storage, it can match the rise and fall of demand perfectly.

The war on woke…energy?

It’s true, however, that while the great majority of Virginians support solar energy, many rural residents oppose it on aesthetic grounds. Of course, they would also oppose nuclear reactors and gas fracking in their neighborhoods. Legislators should be sensitive to their concerns – but having chosen to welcome data centers, Virginia leaders can’t just shrug off the need for energy.

We also have to recognize that many farmers need to lease their land for solar in order to keep the land in their family and generate stable income. This should be as important a consideration to lawmakers as the objections of people who aren’t paying the taxes. Preventing landowners from making profitable use of their land is more likely to lead to the land being sold for development than to it remaining agricultural.

The good news is that solar panels are compatible with agricultural uses including livestock grazing, beekeeping, vineyards and some crops. Dominion Energy uses sheep instead of lawnmowers at several of its solar facilities in Virginia and plans to expand the practice. The combination is a beautiful synergy: sheep and native grasses improve the soil, and in 30 years when the solar panels are removed, the land has not been lost to development.

While there is no getting around the need for utility-scale solar projects, rooftop solar also has an important role to play. In addition to harnessing private dollars to increase electricity generation, distributed solar saves money for customers and makes communities more resilient in the face of extreme weather.

This year the governor vetoed a bill to expand the role of distributed solar in Virginia. The legislation had garnered strong bipartisan support, so it will likely pass again next year. However, lawmakers will need to go further to encourage customer investments in solar now that federal tax credits will be eliminated for residential consumers at the end of this year.

Batteries: For all your reliability needs

The fastest-growing energy sector today is battery storage. Batteries allow utilities to meet peaks in demand without having to build gas combustion turbines that typically run less than 10% of the time. Batteries also pair perfectly with intermittent energy sources like wind and solar, storing their excess generation and then delivering electricity when these resources aren’t available.

Battery prices have tumbled to new lows, while the technology continues to improve. Most lithium-ion batteries provide 4 hours of storage, enough to meet evening peak demand with midday solar. When renewable energy becomes a larger part of Virginia’s energy supply (it’s less than 10% now) we will need longer term storage, such as the iron-air batteries that are part of a Dominion pilot program. This year the governor vetoed a bill that would have increased the amount of storage our utilities must invest in. Given the increasing importance of batteries to the grid, the legislation will likely be reintroduced next year.

In Puerto Rico, customers are helping to keep the lights on. Could a Virginia program do the same?

Batteries installed at homes and businesses can also play a vital role in supporting the grid. Alone or combined with distributed solar, smart meters and electric vehicle charging, customer devices can be aggregated into a virtual power plant (VPP) to make more electricity available to the grid at peak demand times. Dominion will be developing a VPP pilot program under the terms of legislation passed this year.

Advanced nuclear is still in Maybeland

The enormous expense of building large nuclear plants using conventional light-water technology has made development almost nonexistent in this century. Proponents believe new technology will succeed with scaled-down plants that can, in theory, be standardized and modularized to lower costs. Many political and tech leaders hope these small modular reactors (SMRs) will prove a carbon-free solution to the data center energy problem.

It’s hard not to think they’re kidding themselves, or maybe us. Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power plan to develop one SMR each, with Dominion shooting to have one in service in 2035. Not only is this too late to meet today’s energy crunch, but a single SMR would add less energy to the supply side than new data centers add to the demand side each year. Virginia still needs near-term solutions, which means solar and batteries.

Industry enthusiasts believe the 2035 timeline can be shortened, while critics say SMRs may never reach commercial viability. SMRs have to be able to compete on cost with much cheaper renewable energy, including wind, solar and emerging geothermal technologies, and cost parity is a long way off. The economic case for nuclear reactors also requires that they generate power all the time, including when the demand isn’t there, so SMRs need batteries almost as much as renewable energy does.

Geothermal energy is having a moment. Could it power Virginia’s data centers?

Finally, radioactive waste remains a challenging issue, as much (or more) for SMRs as for legacy nuclear plants. The U.S. has never resolved the problem of permanent storage, so nuclear waste is simply kept onsite at generating stations. The risk of accidents or sabotage makes it unlikely that communities will accept SMRs in their midst, especially if the idea is for SMRs to proliferate on the premises of privately-owned data centers near residential areas statewide.

A nuclear technology with less of a waste problem? Fusion energy. A fusion start-up plans to build its first power plant in Virginia in the “early 2030s,” if the demonstration plant it is building in Massachusetts proves successful. While fusion would be an energy game-changer, there are so many uncertainties around timeline and cost that only an inveterate gambler would bet on it helping us out of our predicament.

Pretending climate change isn’t real won’t make it go away

We don’t have to talk about climate change to make the case for transitioning to carbon-free renewable energy, but global warming hovers in the background of any energy debate like an unwanted guest. If you need a primer or are even slightly tempted to say you “don’t know” whether human activity is responsible because you’re not a scientist, read the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s summary for policymakers. The continued habitability of the planet is too important for ignorance to be an acceptable dodge – and of course you, as a respectable candidate, would never stoop to such a thing.

Virginia codified its own action plan in 2020 with two major laws. One provides for the commonwealth to participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a multistate compact that uses auctions of carbon emission allowances to incentivize a shift away from fossil fuels and raise money for energy efficiency and climate adaptation. After taking office in 2022, Youngkin removed Virginia from RGGI – illegally, as a court ruled. Virginia remains outside RGGI while the appeals process continues.

The second law is the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), which creates a pathway for Dominion and APCo to transition to carbon-free electricity by 2050. The VCEA includes provisions requiring Dominion and APCo to invest in renewable energy, storage and energy efficiency and make renewable energy an increasing portion of their electricity supply.

The VCEA contains special provisions for offshore wind, which I haven’t addressed here because Trump is determined not to allow projects to move forward while he is in office. This is a shame, as there is bipartisan support in Virginia for this industry and the huge economic development opportunities that come with it. Still, Virginia’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project is 60% complete and will start delivering power next year. Eventually, hopefully, it will be remembered as the first of many.

The VCEA also prohibited new investments in fossil fuel plants except under certain conditions. Dominion is currently seeking permission from the State Corporation Commission to build a $1.5 billion, fossil gas-fired peaker plant, citing data center demand and a need for reliability. Local residents, environmental organizations and ratepayer advocates oppose the plant and filed expert testimony showing that solar, storage and other less expensive technologies would better serve consumers.

In what passes for a bombshell in the energy space, Dominion was forced to admit last month that it had not obtained an independent review of the bid process before selecting its own gas plant over resources offered by third-party bidders.

“No regrets” solutions are progressive and conservative

As you’ve probably figured out by now, there is no perfect power source available today. And yet we would need new generation even if we stopped data center construction cold in its tracks – which isn’t in the plans. Solar is the cheapest, cleanest, and fastest source of generation, allowing us to preserve land – and keep options open – for the future. If the data center boom goes bust, having surplus clean energy on the grid will let us eliminate dirty sources faster, while saving money.

Since taking office in January, Trump has ordered a moratorium on new offshore wind leases, required the Interior Department sign off for renewable projects on federal land, and signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4 that curtailed tax credits for wind, solar and electric vehicles.

Last month, the US Transportation Department canceled $679 million in funding that had been allocated to 12 offshore wind projects nationwide.

The steps mark a sharp reversal from former President Joe Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which unleashed record levels of clean energy investment.

Last month Trump declared: ""Any State that has built and relied on WINDMILLS and SOLAR for power are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS. THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY! We will not approve wind or farmer destroying solar.""

""Obviously, it (Trump's remarks) creates uncertainty, because the US was attractive over the last years for clean energy projects,"" Thibault Michel, a research fellow at the Paris-based think tank IFRI's Center for Energy and Climate, told Anadolu.

Michel noted that Trump has shifted from skepticism to outright rejection of wind and solar power, deepening concerns about the future of clean energy investment in the US.

- US investment drops 36% in first half of 2025

Wind additions in 2024 slowed to their weakest level in years, with many projects still awaiting final investment decisions when the administration tightened rules.

Denmark's Orsted halted its nearly complete Revolution Wind project in Rhode Island after a federal stop-work order, while US renewable spending fell sharply.

According to BloombergNEF, US investment dropped 36%, or about $20.5 billion, in the first half of 2025 compared with the prior six months.

During the same period, EU-27 investment surged nearly 63%, close to $30 billion.

The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) President and CEO Ray Long blasted the stop-work order.

""The Trump administration's decision to halt the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island is an extraordinarily damaging mistake,"" said Long.

He said the project was nearly complete, employing 2,500 people and delivering billions in private investment, and warned that canceling it sends ""a chilling signal to investors and developers that the US cannot be relied upon to honor its commitments, even when projects are 80% built.""

Long added that the decision risks higher power bills, and undermines US competitiveness as China races ahead with energy infrastructure spending.

While, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright defended the administration's stance, arguing offshore wind is uncompetitive without government support.

""In the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' President Trump advocated, we removed subsidies for wind,"" Wright told the Financial Times.

""Offshore wind is twice as expensive as onshore wind, and we wouldn't have a big onshore wind industry without a lot of subsidies. The economic outlook for offshore wind in the United States is not promising,"" he added.

According to Michel, US developers were already strained by high costs and global competition before Trump took office.

""Jobs destroyed in the wind and solar supply chain won't be replaced by oil and gas,"" he said. ""Most studies agree that for the same amount of energy, renewables employ more people than fossil fuels.""

""Trump's idea is to create new growth for oil and gas, but US oil production is expected to stabilize, not grow much, according to the Energy Information Administration,"" he added.

- ""Investments in renewables are outpacing fossil fuel""

Electricity demand in the US is climbing, driven in part by the growth of data centers, but generation capacity has increased only modestly over the past decade, almost entirely from wind, solar and battery storage.

""If you withdraw additions from wind, solar, or battery storage, it seems impossible to keep pace with growing demand,"" Michel said.

He noted that nuclear and gas projects could add supply, but new plants are unlikely to come online before 2028.

Despite this uncertainty, some US states continue expanding renewables, he explained. ""The US remains a big market, so it will still be attractive. But these announcements send a misleading signal. No one knows what will happen next.""

Globally, however, the picture is much clearer, renewables accounted for 92.5% of new power generation capacity added in 2024, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

""Investors around the world support their deployment: investments in renewables are outpacing fossil fuel funding by a substantial margin,"" Christoph Zipf, a spokesperson for the industry group WindEurope, told Anadolu.

""New wind farms generate electricity at lower costs than new fossil or nuclear power plants,"" Zipf added.

""The only way to slow down the global growth of renewables [in the power sector] is through policy interventions. Such interventions run counter to economic reason,"" he said.

It remains to be seen whether the rule will be adapted after industry feedback or if reporting will be shifted towards individual states.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a rule that would dismantle its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), which currently obliges around 8,000 industrial facilities to report annual emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases.

According to the proposed rule, 46 of the 47 source categories would be relieved of reporting requirements, and many of those in the petroleum and natural gas sector would see their reporting suspended until 2034 under recently enacted legislation.

Administrator Lee Zeldin positioned the move as part of the Trump administration’s “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation” agenda, calling the reporting obligations burdensome to business and saying the data collection “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.”

The EPA estimates that the rule could save U.S. businesses roughly $2-2.4 billion over ten years. The proposal is one in a growing wave of regulatory rollbacks aimed at loosening climate-related controls.

Earlier plans have targeted the EPA’s “endangerment finding,” a legal determination that underpins many federal greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act, as well as efforts to scale back monitoring and reporting regimes.

Impact on carbon management

The consequences for the emerging carbon management industry could be substantial. The current framework underpins almost everything from the actual measurement of CO2, to its transportation and storage. Carbon removal projects involving direct air capture and approaches focused on biomass power generation would also be affected.

Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, an organization spanning over 100 companies and organizations working in the industry said: “The EPA’s GHGRP, along with the Class VI injection well program, serves as the regulatory backbone of the carbon management industry, underpinning the integrity, transparency, and accountability of the 45Q tax credit in the United States.

…Carbon management project developers have already invested an estimated $77.5 billion in capital expenditures across the nation in existing and near-term projects. This amount is far more than the $2.4 billion in savings cited by EPA in their announcement ending 46 of the 47 subparts of the program. Relevant subparts of the GHGRP are mission-critical to the business plan for those projects and remain crucial components to electing the 45Q tax credit – ensuring that these projects and investments translate into corresponding jobs and additional economic benefits.”

Expected pushback

Critics have warned that eliminating much of the GHGRP would strip away transparency, obstruct scientific and policy planning, and weaken public accountability just as climate risks grow.

Meanwhile, business interests supporting national standards have said that certainty helps them plan investments, even amid regulatory uncertainty.

Public comment on the proposal will be open for 47 days after its publication in the Federal Register. Legal challenges could also be expected if the rule is finalized as proposed.

It remains to be seen whether the rule will be adapted after industry feedback or if reporting will be shifted towards individual states. The former would most likely slow down the adoption of rules and regulations while also hampering large-scale projects.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bernd-dittrich-lg2MPRWw2c4-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 06:59:54.364411

Mars confirmed that additional global agreements are in the pipeline to support the development of renewable energy projects that serve the company and its suppliers.
“For Mars, Renewable Acceleration is a performance accelerator, cutting emissions at a scale and speed we could never achieve through traditional value chain engagement approaches.
It lets us bring demand for all the electricity used in our value chain to the clean energy market in a highly efficient manner.”","Mars has teamed up with energy partner Enel as part of its sustainability programme, Renewable Acceleration, aiming to speed up the shift to clean energy across its entire value chain.

The initiative is designed to fuel the move away from fossil fuels by bringing the totality of Mars’ value chain’s electricity usage to the renewables market.

This involves sourcing renewable energy to cover everything from the farms that grow ingredients to the trucks that deliver products, and even the energy used by consumers at home to enjoy Mars products.

By implementing the Renewable Acceleration strategy, Mars said it could cut around 3 million tonnes of carbon emissions from its value chain – around 10% of its current total footprint.

Direct operations across the business globally use approximately 2 TWh of electricity each year, roughly the equivalent of the annual consumption of The Bahamas. However, when including the full Mars value chain under Renewables Acceleration to include its suppliers, customers and consumers, that number jumps to 8-9 TWh – the annual equivalent of Estonia.

The recently signed contract with Enel is the provider’s largest-ever power purchase agreement transaction with a commercial and industrial customer worldwide, as well as Mars’ largest contract to date.

Mars confirmed that additional global agreements are in the pipeline to support the development of renewable energy projects that serve the company and its suppliers.

According to the F&B giant, its first three contracts with Enel will generate a combined 1.8 TWh annually, avoiding approximately 700ktCO₂e per year. Mars will benefit from the entire output from Enel’s three solar plants in Texas, US. Vegetation across all three sites will be managed by sheep grazing, a dual-use solar practice that Enel expanded through the largest solar grazing agreement signed in the US.

Kevin Rabinovitch, global VP sustainability at Mars, said: “Many large companies are well on their way to sourcing renewable electricity for their own operations, but that’s just a part of the picture”.

Supply Chain Economic Impact Comprehensive four-pillar implementation generates profound supply chain transformation extending far beyond environmental compliance.","The global supply chain crisis has a hidden dimension that few executives fully grasp: The energy supply chain powering industrial operations worldwide remains largely carbon-intensive, creating unprecedented risks for companies committed to ESG goals. With 37.4 billion tonnes of annual CO₂ emissions and the power sector accounting for 40% of energy-related emissions, the thermal power generation presents the greatest supply chain and ESG related challenge.

Developing economies still depend heavily on thermal power generation for energy security and economic growth. For example, in India alone, coal-fired power plants generate over 60-70% of electricity, supporting industries that employ millions and provide essential services to 1.4 billion people. Similar dependencies exist across other developing countries, where thermal power remains the backbone of industrial development and poverty alleviation.

This creates the ""thermal power paradox"": the simultaneous need to maintain energy security while drastically reducing environmental impact.

The Supply Chain Reality Check

While supply chain leaders focus on optimizing logistics networks and supplier relationships, the fundamental energy infrastructure supporting industrial operations continues to generate massive environmental and operational risks. A typical 500 MW thermal power plant, the type powering major manufacturing hubs across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, represents a complex supply chain ecosystem requiring 15,000-25,000 tonnes of steel, 50,000 cubic meters of concrete, and coordination among hundreds of global suppliers.

Yet these same facilities release 3 million tonnes of CO₂ annually while consuming 2.5 billion gallons of water daily, creating cascading supply chain impacts, from increased healthcare costs and agricultural productivity losses, to infrastructure damage that disrupts regional logistics networks.

The Four-Pillar Transformation Framework

A systematic approach to transforming thermal power supply chains addresses both environmental imperatives and operational reliability. This four-pillar framework offers supply chain leaders a replicable methodology for engaging with energy suppliers on decarbonization while maintaining the reliability essential for industrial operations.

Pillar 1: Emissions Control Supply Chains

Advanced flue gas desulfurization (FGD) creates new material flows. FGD implementation transforms waste streams into supply chain assets. A single FGD installation prevents 30,000 tonnes of SOx emissions annually while generating 40,000 tonnes of synthetic gypsum — creating new revenue streams for wallboard manufacturing that can generate $5-8 million annually per unit.

The supply chain complexity is substantial: FGD projects require limestone procurement at 1.1-1.3 tonnes per tonne of SO₂ removed, creating ongoing supplier relationships with quarry operations while generating gypsum distribution networks that serve construction industry supply chains. This circular economy approach demonstrates how environmental compliance can enhance rather than burden supply chain economics.

Pillar 2: Renewable Integration Networks

Building diversified energy supply chains. Strategic renewable integration creates resilient energy supply chains that reduce single-source dependency while improving cost predictability. Solar PV integration — with costs declining 85% since 2010 — enables thermal facilities to optimize generation timing, operating during peak efficiency periods while solar handles midday demand.

The procurement implications are significant: A 100 MW solar installation requires coordination of photovoltaic modules, inverters, and electrical infrastructure across hundreds of acres, typically spanning 18-24 months from engineering to commissioning. Success depends on managing fragile component transportation and synchronizing electrical grid integration with multiple technology providers.

Pillar 3: Fuel Supply Chain Transformation

Parallel fuel systems enhance supply security. Rather than disruptive fuel switching that creates supply chain vulnerabilities, parallel fuel systems enable gradual transition while maintaining operational reliability. Natural gas integration alongside existing coal infrastructure provides 50% CO₂ reduction while preserving backup fuel options.

This approach requires sophisticated procurement strategies, including long-term gas contracts, storage capacity and transportation diversity. Implementation involves complete parallel infrastructure — pipeline connections, compression stations, and treatment systems — creating redundant fuel supply chains that optimize based on pricing, availability and environmental considerations.

Pillar 4: Water Resource Supply Chains

Ecological engineering reduces resource dependencies. Phytorid bed technology transforms wastewater treatment from resource-intensive operations into self-sustaining ecological systems. These nature-based solutions achieve superior treatment performance with 60-80% lower operating costs compared to conventional systems while eliminating chemical reagent supply chains.

Implementation requires minimal ongoing inputs: Periodic plant harvesting and substrate maintenance replace chemical procurement, mechanical equipment, and high energy consumption. The approach converts waste streams into productive ecosystems that sequester carbon while generating biomass for composting or biogas production.

Supply Chain Economic Impact

Comprehensive four-pillar implementation generates profound supply chain transformation extending far beyond environmental compliance. The economic model reveals attractive returns through multiple value streams:

Direct cost optimization. Fuel efficiency improvements reduce costs by 15-25%, creating annual savings of $15-30 million for a 500 MW facility. Combined with reduced water consumption and waste disposal costs, operational savings justify implementation investments.

New revenue streams. Byproduct sales from gypsum production, renewable energy sales during peak pricing, and biomass production create additional revenue totaling $8-15 million annually per facility — transforming environmental compliance from cost center to profit contributor.

Risk mitigation. Fuel diversification, environmental compliance and community acceptance reduce regulatory, market and social risks that translate to lower financing costs and higher asset valuations.

Implementation Methodology for Supply Chain Leaders

A staged approach minimizes disruption. Successful transformation requires parallel system development that maintains operational capability while building sustainable capacity. Rather than disruptive replacement, this approach enables gradual transition as new systems prove reliable.

The five-stage methodology begins with comprehensive baseline assessment, progresses through technology integration planning and parallel system development, enables gradual transition and optimization, and concludes with continuous improvement and scaling. Each stage maintains supply chain reliability while building transformation capability.

Stakeholder ecosystem development. Transformation projects catalyze development of supporting supply chain ecosystems that create regional economic development. FGD installations support local limestone mining and gypsum processing, while renewable integration creates demand for installation services and maintenance providers that develop capabilities transferable to other projects.

The Strategic Imperative

For supply chain leaders, the thermal power transformation represents both risk mitigation and competitive opportunity. Early movers gain advantages through reduced energy costs, enhanced ESG performance, and stronger stakeholder relationships. The question isn't whether transformation will occur — economic and regulatory forces ensure it will — but whether companies will lead or follow this supply chain evolution.

The four-pillar approach provides a framework for engaging energy suppliers on decarbonization while maintaining the reliability essential for industrial operations. With global energy transformation accelerating and ESG requirements tightening, proactive supply chain leaders can turn environmental challenges into competitive advantages through strategic energy supplier partnerships.",https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2023/12/01/COAL-POWER-PLANTS-iStock--kamilpetran--623296954.jpg?height=635&t=1701447272&width=1200,N,,2025-09-15 01:57:46.871562

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act incentives, which offered up to $7,500 in tax credits per EV, are set to expire on September 30. Analysts warn the move could sap demand and slow supply chain investments across the U.S. EV sector.

Compounding the challenge, a $4.3 billion Hyundai–LG battery plant in Georgia has been forced to push back its launch by at least two to three months after a federal immigration raid disrupted construction. The facility was expected to start supplying lithium-ion cells next year.

Hyundai and Kia are now leaning on hybrid vehicles to fill the gap. U.S. sales of their hybrids jumped nearly 48 percent year-on-year in the first eight months of 2025, reaching almost 200,000 units. But the vast majority of these cars are exported from South Korea, leaving them exposed to a steep 25 percent import tariff.

That tariff burden could grow more costly as Japan, Hyundai’s biggest hybrid rival in the U.S., prepares to secure a reduced 15 percent tariff under its trade terms with Washington. Toyota and Honda already dominate the U.S. hybrid market with a combined 68 percent share, while Hyundai and Kia trail at 12.3 percent.

Industry analysts warn the risk of a price reversal is real: Kia’s Sportage Hybrid, priced at $30,290, could overtake Toyota’s $32,850 RAV4 Hybrid if tariffs raise its sticker price to nearly $38,000, leaving Hyundai at a competitive disadvantage.

Hyundai is expected to outline a revised North America hybrid strategy at its upcoming CEO Investor Day. Market watchers say the company must emphasize durability, parts distribution, and service networks to reassure investors — and to fend off Japanese rivals poised to consolidate their lead in a post-subsidy market.

Solar projects are groups of solar panels used to harness energy from the sun, while wind projects include wind turbines, which are used to harness energy from the wind.
Tesdell’s solar projects generate about 75 percent of his electricity needs for his farmstead, including his house, barn, and well.
Lee Tesdell mentioned the use of agrivoltaics — defined as agricultural production underneath solar panels — as a way to further mitigate the amount of land solar projects take up.
Restrictions on foreign-made solar panels The news release also announced restrictions on panels “manufactured by foreign adversaries,” which could make solar projects more expensive.","The U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, will no longer fund renewable energy projects on prime farmland, according to an Aug. 19 news release. This will prevent farmers in Iowa from installing solar and wind projects on their land.

Solar projects are groups of solar panels used to harness energy from the sun, while wind projects include wind turbines, which are used to harness energy from the wind.

Lee Tesdell, a farmer located in Slater, Iowa, and a board member for the Center for Rural Affairs, has had solar projects on his land for 10 years. Starting with just an array of six panels, he has since added 24 additional panels. He called the USDA decision “terrible.”

“It’s a sad day when Washington wants to tell us that we can’t farm the wind, can’t farm the sun,” Tesdell said.

Tesdell said many farmers have good reasons to have renewable energy projects on their land — not only for financial reasons— but also because it is a“cleaner energy source” than fossil fuels.

“It makes all kinds of sense for [Iowans] to farm the sun and farm the wind, just like we farm the soil, right?” Tesdell said.

Tesdell’s solar projects generate about 75 percent of his electricity needs for his farmstead, including his house, barn, and well.

Tesdell also said he is “grid tied,” with his electric utility company, Consumers Energy Rural Electric Cooperative — meaning the amount of energy he overproduces goes into the energy grid, leading to a reduced bill each month.

He also has a net metering agreement with the cooperative, meaning compensation for overproduction comes at a retail rate instead of wholesale price, leading to a large difference in the payback each month.

Jennifer Studebaker, interim executive director at the Women, Food, and Agriculture Network, or WFAN, described the decision as unfortunate. She said it will become costly to all Iowans if farmers are no longer able to build wind and solar projects contributing to the energy grid.

Studebaker elaborated on the financial benefit farmers can get, especially if they sell the energy they generate.

“For farmers, that $10,000 or so difference in terms of costs, that’s sometimes, if they get to keep their farm, in terms of the security that that can offer,” she said.

Emma Colman, organizing representative of the Sierra Club’s Iowa Chapter, an environmental nonprofit, said the move represents a lack of understanding of rural America.

“It is a testament to how little our current federal administration understands our state and local communities,” she said. “It ultimately is just taking power out of the hands of our communities, and that’s really disappointing.”

She said farmers should be able to make their own decisions on their property because solar and wind projects allow farmers to make a better living, and are another form of farming.

Chris Hoffman, a member of the Johnson County Solar Task Force, has been in the solar industry for 12 years. He said the federal administration has been clear they do not want to move toward cleaner energy initiatives.

“In reality, the administration just doesn’t want renewable energy projects,” Hoffman said. “This is probably a dug-up excuse for not doing so.”

Prime farmland in Iowa

According to the Clean Grid Alliance, 5,755 out of 30,000,000 acres of Iowa farmland house solar projects, which amounts to less than one percent of total farmland.

The alliance also found 17.5 million out of Iowa’s 30 million acres are considered “prime farmland,” which is defined by the USDA as “land that has the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops and is available for these uses.”

U.S. Rep. Mike Bost, R-IL, sees these projects as taking up too much farmland, therefore limiting the amount of food that is grown to feed Americans.

“We shouldn’t be subsidizing solar projects on prime farmland; that land is too valuable for producing the food and fuel our nation depends on,” Bost said in the news release.

Lee Tesdell mentioned the use of agrivoltaics — defined as agricultural production underneath solar panels — as a way to further mitigate the amount of land solar projects take up. For example, he has set up a fence around his panels and allowed his sheep to graze underneath them, which he said works nicely.

He disagrees with the argument that solar and wind projects take up too much space, and said solar and agriculture can work well together in this way.

“It’s kind of a bogus argument to be honest,” Tesdell said.

Studebaker also brought up agrivoltaics as an alternative to the lack of space argument.

“What I really see as a missed opportunity by the Trump administration is recognizing that you can have renewable energy and sustainable farming working together,” she said.

Environmental impacts of wind and solar projects

Peter Thorne, an environmental professor at the University of Iowa, said solar and wind projects have little negative effect on the land they are built on. Though he mentioned farmland less than ideal for growing crops — not considered “prime farmland” by USDA standards, including land located by streams and rivers — may be a proper place for wind and solar projects.

“We really need to be thinking more smartly about how we use Iowa’s land,” Thorne said. “I think the focus should really be on carefully taking land out of production, that is, this vulnerable land, that’s erodible.”

He explained solar and wind projects, a form of clean energy, are better for the environment than fossil fuels.

“The science all points to the need for clean energy, both in terms of it being the best for the health of the ecology and human health, and also in terms of energy independence,” Thorne said. “We know that fossil fuels are going to run out, and that they are responsible for a lot of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and deaths.”

Studebaker said there are ways for farmers to mitigate any potential impacts projects could have on farmland.

“If you’re worried about erosion or movement of water, there are different things you can do in terms of planting certain types of native plants to block that and absorb more of the water,” she said.

Colman said limiting solar and wind projects will harm the land, as farmers will have to resort to using fossil fuels. She added that energy demand in Iowa and across the world is going up, and that the state must adapt to meet that demand.

“The reality is, if they aren’t investing in renewables, energy efficiency, and battery storage, then they’re going to be building new gas and coal plants across our state — and are those good for the farmland?”

It is unclear if projects on poorly graded land will continue to be approved, as the new restrictions only pointed to protection of prime farmland.

Restrictions on foreign-made solar panels

The news release also announced restrictions on panels “manufactured by foreign adversaries,” which could make solar projects more expensive.

According to the International Energy Agency, China is responsible for over 80 percent of the production of solar panels worldwide.

Studebaker said she expects this to affect farmers’ ability to purchase and install solar panels, even if the project isn’t on prime farmland.

“There may be a few US companies, but I don’t think we have the domestic industry to allow for people to buy solar panels, and especially at an affordable cost,” she said. “The ones [solar panels] being produced in China are probably the most affordable for farmers.”

David Bader, press secretary for U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Grassley will continue to “review the regulation to ensure the U.S. continues to pursue a strategy that supports farmers while increasing our energy savings.”",https://dailyiowan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_09_11_WindTurbine_GD_008.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 00:58:29.089976

But the sun continues to shine, and in Evanston, residents continue to install rooftop panels to turn that into electricity.

It was a year ago when Libby Hillinstalled 12 rooftop solar panels on her northwest Evanston home. We met up again in late August to find out how those panels are doing.

Hill pulled out her phone and showed us that the system had produced 6.18 megawatt hours of power since they were installed. She has paid for extra electricity just once, when midsummer heat made air conditioning unavoidable. Otherwise, she’s been paying just $19.54 a month, the minimum that ComEd charges for connecting to the grid.

She relishes checking the SolarEdge app that tracks electricity production, especially on a clear day when the panels are at their most productive. Even when she’s out of the country, she checks to see whether it’s sunny enough at home to keep the solar power humming.

But the point Hill wanted to emphasize is that she’s not alone. She mentioned several nearby houses with rooftop solar installations, and when she walked around later to confirm, she found even more.

Big trees rule out rooftop solar in many parts of Evanston. But “in my neck of the Evanston woods, I find I’m in good company,” she said. Within a few blocks, she found 12 other solar installations on houses that vary in age and style.

“Homeowners have found suitable locations for panels on house roofs to garages, sometimes sandwiched into the space where the sun reaches on an otherwise tree-shaded roof,” she reported. “Panel-covered roofs face south, east, west and in one case north, and in another case three sides of the roof except north. On my sunny late morning walk, the sun was shining on all.”

Permit applications from the City of Evanston confirm that what she’s observed in her neighborhood reflects a broader pattern. From January 2019 through August of this year, the city issued 409 permits for residential solar installations. For the five years that began in January 2019, the average number of applications per year was 60. Applications rose to 70 in 2022, the year the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law and federal tax credits for solar went into effect.

Act fast for federal tax savings

Now that the Trump administration’s budget bill has dismantled much of the IRA, tax credits for rooftop solar will expire at the end of this year instead of continuing through 2035.

Groups like Rewiring America are urging people to act fast, offering tips like this guide to using tax credits before they’re gone. Electric vehicle credits also expire at the end of September. Rooftop solar installations have to be complete and connected to the grid by Dec. 31 to qualify. (Check EnergySage for other available incentives.)

Even with these credits expiring, solar energy will remain a “hedge against utility rates, which have climbed high in recent years and are expected to rise even further as data centers demand more energy and the Trump administration stymies cheap wind and solar power,” Dan McCarthy writes for Canary Media. “Most households that install rooftop solar see their energy bills drop.”

Saving money isn’t the main consideration for everyone, Hill pointed out, and those who can afford the up-front cost have other important reasons to go solar: “People do it because it’s a good thing to do,” she said.

‘Benign and beautiful way to produce energy‘

Bill McKibben, the author of a 1989 book that raised public alarm about the perils of human-caused climate change, is spearheading plans for Sun Day on Sunday, Sept. 21. The event, a revival of sorts of the first Sun Day in 1978, which Hill remembers fondly, will be celebrated locally with events in Wilmette and at Montrose Beach in Chicago. (Find out more here.)

As McKibben said in a recent interview: “The sudden explosion of solar and wind energy over the last three years is the first time we’ve had anything that’s really started to scale in a way that might make a difference in how hot the planet eventually gets. … We have a benign, indeed, a beautiful way to produce energy, energy from heaven, not from hell.”

Drop by the Sept. 21 Sun Day event at Montrose Beach: “Over 30 groups — from solar installers and nonprofits to justice organizations and houses of worship — will share fun, easy ways to go solar, including community solar that can save you 15–20% on your electric bill.”

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?” AP",https://www.communicationstoday.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US-power-grids-strain-under-data-center-boom-forcing-strategy-shift.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 01:57:55.204424

Installed renewable capacity is expanding at record speed, spanning solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and nuclear. Yet, the true test is not how much we add, but how fully and efficiently we use what is already generated. Unless every kilowatt-hour is delivered at the lowest cost and highest reliability, capacity growth will remain a hollow statistic.

The vision must be uncompromising: Power for all Indians, of the highest quality and lowest cost. Reliable electricity is not just a household need but the foundation of industrial growth, digital expansion, agricultural productivity, and social equity. Delivering clean, uninterrupted power at globally competitive costs is both an economic imperative and a national commitment—essential to India’s prosperity and resilience.

Principles for Transformation

Eliminate power waste: Every photon, gust, or drop converted into electricity must find productive use. Curtailment of renewable energy, still common in several states, undermines both abundance and investor confidence.

Manage surges and shortfalls: AI-driven forecasting, storage, and flexible demand response can smooth out fluctuations. Without such integration, renewable power will remain prone to waste and unreliability.

End tariff distortions: Cross-subsidies discourage efficiency and deter investment. Replacing them with direct benefit transfers (DBT) to vulnerable households ensures transparent, cost-reflective tariffs that attract capital while protecting the poor.

Global standard maintenance: Poor operation and maintenance (O&M) increases outages and costs. Preventive maintenance—using AI, IoT, and drones—must replace reactive fixes, ensuring turbines, substations, and feeders meet global reliability benchmarks.

Full utilisation of assets: Idle plants and stranded assets cannot coexist with power shortages. A national dispatch system with real-time monitoring and strict merit-order discipline will ensure every plant contributes optimally.

AI-led optimisation: Artificial intelligence must permeate every function—demand forecasting, frequency regulation, market clearing, and predictive maintenance—to orchestrate a dynamic, reliable grid.

Policy Circle is now on WhatsApp. Click here to join the channel

Reach the last hamlet: Distributed microgrids—solar, mini-hydro, and biomass—must complement national transmission networks, ensuring no community is left without power.

Regional energy diplomacy: South Asia’s power future is interdependent. Hydro imports from Nepal and Bhutan, natural gas and biogas from neighbours, and cross-border grid connections with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka can create a resilient regional bloc.

Abundance as justice: The goal is not just adequacy but justice—clean, uninterrupted, affordable power delivered at globally competitive costs to every citizen.

Strategic pillars of action

Transmission: A multi-terminal HVDC overlay grid linking Rajasthan, Gujarat, Ladakh, and Tamil Nadu directly to industrial centres is essential. The 500 GW transmission expansion must be fast-tracked and monitored transparently. Cross-border HVDC interconnections will add resilience.

Market reform: Market-Based Economic Dispatch (MBED) with five-minute settlements can lower system costs. Breaking state-level scheduling silos and guaranteeing transparent curtailment compensation are critical to investor trust.

Storage and flexibility: India needs to auction at least 100 GWh of storage annually, spanning batteries and pumped hydro. Storage must be treated as infrastructure, paid for its availability and ramping services. Aligning time-of-day tariffs with renewable peaks will drive efficiency.

Tariff and subsidy reform: Direct benefit transfers can replace opaque subsidies, while national tariff rationalisation ensures fairness and stability. Cost-reflective tariffs will also align investor expectations with consumer protection.

Policy Circle is now on Telegram. Click here to join the channel.

Digital and AI orchestration: An AI-led system operator, backed by a national digital twin of the grid, can optimise dispatch and forecast demand. Real-time, open-access data will spur innovation from startups and utilities alike.

Maintenance excellence: Utilities must adopt ISO 55000-compliant asset management and global preventive O&M standards. Drones and robotics can make inspections continuous, reducing outages and costs.

Regional energy diplomacy: Hydro imports from Bhutan and Nepal should be locked into long-term contracts. India must lead in creating a South Asian Power Pool and regional green gas market, positioning itself as the anchor.

Universal access: Distributed renewable microgrids and prepaid meters must integrate rural consumers into digital markets. Reliable 24×7 power should be treated as a constitutional right.

Governance and finance architecture

A National Renewable Evacuation and Optimisation Mission (NREOM) should take single-point responsibility for integration. Financing must draw on PGCIL InvITs, sovereign green bonds, and blended finance to mobilise over $100 billion annually. Contracts must be outcome-based, with strict penalties for delays.

If executed with urgency, India can:

Eliminate renewable curtailment by 2030.

Deliver the world’s lowest cost per kilowatt-hour, anchored in efficiency.

Guarantee reliable 24×7 power to every household.

Become a net exporter of clean power, stabilising South Asia’s grid.

Lead in AI-optimised grid operations, proving industrialisation can be decoupled from carbon emissions.

Clean energy: From vision to execution

India has pledged 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030 and Net Zero by 2070. These numbers inspire confidence, but they risk becoming hollow milestones if generation is wasted, if tariffs remain distorted, and if assets are left idle. The challenge now is to turn capacity into capability—power that is fully utilised, efficiently dispatched, and equitably shared.

The first step is to eliminate systemic inefficiencies: end renewable curtailment, replace cross-subsidies with direct benefit transfers, and enforce cost-reflective tariffs. At the same time, AI-enabled optimisation must become the backbone of grid management, predicting demand, regulating frequency, and enabling market-based dispatch. Maintenance must move from reactive repair to global-standard preventive care, ensuring every plant and transmission line operates at peak efficiency.

Equally vital is the extension of abundance to every household. Distributed microgrids, supported by digital tokens and prepaid meters, can bring the remotest villages into real-time power markets. Cross-border connections with Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka can anchor a resilient South Asian energy bloc, positioning India as both provider and stabiliser.

This is not simply an energy strategy. It is a civilisational pledge—to deliver clean, affordable, uninterrupted power as a basic right of citizenship, to build competitiveness for industry, and to secure regional leadership. The test of ambition lies not in setting targets but in ensuring that no unit of power is wasted and no citizen is left in the dark.:",https://www.policycircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/green-bonds.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 21:59:46.896683

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act incentives, which offered up to $7,500 in tax credits per EV, are set to expire on September 30. Analysts warn the move could sap demand and slow supply chain investments across the U.S. EV sector.

Compounding the challenge, a $4.3 billion Hyundai–LG battery plant in Georgia has been forced to push back its launch by at least two to three months after a federal immigration raid disrupted construction. The facility was expected to start supplying lithium-ion cells next year.

Hyundai and Kia are now leaning on hybrid vehicles to fill the gap. U.S. sales of their hybrids jumped nearly 48 percent year-on-year in the first eight months of 2025, reaching almost 200,000 units. But the vast majority of these cars are exported from South Korea, leaving them exposed to a steep 25 percent import tariff.

That tariff burden could grow more costly as Japan, Hyundai’s biggest hybrid rival in the U.S., prepares to secure a reduced 15 percent tariff under its trade terms with Washington. Toyota and Honda already dominate the U.S. hybrid market with a combined 68 percent share, while Hyundai and Kia trail at 12.3 percent.

Industry analysts warn the risk of a price reversal is real: Kia’s Sportage Hybrid, priced at $30,290, could overtake Toyota’s $32,850 RAV4 Hybrid if tariffs raise its sticker price to nearly $38,000, leaving Hyundai at a competitive disadvantage.

Hyundai is expected to outline a revised North America hybrid strategy at its upcoming CEO Investor Day. Market watchers say the company must emphasize durability, parts distribution, and service networks to reassure investors — and to fend off Japanese rivals poised to consolidate their lead in a post-subsidy market.

Fleet deployment target is the largest announced to date for Advanced Modular Reactors in the U.K. and could generate at least $54 billion in economic activity, creating thousands of high-quality jobs.

Deployed new nuclear capacity is set to make a significant contribution to the next wave of clean, secure electricity and high temperature heat for industry and manufacturing.

Centrica plc (“Centrica”) and X-Energy, LLC (“X-energy”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of X-Energy Reactor Company, LLC, today announced their entry into a Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) to deploy X-energy’s Xe-100 Advanced Modular Reactors (“AMR”) in the United Kingdom. The companies have identified EDF and Centrica’s Hartlepool site as the preferred first site for a planned U.K. fleet of up to 6 gigawatts.

The agreement represents the first stage in a new trans-Atlantic alliance which could ultimately mobilize at least $54 billion in economic value to bring clean, safe and affordable power to thousands of homes and industries across the country and substantive work for the domestic and global supply chain.

A 12-unit Xe-100 deployment at Hartlepool could add up to 960 megawatts (“MW”) of new capacity, enough clean power for 1.5 million homes and over $15 billion in lifetime economic value. It would be developed at a site adjacent to Hartlepool’s existing nuclear power station which is currently scheduled to cease generating electricity in 2028. Following its decommissioning, new reactors would accelerate opportunities for the site and its skilled workforce. The site is already designated for new nuclear under the Government’s National Policy Statement and a new plant would also play a critical role in generating high-temperature heat that could support Teesside’s heavy industries.

Centrica will provide initial project capital for development with the goal of initiating full-scale activities in 2026. Subject to regulatory approval, the first electricity generation would be expected in the mid-2030s. Centrica and X-energy are already in discussions with additional potential equity partners, as well as leading global engineering and construction companies, with the goal of establishing a UK-based development company to develop this first and subsequent projects.

Chris O’Shea, CEO of Centrica said:

“Centrica is proud to be at the forefront of Britain’s clean energy transition - investing in infrastructure and jobs that meet today’s energy needs while enabling tomorrow’s ambitions. Our partnership with X-energy marks a bold step forward in delivering advanced nuclear technology that is not only scalable and secure, but also vital to clean industry and powering homes. The Xe-100 fleet will help build a resilient energy system that supports national security, affordability, and sustainability. From Sizewell C to Hartlepool, we are backing Britain’s energy future - and building it.”

J. Clay Sell, CEO of X-energy said:

“Our partnership with Centrica represents a commitment to bring X-energy's industry-leading advanced nuclear technology to the U.K. at scale. Together, we aim to build a fleet that has the ability to reliably deliver clean power, strengthen energy security, and grow the trans-Atlantic economy for decades to come. We believe Hartlepool is the right place to begin this journey, with an established industry and a base of professionals and services who can help drive the next generation of nuclear forward.”

In 2021 the U.K.’s Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) identified High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs) as the most promising advanced technology for demonstration. In 2025 X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear completed a number of year-long assessments, co-funded by DESNZ’s ‘Future Nuclear Enabling Fund’, to support the commercial deployment of Xe-100s in the U.K. Discussions are now underway with Government regarding the “route to market” in the UK, consistent with the principles set out in June for supporting privately led projects. The Government’s ongoing work to create a clear and credible pathway is instrumental in making the UK an attractive destination for investment in advanced modular reactors. Support for initial projects, and those that follow, will be decisive in unlocking the full potential of advanced nuclear for Britain’s energy future.

U.K. Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband said:

“This cross-Atlantic partnership demonstrates the transformative potential for the British people of US and UK businesses joining forces, with X-Energy and Centrica’s planned first project alone having the potential to create up to 2,500 good, skilled jobs, add £12 billion in economic value and generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes. By working with the US, we will reap the benefits of this golden age of nuclear, powering British homes with clean, homegrown energy, delivering well-paid skilled jobs and getting energy bills down for good.”

United States Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said:

“With President Trump’s leadership, the United States is ushering in a true nuclear renaissance – harnessing the power of commercial nuclear to meet rising energy demand and fuel the AI revolution. Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators. Today’s commercial deals set up a framework to unleash commercial access in both the U.S. and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening U.S. energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.”

Simone Rossi, CEO of EDF in the UK, said:

“As part of its role to enable further new nuclear development in the UK, EDF welcomes the interest by Centrica and X-Energy in Hartlepool as the first site to develop this technology, and we will support the development plans as they evolve.”

Factors such as upfront costs and access to charging are among significant barriers to “mass adoption” of the technology, the AA said.

A survey by the motoring organisation indicated that some drivers are also concerned about battery health and the resale value of EVs.

The AA has launched an “EV readiness index” aimed at reflecting how practical and appealing EV ownership is.

Its initial rating of 47.5 out of 100 was based on factors such as:

– The average cost of a new EV across four models analysed being 27% higher than their petrol equivalents.

– Home charging being 22% more expensive per mile than petrol equivalents when the average cost of financing a home charger over a one-year period is included.

– Broken down EVs being more likely to be fixed at the roadside than petrol or diesel vehicles.

The index will be updated every three months.

The AA called for the Government to encourage more people to switch to electric motoring by considering targeted incentives for used EVs and reducing VAT for public on-street charging.

Edmund King, AA president, described the recently introduced electric car grant – which reduces the cost of some new EVs by up to £3,750 – as a “welcome boost” but warned “we need to go further to make EVs a realistic choice for all drivers”.

He said: “Drivers tell us they’re excited about going electric and they love the tech, but they’re also confused and cautious.

“Our index shows that upfront costs and charging access are still major concerns.

“Our polling also suggests battery health and resale values are still issues for some.

“Our index is an independent barometer of the issues that are either holding drivers back or propelling drivers to go electric.

“We are confident that the readiness rating will increase with more chargers, less expensive products, targeted incentives and better information.”

The Government has pledged to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2030.

Battery EVs held a 26.5% share of the new car market in August, which was the highest monthly level this year.

A total of 4.1% of all licensed cars in the UK were fully electric as of the end of March.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “We recognise the nervousness of some drivers to go electric, which is why our electric car grant is slashing prices for consumers, giving drivers across the UK access to new electric cars for less – with 35 models now eligible.

“This £650 million scheme is helping families make the switch to cleaner cars while putting money back into the pockets of working people.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3.OTEaPbntJAY7yy93Gxgw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_uk_120/73e7302fe950e216d61bdaf2e8e5e9c8,N,,2025-09-14 19:59:51.297836

The money will bolster the Government’s UK SHORE programme for investing in low-carbon innovation for the maritime industry. This initiative was first launched in March 2022 with an initial budget of up to £206m.

A total of £240m has been allocated through the programme to date, benefitting 200 projects across the UK, including scientific research, factory trials, real-world demonstrations and commercial trials.

The Government claims the investment has also unlocked a further £110m in direct private investment.

Previously supported projects have included the installation of electric charging points at ports for vessels. These are now in place at Cammell Laird dry dock at Birkenhead in Liverpool and various locations across the South Coast and London.

UK SHORE has also supported innovations in low-carbon hydrogen production, ammonia and methanol-based fuels and wingsail attachments for boats.

Domestic transport accounts for around 28% of the UK’s terrestrial emissions footprint. Shipping accounts for around one-fifth of that.

Private investment

Further to the Department for Transport’s funding, the UK Government has confirmed that £700m of private investments will be confirmed on the first day of London International Shipping Week this Monday (15 September).

Peel Ports will invest £300m in modernising its Liverpool, Hunterston and Great Yarmouth ports. A further £150m has been pledged by the operators of the Port of Tyne, largely to accommodate new offshore wind and manufacturing facilities.

NatPower Marine will invest £250m in shore-side power in the UK, which it claims will support more than 2,000 skilled jobs in engineering, construction, and green technology services.

The announcements come shortly after the UK Government consulted on proposed changes to the planning process for ports. Ministers want to make it easier and faster for port owners and operators to expand in order to support nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs), like large offshore wind farms.

Fleet deployment target is the largest announced to date for Advanced Modular Reactors in the U.K. and could generate at least $54 billion in economic activity, creating thousands of high-quality jobs.

Deployed new nuclear capacity is set to make a significant contribution to the next wave of clean, secure electricity and high temperature heat for industry and manufacturing.

LONDON, September 14, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Centrica plc (""Centrica"") and X-Energy, LLC (""X-energy""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of X-Energy Reactor Company, LLC, today announced their entry into a Joint Development Agreement (""JDA"") to deploy X-energy’s Xe-100 Advanced Modular Reactors (""AMR"") in the United Kingdom. The companies have identified EDF and Centrica’s Hartlepool site as the preferred first site for a planned U.K. fleet of up to 6 gigawatts.

The agreement represents the first stage in a new trans-Atlantic alliance which could ultimately mobilize at least $54 billion in economic value to bring clean, safe and affordable power to thousands of homes and industries across the country and substantive work for the domestic and global supply chain.

A 12-unit Xe-100 deployment at Hartlepool could add up to 960 megawatts (""MW"") of new capacity, enough clean power for 1.5 million homes and over $15 billion in lifetime economic value. It would be developed at a site adjacent to Hartlepool’s existing nuclear power station which is currently scheduled to cease generating electricity in 2028. Following its decommissioning, new reactors would accelerate opportunities for the site and its skilled workforce. The site is already designated for new nuclear under the Government’s National Policy Statement and a new plant would also play a critical role in generating high-temperature heat that could support Teesside’s heavy industries.

Centrica will provide initial project capital for development with the goal of initiating full-scale activities in 2026. Subject to regulatory approval, the first electricity generation would be expected in the mid-2030s. Centrica and X-energy are already in discussions with additional potential equity partners, as well as leading global engineering and construction companies, with the goal of establishing a UK-based development company to develop this first and subsequent projects.

Chris O’Shea, CEO of Centrica said:

""Centrica is proud to be at the forefront of Britain’s clean energy transition - investing in infrastructure and jobs that meet today’s energy needs while enabling tomorrow’s ambitions. Our partnership with X-energy marks a bold step forward in delivering advanced nuclear technology that is not only scalable and secure, but also vital to clean industry and powering homes. The Xe-100 fleet will help build a resilient energy system that supports national security, affordability, and sustainability. From Sizewell C to Hartlepool, we are backing Britain’s energy future - and building it.""

J. Clay Sell, CEO of X-energy said:

""Our partnership with Centrica represents a commitment to bring X-energy's industry-leading advanced nuclear technology to the U.K. at scale. Together, we aim to build a fleet that has the ability to reliably deliver clean power, strengthen energy security, and grow the trans-Atlantic economy for decades to come. We believe Hartlepool is the right place to begin this journey, with an established industry and a base of professionals and services who can help drive the next generation of nuclear forward.""

In 2021 the U.K.’s Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) identified High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs) as the most promising advanced technology for demonstration. In 2025 X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear completed a number of year-long assessments, co-funded by DESNZ’s ‘Future Nuclear Enabling Fund’, to support the commercial deployment of Xe-100s in the U.K. Discussions are now underway with Government regarding the ""route to market"" in the UK, consistent with the principles set out in June for supporting privately led projects. The Government’s ongoing work to create a clear and credible pathway is instrumental in making the UK an attractive destination for investment in advanced modular reactors. Support for initial projects, and those that follow, will be decisive in unlocking the full potential of advanced nuclear for Britain’s energy future.

U.K. Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband said:

""This cross-Atlantic partnership demonstrates the transformative potential for the British people of US and UK businesses joining forces, with X-Energy and Centrica’s planned first project alone having the potential to create up to 2,500 good, skilled jobs, add £12 billion in economic value and generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes. By working with the US, we will reap the benefits of this golden age of nuclear, powering British homes with clean, homegrown energy, delivering well-paid skilled jobs and getting energy bills down for good.""

United States Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said:

""With President Trump’s leadership, the United States is ushering in a true nuclear renaissance – harnessing the power of commercial nuclear to meet rising energy demand and fuel the AI revolution. Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators. Today’s commercial deals set up a framework to unleash commercial access in both the U.S. and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening U.S. energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.""

Simone Rossi, CEO of EDF in the UK, said:

""As part of its role to enable further new nuclear development in the UK, EDF welcomes the interest by Centrica and X-Energy in Hartlepool as the first site to develop this technology, and we will support the development plans as they evolve.""

""It's really important that remote communities get a say in where their power comes from,"" Mr Schoenemann adds.
In Djarindjin, his company Amboranj Power is building a solar and battery power station, which will be locally- and publicly-owned.
For her, making sure remote residents have access to reliable, renewable power is about energy justice and equity.
""We've got technology that could really help lower people's energy costs,"" she notes.","Dark, rolling skies always trigger memories of disaster for Kathleen Walker.

She was one of 300 residents evacuated by helicopter from Wujal Wujal, in Queensland's far north, as Tropical Cyclone Jasper crossed the coast unleashing unprecedented floods in December 2023.

""When I see black clouds, I still have a trauma,"" she tells AAP.

Her community was left without power and unable to return to their homes for months.

Being away from home took a toll on the tight-knit group of residents yet it was also the eventual catalyst in fulfilling their decades-long dream of launching Wujal Wujal's own solar microgrid and battery system.

The project was an idea that had come from her husband and uncle some 20 years earlier, Ms Walker says.

They had both wanted to bring renewable energy to the small community as it had long struggled through power outages and other reliability issues.

Ms Walker says the microgrid will alleviate some of the still existing anxiety about being left without power.

""I am so proud and I am so glad that I get to see this thing go ahead,"" she says.

Richard Schoenemann has been working with Wujal Wujal since 2019 to make its dream a reality.

His company, Volt Advisory, needed to consult closely with the local Jabalbina Corporation and Elders to develop the project, he says, because they knew what they needed.

""It's really important that remote communities get a say in where their power comes from,"" Mr Schoenemann adds.

""It will actually work out better in the long run.""

Community is also at the heart of what Bard man Patrick Greechan is doing in Western Australia's Kimberley region.

In Djarindjin, his company Amboranj Power is building a solar and battery power station, which will be locally- and publicly-owned.

Aalga Goorlil, known as the sun turtle project, aims to lower costs, emissions and dependence on non-renewable energy.

""Renewables are a great vehicle to create financial security so that these communities can then pick which way the benefits go,"" Mr Greechan says.

""They can give themselves cheaper power, they can pay themselves in dividends, they can use the income to create other projects for the community, purchase other assets.""

He is also working on a solar and battery system for health clinic in Warburton, a remote Indigenous community on the Great Central Road, just south of the Gibson Desert.

It suffered 13 power outages in 2024 alone, impacting dialysis machines and emergency room facilities.

As Australia finds itself in a renewable energy boom, Mr Greechan reckons it's important isolated communities are empowered to decide what is best for them.

That's why he launched Amboranj, to make sure the people of the Kimberley aren't left behind and do have a voice in the projects developed on their Country.

""Any entities wishing to go into this space, need to understand that this is the opportunity to create economic prosperity,"" he says.

""If they could look at that versus their bottom line it saves the government, saves the taxpayer and creates so much ownership and pride within the community.""

Jaru and Gidja woman Ruby Heard, says as companies start to develop renewables in remote Australia, it's also important to make sure residents are educated about what might be best for them.

""There's predatory installers that go out to remote places, Indigenous communities and they are trying to sell second-rate technologies at high prices into to our households,"" she warns.

""It's, it's preying on people and they're not always aware that the technology is not leading technology and that the costs are too high.""

Ms Heard started Alinga Energy Consulting after volunteering for engineers without borders, building microgrids in communities Ethiopia without access to reliable energy.

She realised many remote communities in Australia could also benefit and were often being excluded from innovations like rooftop solar due to cost and distance.

For her, making sure remote residents have access to reliable, renewable power is about energy justice and equity.

""We've got technology that could really help lower people's energy costs,"" she notes.

""What we're finding is these benefits are being really unequally distributed because it's very cost-driven and for people living in remote areas, the costs are higher to get them connected.""

The bottom line for First Nations Clean Energy Network co-chair Karrina Nolan, is everyone deserves access to power and every community should have homes that are climate resilient.

Remote settlements across the country are making strides in renewables; getting involved in solar, wind, battery and hydro power projects while advocating for policy changes and funding to ensure the best possible outcomes for First Nations people.

While welcoming the federal government's commitments to implementing the First Nations Clean Energy Strategy, Ms Nolan says there's more work to be done to get the transition right.

""Some of our communities are living in extremely vulnerable conditions,"" she says.

""This is an opportunity to retrofit these households, upgrade them, get energy efficient appliances into them, put solar on the roof or next door in a microgrid.

""That makes them climate resilient, cheaper, more livable and cuts a whole heap of social and health costs.""",https://cdn.nit.com.au/storage/6YkcdWTmTb7gBBJLU0RVt36PCLU1I80p3ISJvD01.jpg?size=featured,N,,2025-09-14 18:59:57.965457

The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies.
This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.
The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.
""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement.","The Trump administration has unveiled a pilot program to accelerate the use of electric air taxis, a move aimed at establishing U.S. dominance in airspace technology.

The Department of Transportation on Friday said the Federal Aviation Administration's Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) will develop ""new frameworks and regulations for enabling safe operations"" and form partnerships with private sector companies as well as with state and local governments.

""The next great technological revolution in aviation is here,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement on Friday. ""The United States will lead the way, and doing so will cement America's status as a global leader in transportation innovation. That means more high-paying manufacturing jobs and economic opportunity.""

The program will include at least five pilot projects and will run for three years after the first project is up and running, the department said. The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies. The aircraft will also be used to test their effectiveness in emergency situations, such as airlift and medical transport.

The program would allow the testing of aircraft both unmanned and piloted, and which may be capable of carrying passengers, before they complete FAA certification, a process that can take years. Aircraft must have FAA certification before carrying cargo or passengers when flying commercially, according to federal regulations.

This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.

In June 2023, the FAA greenlit a plan from Joby Aviation, a California-based aviation company, to begin test flights of an electric flying taxi prototype. The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.

""We've spent more than 15 years building the aircraft technology and operational capabilities that are defining advanced aerial mobility, and we're ready to bring our services to communities,"" Joby's chief policy officer Greg Bowles said in a statement. ""We look forward to demonstrating our aircraft's maturity and delivering early operations in cities and states nationwide.""

Another company, Archer Aviation, also said Friday that it plans to participate in the program.

Failing to take action to cut transport emissions in this way could see Australia miss its 2050 net-zero target, Electric Vehicle Council chief executive Julie Delvecchio said.
The findings showed the tax cut was making electric cars accessible to a wider group of people, National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association chief executive Rohan Martin said, including workers who would not have otherwise been able to switch from a petrol or diesel car.
“The electric car discount is popular with families on middle incomes who live in the outer suburbs,” he said.
The federal tax cut and state-based registration discounts should be replaced, the commission said, by greater support for car-charging infrastructure.","The modelling comes after the Productivity Commission called on the federal government to scrap the tax break, calling it a duplicative and expensive policy.

It also follows national debate over the introduction of a road-user tax to be levied on electric vehicle drivers, and after several states, including NSW, Victoria and Queensland, removed rebates for their purchase.

The research, prepared by Magenta Advisory, investigated the fringe-benefits tax exemption introduced in July 2022 that cut the price of electric cars purchased through novated leases.

It found the tax cut could help to put an additional 1.5 million electric cars on Australian roads if extended until 2035, and had already aided in the purchase of 105,000 more EVs between 2022 and 2024.

An additional 200,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles could hit the roads in Australia by 2035 if they were allowed back into the scheme, the modelling found, and could contribute to a growing second-hand market by adding 870,000 low-emission cars.

Allowing the scheme to run until 2035 would also cut transport emissions by 50 per cent more than if the tax exemption was removed in 2027 when it is due to be reviewed, the report said.

Failing to take action to cut transport emissions in this way could see Australia miss its 2050 net-zero target, Electric Vehicle Council chief executive Julie Delvecchio said.

“With transport on track to be Australia’s largest emitting sector, incentives like the EV discount are critical to hitting our climate goals,” she said.

“Keeping this support until 2035 and bringing back plug-in hybrids into the scheme could deliver hundreds of thousands more new and second-hand EVs, making them affordable for more households.”

Electric car purchases under the scheme had been most popular in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane suburbs between 30km and 44km outside city centres, the analysis found, and to drivers on incomes between $90,000 and $120,000.

With EV adoption on the rise and regulatory scrutiny intensifying, insurers and policyholders alike are navigating uncharted territory.","Auto insurance in Michigan—and across the nation—has always been a hot topic, but recent events and new data are pushing it right back into the spotlight. On September 12, 2025, CURE Auto Insurance, a New Jersey-based insurer, agreed to pay a Troy, Michigan man $75,000 for a claim on his wrecked 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee. This payout came only after the company initially denied the claim, canceled his policy, auctioned off the SUV, and kept the proceeds, according to reporting by The Detroit News.

But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The same day, Anita Fox, director of the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services, issued a strongly worded bulletin warning insurers against what she called ""improper"" and ""abusive practices."" While Fox's bulletin didn't name specific companies, the timing and details echoed the very practices CURE Auto Insurance is accused of in the Troy man's case and in other lawsuits. Fox's message was clear: ""Insurers must not engage in practices that harm or disadvantage consumers when handling claims.""

Fox's bulletin outlined a laundry list of unacceptable behaviors, including denying valid claims, canceling policies without adequate justification, and profiting from the sale of claimants' vehicles after denial. These practices, she noted, violate not just the letter but the spirit of Michigan's insurance regulations, which are designed to protect policyholders from unfair treatment. ""We are committed to holding insurers accountable when they fail to treat Michigan consumers fairly,"" Fox stated.

The CURE case has become a flashpoint for broader concerns. The company is currently being sued for similar alleged improper practices in other claims, and the spotlight from state regulators is only growing brighter. For many Michigan drivers, especially those who rely on their vehicles for daily life, these revelations are deeply unsettling. After all, when you pay your premiums faithfully, you expect your insurer to have your back in a crisis—not to pull the rug out from under you.

But the story doesn't end with individual disputes. Michigan's insurance market is facing another, perhaps even more dramatic, shift—one that's affecting drivers far beyond the state's borders. According to a recent report from Insurify, as highlighted by GOBankingRates on September 14, 2025, premiums for electric vehicle (EV) drivers have soared by 16 percent in the last year alone. On average, EV owners are now paying $4,058 annually for coverage—about 49 percent more than their gas-powered counterparts, who pay roughly $2,732 per year.

Why the dramatic difference? Insurify points to the higher costs associated with repairing and replacing EVs. These vehicles, while often touted as the future of transportation, come with expensive parts and specialized labor requirements. That means when accidents happen, insurers are on the hook for bigger payouts—and those costs are being passed along to consumers in the form of higher premiums.

Not every EV is created equal when it comes to insurance costs, though. Insurify's data reveals that several popular models stand out for their particularly steep premiums. The Tesla Model X, for example, is the priciest to insure, with an annual cost of $4,765. Its gas-powered counterpart, the Audi Q3, costs $2,889 to insure—a difference of nearly 65 percent. The Model X's luxury status and advanced features, like its iconic falcon-wing doors, certainly play a role in driving up those numbers.

Even the more affordable Tesla Model 3, which starts at $44,130 according to Kelley Blue Book, carries a hefty insurance bill: $4,546 per year. That's 21 percent more than its gas-powered alternative, the Mercedes-Benz A-Class, which costs $3,592 to insure. And while the Model Y is less expensive to insure than the Model X or S, its insurance cost of $4,189 is still about 44 percent higher than the Audi Q5's $2,915. Interestingly, the Model Y also has a claims frequency of 29.47 percent, compared to just 5.22 percent for the Model S, according to data cited by Insurify from auto insights company Mitchell. That's a staggering difference and a key factor in the higher premiums.

It's not just Tesla drivers feeling the pinch. The Cadillac Lyriq, another luxury EV, costs $3,752 per year to insure compared to $2,671 for its gas-powered sibling, the Cadillac XT5—a 29 percent jump. The Hyundai Ioniq 5, which has won Kelley Blue Book's Best Buy Award in the EV class for two years running, isn't immune either. Its insurance cost is $3,503, about 34 percent more than the Hyundai Kona, its gas-powered alternative, at $2,621.

The reasons for these disparities are complex. As Insurify explained, ""Premiums reflect the risk and expense of paying out claims."" With EVs, the risk profile is different: batteries are costly to replace, repairs require specialized technicians, and even minor accidents can lead to expensive fixes. For insurers, that means higher potential losses—and for drivers, it means higher bills.

For many consumers, these rising costs are forcing tough choices. Some may reconsider the financial wisdom of going electric, despite the environmental benefits and potential long-term savings on fuel and maintenance. Others might be tempted to cut back on coverage or shop aggressively for better rates, hoping to find an insurer willing to take a chance on their EV at a more reasonable price.

Meanwhile, Michigan regulators are under pressure to ensure that all drivers—whether they're behind the wheel of a gas-guzzler or a cutting-edge EV—are treated fairly. Fox's bulletin, while not naming specific companies, sends a strong message to the industry: ""We will not tolerate practices that disadvantage Michigan consumers."" For insurers, it's a warning shot across the bow. For consumers, it's a glimmer of hope that someone is watching out for their interests.

As the auto insurance landscape continues to evolve, one thing is certain: the stakes are higher than ever. With EV adoption on the rise and regulatory scrutiny intensifying, insurers and policyholders alike are navigating uncharted territory. The coming months will reveal whether companies like CURE—and the industry as a whole—can adapt to these new realities while keeping trust with the drivers who depend on them.

For now, Michigan drivers—and EV owners nationwide—are left to weigh their options carefully, hoping that the next time they need their insurance, their insurer will be there for them, not just in the fine print, but in practice.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg,N,,2025-09-14 21:59:58.527091

The US (about 10% of global emissions) has abandoned the field on climate action.","The scale of the Albanese government’s climate action ambition for the next decade will be set this week with the anticipated release of its 2035 emissions reduction target.

The target is one of several expected announcements revealing the “scary” risks posed by the climate crisis, what the government intends to do, and how.

Climate risks

The first announcement, expected on Monday, will be the release of the national climate risk assessment, a long-promised analysis of the economic and environmental risks posed by the climate crisis.

People familiar with it have said it is “intense and scary”, and confronting even for those who work in the area. It will be accompanied by a national climate adaptation plan, a high-level framework for managing a changing climate.

Developed by the Australian Climate Service and the climate change department, work on the risk assessment has included highly detailed modelling of future damage, estimates of the number of people who could be killed by worsening heatwaves and development of a mapping tool that forecasts flooding risk in suburbs across the continent.

Sources say that under some scenarios, even major systems – such as electricity networks, transport routes, food production and the financial sector – could struggle to cope.

Cutting emissions

The biggest announcement will be the government’s 2035 emissions reduction target, expected on Thursday or Friday after cabinet signoff.

Like the risk assessment, this has been significantly delayed. It was initially promised by February but postponed until after the May election as the government waited on advice from the Climate Change Authority, a government agency chaired by former NSW Liberal treasurer Matt Kean.

The government is expected to announce the target at the same time it releases a barrage of reports, including the Climate Change Authority’s target advice, a plan to reach net zero by 2050 and an analysis of what can be done to cut pollution in six sectors of the economy, including electricity and energy, transport, industry, agriculture and land, resources and the built environment.

New policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions are expected to be unveiled alongside the new goal, which would build on the government’s 2030 target of a 43% reduction on 2005 levels.

The latest annual emissions projections, published in November, suggest the government is on track to hit 42.6% – just shy of the legislated target.

Setting targets

The 2035 target matters not just in Australia, but internationally. It will be submitted to the UN as part of the country’s “nationally determined contribution” – what the government says it can do to help the world meet goals in the 2015 Paris agreement. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has indicated Australia is likely to submit a range rather than a single number.

The Paris deal includes a commitment that the target must be more ambitious than the existing 2030 goal – there can be no backsliding – and reflect the country’s “highest possible ambition”. The Climate Change Authority released a consultation paper in April 2024 with its preliminary assessment, finding a cut of at least 65% and up to 75% “would be ambitious and could be achievable if additional action is taken by governments, business, investors and households”.

Since then, the authority has been consulting with experts and interest groups and has undertaken modelling to refine its advice. It is understood its board – including scientists and business figures – reached its final position last week, and the report is yet to go to government.

The authority is required to consider what the best scientific advice says Australia should be doing to keep alive the goal of trying to limit global heating to 1.5C since preindustrial times. It should also consider the international political and diplomatic landscape, the economics of what’s possible, the pace of technological development and what is considered socially deliverable.

From a scientific view, analyses have found Australia should make a percentage cut of somewhere between the high 70s to 100% – actually reaching net zero – by 2035. Australia’s Pacific island neighbours have also stressed the need for their more developed friend to be as ambitious as possible – and to stop approving new fossil fuel developments.

Some of these analyses – including by the thinktank Climate Analytics and the Australian Conservation Foundation – have detailed estimates of how cuts could be made to meet a target of at least 75%. Climate campaigners generally believe the target range must include 75% to be credible.

But other experts, such as Frank Jotzo, the director of the Australian National University’s Centre for Climate and Energy Policy, have argued that even a target of 65% would be ambitious, given it would require pollution to be effectively cut in half over the next decade. He argues that new policies behind the target are ultimately more important than the number.

Business organisations are politically influential and vary markedly in their positions. One group of about 500 that includes Fortescue, Atlassian, Ikea and Unilever has argued strongly for 75%. Others have emphasised the cost of action and pitched for a goal in the 50s.

The Business Council of Australia issued a veiled warning about setting a target in the 60s or 70s, publishing modelling suggesting between $395bn and $530bn of capital investment would be needed.

International action

The picture across developed countries is mixed. The US (about 10% of global emissions) has abandoned the field on climate action. The UK has a 2035 goal equivalent to a 78% cut below 2005 levels, and the EU is expected to land in the 70s. But Canada and New Zealand have set much lower goals (45-50% and 51-55% respectively).

As an emerging economy, China – the world’s biggest national polluter – has not yet set targets on the scale of those nations that developed earlier. Its current goal is that its pollution will peak by 2030.

Some analyses suggest that may have already happened as it builds extraordinary amounts of renewable energy and uses less coal power (even as it continues to build new plants). There is a lot of focus ahead of the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil in November on what Beijing will promise to do by 2035.

In an interview last week, Bowen pointed to a 2021 calculation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that suggested global emissions needed to be cut by 60% between 2019 and 2035 to keep the 1.5C goal on the table. That translates to a 68% cut below 2005 levels – the baseline used by Australia.

But global heating has accelerated since then and 68% is a planet-wide average. Developed countries such as Australia would have to do more.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98031c4650d3ed0623532c713bcc53a1dac6015f/0_0_3207_2567/master/3207.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77c404808207b883212dad60f549971d",N,,2025-09-14 16:59:08.568476

• Ensuring that governance of the new market respects state procurement, environmental, reliability, and other public policies.
• Protecting California’s ability to withdraw from the regional market at any time.","California state lawmakers on Sept. 13 approved a legislative package that includes the creation of an expanded Wildfire Fund and enabling the Pathways Initiative for a voluntary, west-wide regional electricity market.

The legislation was announced by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Senate President pro Tempore Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas on Sept. 10.

AB 825, authored by Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, Senator Josh Becker, and Speaker Robert Rivas, “preserves California’s control over critical policy functions — including transmission planning and procurement — while unlocking the benefits of broader regional cooperation: greater grid reliability, reduced blackout risk, more affordable clean power, and lower emissions,” a news release from Becker’s office said.

Recent amendments to AB 825 “include rigorous annual legislative oversight by relevant California legislative policy committees to ensure the new market operates in line with California’s clean energy and reliability goals. The bill also provides strong protections for state authority, including California’s right to withdraw at any time if participation ceases to benefit the state,” the news release said.

“By enabling least-cost dispatch across a broader pool of Western resources, the Pathways Initiative is expected to save California ratepayers up to $10 billion over the next decade, according to analysis by the Brattle Group,” Becker’s office said. “California will also reduce the costs of maintaining a state-specific strategic reliability reserve by pooling resources with other participating areas.”

The California ISO said that the “bill establishes a clear path toward independent governance for the West's interconnected electric grid. This milestone was shaped by years of successful regional collaboration and the proven success of our Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM), which has delivered more than $7.41 billion in cumulative savings since launch in 2014,” it said.

As the Pathways Committee develops the framework for the new regional organization, “we will coordinate closely to ensure alignment with legislative requirements. We remain fully committed to the successful launch of our Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM) in 2026 and will offer technical support throughout this important transition,” the grid operator said.

Becker’s office said that key safeguards in AB 825 include:

• Maintaining California ISO’s role in planning for and operating California’s grid.

• Ensuring that governance of the new market respects state procurement, environmental, reliability, and other public policies.

• Providing the CPUC and other stakeholders with access to critical market data.

• Protecting California’s ability to withdraw from the regional market at any time.

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/7e5595a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7547x4245+0+448/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F32%2F32%2Fad74d8e809b04ee8d202675b6393%2F2183a975fede4e5bbfd309f8aa660def,N,,2025-09-14 16:59:13.121616

If approved, New Mexico will join a small but growing group of states that already hold primacy for Class VI wells used for carbon storage. States with full authority at this point include North Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana, and West Virginia.

Arizona has also just been granted Class VI primacy by the EPA. Other states—including Texas, Colorado, Utah, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Alaska—are in various earlier stages of rulemaking or pre-application activity.

New Mexico’s efforts reflect both growing urgency and complexity in the regulation of carbon capture and storage: ensuring that state rules are at least as protective as federal regulations, managing public participation, and setting up monitoring and enforcement regimes.

Utilities have reported a 45% reduction in outages by using LiDAR and AI modeling for vegetation management.","Vegetation is a much-needed part of the natural world and is essential for life to thrive on Earth. Yet, when unmanaged, it’s also one of the greatest threats to the grid and a leading culprit for causing outages. Fallen branches topple powerlines, roots damage underground cables, and overgrown trees close to energized wires are known to ignite catastrophic wildfires.

The consequences are enormous. Power outages hit Americans with a $150-billion bill every year, based on Department of Energy numbers, and vegetation issues are behind a lot of those costs.

Just two years ago, a devastating wildfire hit Maui, killing 102 people and destroying 2,200 structures. Sparks from damaged utility lines re-energized unexpectedly, setting nearby vegetation on fire. This is a devastating reminder of the difficult balance utilities must strike between keeping the lights on and protecting public safety.

Historically, utilities have used routine trimming and in-person inspections to manage vegetation. But with labor shortages, rising costs, and wildfire risk increasing, they now need to evolve into risk-based vegetation management.

AI alongside drones and LiDAR (light detection and ranging), provide visibility, predictive modeling, and automation. This empowers utilities to reduce risks, cut costs, and maintain compliance, all while mitigating outages and keeping the power on.

The Vegetation Challenge

Vegetation may seem like a simple problem to solve, but in practice it’s one of the most persistent threats to reliable power delivery. Fast-growing species grow towards overhead conductors, and storms, heavy winds and ice cause branches to snap, igniting wildfires, taking down power lines and triggering widespread outages. And the industry has been grappling with this issue for decades. With extreme weather causing more frequent wildfires, the industry must adopt AI to protect the grid and serve its ratepayers.

Yet traditional approaches are not working. Ground crews may spend weeks patrolling remote corridors on foot or by truck, only to cover a fraction of the system. Helicopter inspections expand coverage areas but bring considerable safety concerns and hefty price tags. And more than half of utilities admit their vegetation management funding doesn’t match operational requirements.

The situation, therefore, becomes even more problematic. Vegetation threats are growing while the money to address them keeps shrinking. AI presents an opportunity to bridge this gap.

How LiDAR and AI Can Drive Smarter, Safer Vegetation Strategies

Utilities have long needed to supplement manual inspection with technology like satellite imagery, aerial surveys, and, more recently, drones. Yet the real breakthrough comes when high-resolution LiDAR data is combined with AI, transforming raw images into actionable business insights.

Clarity of Data Collection: LiDAR technology allows utilities to survey vast areas and infrastructure in weeks by creating detailed 3D point clouds capturing vegetation density, tree height, and encroachment risks with centimeter-level accuracy. Manual patrols simply can’t match this. And the data stays objective and repeatable and avoids human error or fatigue. This removes significant pressure from manpower constraints, eliminating the need for crews to spend days on manual inspections.

AI Modeling of Data: AI and ML algorithms review and analyze LiDAR data to detect vegetation encroachment, tree health issues, and potential hazards in high-risk areas. Rotting trees create serious risks for power lines during intense storms and high winds, for instance. Utilities can use LiDAR-based modeling to identify problematic trees, then quickly dispatch teams to safely remove them—this reduces future outage risks.

Via a combination of data from past vegetation growth, weather, and up-to-date field insights, LiDAR and AI-driven modeling, can predict future issues. For example, the AI system flags areas where fast-growing trees will likely extend onto transmission and/or distribution lines, causing outages in future storms. This gives utilities sufficient data and time for proactive tree trimming crew scheduling rather than waiting for outages or fire risks during storms or natural vegetation growth.

Fixed Cycle to Risk-Based Scheduling

Traditionally, utilities trim vegetation on fixed cycles. For instance, trim trees every three or five years, regardless of actual risk. Instead of trimming every mile of line on a fixed schedule, utilities can use AI risk models to target the most vulnerable corridors. With crews attending to the most risk-prone areas first, this supports risk-based scheduling. This targeted approach reduces outage risk, lowers wildfire exposure, and improves compliance with regulatory clearance standards. And as importantly, this approach saves money: avoiding routine trimming where it isn’t needed and reallocating funds to high-risk zones.

Centralizing Data: On top of its exceptional modeling capabilities, when utilities leverage an AI platform, it provides a centralized location for all data. When teams continuously gather information from the field like photos and sensor readings, they can be documented and stored in a centralized system, creating a single source of truth for decision-making, accessible to all. Combining field data collected on a continuous basis with LiDAR data gathered on an annual basis provides a powerful dataset for modeling.

This “single source of truth” creates a living digital twin of the network and enhances audit readiness, regulatory reporting, and cross-department collaboration. Instead of sifting through fragmented spreadsheets and inspection notes, decision-makers see a unified risk picture across the grid.

Implementation Considerations: AI may sound like the magic bullet for utilities in their efforts to get vegetation management under control, but it takes some thoughtful planning to implement AI safely and successfully.

AI Integration: One of the first hurdles utilities face when adopting LiDAR and AI is making it work with their existing utility management systems. Most utilities have a patchwork of tools, including outage management systems, GIS mapping, SCADA monitoring, and asset management platforms that don’t ‘talk’ to each other.

Integrating AI so its recommendations flow directly into existing workflows is a must. AI should be able to automatically create a maintenance ticket, update the asset database, and alert the right teams for follow-up actions when it spots a risky stretch of power lines. All of this must be completed without manual data entry, along with the ability for human intervention.

The way to make this happen is by building a robust data pipeline:

Bringing in data from LiDAR, drones, satellites, and field crews.

Cleaning and standardizing that data so it’s usable.

Storing the data in an organized and consistent way.

Running AI models to turn raw data into prioritized, actionable insights.

When done right, integration allows AI to become part of the utility’s daily operations, helping crews respond faster and budgets stretch further.

Staff Training and Operational Changes

Even the best AI system won’t make an impact if people don’t know how to use it. Vegetation management crews, dispatchers, and planners need training not just on the software but on how to interpret and trust AI-driven recommendations.

For success, utilities need to appoint change management leaders to organize the training and control the AI rollout. Hands-on training for AI literacy, clear communication about “why” the shift is happening, and a phased adoption so staff don’t feel overwhelmed will all assist in an easier transition. In practice, this looks like an AI pilot program used to prioritize inspections in one region, allowing teams to feel confident and comfortable before scaling company-wide.

Utilities have to stretch tightened budgets to maintain the millions of miles that make up utilities infrastructure across the U.S., but leaning on manual inspection is not feasible or efficient. Integrating LiDAR and AI solutions smartly and safely can help utilities reduce risks, improve compliance, and shift from reactive to proactive vegetation management.

Regulatory and Security Considerations

Utilities face compliance obligations under North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) standards. AI tools can strengthen audit readiness by providing timestamped, geolocated evidence of vegetation clearances.

At the same time, centralizing sensitive data introduces cybersecurity risks. Utilities must ensure robust protections for cloud storage, mobile field devices, and AI platforms.

Financial Justification: Convincing utility executives to invest in AI requires more than technical promise. It requires financial justification. Fortunately, there’s compelling potential for the return on investment.

UReduced inspection costs: LiDAR and AI analysis can cover in weeks what might take boots-on-the-ground crews months and years.

Lower outage costs: Preventing even a single wildfire or large-scale outage can save hundreds of millions, even billions in potential liabilities and fines. Utilities have reported a 45% reduction in outages by using LiDAR and AI modeling for vegetation management.

Improved compliance: Automated reporting reduces manual effort and audit penalties.

Optimized trimming cycles: Targeted risk-based scheduling saves money by trimming only where needed.

Early adopters have seen inspection cost reductions of 30 to 50%, in addition to saving millions annually in avoided emergency response. As AI models mature and data volumes grow, these savings are likely to accelerate.

Unmanaged vegetation is a persistent and costly challenge for utilities. AI and LiDAR can help utilities shift to a proactive approach to managing vegetation. With a technology-forward approach utilities can manage risk, stretch budgets farther, improve compliance and reliability, and enhance resilience.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vegetation-management-wildfire.png,N,,2025-09-14 14:58:43.043596

The deals represent Enel’s largest corporate PPA transaction worldwide. Combined, the agreements represent 851 MWac and are expected to yield 1.8 TWh of electricity each year.

“As we celebrate 25 years in North America, Enel marks a milestone with one of the largest corporate PPA transactions on the U.S. market—nearly two terawatt-hours annually, equivalent to the electricity needed to power 150,000 homes,” said Michele Di Murro, CEO of Enel North America. “This deal reinforces our commitment to decarbonization and shows how renewables are among the fastest and most affordable solutions to meet the nation’s energy needs. Through these agreements, we’re adding clean capacity to the Texas grid while supporting a leading manufacturer’s sustainability goals.”

“Many large companies are well on their way to sourcing renewable electricity for their own operations, but that’s just a part of the picture,” said Kevin Rabinovitch, Global VP Sustainability at Mars. “For Mars, Renewable Acceleration is a performance accelerator, cutting emissions at a scale and speed we could never achieve through traditional value chain engagement approaches.

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.everythinglubbock.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2025/09/68c5fc4a93f3e4.61868730.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-14 12:03:37.003165

Brett Christophers has put his finger on an uncomfortable truth. Renewable energy has reached the point where it is often cheaper to generate than fossil fuels, yet the rate of investment is still far below what climate targets demand. His book, The Price is Wrong: Why Capitalism Won’t Save the Planet, explains why.

Investors follow profit, not need, and renewables are structured in a way that turns falling costs into falling revenues. Solar panels and wind turbines produce power at near zero marginal cost, so competition drives prices down. That is good for consumers and good for emissions, but it makes for wafer-thin profit margins that are not attractive to capital looking for steady, high returns. Fossil fuels by contrast remain in many cases more profitable because their scarcity can be controlled and their markets are designed to reward incumbents. Christophers’ conclusion is stark. If profitability is the bottleneck, then leaving the transition to private capital will not work at the speed required. The state must take on a far larger role.

The core of his argument is hard to dispute. If companies and financiers do not see an acceptable return, they will not deploy capital. He documents how even record low bids for renewable projects have been followed by cancellations or pleas for more support when inflation or supply chain pressures squeeze margins. He reminds readers that what has been built so far has leaned heavily on subsidies, tax credits, or guaranteed contracts, not on free market enthusiasm. Without that scaffolding, private developers walk away. It is a useful correction to the triumphalist narrative that renewables will sweep the board simply because they are cheaper on paper.

Christophers’ prescription for action is that governments must move beyond reliance on markets and take a leading role by building and owning renewable infrastructure themselves, or through public utilities and agencies. Where private developers are involved, he insists that the state must guarantee returns through long-term contracts, subsidies, or price supports that stabilize revenues.

He frames electricity as a public good ill-suited to volatile spot markets and better managed through planned, coordinated investment in generation, grids, and storage. In short, he calls for a decisive expansion of state leadership and ownership, with private capital relegated to a supporting role under strict public frameworks, on the grounds that only by bending or bypassing the logic of profit can the transition proceed at the pace the climate crisis demands. Basically, he calls for socializing electrical generation and removing markets from the equation.

However, credible critics have pointed out that the story is not quite that simple. Renewable profitability varies by technology, geography, and market design. A rooftop solar installation in Germany is a different investment proposition than offshore wind in the North Sea or utility-scale solar in Texas. Many economists note that market design can be reshaped to stabilize revenues. Contracts for difference, long-term power purchase agreements, and capacity payments already exist in many jurisdictions and have drawn in billions of dollars of private capital. Others stress that non-financial bottlenecks such as lengthy permitting, overloaded interconnection queues, and grid congestion slow the pace of deployment even when investment appetite is strong. Christophers is right to highlight profit as a barrier, but it is not the only brake on progress.

There are also fair cautions about his solution. Public ownership can deliver long-term capacity, but state-run utilities have mixed track records, and governments face their own constraints, from budget limits to political interference.

The real question is not whether capitalism must be abandoned but how far it must be bent to public purpose. History offers a guide. Almost every major infrastructure build in the past century combined public rule-setting with private execution. Railroads, highways, telecommunications networks, and electricity grids were all made possible by government interventions that made them investable. The clean energy transition will be no different. The challenge is to design frameworks that unlock capital while ensuring deployment at the necessary pace.

One tool is market design that ensures adequate returns. Electricity markets that rely on energy-only spot prices expose renewable projects to extreme volatility. When the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, prices collapse, sometimes to zero or even negative, and investors cannot rely on a steady cash flow. That makes banks reluctant to lend without charging a high premium. Instruments like contracts for difference in the UK solve this by guaranteeing a fixed price for generation over 15 to 20 years. Developers bid competitively, which keeps costs down for consumers, but they know exactly what revenue they will earn, which makes projects financeable.

Long-term corporate power purchase agreements play a similar role, although Christophers notes that large buyers often negotiate very low rates that squeeze developers. Capacity markets and ancillary service payments can also provide steady income for being available to the grid, not just for producing power in a given hour. These tools stabilize cash flows and lower the cost of capital, which is critical for capital intensive technologies like wind and solar.

Another tool is public support for finance. Governments can use green banks, loan guarantees, or co-investment funds to take on part of the risk that deters private lenders. A green bank providing low interest loans, or a public entity taking the first loss in a project portfolio, can make the difference between a renewable project being bankable or shelved. The Inflation Reduction Act in the United States was an example of public money creating private profitability. Generous tax credits and direct payments made clean energy projects attractive to investors, and as a result the pipeline of solar, wind, and battery plants expanded dramatically. This is capitalism with a thumb on the scale, and it shows that policy can shift capital quickly when it aligns profits with climate goals.

There is also a role for direct public investment in infrastructure the market will not build on time. Transmission lines, interconnectors, and large-scale storage are expensive, slow to permit, and often unprofitable for private firms to build on their own. Yet without them, renewable projects remain stranded. Governments can and should take the lead on these backbone elements, whether by funding them outright or by creating regulated monopoly frameworks that guarantee returns. The payoff is that private developers can then connect new projects without prohibitive delays. Public ownership is justified in these cases because the social value of expanded grids and storage far exceeds the private return.

Carbon pricing and clean energy standards are additional levers. By making fossil fuels more expensive or mandating a rising share of renewables in electricity supply, governments tilt the economics decisively. A robust carbon price or an enforceable renewable portfolio standard creates predictable demand for clean power. That demand, in turn, gives investors confidence that their projects will have a market. These policies are not without political difficulty, but they are well within the toolkit of capitalist economies.

Reducing soft costs is another area where policy can raise effective returns without raising consumer bills. Every month cut from permitting timelines or interconnection delays improves the net present value of a project. Standardized contracts, transparent grid data, and faster regulatory processes all contribute to making renewables more attractive investments. This is not about subsidies or public ownership, but about making the system function more efficiently.

There are selective cases where public ownership makes sense. Grid infrastructure is one. Repowering old coal sites with renewables where transmission already exists is another. Early stage offshore wind zones or large storage projects may also benefit from public build-own-operate models, especially if private capital is hesitant. The key is to ensure such ventures are governed transparently, with clear mandates to deliver reliable, low-cost clean power, not to serve as political tools.

Evidence from around the world supports this blended approach. The UK’s offshore wind boom was driven by contracts for difference that de-risked investment. The United States is seeing a surge of projects thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits and loans. China’s massive build-out of wind and solar is guided by state planning and executed by both state-owned and private firms. Each case shows that when government sets the ground rules and shoulders part of the risk, private capital will scale clean energy. The common thread is that markets are not left on their own. They are bent to serve a public purpose.

As a note, this is one of a select group of books I’ve read which does an excellent job of assessing a complex space and clearly identifying issues, then veers off course into fairly bad prescriptions for action. Marx’ Communist Manifesto did an excellent job of identifying issues with capitalism, then offered a terrible alternative. Naomi Klein’s No Logo‘s first half was a master class in branding, and I learned a lot from it, but the second half was a laundry list of mostly meaningless resistance, not a useful alternative. The Price Is Wrong falls into this category, and for anyone seeing a trend here, you aren’t wrong. All three are worth reading for the diagnosis of the problems, but the strategic policies and plans are shaped by bias, aren’t relevant, and are clearly better resolved within the framework of market economies than through removing markets from the equation.

The conclusion is straightforward. Addressing Christophers’ challenges does not require abandoning capitalism. It requires writing rules that make clean, reliable power profitable to build and cheap to buy. Capitalism will not save the planet on autopilot, but it can be harnessed if governments are willing to set the terms. The measure of success is not ideology but delivered clean terawatt-hours at stable prices. The faster policymakers align markets with that outcome, the faster the transition will proceed.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-14-2025-07_40_26-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-09-14 12:01:44.183049

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.
Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?""","HARRISBURG, Pa. — With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?"" Silverman said. ""Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://media.wfaa.com/assets/CCT/images/d1b54000-e507-4e75-aa81-9a919e2bd9e5/20250913T211557/d1b54000-e507-4e75-aa81-9a919e2bd9e5_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 12:59:27.090224

Questioning the affordability premise The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt.
“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said.
At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind.
His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.","Gov. Gavin Newsom closed out the legislative year with one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades — a package that could give him a presidential debate-stage talking point on rising energy costs as the Democratic Party shifts its focus to affordability.

The six-bill deal — passed Saturday after lawmakers extended their session by an extra day because of last-minute dealmaking — was sold as a way to ease gas prices and soaring electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs.

Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills. They also will get some protection from utilities hiking rates based on the cost of wildfire-proofing their infrastructure, such as by putting power lines underground. But they’ll also continue paying $9 billion over the next decade into a fund to compensate wildfire victims.

The package of legislation now heads to the governor’s desk for his signature.

Newsom and his allies, who negotiated the package in the final days of the legislative session, said the state needed to allow more permits to drill oil to head off more refinery shutdowns that could send gas prices soaring.

Critics said the biggest winners of the maneuvering were the oil industry and the state’s major utilities. Oil drilling measures advanced in Kern County after refiners threatened to shutter plants. Utilities gained sweeping new wildfire liability protections and the ability to join a regional power market — a step critics warned could tether California to fossil-fuel states at a time when the Trump administration is moving to roll back clean energy.

Michael Wara, a Stanford legal scholar focused on energy policy, called it “astonishing” that lawmakers managed to pass so many major bills at once, including the two-thirds vote to reauthorize cap-and-trade. California is making steady progress in shifting from fossil fuels to renewables, even as wildfires complicate the transition, and while the measures were imperfect, they were necessary, he said.

“I’ve been a part, over the last decade, of getting individual tweaks done in each of these areas — but the idea that we would get them all done at once, on time, when we needed to, is astonishing to me,” Wara said. “Are the bills perfect? No, from my perspective they’re not perfect, but they are all material improvements over the status quo.”

The future of cap and trade reinforced

At the center of the bargain was the extension of California’s cap-and-trade system — rebranded by Newsom as “cap and invest” — through 2045. The extension, hammered out in backroom talks, was one of the most divisive elements of the package.

The carbon-trading program, launched in 2013, is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The program sets a strict cap on emissions for polluters and hands out a limited supply of permits companies can sell to other polluters if they cut enough emissions.

The final agreement on the program preserved rules that let oil companies avoid paying the full cost of their emissions while leaving untouched a cap on carbon prices. That setup shields polluters while leaving consumers potentially exposed to higher gas prices, experts said.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas stood by the energy package on Saturday, arguing the measure to boost in-state oil production and keep refineries from closing would keep prices down at the pump. “Altogether,” he told reporters, the deal “is going to result in some billions of dollars in savings.”

The California Chamber of Commerce was out front in opposing the cap and trade deal, arguing it would make energy less affordable by taking credits away from gas customers and giving them to electric utilities — hurting families, renters, and small businesses that still depend on natural gas. The powerful business group has poured at least $6.9 million into legislative races over the past decade, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.

The oil industry’s chief lobbying group, the Western States Petroleum Association, which had pushed back early on, eventually settled into neutrality. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates remained staunchly against it, saying the program protects oil and gas companies while leaving nearby low-income communities to bear the health costs of pollution.

A group of seven environmental justice groups from across the state, including Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Asian Pacific Environmental Network Action, said the extension “institutionalizes inequality in California’s climate policy.”

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” the groups said.

Alongside reauthorization of the program, a companion bill provided a blueprint for how the state should spend its revenues, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget.

Questioning the affordability premise

The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt. Affordability has become the defining fault line in Democratic politics since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, powered by a campaign fixated on cutting costs and fighting inflation.

At the same time, Democrats are leaning into the rhetoric of “abundance,” a term popularized by columnist Ezra Klein to capture the idea that more housing, clean energy and infrastructure can ease scarcity and lower costs. But some consumer advocates and Capitol insiders argue the measures won’t ultimately help consumers.

“I don’t know how any of this saves money,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “But this is the new state of Sacramento. I think it happened because of Trump, honestly, I think this is all about abundance and Trump, and Democrats trying to make a name for themselves by dumping regulation.”

Republicans, too, slammed the package, but they called it over-regulation that would continue to keep gas and energy costs high. Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, called Democrats’ goals of using the cap-and-trade dollars to improve transit “unrealistic” when Californians “are not going to give up driving their cars,” and said the party’s stated three goals can’t coexist.

“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said. “People aren’t going to be able to live here.”

Newsom’s push to keep gasoline prices and energy bills in check — a message potentially aimed as much at a national audience in a future presidential bid as at Californians — meshed with Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas’s early pledge to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.”

Meanwhile, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and his team resisted giving ground to oil and gas interests without securing gains for environmental and social justice priorities, given the concentration of polluting industries and poor air quality in low-income communities.

Cap-and-trade renewal took on urgency as carbon auctions faltered and Trump singled out the program — originally set to expire in 2030 — as potentially unconstitutional.

A ‘giveaway to big oil’?

At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind. After blasting the industry as deceitful and politically manipulative for years, Newsom reversed course. His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.

While much of the governor’s original oil refinery proposal was pared back in the Legislature, drilling approvals advanced in Kern County. That was a victory for Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, who represents the county. Grove has spent a decade pushing to keep drilling and its middle-class jobs alive there.

The approved oil permits, she said, “will result in California-compliant oil that is the most regulated in the world.”

Nevertheless, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, criticized the oil deal from the Assembly floor Saturday as a “giveaway to big oil.”

“The thing we need to focus on is a controlled and managed phaseout of fossil fuel, like the dinosaurs that they process, the petroleum-oil, fossil-fuel industry fuel is dying out,” Lee said. “Refineries and facilities are closing, not just in California, but in Texas and across the world.”

Lawmakers also established a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.

Layered onto those debates was a high-stakes battle over utility finances. Wildfire liabilities loomed over investor-owned utilities, especially Southern California Edison, now under scrutiny for its potential role in the Eaton Fire in Altadena. Newsom pressed to expand California’s $18 billion wildfire fund — a safeguard supporters said was vital to protect ratepayers if utilities sparked future blazes, but one that critics warned could ultimately drive consumer bills higher.

Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines. Supporters say it could cut costs for customers and steady the grid during crunch times like heat waves, while supporting in-state clean power producers who could sell excess electricity to neighbors.

Consumer advocates, led by The Utility Reform Network, warned the change could weaken California’s control over its clean energy agenda and hand more power to a federal government under Trump that is siding with fossil fuels. Some environmental and consumer groups shared that concern.

The shift is important because California has spent decades building one of the cleanest grids in the world and the move to open up that system to other Western states could reshape how both renewable and fossil power move across the region.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fde5aad/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+109/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2F46%2F485856f344ccafaa914580726190%2F090622-powerlines-lv-cm-002.JPEG,N,,2025-09-14 10:59:49.557277

Developed by VW subsidiary PowerCo, the prismatic cell will debut in the automaker's line of affordable EVs launching in 2026.

Over time, VW plans to use the cell across all its brands—from VW to Porsche—and adapt it to chemistries including LFP, sodium-ion and solid-state.

The Volkswagen Group's years-long effort to create a standardized battery cell to use across its electric portfolio is finally coming together. This week at IAA Munich, Europe's biggest auto expo, the automaker said it completed development of its ""unified cell"" and laid out a roadmap for the technology's future.

The idea behind the standardized cell is to unlock super-sized economies of scale around one of the most crucial EV components, VW executives explained at the show. That's critical, because almost no manufacturers besides Tesla have managed to turn a profit on their electric cars—largely because they've been crushed by high battery costs and limited production scale. Carmakers in Europe in particular need to meet escalating emissions rules and combat an influx of high-quality, highly subsidized Chinese offerings too.

Now, as Volkswagen prepares a renewed EV product offensive and advanced electrical architectures sourced from Rivian, it also has big plans for the batteries that are central to any EV.

""This brings us back to the driver's seat in one of the key technologies of our industry,"" said Thomas Schmall, member of the Volkswagen board of management responsible for technology, at IAA.

The prismatic cell developed by PowerCo, the automaker's battery subsidiary, will start series production within ""weeks"" at its factory in Salzgitter, Germany and ramp up next year, PowerCo CEO Frank Blome said during a presentation. Production will follow at plants in Spain and Canada in 2026 and 2027, respectively, he said.

The cell will power up to 80% of the VW Group's EV models from 2030 and extend to all brands, the company said. That means variations of it will be found in everything from Volkswagens and Škodas to Porsches and Audis. And they'll go into vehicles sold across the U.S., China and Europe. Notably, Porsche recently scrapped its own in-house battery manufacturing project.

""The basic idea for us is to standardize things wherever possible. We customize wherever necessary,"" said VW battery executive Guenther Mendl.

The unified cell will debut in the VW Group's ""Electric Urban Car Family,"" four models on the new MEB+ platform that VW says will start at around 25,000 euros, or roughly $29,000. Those include the Volkswagen ID. Polo and ID. Cross, along with the Cupra Raval hatchback.

VW says the unified cell will deliver a driving range of up to 450 kilometers (279 miles) in those cars. It says the cell demonstrates a volumetric energy density of 660 watt-hours per liter, a 10% improvement over VW's previous cells.

Ultimately, though, range and other specs will vary from vehicle to vehicle. VW says the cell can be adapted to different dimensions and can work in large and small vehicles. It can work with 400-volt and 800-volt architectures too.

VW's unified prismatic cells can be adapted to different sizes, executives said at IAA.

The unified cell will eventually employ several different battery chemistries, according to VW, starting with nickel manganese cobalt (NMC), which is the most popular format in the West. Soon, PowerCo will start manufacturing cheaper lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells too, which are taking off globally because of their low cost and durability over years of charging.

""Technologically speaking we're still at the very beginning,"" Blome said, through a translator. ""So we're going to first have NMC, then LFP, then sodium and solid-state is also in the pipeline. It's included in the development roadmap, and we're also talking about further architectures and cell chemistries that we've started to work on.""

VW will start producing LFP unified cells at a factory in Valencia, Spain, in 2027. Solid-state batteries are likely farther off, as no company has successfully commercialized this holy grail battery technology. However, at IAA, Volkswagen rolled out its first demonstration vehicle with solid-state battery tech, a Ducati motorcycle with cells from VW-backed QuantumScape.

Executives said they chose the prismatic form factor—a rectangular box rather than a cylinder or flexible pouch—so that it could accommodate different chemistries over time. The shape is key in another way, too. In a new design for the VW Group, the cells stack together and slot directly into a vehicle's battery pack, rather than being packaged into a handful of modules first.

This cell-to-pack technology eliminates parts and frees up more space for batteries inside a vehicle, boosting range while cutting weight and cost, Mendl said, also calling the design ""extremely important.""

VW isn't alone here. The cheaper-to-build, overhauled EV platform that Ford announced in August uses prismatic cells integrated directly into a pack as well. The Rivian R2 eliminates the modules found in its R1 series. General Motors bet big on a scalable battery platform called Ultium, based on battery packs with different configurations of standardized modules. Now it's also looking into prismatic cells that can eliminate battery substructures and reduce the number of modules.

Volkswagen won't take on the brunt of manufacturing all on its own. The company said it plans to offload about 50% of cell production to suppliers, which, according to a presentation attended by InsideEVs Germany, include Gotion, CATL, Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution.

The cells aren't just for cars, either. They will also go into stationary battery banks built by Elli, VW's new energy storage company.

Frequently Asked Questions: Electric Vehicle Myths Debunked Do electric vehicles pollute more than gas cars due to battery production?","Rumors, clickbait, and lively dinner table debates—when it comes to electric vehicles, misinformation travels faster than a Lucid Air on a straightaway. In 2025, with Tesla sedans quietly weaving through traffic and BYD, Ford, Nissan, Chevrolet, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Polestar, Lucid Motors, and Rivian all fighting for market share, electric cars have leapt from niche status to global presence. Still, persistent myths muddy the facts for curious new drivers and skeptics alike. Are EVs really worse for the environment? Are battery fires about to erupt? Is public charging still a mythological quest? Below, we untangle the biggest misconceptions, diving into real-world stories, data, and a few surprises about the cars shaping our roads, jobs, and future.

Electric Vehicle Environmental Impact: Separating Myth from Reality

As Jane, a journalist from Manchester, prepared to trade her aging Ford Focus for a gleaming new EV, she heard it all: “It’ll take you 77,000 miles just to break even on emissions.” Yet recent data tells a different story. A Tesla Model Y in the UK balances out its initial ‘carbon debt’ after just 13,000 miles—less than two years for most drivers. Over a full life, its emissions are about three times lower than an average petrol car. Production emissions, especially from batteries, do exist; however, as Europe’s and the world’s electric grids get cleaner, the benefits keep improving. Meanwhile, manufacturers like Volkswagen and Hyundai are pushing for greener supply chains, driving these numbers down further. The story is clear: whether you drive a Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt, or Polestar 2, the green advantage begins early and grows over time.

Electric Grid and Charging Infrastructure: Can the System Cope?

Skeptics like to recall headlines forecasting grid collapse or a shortage of public chargers. Yet, since the UK hit 50,000 public charging points, and with global investments topping $1 trillion for future infrastructure, the landscape is shifting rapidly. Technologies like Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) now allow EVs to stabilize the grid rather than overwhelm it. In fact, modern grids—even in coal-heavy countries—are handling the transition smoothly, aided by smarter home charging and overnight rates. Jane, now a proud Hyundai Ioniq 5 owner, charges at home most nights, waking to a full battery. And with networks from Tesla Superchargers to ChargePoint expanding fast, ‘range anxiety’ is giving way to newfound convenience.

Myths Around Cost, Maintenance, and Battery Life in Electric Cars

For many like Alex, a London rideshare driver recently switching from a diesel VW Golf to a BYD Atto 3, the biggest shock wasn’t the silence or acceleration—it was realizing his maintenance costs had plummeted. Even as headlines warn that EVs are too expensive or that their batteries are dangerously short-lived, real-world economics look different. Battery warranties from Ford, Nissan, and others stretch eight years or more. Major studies reveal 90% of EVs with 100,000 miles still have at least 90% battery capacity. And when it comes to cost, falling battery prices, incentives, and cheaper electricity mean the total cost of ownership for models like the Chevrolet Bolt or Kia EV6 is now on par—sometimes even below—that of comparable petrol vehicles. Maintenance? With 90% fewer moving parts and no oil changes, it’s no contest.

Performance, Range, and Practicality: Today’s EVs in the Real World

Step into the world of enthusiasts like Priya in Los Angeles, who swapped her hatchback for a Lucid Motors Air Grand Touring. The myth that EVs are slow or limited to city streets evaporates on the freeway, where her car covers 837 km (520 miles) on a single charge—more than some gasoline rivals. Whether it’s the instant torque of a Tesla Model S Plaid or the adventurous spirit of a Rivian R1T tackling unpaved trails, EVs today are as thrilling as they are practical. Data from Norway—where EVs outnumber nearly every other type—demonstrates that not only do drivers travel further each year, but range is no longer a barrier. Even in harsh winters, Hyundai and Tesla models excel, with adaptive tech ensuring drivers are rarely caught short.

Job Market, Manufacturing, and the Future of Mobility

Beneath the shift toward electric mobility lies another, less visible revolution. When Ford’s F-150 Lightning rolled off a new assembly line in Michigan, it was more than a product launch—it was a harbinger of change for millions. Contrary to dire warnings about job losses, investments from Chevrolet, Volkswagen, and Polestar are ushering in tens of thousands of new roles, from battery production to software engineering. Recent research even suggests manufacturing EVs may require more labor, at least for now, due to new assembly technologies. The UK alone is poised to add 80,000–100,000 jobs by 2030, contingent on securing manufacturing plants. As Jane tells friends skeptical of “losing jobs to robots,” it’s human adaptation and retraining—supported by industry and government—that is rewriting the workplace, not the end of employment itself.

Frequently Asked Questions: Electric Vehicle Myths Debunked

Do electric vehicles pollute more than gas cars due to battery production?

No. Despite higher initial emissions from battery manufacturing, EVs like the Tesla Model Y pay off their ‘carbon debt’ in one to two years, ultimately reducing lifetime emissions by 65-70% compared to petrol cars.

Are EVs too expensive for the average driver?

Although some models have higher upfront prices, falling battery costs, tax incentives, and much lower maintenance and fueling expenses make EVs like the BYD Dolphin or Chevrolet Bolt highly affordable over their lifespan.

Can EVs be used for long trips and in cold climates?

Absolutely. Models from Lucid Motors, Tesla, and Hyundai now boast 400–800 km ranges, and advanced battery management ensures reliable performance even in freezing temperatures. Norway’s high EV market share supports this with real-world data.

Is the charging infrastructure enough to support millions of EVs?

Yes. Rapidly expanding networks—public and private—along with home charging, now mean that finding a plug is easier than ever, with 4 million+ public chargers worldwide and thousands more coming online monthly.

Do EV batteries last, or will I need to replace mine every few years?

Most EV batteries are rated for 10–15 years and over 300,000 miles, with warranty support and continually improving chemistry. Less than 2% of batteries have needed early replacement in large-scale studies.

Ford Motor Co. unveiled plans for a new line of budget electric vehicles in a $5 billion bid to achieve the mass appeal that has so far eluded its money-losing EV business.

The automaker’s new “universal EV platform” represents its first battery-powered models fully designed from the ground up, after early efforts such as the F-150 Lightning plug-in pickup failed to meet lofty sales expectations.

The new platform will spawn a family of EVs starting with a $30,000 mid-sized pickup truck in 2027, the company said in a statement Monday. That will be followed by battery-powered models expected to include a crossover SUV and a vehicle for ride-hailing, Bloomberg has reported, which will be priced below $40,000, about $10,000 less than the average price of a new car in the US.

Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley has billed the new EV line as Ford’s big bid to take on the growing global dominance of Chinese EV makers such as BYD Co. and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. It’s part of what Farley called a “tremendous pivot” away from its earlier strategy of electrifying its largest models, which it largely abandoned a year ago when it canceled plans for an electric three-row SUV.

“This is a Model T moment for the company,” Farley told analysts last month, invoking the car that put Ford on the map a century ago. “We believe the only way to really compete effectively with the Chinese over the globe on EVs is to go and really push ourselves to radically re-engineer and transform our engineering supply chain and manufacturing process.”

Farley on Monday cautioned that the strategy around its new EV line might not succeed, especially given how unpredictable the US EV market has been as American car buyers have been slow to embrace electric vehicles.

“There are no guarantees,” Farley told a crowd of workers and politicians at an event at Ford’s Louisville, Kentucky, factory. “It is a bet. There is risk.”

Factory Overhaul

The push includes a new, $2 billion investment to convert Ford’s Louisville plant from producing gasoline-fueled Escape SUVs, a model it is discontinuing, to manufacture the new EV line.

The battery-powered models will take 40% less time to build and require 600 fewer workers than the Escape thanks to an efficient design that was led by former Tesla Inc. executive Alan Clarke in what Ford called a skunk-works project in California. The Louisville plant will employ 2,200 hourly workers to build the EV line, down from 2,800, the company said.

The new models will have more interior room and advanced features, such as hands-free driving. They will be powered by lower-cost lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries Ford is to begin building next year at a new $3 billion battery factory in Marshall, Michigan, the company said.

Farley told reporters after Monday’s plant event that Ford can only beat Chinese automakers by offering an EV with more innovative features and efficient manufacturing methods because Ford can’t beat their low labor costs. “You’ve got to get close on cost, but then you have to apply the innovation,” he said.

Ford deliberately chose not to actually reveal a prototype of the electric pickup coming in two years because it didn’t want to tip its hand to competitors.

Despite Ford’s embrace of smaller, more affordable EVs, the automaker is still moving forward with plans for a successor to the F-150 Lightning full-size pickup. The automaker has repeatedly delayed its next generation electric F-Series truck and has now pushed its launch to mid-2028, from late 2027, according to a person familiar with the change.

Ford said in a statement that it has communicated the timing adjustment to its suppliers and employees in June.

Ford plans to build it at a new $5.6 billion manufacturing compound in Stanton, Tennessee, in 2028. The factory, Ford’s first new assembly plant in a half century, is capable of building more than 300,000 trucks a year, far more than the market is now demanding. It was part of Farley’s now-jettisoned $50 billion plan to churn out 2 million EVs a year by 2026 and overtake Tesla as the market leader in battery powered models.

It remains unclear how Ford will fully utilize its new Tennessee factory, though Farley has suggested the plant could also produce extended-range electric vehicles, a new type of plug-in hybrid.

EV Losses

Ford last year lost $5.1 billion in its EV unit and has said the deficit could widen this year as it brings its new line of battery powered models to life. But Farley has said any new EV at Ford must be both affordable and profitable within its first year on the market. Mainstream consumers have been turned off by the high price of electric vehicles.

“We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty,” Farley said in a statement.

Ford’s big bet on battery-powered models runs up against President Donald Trump’s crusade against what he calls an “EV mandate.” Trump’s $3.4 trillion fiscal package is eliminating a $7,500 consumer tax credit on EV purchases and nearly derailed manufacturing subsidies that were critical to Ford’s business case for its Michigan battery plant.

The automaker lobbied furiously to protect those manufacturing credits, including an appeal by Executive Chair Bill Ford, great-grandson of founder Henry Ford.

Ford also said Trump’s tariffs cost the company $800 million in the second quarter and represent a $2 billion headwind for the year. That’s despite the fact that the Dearborn, Michigan-based company produces more cars in America than any other automaker.

“I think the fact that subsidies have been either cut back or limited means that it’s likely that there won’t be future offshore wind built in America.” Halting construction Burgum’s remarks come just weeks after the Interior Department issued a stop-work order for the Revolution Wind offshore wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island.
Five major offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, are under construction.
The three other wind farms under construction are Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts, Sunrise Wind off the coast of New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind in Virginia.
Just this week, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) issued her support for the Coast Virginia Offshore Wind Project.","Clean energy advocates hoped that wind power would have a role to play in Trump’s second term, as the administration faces the problem of securing enough power to meet growing demands brought on by the artificial intelligence race.

However, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum insisted this week that offshore wind essentially has no “future” in the United States right now.

“Right now, under this administration, there is not a future,” Burgum said of the industry during the GasTech conference in Milan. “I think the fact that subsidies have been either cut back or limited means that it’s likely that there won’t be future offshore wind built in America.”

Halting construction

Burgum’s remarks come just weeks after the Interior Department issued a stop-work order for the Revolution Wind offshore wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. It cited unspecified “national security” concerns.

The project, which is being developed by Danish wind giant Ørsted, is estimated to be roughly 80% completed with around 45 out of 65 planned turbines installed. Recent federal court filings revealed that the company is losing roughly $2 million a day over costs incurred from the stop-work order.

However, Ørsted faces billions of dollars’ worth of revenue losses if it cannot meet critical deadlines outlined in its power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, according to the Providence Journal. Under the contracts, the wind farm must start generating power by the end of December of next year and mid-January 2027. Otherwise, the utilities could terminate the contracts.

If the project were to be scrapped entirely, officials with Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection warned it could cost consumers up to $500,000, an increase of between 5% and 7% in their electric bills.

“Every day that goes by without a resolution to this largely unexplained stop work order is a waste of American resources,” Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind nonprofit organization Turn Forward, said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

“Hundreds of union workers sit idle, wondering if their jobs still exist. Regional grid officials counting on this critical new energy source to stabilize the grid and hold down electricity bills must plan for increased risks to reliability,” Bright added. “And billions of dollars of U.S. infrastructure investment are slowly being drained rather than helping a project come to life.”

Other projects in the air

In the last few weeks, the Trump administration has moved to yank federal permits previously granted to offshore wind projects set to be constructed along the East Coast.

This included construction and operations permits granted to U.S. Wind for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, also known as MarWin, which was approved by the Biden administration in December 2024.

The wind farm is expected to have up to 114 turbines that will generate enough electricity to power over 718,000 homes.

The Interior Department is also targeting permits granted to SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind off the coast of Massachusetts. All three projects have not yet started construction.

Five major offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, are under construction. Trump previously issued a stop-work order for Empire Wind off the coast of New York. However, it was ultimately lifted after the administration said it had made a deal with Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) to approve two gas pipelines in her state.

The three other wind farms under construction are Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts, Sunrise Wind off the coast of New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind in Virginia.

Burgum said that all five projects are being reviewed by the administration this week.

“Yes, they were permitted, but they got moved through a very fast, ideologically driven permitting process,” Burgum said.

While permit reviews of such projects are not uncommon at the start of any administration, many in the offshore wind industry have said the Trump administration is going a step too far.

“These particular projects have already been through nearly a decade of rigorous studies and permitting reviews,” Katharine Kollins, president of the Southeastern Wind Coalition, told the Washington Examiner.

“While this administration has shown hostility to the industry, we believe the long-term momentum behind wind energy, which is driven by market demand, technological progress, and private investment, will continue,” Kollins added. “What’s important is that we provide a stable and predictable regulatory environment that allows this industry to provide the domestic energy needed to fuel our economic growth.”

Republican support

As Trump and his allies have rallied against the offshore wind industry, a growing number of Republicans in Congress have directly challenged the crackdown or come out in support of various projects.

Just this week, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) issued her support for the Coast Virginia Offshore Wind Project. The project, which is being built by utility Dominion Energy, is set to be the largest offshore wind farm in the country.

Kiggans, who did not openly criticize the administration, said she remains a “staunch” advocate of the project due to the economic development and job growth in the region. She also noted that it has become crucial for meeting energy security demands in Virginia, particularly when it comes to defense.

“I always speak about that project in light of the national security benefit and that benefit to Naval Air Station Oceana,” Kiggans told reporters on Monday. “I have a base here that needs a lot of infrastructure help, and Dominion Energy has been a great partner for us. That public-private partnership is giving Naval Air Station Oceana a $500 million power grid upgrade.”

Similarly, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) offered his support for the project, which has somehow remained unscathed in the administration’s offshore wind crackdown thus far.

“Yes, I’ve talked to the Trump team and there are ongoing conversations about that,” Johnson told E&E News when asked about the Virginia Beach project this week. “I understand the priority for Virginians, and we want to do right by them, so we’ll see.”

WRIGHT BACKS TRUMP ARGUMENT BLAMING RENEWABLES FOR RISING ELECTRICITY PRICES

Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) has also quietly backed the offshore wind farm and reportedly called Burgum last month to voice his support.

However, with Burgum insisting that offshore wind has no “future” and Trump vowing not to let any new windmills be built in the U.S., any public support from Republican industry allies might be for naught.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25237502829235.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-14 12:02:24.013081

The decline in profits is also influenced by the high costs of transforming production lines to meet the demands of EV manufacturing. This includes the development of advanced technologies like autonomous driving and energy solutions, which require significant investments. Additionally, supply chain disruptions, such as semiconductor shortages, have posed substantial challenges in meeting production targets and delivering vehicles on time.

Membrane innovation boosts speed and stability

A core innovation is a novel ultra-ion-selective membrane called SPEEK-SX. It delivers ionic conductivity while restricting unwanted ions, allowing the battery to operate at high current densities (≈160 mA/cm²) over 600 full charge/discharge cycles with minimal capacity loss (≈0.00935% per cycle). This performance exceeds that of the widely used Nafion-212 membrane, particularly in terms of cycle stability and speed.

Safety, cost and real-world readiness

Unlike many lithium-ion systems, the flow battery uses non-toxic, non-flammable materials and relies on abundant components. It stores energy in liquid electrolytes and uses a membrane barrier system to separate ion streams, making it simpler to scale. Researchers are 3D-printing prototypes and testing under realistic conditions; if results hold, the battery could become commercially available in a few years.

How it compares with lithium systems

Current lithium-ion storage systems used for rooftop solar in many markets cost around USD 10,000. This new flow battery aims to undercut those costs, while offering safety and performance advantages. The fast charging enabled by the membrane means it can more closely match solar output in real time.

Implications for the manufacturing sector

For manufacturers of battery components, membranes, and storage systems, this is a potential game changer. The shift away from expensive, fluorinated separators toward more affordable and safer alternatives opens new supply chain opportunities. Local industries focusing on organic chemistry, polymer membranes and scalable manufacturing methods stand to benefit.

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov.
The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2025/09/68c5fc4e13c733.48887980.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-14 08:59:50.794586

Rea, a senior associate with the nonprofit RMI, analyzes the latest plans put out by U.S. electricity utilities for meeting projected demand over the coming decades.

His most recent review of all 128 plans found that utilities were looking to build twice as much natural gas capacity as they had anticipated just 18 months earlier.

The main reason for this shift: Utilities are rushing to accommodate the electricity needs of data centers, and projections of those needs keep rising. It’s a troubling trend for anyone concerned about the costs for ratepayers and the effects on the climate.

“Utilities that have updated their plans since the end of 2023 have added just a small amount of wind and solar capacity, 4 gigawatts, but a lot more gas capacity, 52 gigawatts,” said Rea, whose organization seeks to accelerate the energy transition.

At first glance, utilities’ long-term plans seem to favor renewables overall, projecting wind and solar growth of 258 gigawatts versus natural gas additions of 102 gigawatts through 2035. But a closer look reveals the shift.

Just one year back, these plans showed wind and solar could overtake natural gas as the nation’s biggest source of electricity generation by 2035. At the new rate, gas would keep reigning.

AI Boosts Demand

U.S. tech giants are betting big on an AI future, but the power grid is still a relic of the past.

Data centers—essentially warehouses for computers that form the backbone of the internet—are multiplying as companies add power-hungry servers for artificial intelligence. Some existing sites use as much energy as a small city, and new ones are even bigger.

As a result, data centers, which used less than 2 percent of total U.S. electricity prior to 2018, consumed 4.4 percent in 2023 and are on track to make up anywhere between 6.7 and 12 percent by 2028. That’s according to a congressionally mandated report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory last year.

After nearly two decades of flat demand, the power grid—much of it running on equipment that is over half a century old—is scrambling to keep up.

“It was designed to accommodate big central power plants that sent electricity in one direction down the lines to the customers,” said Todd Olinsky-Paul, senior director of the Clean Energy Group’s Resilient Power Project.

It was not built for a system that has much more rooftop solar and home-based batteries, with electricity going to and from the customer.

Energy companies and regulators have been working for years to modernize the grid and move toward cleaner sources of energy. But when faced with a rapid increase in electricity demand, ambitions of just a few years have faded in favor of plans to rely heavily on new natural gas power plants—with everyone bearing the costs, from higher electricity bills to harmful climate impacts.

Resorting to Natural Gas

Experts say that utilities are leaning extensively on gas due in part to the inertia of existing regulatory processes and a tendency of the power sector to hype its demand outlook.

When utilities want to raise rates, they almost always have to make their case in public proceedings before a state commission. In most states, the regulator-approved rate hikes only account for the fixed costs of building new infrastructure, including plants and power lines. The fluctuating cost of the fuel that goes into running those plants is passed through to consumers on a rolling basis year after year.

“Often the fuel price risk is ignored, probably intentionally ignored, by utilities when they speak with their regulators,” said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based consultancy focused on transmission and power markets.

Gramlich, who testified before a Senate committee in July about rising electric demand, previously worked with a Republican chairman of the federal energy regulator as well as with the country’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection.

Among the reasons for utilities to favor gas is the rate-setting process, which makes it more profitable for utilities to opt for power plants in their territory rather than contracting for renewables, Gramlich said.

“Renewables have been a little bit less attractive because often they’re in a neighboring service territory or spread around the region,” he said, and “they’re usually developed and owned by independent power producers.”

Utilities also like to err on the side of caution. To avoid blackouts, they prefer to build more rather than less, which shows up in their off-the-charts projections. Since 2006, their 10-year growth forecasts have overshot reality by 17 percent on average, according to an RMI analysis.

That saddles customers with the bill for unneeded facilities. And it’s a particular risk in the current fast-changing environment.

Utilities are preparing to meet a 24 percent increase in electricity demand by 2035, according to another RMI analysis.

Jeremy Ortiz, a spokesperson for the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade group, said in a statement, “Our members are investing more than $1.1 trillion in infrastructure projects nationwide over the next 5 years to help keep costs as low as possible for families and businesses while enabling the innovation America needs to win the AI race.”

Without regulatory changes, the costs will be effectively socialized across the customer base even though much of the growth is coming from one kind of customer—data centers.

“The typical rate-making structures are not set up for this because typically electrical infrastructure—generation, transmission, distribution lines—is paid for by the entire customer base, which is a reasonable assumption when you assume that everything is growing in a similar way,” said Cathy Kunkel, a North America energy consultant with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

But today’s growth is coming from some of the world’s largest corporations, which are sparing no expense to win the AI arms race.

“Because the data centers are so enormous,” Kunkel said, “it’s a different paradigm.”

While this is playing out around the country, the most acute impacts are regionally concentrated. Northern Virginia is the world’s largest hub of data centers—and the utility that serves them, Dominion Energy, raised its capital expenditure by a fifth to $12 billion last year, the largest jump for any investor-owned electric utility in the nation.

Soaring electricity prices in Virginia, and throughout the wider Mid-Atlantic region, have been attributed in large part to data centers.

As Virginia strains to accommodate that growth, “we’re seeing data center companies right now seek out anywhere that they see perceived headroom or ability to power their load throughout the country,” said Lauren Shwisberg, a principal at RMI’s Carbon-Free Electricity Practice.

Against this backdrop, many other states are courting data centers and their tax revenue, following in Virginia’s footsteps.

But data centers don’t produce a lot of permanent local jobs, and they “may be effectively crowding out other forms of economic development” by siphoning large portions of the region’s available electricity away from other types of industrial and manufacturing investments, Kunkel noted.

Meanwhile, sparse information disclosed by data-center developers—and the speculative nature of many proposals on the cutting edge of tech—makes it harder to effectively plan the grid of the near future.

“It is worrisome that we’re going to end up overbuilding generation, particularly overbuilding fossil-fuel generation, which no one wants to see,” Kunkel said.

Blow to Clean Energy

Clean energy is literally waiting in line to help the grid out—and waiting, and waiting.

Another report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory last year found that 95 percent of energy projects queued up at the end of 2023 for permission from grid operators to get connected were either solar, batteries or wind. The report noted that wait times are rising, from less than two years for projects completed in 2008 to nearly five years for those finished in 2023. Historically, just about one in five projects in the queue get completed.

With all these projects in the pipeline, “we can meet the vast majority of the requirements for many of these data centers with pretty close to exclusively clean energy, if we had both the political apparatus and will to be able to do so,” said Jeremy Fisher, principal advisor on climate and energy with the Sierra Club’s environmental law program, who co-authored a report last September about leveraging growing electric demand for a cleaner grid.

At a federal level, with a president who has made no secret of his disdain for renewables, the will is now entirely absent.

“The cancellation of permits, the difficulty of getting federal permits and the uncertainty and loss of tax credits are all very likely to reduce renewable energy growth in the next few years,” Grid Strategies’ Gramlich said, referring to Trump administration moves to discourage wind and solar. All of that compounds the effects of burgeoning demand, he said, “making clean energy targets more difficult to meet in a number of places.”

Take Virginia’s example. The state passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act in 2020, setting staggered targets, under financial penalty, for investor-owned utilities to keep raising the share of carbon-free electricity in their statewide power sales, topping out at 100 percent in 2045 for Dominion.

But Dominion’s long-term planning indicates that it might miss those targets. In 2023, its modeling showed it might not meet the statutory requirement to retire all carbon-emitting power generation by 2045, citing “an increasing load forecast.” Last year’s plan said it was getting ready to collect fines for some of the years through 2040 when it expects to fall short of the targets. Those fines would pass to customers.

Dominion did not respond to requests for comment.

Even if compliance with the law was possible and compatible with high levels of data center growth, it would require “unprecedented investment in an ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy” on energy. That was the finding of a study released in December by the state legislature’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which also said the state’s current regulatory practices “were not designed to account for this level and continued pace of large load growth from essentially a single customer type.”

In neighboring North Carolina, where data center construction is exploding, the Republican-led state legislature last month dropped a 2030 deadline for utility Duke Energy to slash its carbon emissions by 70 percent.

Risks to Consumers

Already, utility bills are rising as climate change drives more extreme weather and grid hardening costs. Deepening dependence on gas further piles on risks for ratepayers, and not only because gas worsens climate change.

“When [gas prices] spike, that’s an instant rate increase outside the rate-case process that flows directly to your bill,” said Ted Thomas, founder of consultancy Energize Strategies and former chair of the Arkansas Public Service Commission. “If you’re a regulator, your consumers are twisting in the wind if they’re just sitting there eating those costs on both electricity and natural-gas home heating.”

Then there’s the possibility of the political pendulum swinging back. Make energy investment decisions assuming the current federal policy environment won’t change, and “you’re probably going to get hammered,” Thomas said.

“The people that think the only reason to do renewables is environmental, they get it wrong,” Thomas said. His guidance for utility commissioners: “You’ve got to leave your ideology at home. … We can’t pretend that natural gas prices don’t spike because if they do, our constituents are going to have to pay for it.”

Some states are taking a hard look at the other major grid issue posed by data centers: Everyone bearing the costs of that development. In July, utility American Electric Power got buy-in from state regulators in Ohio to make large data centers pay for at least 85 percent of their projected energy use each month, even if they end up needing less. A report that same month from the Clean Energy States Alliance details other ways that officials are trying to make data centers pick up the tab—and stay the course on the clean-energy transition.

“The momentum was always at the state level,” said Olinsky-Paul, a co-author of that report. “States have a very good, effective ability to institute new policy and regulations and new programs to accelerate the deployment of clean energy resources. They know how to do it. They’ve been doing it for decades.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2214908574-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 05:58:51.486591

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the credit—offering up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones—is set to expire on September 30, 2025. However, recent IRS clarifications, as detailed in a Yahoo Finance report, allow consumers to secure the incentive by entering a binding contract and making a payment before the deadline, even if the vehicle isn’t delivered until later.

This adjustment addresses a practical hurdle: supply chain delays and inventory shortages that have plagued the auto industry. Buyers who sign a non-refundable agreement or provide a down payment by the cutoff date can still claim the credit on their 2025 tax returns, provided the vehicle meets all other qualifications like battery sourcing and price caps.

Navigating the Binding Contract Loophole

Industry experts view this as a lifeline for an EV market still recovering from post-pandemic disruptions. According to insights from WebProNews, analysts predict a 10-15% sales dip without the credit, but the extension via contracts could mitigate that by encouraging pre-deadline commitments. Dealerships are already adapting, with some offering streamlined online contracting to lock in deals remotely.

For consumers, the key is understanding what constitutes a “binding contract.” The IRS specifies it must be enforceable under state law, with at least a partial payment or trade-in. This echoes guidance from the IRS’s own clean vehicle tax credits page, updated in May 2025, which emphasizes that acquisition is defined by commitment, not possession.

Implications for Automakers and Supply Chains

Automakers like Tesla and General Motors stand to benefit, as the loophole could sustain demand into late 2025. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, from users like Sawyer Merritt highlight how the original expiration shift from December 31 to September 30 caught the industry off guard, prompting urgent marketing pushes. Meanwhile, a CNBC analysis notes that this flexibility particularly aids out-of-state purchases, where shipping delays might otherwise disqualify buyers.

Yet, not all vehicles qualify. Eligibility hinges on factors like North American assembly and income limits—$150,000 for single filers, $300,000 for joint. NerdWallet’s July 2025 update on EV tax credits lists models like the Chevrolet Bolt and Ford F-150 Lightning as prime candidates, but warns of potential changes if battery mineral rules tighten further.

Consumer Strategies and Market Shifts

To maximize savings, experts recommend acting swiftly. A NPR report from August underscores that shoppers don’t need keys in hand by September 30, easing pressure on rushed deliveries. This has sparked a flurry of activity, with Consumer Reports noting in its August 2025 piece on qualifying EVs that plug-in hybrids like the Toyota Prius Prime remain strong options amid the deadline.

Looking ahead, the expiration could reshape EV adoption. Without the credit, prices may rise effectively by thousands, potentially slowing the transition to cleaner transport. As Edmunds explores in its coverage of the loophole, this might accelerate innovation in affordable models, but for now, the IRS’s extension offers a critical window for savvy buyers to electrify their drives on favorable terms.

Economic Ripple Effects and Policy Context

Broader economic implications are evident. The credit, extended multiple times since its inception, has subsidized over a million EV purchases, per Department of Energy data from its clean vehicle credits page. X posts from figures like Pramila Jayapal reflect past enthusiasm for such incentives, but with the 2025 cutoff, attention turns to state-level rebates in places like California.

Critics argue the policy favors wealthier buyers, as echoed in older X commentary from Guy Reschenthaler, yet recent IRS tweaks aim for inclusivity. As the September deadline looms, industry insiders advise consulting tax professionals to navigate claims, ensuring this final extension doesn’t slip away unused.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DALL·E-2024-08-09-06.35.54-A-dynamic-image-depicting-the-rapid-rise-of-electric-vehicles-EVs-dominating-the-automotive-landscape.-The-scene-shows-a-futuristic-cityscape-with-h.webp,N,,2025-09-14 08:59:27.113174

""Hydro is now being called the forever renewable,"" Kentucky hydropower developer David Brown Kinloch said, ""because these plants last forever.""
Kentucky's leading source of clean power Hydroelectric power plants function by a relatively simple premise: Water flows downstream and through a turbine, causing it to spin, which in turn runs a generator.
In Kentucky, hydropower is often generated in a run-of-river context, harnessing the natural flow of a waterway.
1 state for building new small hydropower,"" Brown Kinloch told state lawmakers last year.","Hydropower provides a vast majority of Kentucky's renewable electricity generation, and many unused dams could offer an opportunity for more.

Unlike other technologies like solar and wind, hydropower has seen broad bipartisan support, from the White House to the Kentucky legislature.

Upfront cost and a lengthy licensing process remain steep barriers for hydropower projects, and can disproportionately affect the smaller projects more common in Kentucky.

When it was built nearly a century ago, the Ohio Falls hydroelectric dam churned out enough power to serve nearly the entire budding city of Louisville.

Adorned by wooden handrails, vintage analog gauges and original tile, the plant's eight turbine units still chug away today, producing carbon-free electricity from the Ohio River. Anglers, water birds and wildlife congregate around the historic structure, jutting off of Shippingport Island along the McAlpine locks and dam system.

Louisville's power demand outgrew the station's generating capacity many years ago. But with a recent modernization effort, LG&E expects the station to persist for yet another century, meeting the electricity needs of tens of thousands of homes.

The Ohio Falls generating station is one of about a dozen hydroelectric plants operating in Kentucky waters.

Dozens more of Kentucky's existing dams could be suitable for hydroelectric generation but have not yet been developed — offering an opportunity to grow Kentucky's share of the oldest form of renewable energy. That opportunity is vast: The commonwealth has more miles of navigable water than any other state after Alaska, and many rivers and streams are already dammed from past efforts to shape these watersheds.

But developers say hydroelectric projects in states like Kentucky face significant hurdles, including an arduous federal licensing process and the need for long-term investment. Turbines are typically custom-designed and manufactured, posing another costly challenge.

Nevertheless, several hydroelectric projects are moving forward in Kentucky, and proponents see momentum and cause for optimism in the industry. Hydropower has enjoyed bipartisan favor, even amid the Trump administration's efforts to reverse federal support for other renewable energy technologies like wind and solar.

Building upon eligible, existing dams could yield hundreds of megawatts of reliable and renewable electricity, by some estimates. Additionally, by installing new hydropower generation without building new dams, developers avoid some of the knotty environmental challenges of reworking river systems.

Once stations do come online, they offer a reliable, carbon-free power source, often for a century or more. In fact, the U.S. Energy Information Administration in 2017 assessed all power plants built before 1930 and still in operation across the country. Hydroelectric stations made up 99% of the capacity.

""Hydro is now being called the forever renewable,"" Kentucky hydropower developer David Brown Kinloch said, ""because these plants last forever.""

Kentucky's leading source of clean power

Hydroelectric power plants function by a relatively simple premise: Water flows downstream and through a turbine, causing it to spin, which in turn runs a generator.

Plants harness the kinetic energy of moving water ― a concept applied in some form since at least the days of ancient Greece ― to generate electricity. The volume or flow of the water and the elevation change at the point of the dam determine the potential generation.

Louisville's Ohio Falls station, which sits at the single highest drop in the entire 981-mile length of the Ohio River, is in a particularly opportune location. Each of the station's eight turbine units can take in 4,000 cubic feet of water per second from the river, at capacity.

""The taller the dam, the more power you can make,"" Brown Kinloch said.

In Kentucky, hydropower is often generated in a run-of-river context, harnessing the natural flow of a waterway. It's also implemented in lakes and reservoirs, like Kentucky Utilities' Dix Dam at Herrington Lake.

Hydroelectric stations made up roughly 7% of Kentucky's electricity generation and a vast majority of its renewable power in 2022, with solar still fighting to gain ground. Dams in Kentucky waterways collectively generate millions of megawatt hours each year. (A power plant would need to burn billions of pounds of coal to generate the same amount.)

But the remaining 93% of the state's electricity generation came from polluting and planet-warming fossil fuels: coal and gas. Kentucky's electric power industry emits more than 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent emissions each year ― more than the state's transportation and agriculture sectors combined, according to EPA data.

Increasing the generation of carbon-free power and curtailing emissions from burning fossil fuels is mandatory for avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, according to the world's leading experts.

Hydropower's momentum in Kentucky, where conservative politics has slowed efforts for a clean energy transition, is part of a larger effort to chip away at stubborn power sector emissions.

Appalachian Hydro Associates, Brown Kinloch's development firm, is building a number of small hydroelectric projects up and down the Kentucky River. The firm has also partnered with Berea College on some projects, including a completed station near Ravenna.

And in Bell County, a billion-dollar pumped storage project is progressing with the help of some federal dollars.

But a burdensome federal licensing process and difficulty finding long-term investors can pose formidable hurdles for hydro projects, experts said. Installing hydro in an existing dam can take a decade or more, depending on the need for environmental assessments and other steps.

""When you go to most investors, they're wondering, 'What's the profit next quarter?'"" Brown Kinloch said. ""And you're talking about a project that's got a 100-year life, at minimum.""

Brown Kinloch said his firm has partnered Berea College because it also has taken the long view.

""They're not so concerned about whether the thing is making money in the first two months,"" he said. ""They realize it's a long-term investment.""

The bipartisan appeal of hydropower

In 1983, a state report analyzed potential sites for hydropower at existing dams across the commonwealth. Brown Kinloch has a copy; the pages have yellowed, but many of the dams it lists have yet to be developed.

Last year, he presented some of these statistics to a committee of state lawmakers, some of them staunch allies of the coal industry who have rejected the merits of decarbonizing Kentucky's power sector.

Installing hydroelectric systems in dozens of existing dams across the state could yield more than 600 megawatts of reliable electricity, Brown Kinloch explained — enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes.

Lawmakers were impressed.

""This seems to me to be a much more intelligent application of resources than, you know, basically future garbage dumps that we're building with all these solar projects,"" Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, said of hydropower during the committee meeting.

""When you look at all the energy aspects, and you see all the solar farms and you see all the potential harm that it can do to our farmlands and things, our return on investment isn't that great with some of these renewables,"" said Rep. Ryan Dotson, R-Winchester. ""But with hydro, I see the great potential in it.""

Party leaders, while remaining staunch in their defense of fossil fuels, have expressed concerns about electricity shortages and price hikes, especially as data centers and other energy-hungry industries take root around the state.

Hydropower boasts relatively low operation and maintenance costs. Dams also don't face the fuel input costs of coal- or gas-fired power plants, although operators do pay a fee to the federal government for use of the waterway.

Also, hydroelectric stations can generally operate for a larger portion of the year than solar or wind, although periods of flooding or drought — too much or too little water — can impede generation.

""Hydropower really does enjoy huge bipartisan support,"" said Malcolm Woolf, president and CEO of the National Hydropower Association. ""It appeals to both sides of the aisle.""

Alongside oil, gas, coal and nuclear, President Donald Trump has indicated his support for hydropower — ""which is fantastic,"" he said on the campaign trail — showing favor over other forms of renewable energy technologies.

Some of Trump's energy-related executive orders prioritize hydropower, and the president's domestic policy megabill spared key incentives for the hydro industry while crippling Biden-era support for other renewables, like solar and wind.

""If you're conservative, you like that it's baseload. It's not intermittent, like wind and solar,"" Woolf said. ""You like that it's domestic and secure. You understand it, because it's been around for 100 years.""

Hydropower projects moving forward in Kentucky

Even the industry's most fervent proponents admit hydroelectric dams are unlikely to ever generate a significant portion of Kentucky’s modern energy needs, especially as demand is expected to surge.

""Hydropower is not going to solve all of Kentucky's problems,"" Brown Kinloch said.

But it could still have a valuable role, even without the construction of new dams. Several new developments are forging ahead in the state, from small hydropower installations to larger investments.

Together, Brown Kinloch said, ""they're going to add up.""

Along the upper reaches of the Kentucky River, Brown Kinloch's firm is building a series of small hydroelectric stations on existing dams. Once complete, these projects will generate enough power for thousands of homes.

A station at lock 12, near Ravenna, is already in service ― and named for Matilda Hamilton Fee, the ""first lady"" of Berea College at its founding.

Another similarly sized station at lock 7, near Shakertown in Mercer County, is named for Mother Ann Lee, a religious leader of the Shakers. Inside, turbine housings are painted in bright colors and embellished with the artwork of schoolchildren.

""I took those plates off and took them over to my daughter's elementary school, and they painted the fish of the Kentucky River on there,"" Brown Kinloch said. ""So, it's a kids' art gallery also.""

In Bell County, a proposed project would add 266 megawatts of pumped storage on a former coal mine. Rather than generating power, pumped storage acts as a ""water battery,"" and this project would store electricity for up to 8 hours at a time, available for dispatchable use as needed to help stabilize the grid.

Rye Development is investing more than $1 billion in the project, which is named Lewis Ridge. It's expected to create 2,300 construction jobs.

Republicans representing the area have praised the Lewis Ridge plans. State Sen. Scott Madon, of nearby Pineville, called it a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity for Eastern Kentucky communities to build upon their energy-producing legacy,"" and an economic boon for the region.

""As we grow our economy, it's vital that Kentucky strengthen our energy system through common-sense solutions like the Lewis Ridge Pumped Storage Project,"" U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers said in a news release. ""Additionally, this project will help keep energy prices stable and affordable for Kentuckians.""

An 'extremely broken' regulatory process

Despite hydropower's momentum on the Kentucky River and elsewhere, industry experts say long timelines still pose formidable hurdles. Licensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can take years.

""The process is and has been, for many, many years, extremely broken,"" Brown Kinloch said.

The licensing process for a pair of relatively small hydroelectric projects on the Kentucky River, he added, took more than seven years.

The regulatory process is designed to ensure a hydropower project won't cause harm to the environment, recreation or other resources. In some cases, hydroelectric projects can pose a threat to fish, mussels and other species, although modern turbine designs and other tactics have sought to reduce harm. The Mother Ann Lee dam on the Kentucky River, and the Meldahl station on the Ohio, are both certified by the Low Impact Hydropower Association for taking measures to reduce disruption of the environment.

The federal government itself has recognized the licensing process can inflict undue cost and delays to building new hydroelectric infrastructure, even in projects with minimal controversy. A Department of Energy report found the arduous licensing process can disproportionately hinder smaller projects ― such as those fit for Kentucky's existing dams.

One piece of legislation, which the National Hydropower Association called a ""critical first step"" toward streamlining the licensing process, recently passed in the U.S. House of Representatives with bipartisan backing. It would require regulators to report to Congress with regular updates on the licensing process for each application.

Industry advocates said easing licensing barriers could be key to unlocking more hydroelectric projects ― especially in states like Kentucky, where hydropower has proven politically palatable in ways solar and other clean energy technologies have not.

""Kentucky is the No. 1 state for building new small hydropower,"" Brown Kinloch told state lawmakers last year. ""And it is our intent to build a whole industry centered here in Kentucky, with component suppliers and everything to supply small hydro, and teach the rest of the country how to do it.""","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/05/PLOU/85531689007-hydro-03.jpg?crop=2999,1687,x0,y120&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-14 05:58:55.231397

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Electricity Isn’t the Only Concern

There have also been recent reports about the amount of water data centers are using that have caused concern among communities impacted by tech companies moving in next door.

A data center in Georgia, operated by Facebook’s parent company Meta, is said to use roughly 500,000 gallons of water daily to cool their computing equipment. This amounts to about 10% of water use in the county, roughly equivalent to the demand of about 1,600 homes. Newer AI data centers are expected to use more than a millions gallons daily, according to water permit applications. Some have even asked for as many as six million gallons of water per day.

In some areas it has been suggested that residents may have to start rationing water by 2030, all so the tech companies can keep pushing their hot new product.

Data Centers Are Threatening Grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states, and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma, and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data Centers Might Have to Adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s Largest Grid Operator Has a Proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois, and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A Deal is Shrouded in Secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A New Way of Thinking About Electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

Taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://www.poncacitynow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Amazon-Data-Center-08-22-2024-AP.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 07:59:03.473407

Of equal importance is the social dimension of the coal transition.
The challenge is to leverage what remains of coal’s economic utility to accelerate, rather than delay, the clean energy pivot.
The clean energy era is not about erasing the past; it is about harnessing it to finance and secure a more sustainable future.","Jakarta, IO – Every era of a nation’ s development has its emblematic resource. For Indonesia, coal has long played that role. From the sprawling mines of Kalimantan to the busy ports along Sumatra’s coast, coal has not only powered turbines but also filled state coffers, paid for schools, hospitals and roads, and served as a diplomatic bargaining chip in global trade. Yet as the world edges ever closer to a clean energy future, Indonesia’s reliance on coal stands at a critical juncture. President Prabowo Subianto’s ambitious pledge to move toward 100 percent renewable energy within a decade underscores both the urgency and the opportunity of this moment. The pressing question is not whether coal will decline, but how it will be repositioned in the nation’s evolving energy landscape.

Coal’s legacy is both monumental and contradictory. On one hand, it has been the backbone of Indonesia’s electrification drive, enabling the lights to switch on in rural villages and industrial estates alike. The state has long depended on royalties and taxes from coal exports, particularly to energy-hungry neighbors in Asia. In 2022 alone, coal exports generated more than US$45 billion in foreign exchange, making it one of the largest contributors to Indonesia’s trade surplus. The resource has also created jobs across mining provinces, anchoring local economies and political networks. Yet this success has come with undeniable costs: deforestation, polluted rivers, respiratory illness among neighboring inhabitants from particulate emissions, and a carbon footprint that has placed Indonesia among the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters.

Globally, the coal narrative has shifted with remarkable speed. Banks, insurers and sovereign wealth funds have withdrawn financing from coal projects. Multilateral institutions now view coal as a “stranded asset” waiting to happen. Across Asia, long a bastion of coal demand, countries from China to India are scaling up renewable capacity at unprecedented rates. For Indonesia, which exports around 70 percent of its coal, this shift threatens to erode a vital stream of income. Domestically, the commitment to decarbonization, enshrined in the Paris Agreement and Indonesia’s net-zero pledge by 2060, further accelerates the imperative to transform. The recently-updated National Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) reflects this pivot, slating the majority of new capacity additions to come from renewables rather than coal-fired plants.

Yet phasing coal out of the grid is only part of the story. A more strategic question is how to reposition coal in a way that preserves its economic value, while aligning with the clean energy vision. Simply abandoning coal is neither feasible nor fiscally prudent. Instead, coal must be reframed not as an enemy of the transition but as a resource that, if managed wisely, can serve as a bridge to Indonesia’s clean energy era.

One avenue is industrial repositioning through downstream development. Indonesia has already experimented with coal gasification, aiming to convert coal into dimethyl ether (DME) as a substitute for imported LPG. Similar pathways exist for coal-to-methanol, coal-to-ammonia, and other petrochemicals that could supply domestic industry. While the environmental credentials of such technologies remain contested, particularly if carbon capture is not employed, they represent an attempt to move coal higher up the value chain. Rather than exporting raw coal, Indonesia could extract more economic rent by transforming it into intermediate products that support fertilizer, plastics, or chemical industries. This would mirror the government’s broader strategy of resource nationalism, exemplified by the nickel downstreaming push.

Another, perhaps more compelling, role for coal is as a fiscal buffer. Just as Norway built its sovereign wealth fund from oil revenues, Indonesia could channel the remaining windfall from coal into a “clean energy transition fund.” Such a mechanism would ensure that coal rents are not squandered on short-term expenditures but rather invested in renewable infrastructure, grid modernization and worker retraining. With careful design, this fund could become a stabilizing pillar for energy transition, insulating the state budget from commodity price volatility while underwriting longterm resilience. The analogy is not perfect; coal is far dirtier than oil, and time is shorter but the principle of converting resource wealth into future security remains powerful.

Coal could also serve as a strategic energy buffer. Even as renewable energy expands, intermittency and reliability issues will persist, especially in archipelagic regions where grid integration is costly. Maintaining limited coal reserves as an emergency fallback, akin to a strategic petroleum reserve, could help Indonesia hedge against supply disruptions, whether from natural disasters, geopolitical tensions or sudden demand surges. This does not mean prolonging the dominance of coal in the power mix, but rather reimagining it as a backup, a form of insurance in the broader resilience framework.

Of equal importance is the social dimension of the coal transition. Millions of Indonesians rely directly or indirectly on the coal economy, from miners in East Kalimantan to truck drivers, port workers and small traders in mining towns. Abrupt closure of coal operations would devastate these communities, fueling unemployment, poverty and social unrest. A just transition requires deliberate planning: channeling coal revenues into retraining programs, supporting micro-enterprises in affected regions and investing in new industries – ones that can absorb displaced workers. Provinces that once thrived on coal should not be left behind in the clean energy era. Instead, they should be recast as hubs for such renewable energy development as solar farms on reclaimed mining land, wind turbines along coastal ridges, or biomass plants tapping local resources.

The repositioning of coal also demands robust institutional frameworks. Without strong governance, efforts at downstreaming or fiscal reallocation risk succumbing to rent-seeking, inefficiency or even corruption. Transparent mechanisms for managing coal revenues must be established, with clear lines of accountability, to ensure that every Rupiah serves the transition. Likewise, the coal-to-clean narrative must be embedded within a broader strategy of national energy resilience, not treated as an ad hoc policy experiment. Coordination across ministries, local governments, stateowned enterprises, and the private sector will be critical.

Repositioning coal in this manner does not imply romanticizing its role. The environmental costs remain steep, and no amount of rebranding can obscure its carbon intensity. However, realism is essential. Coal will not disappear overnight, nor can Indonesia afford to sever its dependence without careful preparation. The challenge is to leverage what remains of coal’s economic utility to accelerate, rather than delay, the clean energy pivot.

In this respect, Indonesia has an opportunity to craft a uniquely Indonesian model of transition. Rather than importing blueprints wholesale from Europe or North America, the country can integrate its own historical experiences, developmental priorities and social realities. Coal repositioning can be framed not as capitulation to external pressure but as an assertion of energy sovereignty; redirecting a domestic resource to serve long-term national resilience. Such a framing would resonate with the ethos of Article 33 of the Constitution, which mandates that natural resources be harnessed for the greatest prosperity of the people.

The international community will also be watching closely. How Indonesia manages coal will influence its credibility as a climate actor and shape investor confidence in the broader energy sector. If the country demonstrates that coal revenues are being transparently and strategically reinvested into clean energy, it could unlock greater flows of climate finance, concessional loans and technology partnerships. Conversely, if coal is merely prolonged under the guise of transition, skepticism will grow, potentially deterring the very investment needed to achieve the renewable vision.

The narrative power of repositioning coal lies in turning a liability into leverage. Coal built Indonesia’s industrial past, but it does not have to be an albatross around the neck of its future. By converting its fiscal benefits into renewable investment, transforming its industrial role into higher-value products and using its reserves as a strategic buffer, coal can be recast as an enabler of the clean energy era, rather than its obstacle.

The stakes are high. Indonesia’s aspiration to become a green industrial powerhouse by 2045 will falter if coal is mishandled. But if managed wisely, coal could serve as the launchpad for the next chapter of national development, one in which energy security, economic resilience, and environmental stewardship converge.

In the end, the story of coal in Indonesia will be judged not by how long it persisted, but by how wisely it was repositioned. The clean energy era is not about erasing the past; it is about harnessing it to finance and secure a more sustainable future. Coal lit Indonesia’s path to prosperity. Now it must fund the journey toward sovereignty in a cleaner, more resilient age.",https://cdn.observerid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Feiral-Rizky-Batubara-2.webp,N,,2025-09-14 05:58:35.730966

LAS VEGAS, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Exhibitors at RE+, North America's largest clean energy expo in Las Vegas, warned that U.S. tariffs and policy uncertainty pose major challenges for the global renewable energy industry, disrupting supply chains and complicating project planning.

The expo, held from Monday to Thursday, brought together exhibitors and industry professionals worldwide to showcase the latest solar, wind and energy storage technologies, explore new products, forge partnerships, and discuss trends shaping the renewable energy sector.

Behind the bustling exhibition halls, however, many companies voiced concerns over tariff-driven cost pressures and supply chain disruptions.

""Tariff hikes have brought significant cost pressure, forcing companies to pass the increases on to downstream customers, namely the end consumers,"" said Cheng Wang, CEO of Xenerpower, a Texas-based maker of transformers, switchgears and switchboards.

The uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and clean energy policies, along with rising costs, could severely impact the U.S. clean energy sector, particularly the solar and wind industries, Wang told Xinhua.

""When subsidies were in place, companies could fully cover their costs and even receive additional financial support. Now, with tax incentives removed and stricter approval standards, many projects have been forced to pause or be canceled,"" Wang noted.

For Premier PV, an Arkansas-based solar solutions company, tariffs are complicating component sourcing.

""For the parts and the raw materials, we do have quite a bit of supplies from Europe, the DC feeder cables come from either China or India, and lugs from India,"" said Brian Moore, the company's director of business development.

""There's some tariff the international components will carry ... at one point this year, the tariff went up to 125 percent. It's crazy. But it didn't actually go through, so it got reduced down,"" Moore added.

On U.S. energy policy, Moore said that President Donald Trump's administration has not actively supported renewable energy development.

""Trump keeps fighting against renewable energy. At the same time, for energy independence, the fastest to deploy is generally going to be renewable energy. At least for the next four or five years, we really don't see a way for them to get around it. That's a trend,"" he said.

He added that independent of government subsidies, tech companies with high energy demands -- such as data centers -- are likely to continue pursuing renewable energy projects.

Some companies are taking a wait-and-see approach as they navigate the volatile tariff environment.

Jeannette Holton, senior communications manager at EcoFlow, a multinational specializing in portable power and home solar systems, told Xinhua the company is closely monitoring the situation and will reassess its pricing strategy as needed.

""Our business model isn't really focused on the tariff situation, because we know it's always up and down, and it's constantly changing,"" she said.

Looking ahead, Wang said the future of U.S. clean energy remains uncertain, with corporate planning and investment under heavy pressure. ■",,N,,2025-09-14 06:58:41.840831

Installing solar panels is a great way to reduce your personal planet-warming impact, and it can also save you some money.

In fact, installing solar panels can bring your cost of energy down to nearly $0. EnergySage provides a free service that allows users to compare quotes from vetted local solar installers to save money on solar panel installation.

Going solar can also help reduce the costs of other money-saving electric appliances, like heat pumps or at-home electric vehicle chargers. If you're interested in installing a heat pump, LG can help you find the right heat pump for your home.

As 2025 unfolds, the continued growth and success of renewable power sources signal that these sources are not only important as sources of energy generation, but also essential to mitigate further global heating. Solar and wind have cemented themselves as pillars of the United States' energy portfolio.

In Detail : Union Minister H. D. Kumaraswamy (HDK) announced that fiscal incentives are being planned to encourage domestic production of rare earth magnets. These measures aim to reduce India’s reliance on imports and strengthen the local supply chain for critical materials.

Rare earth magnets are essential for various high-tech applications, including renewable energy, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics. By producing them locally, India can secure strategic resources crucial for industrial growth.

The proposed incentives are expected to make domestic manufacturing financially viable. Support could include tax breaks, subsidies, or capital expenditure assistance to attract investment in rare earth magnet production facilities.

HDK highlighted the importance of developing a robust ecosystem for rare earth materials. Local production of magnets will complement initiatives for mining, refining, and processing critical minerals within India.

Domestic manufacturing is also expected to create employment opportunities across technical, engineering, and production roles. Skill development programs may be integrated to ensure a trained workforce capable of supporting high-precision magnet production.

The move aligns with India’s broader strategic goals of self-reliance in critical technologies. Reducing import dependence strengthens energy security and enhances competitiveness in global high-tech sectors.

Fiscal incentives are likely to attract private sector participation, including both domestic companies and international investors. Public-private partnerships could accelerate capacity building and technology transfer for efficient magnet production.

Industry analysts see this initiative as a key step toward supporting India’s clean energy and electric mobility ambitions.

As buyers race against the clock ahead of the October 1 deadline, projections indicate that while this surge is likely to lead to an immediate influx of EV purchases, a subsequent decline in sales is expected once the incentives are no longer available.

Historically, the financial benefits provided through these tax credits have played a vital role in encouraging consumers to transition to electric vehicles. However, industry analysts suggest that the advantages of owning an EV extend beyond initial incentives. Many new EV owners who are experiencing the benefits of electric driving—such as cost savings on fuel, reduced maintenance needs, and the convenience of home charging—are expected to share their positive experiences with friends and family. This word-of-mouth marketing could catalyze a broader shift in consumer attitudes toward EVs.

As new buyers take the plunge and enjoy the advantages of their electric vehicles, a ripple effect may occur. Those who are influenced by these early adopters—co-workers, friends, and relatives—might become more inclined to consider an EV for their next vehicle purchase, even in the absence of financial incentives. While some consumers may initially hesitate to make a purchase immediately after the credits expire, feeling they may have missed out on savings, the overall awareness and interest in electric vehicles could still lead to additional sales over time.

There is also a discussion around the timing and impact of the EV purchase surge. Some argue that the tax credits, if retained, might support a steadier growth of EV sales over time, easing the transition for consumers. Yet, there’s an interesting perspective suggesting that the accelerated sales during this window could set off a cascading effect as early adopters ignite further interest. This phenomenon could potentially lead to quicker adoption rates among the broader population, pushing society closer to the goal of reaching 50% EV sales sooner.

The potential for a cyclical pattern—where incentives are phased out, leading to an immediate surge, followed by a return of incentives—has also been considered. Such a cycle might not only promote an explosive burst of sales but also ensure renewed support mechanisms for EV buyers in the future.

As the deadline for these financial incentives approaches, the electric vehicle market stands at a pivotal junction, with upcoming consumer behaviors and industry shifts likely to shape the landscape of EV adoption well into the future.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Surge-in-Electric-Vehicle-Purchases-Anticipated-Before-Tax-Credit-Expiration.jpeg,N,,2025-09-14 04:58:03.278924

The European Union has threatened retaliatory tariffs, including on Kentucky bourbon.
What does that mean for Kentucky bourbon makers?","Bankers aren’t typically required to wear a uniform, but for a while, many did: a dark Patagonia vest with a dress shirt and slacks.

The look was so widely associated with finance that it developed a nickname, the “Midtown Uniform,” a reference to the New York City neighborhood known for its many investment banks and law firms. It even had an Instagram account with 168,000 followers.

When he unexpectedly found himself at the helm of a successful clothing company, it provoked an identity crisis of sorts. Even when he couldn’t make payroll, Chouinard refused to accept outside investments or consider an initial public offering. He declined offers to sell the company to Berkshire Hathaway and Ralph Lauren, and early on turned down the promise of a $100 million payday if he let the investment bank Robertson Stephens lead an I.P.O.

Although he ultimately became a billionaire himself, Chouinard boasted of his children that “both believe that billionaires represent a policy failure,” adding: “They were brought up right.”

Patagonia pared back sales to financial and tech firms in 2019, uncomfortable with having its products become hot commodities on Wall Street. Many of those Patagonia vests were issued to interns on orientation day and tossed aside a few months later when the interns moved on to a new job. That kind of disposable mind-set was antithetical to Chouinard, who wanted to make things that lasted a lifetime.

It wasn’t the first time he had deliberately throttled the company’s growth, fearing that it would be impossible to scale the business without compromising his high environmental and ethical standards. In 2011, Patagonia ran an ad in The New York Times that read “Don’t Buy This Jacket.”

And still, the company kept getting bigger, establishing a reputation as a small corporation with a big cultural influence.

Forbes magazine placed Chouinard on its annual list of billionaires in 2017, pegging his net worth at a cool $1 billion.

It made Chouinard livid. “It really, really pissed me off,” he said.

His reaction stood in sharp contrast to most American billionaires, many of whom flaunt their fortunes. But material possessions never meant much to Chouinard, who still lives in a log cabin cluttered with secondhand furniture and cooks off the same cast iron skillet he’s had for 50 years.

In 2022, determined to get off the Forbes list, Chouinard resolved to get rid of his wealth once and for all. He considered selling to a like-minded billionaire, handing ownership of the company over to its employees or reincorporating in Switzerland or Denmark, countries that accommodate charitable corporations.

But none of those options satisfied all of Chouinard’s requirements, which included ridding himself of his billionaire status, protecting the integrity of Patagonia and funneling more money to causes like conservation.

In the end, he and his family took the unusual step of giving away their equity in Patagonia to a new series of trusts and nonprofit organizations that now distribute the company’s profits to environmental activism. (Critics accused them of dodging taxes.)

It was a complex transaction, full of legal intricacies and complex paperwork, and Chouinard and his team didn’t do it alone.

Rather, to figure out how to get the deal done, they hired a merchant bank, BDT — just the kind of place where you’d find analysts wearing the Midtown Uniform.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

The Murdoch family settled a yearslong feud over the future of its media empire. Rupert Murdoch’s elder son, Lachlan, has cemented his place as leader of the powerful conservative media outlet after the family agreed to a multibillion-dollar deal. Three Murdoch siblings — Prue, Liz and James — will get $1.1 billion each for their shares in the family business in return for ending their succession fight.

The Ellison family is said to be eyeing a megamedia roll-up. A deal would combine Paramount Global, the media group controlled by David Ellison, with Warner Bros. Discovery — potentially bringing CNN, CBS News, HBO Max and Paramount Plus under one roof. Shares of both companies rose on the report. It was a momentous week for Ellison’s father, Larry, a co-founder of Oracle, who briefly became the world’s wealthiest man after the tech giant reported a knockout forecast.

Traders upped the odds for interest-rate cuts. The futures market was forecasting yesterday that the Federal Reserve would lower its benchmark lending-rate three times this year after jobless claims rose to a four-year high. That’s even though the Consumer Price Index on Thursday showed inflation on a re-accelerating path. Another factor: The Trump administration moved a step closer to getting Stephen Miran, a close adviser to the president, nominated to the central bank in time for next week’s meeting.

Other big deals: Oracle said it had added hundreds of billions of dollars in future contract revenue during its most recent quarter, sending its shares skyrocketing (and briefly making its co-founder Larry Ellison the world’s richest person). OpenAI took a big step toward reorganizing as a for-profit. Giorgio Armani’s will directs heirs to sell an initial 15 percent stake in his company within 18 months. And Air Taxis get another boost from President Trump.

Kentucky’s governor wants Democrats to get real

And he has become a force for renewable energy development in his coal state. Under his watch over the last six years, Kentucky has attracted two electric vehicle battery plants totaling $8 billion in investment. In August, the governor scored another clean energy victory, securing a $2 billion investment from Ford Motor to remake its Louisville plant into an electric truck hub.

Those investments have helped counter the nearly 15,000 coal jobs lost in the state since 2011. But Beshear’s clean energy agenda faces mounting hurdles. President Trump has pushed forward policies that undercut the electric vehicle industry, creating uncertainty that contributed to a halt in hiring at one of Kentucky’s electric vehicle battery plants.

Beshear spoke to DealBook about his plans to make Kentucky an E.V. powerhouse, whether a 2028 presidential run is on the horizon and what can be done about the rise in political violence. The interview has been condensed and edited.

The Trump administration has cut the federal government’s $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, and many analysts expect sales to dip after it expires. Why make a bet on electric vehicles now?

A lot of people have tried to fight the future, and none of them have ever won. E.V.s are coming. They will be a significant part, if not a dominant part, of the automotive economy.

When I look at the rollback of the E.V. credits, yes, I’m disappointed with the president, but I’m really disappointed with Kentucky Representative Brett Guthrie, who pushed that bill through the House. Guthrie has both Kentucky’s BlueOval battery plant, which will employ 5,000 people, and the Envision plant, which will employ 2,000 people, in his district.

Ford delayed production of its electric truck at the BlueOval plant to 2028. What makes you confident Ford’s latest investment in the state will go through?

You don’t build a multibillion-dollar facility if you’re not going to use it. Ford has repeatedly assured me that it’s only a matter of when, and not a matter of if. I take them at their word. I believe the private sector is showing people very clearly that the economy is and will continue to head in the E.V. direction.

Beyond the electric vehicle industry, President Trump’s tariffs have dealt a blow to your state’s bourbon industry, which produces 95 percent of the world’s bourbon.

The other 5 percent is counterfeit.

Ha. Many Canadian provinces have stopped importing alcoholic beverages from the U.S. The European Union has threatened retaliatory tariffs, including on Kentucky bourbon. What does that mean for Kentucky bourbon makers?

Donald Trump’s tariff policy is the most destructive economic policy I’ve seen in my lifetime. What’s happening with bourbon is both the result of tariffs and the president’s misguided foreign policy. So tariffs are impacting the E.U., and the countermeasures that we’re seeing with bourbon in Canada, it’s primarily that the president has insulted them over and over.

Your podcast was recently picked up by SiriusXM. You’ve said that the show is meant to demonstrate a kind of realness you don’t often see in politicians. What do you mean by that?

Oftentimes all you see from a governor or a senator or even a C.E.O. are their policies. But we need to see each other more as human beings, especially right now.

When we get there, we can create grace and space to disagree on some things, but come together on others. So when I describe the reason that I veto anti-L.G.B.T.Q. legislation, I talk about it being because of my faith. I believe all children are children of God and we shouldn’t be picking on them. That provides a different way that people can hear someone who is disagreeing with them, and help them recognize that they’re maybe doing it for the right reasons.

Do you think Democrats are going to need more of that realness in 2028?

Democrats need to communicate across as many new platforms as possible and haven’t. That’s why I think that Gov. Gavin Newsom’s podcast is really important. Mine tries not to be an overly political voice. I want to make sure it’s a place where people can come and process all this complicated, difficult news.

Are you planning to run in 2028?

Right now I’m out there trying to be a reasonable voice in the chaos, to be a voice of common sense, common ground and getting things done. Next year, I’m fully committed to this job as governor and being the head of the Democratic Governors Association. And then after that, we’ll sit down with my family and I, and we’ll consider it.

Charlie Kirk was assassinated on Wednesday. His killing is the latest incident in a surge of political violence. I’m wondering what you think can be done to address this trend.

What happened yesterday is awful. Leaders have a choice right now to say that violence is wrong no matter who it’s perpetrated against, or to say violence is wrong when it’s perpetrated against people like me or that I agree with now. Now is the time to take the stand to say all of it’s wrong and all of it has to end.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/13/business/13DB-PATAGONIA-VEST2/13DB-PATAGONIA-VEST2-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 00:58:09.898420

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.counton2.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/09/68c5fc454680e4.86648230.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-14 00:58:51.310725

The facility will transform forest byproducts, such as sustainably sourced wood waste and thinnings, into low-carbon fuels like renewable naphtha and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Governor Greg Abbott announced the project in 2022 with an initial $1.7 billion investment, which is expected to create over 140 permanent jobs. USA BioEnergy has secured more than 1,600 acres in Bon Wier for the refinery, aiming to turn an idle property into a clean energy hub by 2025.

The refinery has entered a 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines for up to 680 million gallons of SAF. The facility plans to produce between 34 million and 65 million gallons of renewable fuels annually, contingent on the final design. USA BioEnergy confirmed the implementation of Honeywell’s Experion PKS control system at the Bon Wier plant, with Johnson Matthey also joining as a technology collaborator.

""By utilizing forest thinnings for bioenergy production with carbon capture and sequestration technologies, our integration with technology providers like Honeywell will help us create a fully integrated, alternative fuels solution,"" said Nick Andrews, CEO of USA BioEnergy.

The project is benefiting from approximately $150 million in state, county, and federal credits and tax incentives. Local support includes organizations such as the Texas Forest Country Partnership, Texas Forestry Association, and the City of Newton.

""This advanced-fuels facility development milestone underscores USA BioEnergy’s commitment to the future of aviation and energy security,"" Andrews said in a February statement. ""We also appreciate the opportunity to create good-paying jobs in Newton County, Texas, which has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the state.

Once operational, the plant is expected to employ roughly 200 people full-time, alongside several hundred construction jobs during the build-out phase. The facility will also provide a new market for East Texas forestry byproducts, abundant in Newton and surrounding counties.

Despite the land purchase and new technology partnerships, construction has not yet begun. USA BioEnergy says engineering and design work is ongoing, with construction expected to take about two years once it starts. Full operations are projected for 2028 or 2029.

The auto industry’s landscape is shifting fast, and not just because of new models or tech. Donald Trump’s rollback of emissions standards and the elimination of federal EV tax credits have thrown a wrench into the works—especially for companies that bet big on electric vehicles. If you’re wondering who’s winning, who’s losing, and what it means for the cars you’ll see on the road, let’s break it down.

Why Are Ford, GM, and Stellantis Suddenly Saving Billions?

For years, automakers like Ford, GM, and Stellantis had to pay up—big time—if they didn’t meet federal fuel economy targets. The system worked like this: if a company sold too many gas-guzzlers, it had to buy regulatory credits from brands with cleaner fleets, like Tesla and Rivian. According to Bloomberg, GM alone shelled out $3.5 billion on credits since 2022. Ford and Stellantis? Also in the billions.

But with Trump’s rollback, the financial penalty for missing those targets is gone. That means Detroit’s Big Three can focus on their bread and butter—trucks and SUVs—without worrying about writing checks to their rivals. Ford CEO Jim Farley even called it a “multibillion-dollar opportunity,” and the company’s already retooling its Oakville plant to build Super Duty pickups instead of EVs. GM is scaling back EV production, and Stellantis is bringing back the Hemi V8. It’s like the clock just turned back a decade.

What’s the Fallout for Tesla, Rivian, and Smaller EV Startups?

Here’s where things get dicey. Tesla and Rivian didn’t just make money selling cars—they made a killing selling those regulatory credits. With that revenue stream drying up, Tesla could lose over $1 billion a year, according to industry estimates. For startups, the picture is even bleaker. Take Slate, for example. Their affordable electric truck was counting on the $7,500 federal tax credit to stay competitive. Now, with a sticker price near $30,000 and no tax break, their business model looks shaky at best.

It’s not just about lost profits. The end of tax credits makes EVs less attractive to buyers, especially in a market where price is king. Smaller brands that don’t have the deep pockets of Ford or GM may struggle to survive. We could see some names disappear before they ever really get started.

Is the EPA Abandoning Its Own Mission?

This is where the story takes a twist. The Environmental Protection Agency’s mission is crystal clear: protect human health and the environment. Yet, by supporting the rollback of emissions standards, the agency is doing the opposite. The EPA’s own website debunks myths about EVs—like the idea that they’re worse for the climate or will crash the power grid. In fact, J.D. Power and other analysts have shown that EVs are cheaper to own over the long haul when you factor in fuel and maintenance.

So why the about-face? Critics argue that the EPA is now prioritizing political directives over its stated mission. The result? Automakers are free to build more polluting vehicles, and consumers lose out on billions in potential savings. It’s a head-scratcher, especially when the science on emissions and public health is so clear.

What Does This Mean for Consumers and the Environment?

If you’re in the market for a new car, you’ll notice the difference. Expect more choices in trucks and SUVs, fewer affordable EVs, and less incentive to go electric. For the environment, the stakes are even higher. The rollback could lead to higher emissions, more fuel burned, and a slower transition to cleaner transportation.

But here’s the thing—change in the auto industry is never a straight line. Consumer demand, state-level policies, and global trends still matter. California and several other states are pushing ahead with stricter standards, and the global market for EVs is growing, especially in Europe and China. Automakers who ignore those trends do so at their own risk.

The big takeaway? Navigating the new rules of the road isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments. Start with one change this week, and you’ll likely spot the difference by month’s end. Whether you’re a car buyer, an industry insider, or just someone who cares about clean air, staying informed—and flexible—will put you in the driver’s seat.",https://www.globalvillagespace.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/trump-emissions-rollback-reshapes-auto-industry-winners-and-losers.avif,N,,2025-09-14 08:59:31.825683

According to Canary Media, leaders in the state's energy sector filed an urgent request Aug. 22 asking regulators to expedite approvals for new renewable projects. Just five days later, the utilities commission approved an accelerated timeline for permitting and construction, a rare move for state energy regulators.

The plan would finalize approvals by mid-2026 for 4 gigawatts of new wind and solar power, 200 megawatts of thermal power, and 300 megawatts of battery storage. Colorado already has 5 gigawatts of wind and 4.5 gigawatts of solar installed, meaning this expansion could significantly boost the state's capacity to deliver affordable, reliable clean energy before the Trump administration's new energy-constraining laws take effect.

The clear threat of higher energy prices caused by the administration's policies has created a rare alignment of interests among utility providers and ratepayer advocates to take advantage of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits right now.

Colorado's largest utility provider, Xcel Energy, stated that the accelerated plan could save customers $5 billion over the next two decades, providing critical relief as electricity demand rises faster than it has in decades. More clean power means less reliance on volatile coal and gas prices, helping protect residents from future price spikes.

Wind, solar, and storage projects can also significantly reduce planet-overheating pollution, lower air pollution from dirty energy plants, and make communities more resilient as demand for power surges from electric vehicles and costly data centers.

Colorado's push is being watched closely across the country. California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed a similar executive order to help projects meet expiring federal deadlines.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis urged authorities to ""eliminate administrative barriers and bottlenecks for renewable projects,"" adding that ""getting this right is of critical importance to Colorado ratepayers; by maximizing the utilization of tax credits while they're available and reducing future tariff uncertainty, the State can avoid billions of dollars in additional energy costs for decades to come.""

The Department of Transportation on Friday said the Federal Aviation Administration's Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) will develop ""new frameworks and regulations for enabling safe operations"" and form partnerships with private sector companies as well as with state and local governments.

""The next great technological revolution in aviation is here,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement on Friday. ""The United States will lead the way, and doing so will cement America's status as a global leader in transportation innovation. That means more high-paying manufacturing jobs and economic opportunity.""

The program will include at least five pilot projects and will run for three years after the first project is up and running, the department said. The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies. The aircraft will also be used to test their effectiveness in emergency situations, such as airlift and medical transport.

The program would allow the testing of aircraft both unmanned and piloted, and which may be capable of carrying passengers, before they complete FAA certification, a process that can take years. Aircraft must have FAA certification before carrying cargo or passengers when flying commercially, according to federal regulations.

This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.

In June 2023, the FAA greenlit a plan from Joby Aviation, a California-based aviation company, to begin test flights of an electric flying taxi prototype. The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.

""We've spent more than 15 years building the aircraft technology and operational capabilities that are defining advanced aerial mobility, and we're ready to bring our services to communities,"" Joby's chief policy officer Greg Bowles said in a statement. ""We look forward to demonstrating our aircraft's maturity and delivering early operations in cities and states nationwide.""

Another company, Archer Aviation, also said Friday that it plans to participate in the program.

""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement. ""These early flights will help cement American leadership in advanced aviation and set the stage for scaled commercial operations in the U.S. and beyond.""

The FAA said it is accepting proposals and a minimum of five participants will be selected, according to an unpublished federal notice about the program that is set to become public on Tuesday.

""For consumers, any increase in supply costs or materials increases the overall cost of putting solar panels on your roof,"" Crouch told Insurance Business.
Why do rising insurance prices for renewable energy projects matter?
While U.S. renewable-energy investment dropped by $20 billion, the world saw overall investment grow by 10% to a record $386 billion, according to BloombergNEF.
Taking things a step further, you can help by installing solar panels on your home now before Crouch's predicted insurance crunch becomes more severe.","With the federal government rolling back billions of dollars in incentives for renewable-energy development, experts have sounded the alarm over a widely overlooked yet highly likely impact: rising insurance costs.

What's happening?

In addition to ending significant tax incentives previously available to projects ranging in scale from home solar installations to massive wind farms, increased tariffs also have made it more expensive to purchase necessary materials, Canaan Crouch, the executive vice president and environmental broker at Jencap Specialty Insurance Services, told Insurance Business.

As a result, investors have significantly scaled back on renewable-energy development in the United States. According to BloombergNEF, in the first half of 2025, such investments dropped a staggering 36% from just a year prior, a loss of more than $20 billion in funding.

Crouch warned that the impact on consumers likely would be even greater and more immediate than on utility-scale projects.

""For consumers, any increase in supply costs or materials increases the overall cost of putting solar panels on your roof,"" Crouch told Insurance Business. ""So, consumers are probably seeing a bigger impact.""

On top of these direct effects, Crouch cautioned that these industry-wide changes also would have important secondary impacts, such as in the insurance market.

For example, when a homeowner decides to install solar panels on their roof, they must find an insurance carrier that is willing to cover the project's risks. The rising cost of even such small-scale projects has made insurers more hesitant to do so.

""Stay informed about what's happening with subsidies, tariffs, and inflationary pressures, because those are the factors that directly shape the risks we're insuring,"" cautioned Crouch, per Insurance Business.

With fewer carriers willing to insure such projects, prices for such coverage will inevitably increase, Crouch predicted.

While the market has yet to reflect such pressures, Crouch warned, ""If I had to read the tea leaves, there's going to be an increase in price.""

Why do rising insurance prices for renewable energy projects matter?

The impact that government policies have on insurance prices, and the ability to get insurance coverage at all, has been an overlooked yet significant aspect of the current administration's recent changes.

If individuals and companies are unable to insure renewable-energy projects, or if the cost of doing so rises significantly, fewer homeowners will be able to install solar panels, and fewer utility-scale renewable-energy projects will be built.

The result will not only hinder efforts to transition the U.S. economy toward cleaner, renewable sources of energy but likely will harm the nation's economy as a whole.

Even as renewable-energy investments in the U.S. cratered by more than one-third, such investments globally reached record highs, per BloombergNEF. This has put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage and puts the country at risk of falling behind in the energy revolution taking place throughout much of the world.

While U.S. renewable-energy investment dropped by $20 billion, the world saw overall investment grow by 10% to a record $386 billion, according to BloombergNEF.

Simply put, renewable-energy investors put off by recent changes in U.S. policy have found other countries to invest in.

As companies and countries around the globe continue to race for supremacy in artificial intelligence, powering the massive, energy-hungry data centers that make AI possible has become a key distinguishing factor. If the U.S. continues to fall behind on building the power sources of the future, it could significantly hurt the country's ability to compete in the AI race.

What's being done about it?

For the U.S. to once again shift course and regain its momentum in the transition toward cleaner, renewable sources of energy will require change at the political level.

To help make this happen, you can use your voice by contacting your elected representatives and letting them know where you stand on issues like renewable-energy tax incentives and tariffs on materials used in renewable-energy development. And, when election season rolls around, you also can make a difference by voting for candidates who share your views.

Taking things a step further, you can help by installing solar panels on your home now before Crouch's predicted insurance crunch becomes more severe.

EnergySage offers free online tools that make it easy to compare quotes from local solar installers and to take advantage of available incentives.

Gavin Newsom has championed as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks is in the hands of state lawmakers.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature is slated to vote Saturday on whether to extend the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013. It allows major greenhouse gas emitters to buy emission allowances from the state, with fewer available over time. Money from the sales fund climate change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution - all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said after striking the deal this week.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature will vote on another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

Cap and trade is an important cost-effective tool for curbing carbon emissions, said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, the California state director for the Environmental Defense Fund.

“Supporting this program and making this commitment into the future is extremely important - now more than ever,” she said.

But environmental justice advocates opposing the proposal say it doesn’t go far enough and lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This really continues to allow big oil to reduce their emissions on paper instead of in real life,” said Asha Sharma, state policy manager at the Leadership Council for Justice and Accountability.

Critics have also said it will increase the cost of living.

“This moving forward, instead of lowering costs, it makes California even more expensive,” Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland said. “They’re raising the price of energy and gas and goods and services.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It’s played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would streamline permits for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The state could refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers will also vote on a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/09/13/California_Legislature_93316_c0-370-7547-4772_s1200x700.jpg?92f64011319994b084bf1a50ddc7b2baf746a509,N,,2025-09-14 00:58:39.504362

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal would see industrial facilities like coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, and steel mills no longer have to track and report the amount of carbon dioxide, methane, and other emissions they emit—a requirement that had been in place since 2010.

The agency said that U.S. businesses could save as much as $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over the next decade as a result of the change. Some experts have argued that the societal costs of emissions from companies in the U.S. could run into the tens of trillions by 2050.

The EPA in its release said that requiring facilities to report emissions had “no material impact on improving human health and the environment.” It comes after months of work by the Trump administration to dismantle various federal programs designed to combat climate change and cuts to research funding to study the phenomenon.

The administration’s efforts to pull back on climate change is at odds with the broad scientific consensus that human-driven warming is linked to extreme weather and health risks. A study published in Nature this past week, for example, showed that 180 of the world’s biggest fossil fuel and cement producers made 213 extreme heatwaves between 2000 and 2023 more likely and more dangerous.

What does greenhouse gas reporting do?

Since 2010, the greenhouse gas reporting program has collected emissions data from about 8,000 of the largest industrial facilities in the U.S. from 47 different source categories. In turn, this information has historically been shared with the United Nations, but for the first time in nearly 30 years, the Trump administration missed an April deadline to submit data on U.S. climate emissions.

As part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the United Nations has required industrialized countries to reduce their emissions to combat climate change. U.S. President Donald Trump announced on his first day in office that the U.S. would withdraw from this agreement for the second time (Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement during his first term).

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, said in a statement. “Instead, it costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities.”

“Unlike other mandatory information collections under the Clean Air Act, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment. By reducing the overall regulatory burden, current regulated parties will be able to focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits,” an EPA spokesperson told Fast Company in a statement.

Certain oil and gas facilities will still be required to report emissions data as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, although the EPA’s proposal would allow these facilities to suspend reporting until 2034.

Critics point to cost of losing data

Environmental advocates criticized the proposal as hampering future policy making.

“With this move, they’re taking away the practical and material capacity of the federal government to do the basic elements of climate policymaking,” a former EPA official under the Biden administration told The New York TImes.

The proposal would eliminate data that the public, states, and local policymakers have depended on for more than 15 years, leaving Americans “in the dark” about where pollution is coming from, David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, told The Associated Press.

Before this proposal is finalized, the EPA will hold a virtual public hearing and accept public comments for 47 days after the proposal is published in the Federal Register.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/09/p-91404426-EPA-to-stop-recording-emissions.jpg",N,,2025-09-13 20:01:20.590584

Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines.","Gov. Gavin Newsom closed out the legislative year with one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades — a package that could give him a presidential debate-stage talking point on rising energy costs as the Democratic Party shifts its focus to affordability.

The six-bill deal — passed Saturday after lawmakers extended their session by an extra day because of last-minute dealmaking — was sold as a way to ease gas prices and soaring electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs.

Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills. They also will get some protection from utilities hiking rates based on the cost of wildfire-proofing their infrastructure, such as by putting power lines underground. But they’ll also continue paying $9 billion over the next decade into a fund to compensate wildfire victims.

The package of legislation now heads to the governor’s desk for his signature.

Newsom and his allies, who negotiated the package in the final days of the legislative session, said the state needed to allow more permits to drill oil to head off more refinery shutdowns that could send gas prices soaring.

Critics said the biggest winners of the maneuvering were the oil industry and the state’s major utilities. Oil drilling measures advanced in Kern County after refiners threatened to shutter plants. Utilities gained sweeping new wildfire liability protections and the ability to join a regional power market — a step critics warned could tether California to fossil-fuel states at a time when the Trump administration is moving to roll back clean energy.

Michael Wara, a Stanford legal scholar focused on energy policy, called it “astonishing” that lawmakers managed to pass so many major bills at once, including the two-thirds vote to reauthorize cap-and-trade. California is making steady progress in shifting from fossil fuels to renewables, even as wildfires complicate the transition, and while the measures were imperfect, they were necessary, he said.

“I’ve been a part, over the last decade, of getting individual tweaks done in each of these areas — but the idea that we would get them all done at once, on time, when we needed to, is astonishing to me,” Wara said. “Are the bills perfect? No, from my perspective they’re not perfect, but they are all material improvements over the status quo.”

The future of cap and trade reinforced

At the center of the bargain was the extension of California’s cap-and-trade system — rebranded by Newsom as “cap and invest” — through 2045. The extension, hammered out in backroom talks, was one of the most divisive elements of the package.

The carbon-trading program, launched in 2013, is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The program sets a strict cap on emissions for polluters and hands out a limited supply of permits companies can sell to other polluters if they cut enough emissions.

The final agreement on the program preserved rules that let oil companies avoid paying the full cost of their emissions while leaving untouched a cap on carbon prices. That setup shields polluters while leaving consumers potentially exposed to higher gas prices, experts said.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas stood by the energy package on Saturday, arguing the measure to boost in-state oil production and keep refineries from closing would keep prices down at the pump. “Altogether,” he told reporters, the deal “is going to result in some billions of dollars in savings.”

The California Chamber of Commerce was out front in opposing the cap and trade deal, arguing it would make energy less affordable by taking credits away from gas customers and giving them to electric utilities — hurting families, renters, and small businesses that still depend on natural gas. The powerful business group has poured at least $6.9 million into legislative races over the past decade, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.

The oil industry’s chief lobbying group, the Western States Petroleum Association, which had pushed back early on, eventually settled into neutrality. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates remained staunchly against it, saying the program protects oil and gas companies while leaving nearby low-income communities to bear the health costs of pollution.

A group of seven environmental justice groups from across the state, including Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Asian Pacific Environmental Network Action, said the extension “institutionalizes inequality in California’s climate policy.”

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” the groups said.

Alongside reauthorization of the program, a companion bill provided a blueprint for how the state should spend its revenues, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget.

Questioning the affordability premise

The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt. Affordability has become the defining fault line in Democratic politics since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, powered by a campaign fixated on cutting costs and fighting inflation.

At the same time, Democrats are leaning into the rhetoric of “abundance,” a term popularized by columnist Ezra Klein to capture the idea that more housing, clean energy and infrastructure can ease scarcity and lower costs. But some consumer advocates and Capitol insiders argue the measures won’t ultimately help consumers.

“I don’t know how any of this saves money,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “But this is the new state of Sacramento. I think it happened because of Trump, honestly, I think this is all about abundance and Trump, and Democrats trying to make a name for themselves by dumping regulation.”

Republicans, too, slammed the package, but they called it over-regulation that would continue to keep gas and energy costs high. Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, called Democrats’ goals of using the cap-and-trade dollars to improve transit “unrealistic” when Californians “are not going to give up driving their cars,” and said the party’s stated three goals can’t coexist.

“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said. “People aren’t going to be able to live here.”

Newsom’s push to keep gasoline prices and energy bills in check — a message potentially aimed as much at a national audience in a future presidential bid as at Californians — meshed with Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas’s early pledge to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.”

Meanwhile, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and his team resisted giving ground to oil and gas interests without securing gains for environmental and social justice priorities, given the concentration of polluting industries and poor air quality in low-income communities.

Cap-and-trade renewal took on urgency as carbon auctions faltered and Trump singled out the program — originally set to expire in 2030 — as potentially unconstitutional.

A ‘giveaway to big oil’?

At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind. After blasting the industry as deceitful and politically manipulative for years, Newsom reversed course. His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.

While much of the governor’s original oil refinery proposal was pared back in the Legislature, drilling approvals advanced in Kern County. That was a victory for Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, who represents the county. Grove has spent a decade pushing to keep drilling and its middle-class jobs alive there.

The approved oil permits, she said, “will result in California-compliant oil that is the most regulated in the world.”

Nevertheless, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, criticized the oil deal from the Assembly floor Saturday as a “giveaway to big oil.”

“The thing we need to focus on is a controlled and managed phaseout of fossil fuel, like the dinosaurs that they process, the petroleum-oil, fossil-fuel industry fuel is dying out,” Lee said. “Refineries and facilities are closing, not just in California, but in Texas and across the world.”

Lawmakers also established a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.

Layered onto those debates was a high-stakes battle over utility finances. Wildfire liabilities loomed over investor-owned utilities, especially Southern California Edison, now under scrutiny for its potential role in the Eaton Fire in Altadena. Newsom pressed to expand California’s $18 billion wildfire fund — a safeguard supporters said was vital to protect ratepayers if utilities sparked future blazes, but one that critics warned could ultimately drive consumer bills higher.

Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines. Supporters say it could cut costs for customers and steady the grid during crunch times like heat waves, while supporting in-state clean power producers who could sell excess electricity to neighbors.

Consumer advocates, led by The Utility Reform Network, warned the change could weaken California’s control over its clean energy agenda and hand more power to a federal government under Trump that is siding with fossil fuels. Some environmental and consumer groups shared that concern.

The shift is important because California has spent decades building one of the cleanest grids in the world and the move to open up that system to other Western states could reshape how both renewable and fossil power move across the region.

This led Ørsted to sue the Trump administration in September, in a bid to get the project moving again.
In September, the Trump administration instructed around half a dozen government agencies to draft plans to restrict U.S. wind energy development, as Trump labelled wind farms as ugly, expensive, and inefficient.
Agencies that have traditionally had little to do with wind energy have been called upon to support efforts to restrict the development of offshore wind farms.
Several agencies are expected to assess their existing policies to see if there are any that are favourable for wind energy development that could be redirected to other forms of energy, particularly fossil fuels.","The Danish wind giant Ørsted is fighting for its survival after United States President Donald Trump introduced a barrage of orders limiting the growth of the wind power sector. After declaring an energy emergency in the U.S. upon entering office in January, Trump has spent the past eight months introducing executive orders and legislation to strengthen fossil fuel production and limit the expansion of the renewable energy sector. This has led to greater investor uncertainty and has caused project delays and financial harm to green energy producers.

In January, Trump ordered a review of offshore wind permitting and leasing, and in the months since he has introduced a host of orders and laws aimed at curbing wind energy development, which have led to the halt of several major projects, In August, Europe’s largest wind power company, Ørsted, released a statement blaming President Trump for derailing its business model after its market value dropped by nearly a third. It is now fighting to get its business on track.

Ørsted received approval from shareholders for its $9.4 billion rights issue in early September. The company was forced to raise new capital after its profits fell in recent months due to project delays and investor uncertainty, among other factors. The Trump administration halted work on Ørsted’s 704-MW Revolution Windfarm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut in August, despite the company holding project permits and works being around 80 percent complete.

This led Ørsted to sue the Trump administration in September, in a bid to get the project moving again. Orsted requested that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismiss the stop-work order, saying it was arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, and “issued in bad faith”. Orsted and its partner Skyborn Renewables have already invested $5 billion in Revolution Wind, a project which is expected to provide power for over 350,000 homes in the region.

Norway’s wind giant Equinor was one of the companies to support Ørsted’s search for capital, offering $1 billion in funding to help keep it afloat. In a bid of confidence, Equinor said it planned to retain its 10 percent ownership of Ørsted, which it completed last December, making it the second-largest shareholder after the Danish government. The Norwegian firm said it was confident in Ørsted’s underlying business and the competitiveness of offshore wind in the future energy mix. As part of the move, Equinor plans to nominate a candidate to Ørsted’s board of directors.

Ørsted’s shares have fallen in recent months in the face of various challenges, mainly centred around U.S. policy decisions. The firm’s share prices have decreased by around 90 percent from the 2021 peak. The support from Equinor has made some in the industry question whether the two companies could be heading towards a merger.

It is not just Ørsted that has been hit hard by Trump’s attack on the renewable energy sector. President Trump has long hailed the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the most far-reaching climate policy to date, a “Green New Scam. Greatest scam in history, probably.” His blatant attack on green energy from the moment he entered office, and even before, on his campaign trail, has led to greater investor uncertainty in the sector. Many renewable energy producers and cleantech companies now fear cuts in funding and project delays, after several years of high investment and the rapid acceleration of green energy deployment.

In September, the Trump administration instructed around half a dozen government agencies to draft plans to restrict U.S. wind energy development, as Trump labelled wind farms as ugly, expensive, and inefficient. Agencies that have traditionally had little to do with wind energy have been called upon to support efforts to restrict the development of offshore wind farms. At the Health and Human Services Department, officials are now assessing whether wind turbines are emitting electromagnetic fields harmful to human health, while the Department of Defence (War) is probing whether wind projects could pose a threat to national security.

Following the instruction, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. said he was working with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth as part of a “departmental coalition team” to assess the risks from offshore wind farms. “We’re all working together on this issue,” Kennedy said during a cabinet meeting.

Several agencies are expected to assess their existing policies to see if there are any that are favourable for wind energy development that could be redirected to other forms of energy, particularly fossil fuels. The move will build on previous actions by the Trump administration to curb U.S. wind energy development in favour of oil, gas, and coal, as President Trump looks to largely undo the groundwork laid by the Biden administration for a green transition.

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said after striking the deal this week.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said the extension balanced the state’s ambitious emission-reduction and affordability goals. The Democrat called cap and trade “the cornerstone of our climate strategy.”

But environmental justice advocates opposing the proposal say it doesn’t go far enough and lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This really continues to allow big oil to reduce their emissions on paper instead of in real life,” said Asha Sharma, state policy manager at the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.

GOP lawmakers say cap-and-trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2025/09/68c5f1c4d41f06.27666104.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-13 19:00:44.176473

The development of a next-generation thermal fluid, called Shell EV-Plus, promises to recharge batteries from 10% to 80% in less than 10 minutes without compromising safety or cell life.

Shell fluid accelerates electric car charging

The breakthrough was made possible by a joint venture between Shell Lubricants and RML Group, a British company specializing in automotive innovation. Together they designed a 34-kWh battery pack that incorporates this thermal fluid based on gas-to-liquid (GTL) technology. (GTL) TECHNOLOGY. This combination allows higher charging currents to be tolerated with precise thermal control.

Under optimal conditions, a light, aerodynamic vehicle consuming 10 km/kWh could recover up to 24 km of range for every minute connected to the charger. This figure far exceeds the 5 km per minute typical of many current models, representing a significant improvement in range per charge time.

The key to performance lies in the ability of the Shell EV-Plus fluid to fill all spaces within the battery pack, maximizing contact with each cell and ensuring efficient heat transfer. Its non-conductive nature allows it to maintain electrical electrical safety while managing the heat generated during fast charging.

Safety and more compact design

In addition to shortening charging times, this breakthrough makes it possible to design more compact battery packs with fewer components and greater thermal stability. This translates into propulse and safer battery packs, suitable for the next generation of electric vehicles.

Shell will showcase this innovation in October during The Battery Show North America in Detroit, one of the most relevant events in the industry. The initiative reinforces Shell’s commitment to the electrification of transportation and the development of solutions that drive the mass adoption of electric vehicles worldwide.

And several new projects in Europe have started the process of eliminating our reliance on oil and gas. The fact that it is right beneath the sea only makes this new development more exciting. TotalEnergies and Air Liquide plan to develop two projects that will deliver about 45,000 t/year of green hydrogen for our ever-growing energy needs. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and only requires some special attention to become the fuel of the future.

The Netherlands has become the home of renewable energy production

That can only become a reality when the system comes online, and like Skynet in the Terminator, it could change the world forever, only this time in a positive way. TotalEnergies has signed agreements with Air Liquide to develop two projects that could aim to tap into the natural reserves of hydrogen sitting in the sea just waiting for us to find them.

The power will be generated mostly by the OranjeWind offshore wind farm in the Dutch North Sea, and plans to transport the green hydrogen via a pipeline inland towards the Hydrogen Network Rotterdam grid. It forms part of the new trajectory that the Netherlands is heading towards in sustainable energy solutions that meet and exceed the world’s energy needs.

The joint venture plans to construct and operate a 250-MW electrolyzer near the Zeeland refinery in the southern Netherlands, which could be commissioned in 2029, and reduce the site’s CO2 emissions by up to 300,000 t/year. Those are some impressive numbers that will surely drive the world’s big oil companies absolutely insane.

The world is pivoting towards hydrogen as the fuel of the future

Our reliance on fossil fuels needs to end; we are all acutely aware of that truth. Uncomfortable as it may be, the truth hardly spares a moment to consider how we might feel. But the new joint venture is a step towards a sustainable future that all of us, and our descendants, can enjoy and be an active part of. The project has been given the green light and has the world eagerly awaiting the first phase.

To make the deal even sweeter, TotalEnergies has signed a tolling agreement for 130 MW to be dedicated to producing 15,000 t/year of green hydrogen for the TotalEnergies platform in Antwerp. So the project is aiming to enter the rest of Europe as well. How will the Europeans react to a whole new mode of energy production that comes from the sea?

While the Netherlands is a small country, they have significant interests in renewable and sustainable energy production, and no matter who you ask, hydrogen is the most viable fuel source for the world’s needs. We just need a practical method of extraction and storage, and then we are off to the races, as they say. It’s a promising sign to see some of the world’s largest energy companies making significant investments in sustainable energy.
