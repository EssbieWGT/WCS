Rader is supporting a Republican-backed effort to introduce more community renewable energy projects in Ohio.","Editor's note: This is part two of the three-part ""State of Energy"" series from WOSU. Look for part three tomorrow.

The air quality in Ohio is getting worse.

Brittany Sinzinger has been the executive director for the American Lung Association of Columbus for 13 years.

“If you look at our newest report, the 26th annual ""State of Air"" report that came out, it is showing that about 50% of the population is breathing air that is not good for them,"" Sinzinger said.

Several Ohio metro areas made the lung association’s top 25 list for worst year-round particle pollution, including Cincinnati, Cleveland and Akron.

The lung association ranks the air quality in Columbus as an overall “C,” but it gets an “F” for particle pollution.

Sinzinger said there’s a reason these particles and the human body shouldn’t mix.

“They are various sizes, so there are teeny, teeny, tiny ones and then there are some that are larger and when we inhale those, the larger ones, our bodies are made to expel those so we cough or we sneeze, but there's tiny, tiny little particles that can wedge themselves down into our lungs and get into that tissue and that can be very dangerous for people,"" Sinzinger said.

Particle pollution has a bigger impact on the human body than other types of pollution like ozone. It's the most dangerous type of air pollution to human health, according to the lung association. The pollution can cause lung cancer, asthma, heart attack, stroke and can impair cognitive function.

As previously written in part one of this series on Monday, Ohio was supposed to generate 25% percent of its energy with renewable sources by 2025. It’s 2025, and the state has only reached a fifth of that goal.

After that bipartisan goal was made in 2008, the fossil fuel lobby and global forces shifted state energy policy against the renewable market. Experts report the move hurt a once-growing industry in Ohio, and damaged public health and the environment.

Some industries create more particle pollution than others.

Sinzinger said factories, power plants, manufacturing, vehicles powered by diesel and gasoline and anything that burns raw materials on a large scale create the large particles that are bad for human health.

These bad particles can blow in from production centers elsewhere and can get trapped because of geological features of the land.

Ohio's electric power sector is one of the state’s most emissive because of how much coal is still in the mix, and coal power plants are a top producer of particulate pollution, according to the National Institute of Health. Researchers there found a direct correlation between burning coal and increased mortality rates.

Ohio House Rep. Tristan Rader, Parma-D, said fossil fuel companies have had a stranglehold over Ohio’s politicians, on both sides of the aisle.

“I think it's just total utility capture,"" Rader said. ""Total utility regulatory capture and then their ability to just throw enough money around to always get politicians on their side to get done whatever they need to get done until whatever they don't like.”

Rader said energy companies have been too cozy with lawmakers in the past.

“I look at it as just way too much money influence with the utilities here in Ohio,"" Rader said.

Ohio’s energy users only get 4% of their energy from renewable sources, putting it 44th in the country.

Renewable sources produce less particle emissions and have less energy loss.

Jeff Bielicki is the research lead at Ohio State University’s Sustainability Institute. He said the state hasn’t balanced the environmental and health concerns with the economics of its energy policies, but has only focused on the ability of utility companies to make a profit.

“We need to consider the air that we breathe, the water that we drink, and so on, and how that sustains our well-being. The environment is an important component of our well being. The economy is also an important component of well being, the ability to make money, have a job, is an important component of well being too,"" Bielicki said.

Bielicki warns that climate change is also putting more demand on our energy usage.

“It's clear that temperatures are getting hotter on average over time, which leads to more demand for cooling, air conditioning, for example, and all else equal less demand for heating. Because temperatures are warmer. And that, in essence, shifts the demand profile from heating,"" Bielicki said.

Energy sources like natural gas are easily converted into heat, but more resources are needed to create electricity to power cooling systems.

Restrictions on the renewable energy industry in some states have prevented the generation of much needed electricity by alternative sources, prompting states like Pennsylvania to delay closing coal power plants.

Demands on the power grid are growing, and Ohio lawmakers say they’re now embracing all energy sources.

“I think there's this new willingness to push back the utilities that have gone way too far for way too long, and we need to make sure that we represent the people that live in our districts, (and) that deserve protection and deserve monopolies be held accountable,” Rader said.

Rader is supporting a Republican-backed effort to introduce more community renewable energy projects in Ohio.

“The economics of these projects being kind of efficient, not having to rely on the transmission grid, or not having you bid into this giant system, there's a little bit of savings that folks can get,"" Rader said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18a6f82/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4624x2428+0+522/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F88%2F7887059546f7b6cece9a43faadfb%2Futility-lines.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 05:57:54.592948

But it’s a competitive business, with other states and municipalities courting the same data centers.

Northern Indiana Public Service Co. is launching a spinoff company, GenCo, that is exempt from many of the regulatory proceedings typically required before power plants can be built in the state. The utility, also known as NIPSCO, says that this will allow the new entity to quickly provide the copious amounts of energy that data centers need without pushing excessive costs onto other consumers.

But the move is raising alarm bells for watchdog groups and other critics, who argue that rather than protect consumers, the plan will mainly enrich the utility’s parent company while interfering with market competition and undercutting important regulatory safeguards. It could also set back the state’s clean-energy transition, advocates say.

As regulators around the country wrestle with how to get a lot of power online quickly to serve ​“hyperscaler” AI data centers, other utilities may be looking at NIPSCO’s ​“unique arrangement” as ​“a model for how to maximize profits while meeting new data-center demand,” said Emily Piontek, a regulatory associate at the nonprofit Clean Grid Alliance.

Beating other states in the data-center race

Indiana is attractive to huge data centers because of its cheap land, ample water, special state tax breaks on equipment and energy, and access to both the PJM Interconnection and Midcontinent Independent System Operator regional electric grids. The State Utility Forecasting Group at Purdue University recently predicted that data centers will almost double Indiana’s energy demand by 2035.

NIPSCO highlighted that boom to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission during the case proceedings to create GenCo. Vincent Parisi, president and CEO of both NIPSCO and GenCo, told regulators about the sheer number of requests the utility has gotten from potential ​“megaload” customers, generally data centers, seeking hundreds or even thousands of megawatts of electricity.

But it’s a competitive business, with other states and municipalities courting the same data centers. NIPSCO says that providing new power quickly, through GenCo, will be key to securing the deals.

The regulatory commission agreed with this reasoning, writing in its September order approving the GenCo plan, ​“The evidence shows that megaload customers are sophisticated and have many choices available to them when determining where to make developments.” The commission added that relinquishing its jurisdiction over aspects of GenCo ​“will enable NIPSCO to support Indiana’s efforts to compete with other states to attract this economic development.”

Will GenCo help or hurt Indiana households?

Nationwide, regulators and advocates have grappled with concerns that residential customers could pick up too much of the tab for new generation built to power data centers, especially if the computing warehouses don’t materialize or don’t use as much power as predicted.

NIPSCO says GenCo will protect customers from such costs since it will be responsible for providing the data centers with power. That means those expenses won’t be rolled into the rates paid by other NIPSCO consumers, the utility says.

But Citizens Action Coalition, the state’s main consumer-advocacy group, argues that the GenCo structure doesn’t really insulate customers from the risks of the data-center market.

If GenCo were to lose money, that could affect the finances and credit rating of parent company NiSource and hence impact NIPSCO’s customers, said Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson. And he worries some costs of data-center power infrastructure could still be passed on to residential customers, hidden in an opaque process created specifically for GenCo.

In September, the state regulatory commission exempted GenCo from a host of usual procedures. Chief among them is that GenCo does not have to file a detailed plan when it wants to build or acquire new generation. The commission did not set any minimum standards or requirements regarding how power will be provided to data centers, as advocates had hoped. Instead, the commission will review each proposed contract between NIPSCO and a data center, and the related power purchase agreement between NIPSCO and GenCo.

The Citizens Action Coalition called this case-by-case review process unfair and inefficient, making it too difficult for stakeholders to monitor the situation and submit public comments to the commission.

“Every single time a data center comes online, there’s another case; there’s no minimum criteria or boxes that need to be checked,” said Olson. ​“I know they’re claiming costs won’t be passed on to ratepayers, but we’ve been around the block. When you have what will likely be confidential special contracts, everything redacted, it’s going to be really challenging for stakeholders to dive into the details to ensure that none of these costs are being passed on.”

NIPSCO declined to answer questions but referred Canary Media to a press release quoting Lloyd Yates, NiSource president and CEO, regarding the regulatory commission’s decision.

“This is an important step forward to position Northern Indiana at the center of a fast-growing, economically essential industry,” Yates said.

The Citizens Action Coalition and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, a state agency tasked with protecting consumers, notified the commission that they plan to appeal the approval of GenCo.

Concerns about a market edge

Another major concern of critics is that GenCo will have an unfair competitive advantage over other power producers.

Indiana has a regulated energy market, wherein utilities have the right to serve as monopoly producers and distributors of energy, but regulators must approve how much capacity they build or buy and what they charge customers for the power.

GenCo is largely exempt from this structure, acting more akin to a power producer in a state like Illinois, with a deregulated market. But in Illinois, power producers compete to sell their energy to utilities, whereas GenCo has a guaranteed customer in the form of NIPSCO, and the two sister companies — which share the same parent — set the price NIPSCO will pay GenCo for power.

“The utility affiliate is being treated like an unregulated independent power producer while retaining the guarantee of a monopoly market enjoyed by regulated utilities,” Piontek said. ​“Essentially, the arrangement insulates GenCo from market forces, and [it] is not subjected to rate regulation. It’s going to be a very profitable arrangement for the parent company and its shareholders … by providing the affiliate with an unearned competitive advantage.”

The Clean Grid Alliance — made up of renewable-energy developers, environmental groups, and other stakeholders — and Takanock, a data-center developer, told regulators in a joint brief that GenCo ​“turns the federal paradigm which encourages competition … on its head by proposing that GenCo, and only GenCo, provides generation services to NIPSCO to serve its megaload customers.”

In testimony, Takanock founder and CEO Kenneth Davies told regulators about problems his company has had trying to acquire power from NIPSCO for a planned data center. Davies described the NIPSCO-GenCo relationship as ​“anticompetitive,” and lamented that NIPSCO will not allow new data-center customers to buy power on the open market themselves, as some existing industrial customers are allowed to do. Davies said NIPSCO seems to be ​“picking and choosing” which data centers to prioritize, and he is worried Takanock could be treated unfairly, since confidential contracts would make it difficult to compare the arrangements other data centers are getting.

Davies and other stakeholders say there are ways for NIPSCO to protect customers from data-center costs without creating a new market entity with an unfair edge.

Takanock and the Clean Grid Alliance, in their filing, criticize GenCo for failing to explore the more common method of pricing tariffs designed specifically for data centers. That’s where a utility makes an agreement with state regulators to treat data centers differently from other customers, ensuring they pay their fair share of costs. Davies described Wyoming regulators’ creation of such a special tariff to serve a Microsoft data center. Davies was Microsoft’s director of renewable-energy strategy and research at the time.

In another example, Citizens Action Coalition reached an agreement last year with utility Indiana Michigan Power and three new data centers, requiring long contracts, exit fees, and other protections to ensure the centers pay the full costs of infrastructure built to serve them, even if they don’t use as much power or operate for as long as expected. The agreement also requires the data centers to pay millions of dollars to support low-income electricity customers with benefits like weatherization.

Advocates point out that Indiana already has a law on the books meant to help utilities more quickly get power online to supply data centers, without sacrificing transparency or relying on a new entity like GenCo. HB 1007, enacted in May, gives utilities an expedited approval process for new generation if they provide information about the impacts on customers, predicted load growth for the next five years, and the potential of grid-enhancing tech to avoid investments in new power plants, among other things.

“NIPSCO decided to ignore 1007 and create what we think is a shell game, a scam, with this unregulated affiliate doing Lord knows what,” said Olson.

Clean-energy implications

The creation of GenCo will likely undermine the clean-energy transition in northern Indiana, advocates say. NIPSCO has already made clear its plans to build lots of natural-gas-fired generation to power data centers, and if this is carried out through GenCo, stakeholders will have little opportunity to weigh in on the implications.

This is a disappointing shift for environmental groups that had praised NIPSCO for plans it announced in 2018 to retire all coal plants within a decade and build out renewables, reducing carbon emissions by 90%.

By contrast, NIPSCO’s 2024 Integrated Resource Plan says that if contracts with data centers are in place, the utility will build over 1,700 megawatts of gas generation by 2030 and another over 2,000 MW by 2035. Already, NIPSCO is seeking an air permit to build 2,300 MW of gas-fired generation at the site of a retiring coal plant, in order to serve data centers.

“GenCo is certainly a concern for the climate, demonstrating that NIPSCO has done a complete strategy reversal on sustainability,” said Ben Inskeep, program director at Citizens Action Coalition. He said the utility’s 2018 resource plan ​“was groundbreaking for leading the way on a clean-energy transition. Now, they are pursuing a strategy that appears to be 100% natural gas for new data centers, with no additional clean energy to serve the additional load.”

If NIPSCO had to turn to the open market to procure the power that data centers need, Piontek noted, more renewables would likely get built along with the gas-fired generation.

“Clean-energy resources like wind, solar, and energy storage outcompete other resources in speed-to-market and remain the most cost-effective resources available, making them an attractive option for bringing data centers online in Indiana,” Piontek said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/53681144380_6d03e45ffe_c.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f798e967b3acc1c6872028f43313dd41,N,,2025-10-28 05:57:58.186818

A deceleration in production capacity in EIA’s category renewable diesel and other biofuels accounted for most of the slowdown in growth.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane make up virtually all of the other biofuels.

Renewable diesel and other biofuels

Renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity increased just 391 million gallons per year (gal/y) in 2024, less than one-third of the growth observed in 2022 and 2023.

In 2024, only two capacity additions came online, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to exclusively produce biofuels and the new Renewable Fuels plant in Bakersfield.

With the completed conversion, the Rodeo plant has a capacity of 767 million gal/y, up from 180 million gal/y in last year’s report.

This increase makes it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the US, behind Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana.

US capacity growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138-million-gal/y Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities.

Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively. Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy closed plants in Mobile, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi, respectively.

The loss of renewable diesel capacity at four facilities reflects changes to biofuel margins and petroleum refining margins since 2020.

Low refinery margins and rising biofuel credit values in 2020 and 2021 prompted a wave of renewable diesel capacity announcements.

As more of those plants started operations, biofuel production began exceeding target volumes, and biofuel credit values and margins decreased in 2023.

At the same time, petroleum refinery margins were much stronger than their 2020 lows, resulting in a slowdown in investments to expand renewable diesel capacity for the upcoming years.

A notable shift in 2024 was the increased focus on SAF.

SAF is an alternative to petroleum jet fuel that capture in other biofuels category.

Other biofuels includes SAF, renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline, and other emerging biofuels.

EIA combine other biofuels with renewable diesel capacity because other biofuels are mostly produced at renewable diesel plants as byproducts or, often in the case of SAF, in place of renewable diesel.

Following the completion of conversion projects in 2024, Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant can shift about 150 million gal/y of its renewable diesel production capacity to SAF, and Diamond Green Diesel can shift about 235 million gal/y to SAF.

Biodiesel

In addition to slower growth in renewable diesel production capacity, biodiesel production capacity decreased slightly.

In 2024, eight biodiesel plants closed due to poor margins, resulting in a loss of about 100 million gal/y of production capacity.

Fuel ethanol

Unlike renewable diesel and biodiesel, US fuel ethanol production capacity increased more in 2024 than in previous years.

This month's Nature Quest is about that very question. Listener Molly Magid in New Zealand wanted to know if and how other communities have chosen the path of ""managed retreat."" That's the purposeful and coordinated movement of people and assets out of harm's way.

The topic of managed retreat has been an ongoing conversation for many in western Alaska, long before the remnants of Typhoon Halong slammed into the coast and displaced up to 2,000 people from their homes. With climate change, these communities face increased flooding, coastal erosion and melting permafrost. For many, safety means going elsewhere.

Morris Alexie hopes that means his community of Nunapitchuk. A local tribal liaison, he says they've chosen a new site around 3 or 4 miles away on higher ground, ""We would not be moving somewhere far from what we've grown up eating and living off of.""

Speaking with Alaska Public Media, Alexie estimates it will take $277 million to relocate Nunapitchuk. So far, federal and state agencies have not stepped forward to help pay.

,Clean Energy ,2025-10-28 06:30:45+00:00,the Guardian,"Wind power has cut £104bn from UK energy costs since 2010, study finds - The Guardian","Fiona Harvey, www.theguardian.com, fiona-harvey",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/28/wind-power-cut-uk-energy-costs-ucl-study,"Wind power has cut at least £104bn from energy costs in the UK since 2010, a study has found.
Over the same period, consumers paid about £43.2bn in green subsidies, levied on electricity bills rather than gas bills.

Solar and wind generation today are four times what the International Energy Agency in 2015 forecast they would be.
Wind power is cheaper, cleaner and more secure than new gas – helping us bring down bills for good.","Wind power has cut at least £104bn from energy costs in the UK since 2010, a study has found.

Users of gas have been among the biggest beneficiaries, the research suggested.

Research by University College London found that from 2010 to 2023, energy from windfarms resulted in electricity bills being lower by about £14.2bn than they would have been if gas had been needed to generate the same amount of power.

However, the reduction in the cost of gas that could be attributed to wind generation – owing to the cut in demand and not needing to build new infrastructure – was much greater, at about £133.3bn.

Over the same period, consumers paid about £43.2bn in green subsidies, levied on electricity bills rather than gas bills. The net result was a reduction of £104.3bn in UK energy bills over the 13-year period, according to the researchers.

Surging renewable energy generation across Europe made demand for gas – and thus gas prices – lower than they would otherwise have been, and meant electricity companies had less need to build costly new gas-fired power stations, according to the analysis. The way that the UK’s energy market works also means gas-fired power stations are in effect allowed to set the price of electricity.

The analysis applied to 2010-23, leaving out the lingering impacts of the leap in gas prices in early 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine.

Colm O’Shea, a former hedge fund manager, now a master’s student at UCL and lead author of the report, said: “Far from being a financial burden, this study demonstrates how wind generation has consistently delivered substantial financial benefits to the UK. To put it into context, this net benefit of £104bn is larger than the additional £90bn the UK has spent on gas since 2021 as a result of rising prices related to the war in Ukraine.

“This study demonstrates why we should reframe our understanding of green investment from costly environmental subsidy to a high-return national investment.”

Mark Maslin, a professor of Earth system science at UCL, said the UK’s consumers would benefit to a greater extent if the electricity market were reformed to reflect the reality that wind generation was reducing bills. “At some stage, the UK government must decouple gas and electricity prices,” he said. “That would mean gas prices would reflect the global markets, while the electricity price would reflect the savings from wind and solar.”

Ana Musat, the director of policy at RenewableUK, the trade body for the wind sector, said: “This research highlights the long-term economic benefits for UK plc of investing in renewable energy generation. The only way to reduce energy costs for good is to minimise our exposure to volatile global fossil fuel prices and increase the share of electricity generation from clean homegrown sources.”

The government disappointed the wind industry and renewable energy advocates on Monday by setting out a lower amount of available subsidy than some had hoped for in an auction for new offshore wind capacity. Only about £1.1bn was made available in the auction.

Musat said: “The wind industry alone employs 55,000 people and this is set to double to 110,000 by 2030. Every gigawatt of offshore wind brings £2bn-£3bn in private investment to the UK. That’s why it’s so important that we procure significant volumes of new wind and solar capacity in the auction for clean power contracts, with the budget set at an ambitious level to enable us to make the most of the opportunity to stabilise the cost of energy.”

Michael Shanks, the energy minister, said: “Our competitive new auction process will allow us to buy the right amount of clean power at the right price on behalf of the British people, so we can take back control of our energy.”

Separately, analysis from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank found that in the 10 years since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015 there have been far greater increases in renewable energy generation than was envisaged at the time.

In 2015, BP predicted that non-fossil fuels would take a 38% share of global power generation by 2035, but already they account for 41%. Solar and wind generation today are four times what the International Energy Agency in 2015 forecast they would be.

The deployment of electric vehicles has also risen faster than expected: the 2015 target of 100m EVs on the road by 2030 is likely to be hit in two years.

Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said: “Clean homegrown power is the right choice for families, industry and the nation for many years to come. Wind power is cheaper, cleaner and more secure than new gas – helping us bring down bills for good.

“And with a competitive new process to secure more wind in our upcoming renewables auction, we will take back control of our energy and bring the next generation of opportunity to British coastlines and heartlands.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef5d88fbf1686b46b9710ad17d4c7ef445de7bc4/0_67_3599_2878/master/3599.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8394f992bc25650d1e740d4b6f4d1bbf",N,,2025-10-28 03:17:33.498814

For an industry still learning to compete with Asian manufacturing prowess, it signals a troubling pattern: political opposition may be undermining America's ability to acquire the technical expertise needed to build a competitive domestic battery sector.

A missed learning opportunity

When Gotion first announced its Michigan plans in October 2022, the project promised 2,350 jobs and represented something potentially more valuable than investment dollars—a chance for American workers to learn from one of the world's leading battery manufacturers. The company, a subsidiary of China's Gotion High-Tech, brought decades of large-scale battery production experience that US manufacturers are still working to develop.

""There's a world of difference between writing a recipe or seeing a recipe and going, 'Yeah, I know how to do that,' and actually producing the dish,"" explained Celina Mikolajczak, then Chief Battery Technical Officer at Lyten, in a 2024 Battery Show North America panel discussion. ""Asia has been doing the cooking. They have been making the cells and learning all the little things, all the little details, all the little bits and bobs of what makes a good cell, what makes a high-volume production line.""

The Gotion project would have provided exactly this kind of hands-on manufacturing knowledge transfer—Chinese expertise applied in an American facility, creating jobs while building domestic capabilities.

The political headwinds

Instead, the project became a political lightning rod. Republican lawmakers, led by Representative John Moolenaar who chairs a House select committee on China, worked to oppose the project and bar US government subsidies for Chinese-affiliated battery companies. Local opposition in Green Charter Township was so intense that voters recalled township officials who supported the project in 2023.

Reuters reports that in a letter to Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) the company's attorney blamed ""politically motivated"" opposition driven by ""racist and ethnically charged stereotypes"" for creating the litigation and delays that ultimately doomed the project. By September, the declared Gotion in default of its agreement, citing no activity at the project site for more than 120 days.

Contrast with CATL

The Gotion failure stands in stark contrast to other international partnerships that successfully transfer battery manufacturing knowledge to US operations. Ford's licensing agreement with CATL for lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery production represents the kind of structured collaboration that industry experts advocate.

""CATL working with Ford, LG working with GM—this is a great opportunity to learn how to make lithium-ion batteries because we just don't know how to do it,"" noted ARPA-E Program Director Halle Cheeseman in a Battery Show North America panel discussion.

These partnerships follow a proven model: foreign companies provide technology and manufacturing expertise while American companies maintain ownership and operational control. James Frith, Principal at Volta Energy Technologies, has pointed to the Ford-CATL structure as an example of how to address concerns about foreign control while still accessing critical technical knowledge.

""If there are concerns over taking too much foreign investment or overseas companies controlling too much critical infrastructure, this licensing model could be more broadly explored,"" Frith explained.

The strategic cost

The collapse of the Gotion project carries implications beyond Michigan's borders. As Avicenne Energy Senior Adviser Michael Sanders has noted, attempting to build battery manufacturing capabilities without learning from established producers is ""a fool's proposition.""

""There's so many subtleties on how to make a battery and how to do it well that trying to do it all on your own"" simply isn't viable, Sanders explained in an earlier Battery Show panel. ""The idea here is not to say, I'm going to let the Chinese or Koreans or whatever come in and run it and run it for multiple years. You have to get to the point that your team learns to where you can take control to whatever strategic destiny you want to be.""

The Michigan project would have provided exactly this kind of learning opportunity—Chinese manufacturing expertise deployed in an American facility, with American workers gaining the hands-on experience that textbooks and engineering degrees cannot provide.

Industry implications

Michigan taxpayers will bear the immediate cost of the project's failure. The state is pursuing repayment of $23.6 million spent purchasing land for the facility, while the remaining $125 million in promised incentives was never disbursed. The project was a high-profile beneficiary of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's $2 billion Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve fund, which, Bridge Michigan reports, the Legislature defunded earlier this month.

For the broader US battery industry, the Gotion collapse raises uncomfortable questions about America's ability to compete in a sector where manufacturing expertise remains concentrated in Asia. While political concerns about Chinese investment are understandable, the industry's technical realities suggest that some form of international collaboration remains essential for building domestic capabilities.

The challenge for policymakers and industry leaders is finding structures that address legitimate security concerns while still enabling the knowledge transfer that American battery manufacturing desperately needs. The Ford-CATL model offers one template, but the Gotion failure suggests that even well-structured partnerships may struggle against political headwinds.

He thinks scientific innovation will curb it, and it’s instead time for a “strategic pivot” in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.

A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said. In a memo released Tuesday, Gates said the world’s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions in the world’s poorest countries.

If given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, Gates told reporters, “I’ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don’t understand the suffering that exists today.”

The Microsoft co-founder spends most of his time now on the goals of the Gates Foundation, which has poured tens of billions of dollars into health care, education and development initiatives worldwide, including combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. He started Breakthrough Energy in 2015 to speed up innovation in clean energy.

He wrote his 17-page memo hoping to have an impact on next month’s United Nations climate change conference in Brazil. He’s urging world leaders to ask whether the little money designated for climate is being spent on the right things.

Gates, whose foundation provides financial support for Associated Press coverage of health and development in Africa, is influential in the climate change conversation. He expects his “tough truths about climate” memo will be controversial.

“If you think climate is not important, you won’t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo,” Gates said during a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release. “It’s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who’s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.”

Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.

University of Washington public health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi said she thoroughly agrees with Gates that the U.N. negotiations should focus on improving human health and well-being. But, she said, Gates assumes the world stays static and only one variable changes — faster deployment of green technologies — to curb climate change. She called that unlikely.

Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, called the memo “pointless, vague, unhelpful and confusing.”

“There is no reason to pit poverty reduction versus climate transformation. Both are utterly feasible, and readily so, if the Big Oil lobby is brought under control,” he wrote in an email.

Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field said there is room for a healthy discussion about whether the current framing of the climate crisis is typically too pessimistic.

“But we should also invest for both the long term and the short term,” he wrote in an email. “A vibrant long-term future depends on both tackling climate change and supporting human development.”

Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said he doesn't dispute the principle of making human well-being the primary objective of policy, but what about the natural world?

“Climate change is already wreaking havoc there,"" he wrote in an email. ""Can we truly live in a technological bubble? Do we want to?”

Gates is clear in his memo that every tenth of a degree of warming matters: ""A stable climate makes it easier to improve people's lives.”

A decade ago, the world agreed in a historic pact known as the Paris agreement to try to limit human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. The goal: to stave off nastier heat waves, wildfires, storms and droughts.

In a 2021 book, Gates laid out a plan for reducing emissions to avoid a climate disaster. But humans are on track to release so much greenhouse gas by early 2028 that scientists say crossing that 1.5-degree threshold is now nearly unavoidable.

Breakthrough Energy focuses on areas where the cost of doing something cleanly is much higher than the polluting way, such as making clean steel and cement. Gates concluded his memo by saying governments should work toward driving this difference to zero, and be rigorous about measuring the impact of every effort in the world’s climate agenda.

Gates said the pace of innovation in clean energy has been faster than he expected, allowing cheap solar and wind energy to replace coal, oil and natural gas plants for electricity and averting worst-case warming scenarios. Artificial intelligence is helping accelerate advances in clean energy technologies, he added.

At the same time, money to help developing countries adapt to climate change is shrinking. Led by the United States, rich countries are cutting their foreign aid budgets. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax.

Gates criticized the aid cuts. He said Gavi, a public-private partnership started by his philanthropic foundation that buys vaccines, will have 25% less money for the next five years compared to the past five years. Gavi can save a life for a little more than $1,000, he added.

Vaccines become even more important in a warming world because children who aren’t dying of measles or whooping cough will be more likely to survive when a heat wave hits or a drought threatens the local food supply, he wrote.

Health and prosperity are the best defense against climate change, Gates said, citing research from the University of Chicago Climate Impact Lab that found projected deaths from climate change fall by more than 50% when accounting for the expected economic growth over the rest of this century.

Under these circumstances, he thinks the bar must be “very high” for what’s funded with aid money.

“If you have something that gets rid of 10,000 tons of emissions, that you’re spending several million dollars on,"" he said, “that just doesn’t make the cut.”

DOE’s Office of Science has issued its Fusion Science & Technology Roadmap (Roadmap), incorporating input from over 600 scientists and engineers across the public and private sectors, national laboratories, universities, and international partners. The Roadmap establishes a three-pronged “Build-Innovate-Grow” framework focused on balancing collaboration among state and federal government entities and across private enterprise with a goal of fostering a competitive commercial landscape.

The Roadmap also lays out 10 key actions and six core challenges over the coming decade to build toward deployment of fusion energy at scale in the U.S. by the mid-2030s. Key actions for industry and policymakers include using artificial intelligence (AI) models to solve technical challenges around sustained and controlled plasma burning, building out multiple scaled demonstration facilities, addressing supply chain constraints, and developing a path toward broader commercialization. Beyond the clear hurdles that remain with respect to generating and controlling sustained net-energy-positive fusion reactions, further challenges identified by the Roadmap include development of technologies to produce, handle, and recycle fuel materials like tritium as well as development of the balance-of-plant systems to convert energy output from the fusion engine into usable power delivered into the grid.

In parallel, the bipartisan Commission has released a report titled Fusion Forward: Powering America's Future (Fusion Forward Report), which emphasizes the growing competition between the United States and China to achieve dominance in harnessing this emerging energy technology, and the steps the United States must take in both public and private sectors to win this race. Although the United States continues to lead in scientific development, China has poured billions of dollars into the development of both physical infrastructure and scientific expertise to foster fusion energy buildout.

To support fusion buildout in America, the Fusion Forward Report makes a number of recommendations, including a presidential Executive Order (EO) building on President Trump’s Unleashing American Energy EO by declaring fusion energy to be a national security priority, marshalling the resources of the government to support the construction of multiple industry-led fusion power demonstration plants in the United States before the end of 2028. The report sets a goal of $10 billion in investment for development of both fusion infrastructure and R&D. Finally, the report identifies a number of legal and regulatory challenges that need to be addressed to avoid unnecessary roadblocks to rapid deployment.

In addition to the reports from DOE and the bipartisan Commission, the Clean Air Task Force (CATF) has also released a white paper detailing State Policy Options for Fusion Energy Deployment, outlining concrete steps that state policymakers can implement to prepare for fusion energy coming online at scale. Pulling on actions taken in individual states across the country to develop a toolkit for lawmakers, the CATF recommendations include updating state renewable energy portfolio standards and clean energy standards to include fusion, centralizing permitting and regulation of fusion energy in a single (adequately funded) agency, regulating byproducts to be treated as equivalent to similar X-ray materials, and creating a fast-track permitting pathway.

Together, these reports build on recent successes for the fusion industry in building out the legal infrastructure for the development and deployment of fusion technology, first in the demonstration phase and then at scale. Recent advances include the 2023 decision of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to regulate fusion technology separately from fission reactors,[1] passage of the 2024 ADVANCE Act codifying separate regulatory treatment of fusion machines as particle accelerators and simplifying disposal of the limited waste materials, and the growth of the Agreement State framework delegating NRC regulatory authority to states (39 at latest count) that wish to facilitate fusion development and deployment locally. Nevertheless, as both new reports emphasize, critical challenges remain.

Takeaways and Potential Opportunities and Challenges

Fusion energy is uniquely positioned at the nexus of both the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. At a moment when the United States and China have entered a period of accelerating economic and technological competition over everything from AI to critical minerals, the prospect of near-term commercial-scale fusion energy is both shaped by and instrumental in shaping those broader trends. China’s dominant position in the supply chain for components critical to fusion technology, such as tungsten, vanadium, and rare earth elements, render the U.S. fusion industry vulnerable to a protracted trade war. At the same time, even as AI models may help fusion developers solve their remaining technical challenges, the prospect of stable, plentiful energy from commercial fusion machines could help technology companies meet their rapidly expanding energy demand to service data centers and AI infrastructure.

Moreover, fusion plants seem like a nearly ideal fit for large load centers like factories and data centers. Fusion plants will have relatively small footprints and can be sited close to demand centers (unlike renewable energy, which is limited by resource availability, and without the safety concerns popularly associated with nuclear fission). This means that reliance on long-distance, high-voltage transmission lines, which have themselves become a major bottleneck for energy development, can be minimized. Even so, grid interconnection and queue timelines remain a critical choke point for fusion buildout. State and federal lawmakers should take steps to allow behind-the-meter sales to focus early fusion commercialization where demand is highest. And states and transmission providers should consider exempting fusion projects from multi-year queues, given the overarching desirability of clean, safe, stable baseload. In many states, there may be potential to reuse transmission and other infrastructure from closing fossil fuel plants to accelerate the siting of fusion facilities.

The NRC is currently crafting a new regulatory framework under 10 CFR Part 30 for licensing the disposal of byproduct materials for approved fusion machine technologies. Final rules are expected in November and will provide another strong signal as to whether regulators are approaching fusion development with the necessary flexibility and creativity.

One point of notable optimism for fusion development is the bipartisanship of support for the technology. Tax credits for fusion that were championed by the Biden administration in the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, such as 45Y and 48E credits, were all retained by the Trump administration in its One Big Beautiful Bill Act, standing in contrast to other forms of clean energy. Although competition with China may pose challenges to supply chains and create risk of intellectual property theft, as seen in the AI field, this may nevertheless help to preserve broad government support domestically through a period when the emerging private sector needs broad, stable, and innovative regulatory, financial, and scientific support.

Most fusion projects also are unlikely to require review under the National Environmental Policy Act unless they are situated on federal land or heavily reliant on federal funding or loan guarantees. Nevertheless, reducing the overall timeline for other state and federal environmental permits remains a critical unresolved issue. States seeking to become innovation hubs for this potentially game-changing technology would be well advised to think proactively about how to implement smooth, rapid permitting regimes going forward.

Future-proofing for a renewable future As renewable energy reshapes the power landscape, volatility will remain a defining characteristic of renewable-heavy portfolios.
Investors can position themselves for success by integrating flexible assets and adopting a resilience-focused strategy that anticipates market swings.","Andrew Warrell, is a partner, Spencer Holmes is an associate partner, and Tyler Bowen is an expert at McKinsey & Company.

Renewable energy is transforming the U.S. power market, which is set to grow from 25% to 45% of total generation by 2030. This rapid expansion, while crucial for a low-carbon future, brings new dynamics for investors to navigate — particularly around price volatility.

Solar and wind power, driven by variable weather patterns, can create differences between forecasted and actual output, leading to major price gaps in day-ahead versus real-time markets. For renewable-heavy portfolios, managing this variability is key to ensure stable, resilient returns.

Additionally, demand mismatches exacerbate this volatility. Solar production peaks around midday, often when demand is low, and tapers off in the evening when demand rises. In states like California, where solar comprises a large share of power, this mismatch can lead to significant daily price swings. Adding to the challenge, many renewable assets are located far from demand centers, leading to locational price differences which can reduce profit margins.

Contrastingly, renewable generation can exceed demand at times of extreme wind or sunshine, leading to price drops that reduce revenues when output is at peak. For renewable-heavy portfolios, this “oversupply effect” underscores the need for stabilizing factors to secure a steady stream of revenue.

Flexible assets as a stabilizer

To counteract renewable energy source-driven volatility, flexible assets have become a remedy in managing supply-demand imbalances and stabilizing returns. Battery storage, gas generation and demand response are leading solutions, helping portfolios remain resilient in increasingly volatile markets.

Battery storage capacity in the U.S. is expected to increase from 13 GW today to 110 GW by 2030, marking an eightfold growth as investors respond to stronger demand for higher storage capabilities. Batteries allow excess energy to be stored when prices are low and released during peak demand — creating new revenue opportunities and reducing exposure in lower-price periods. With their ability to quickly respond to price fluctuations, batteries are becoming an essential asset for stabilizing returns.

Gas generation remains a reliable option for on-demand power supply. While gas comprises 43% of U.S. power generation, some investors weigh its carbon footprint against its role in stabilizing portfolios exposed to renewables. Gas plants can quickly adjust output, ensuring reliable power when renewable generation falls short, offering a hedge against price instability.

Demand response programs have experienced rising participation, providing grid operators with the ability to incentivize consumers to lower usage during peak periods. Demand response now represents around 60 GW of capacity nationwide, helping to ease strain on the grid without requiring new infrastructure. For investors, it offers a flexible and sustainable way to balance renewable variability, enabling a dynamic approach to managing portfolio risk.

Together, battery storage, gas generation and demand response provide a crucial buffer against the risks associated with renewable energy, making portfolios more adaptable and financially resilient.

A strategic approach to building resilient portfolios

In addition to integrating flexible assets, a multi-pronged strategy is essential for long-term stability in renewable-heavy portfolios. Acquiring flexible capacity through M&A can add resilience to existing investments. By investing in established battery storage facilities or demand response assets, investors gain immediate capacity and increased control over risk, without the lengthy timelines typically needed for new energy infrastructure projects.

Integrated financial modeling allows investors to take a portfolio-wide view of potential risks and returns. By simulating how flexible assets and financial hedges perform under different market conditions, investors can optimize for risk-adjusted returns, structuring portfolios that strike a balance between risk appetite and stability.

Future-proofing for a renewable future

As renewable energy reshapes the power landscape, volatility will remain a defining characteristic of renewable-heavy portfolios. Investors can position themselves for success by integrating flexible assets and adopting a resilience-focused strategy that anticipates market swings.

With flexible assets and a proactive approach to risk management, investors can capture the promise of renewables while maintaining the stability needed for consistent returns. In this evolving energy landscape, such strategies are essential for securing long-term growth and safeguarding portfolio resilience.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/energy%20and%20materials/our%20insights/blog/mitigating%20price%20volatility/mitigating-price-volatility.jpeg,N,,2025-10-28 04:59:11.843194

This overcapacity posed a risk to the financial stability of China’s renewable energy sector, as producers grappled with reduced profitability due to oversupply.","Many observers praised China’s pledge to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060 as a historic commitment for global climate governance. However, much less attention was given to what was happening within the nation’s own industrial machinery. China’s renewable energy industry has expanded so quickly after 20 years of state-driven growth that it now faces the paradox of its own success.

China’s installed renewable capacity reached an astounding 3,348 gigawatts (GW) by 2024, surpassing the combined electricity generation of Europe and the United States. Within this total, 887 GW came from solar energy and another 521 GW from wind, with additional projects already underway. The country’s manufacturing output, however, far outpaces domestic demand: its factories are capable of producing over 861 GW of solar modules annually, a volume that the national grid cannot yet absorb.

This remarkable industrial scale-up has produced what might be described as a green surplus: an abundance of renewable technologies that the domestic system struggles to utilize efficiently. Grid bottlenecks, curtailment rates reaching up to 9 percent in certain provinces, and sluggish demand have left entire inventories of solar panels warehoused and idle. What appears on the surface as a technical challenge is, in essence, a political economy dilemma. When the world’s largest producer of green technology can no longer sell its output at home, the question arises: where does this surplus go?

From Domestic Boom to Global Spillover

China has gradually turned its excess production into an outward-oriented development strategy that exports goods and its institutional model of green industrialization over the past decade. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) are financing this transnational expansion by directing capital and equipment to the Global South.

In this process, China is effectively undergoing what some scholars have called a “second industrial revolution.” The first revolution internationalized the production of steel and cement; the second sends out solar modules, wind turbines, and battery systems.

According to the “China’s Global Power” database, over 68 percent of China’s overseas generation capacity investments were directed toward solar and wind renewable energy projects by 2022-2023. Southeast Asia, in particular, has emerged as a primary destination, absorbing more than 31 percent of China’s total renewable energy investments abroad. Over the past decade, China has led public clean energy investment, contributing more than $2.7 billion into ASEAN clean energy markets.

At the center of this regional transformation lies Indonesia.

Indonesia: The Perfect Outlet

With more than 278 million people scattered across 17,000 islands, Indonesia offers both a massive energy market and a logistical maze. Under the National Electricity Master Plan (RUKN), electricity demand in Indonesia is projected to increase almost four times in the next 35 years – from 482 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2024 to almost 1,813 TWh by 2060. For China, that’s precisely the kind of growing market its renewable surplus needs: resource-rich, rapidly urbanizing, and still building the power systems that much of the developed world already takes for granted.

Jakarta’s ambitions match the moment. The government has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060 and aims for 52 percent of its energy mix to come from renewables by 2044. Yet structural constraints persist. The country’s grid remains outdated, domestic financing is limited, and its solar manufacturing capacity, barely exceeding 1 GW annually, cannot possibly meet future demand on its own.

Against this backdrop, Chinese engagement has intensified. The two nations inked 11 agreements totaling $12.6 billion in 2023 alone, the majority of which had to do with electric vehicles and renewable energy. This degree of collaboration has never been seen in Indonesia’s power industry.

A case in point is the Cirata Floating Solar Power Plant, the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia. The project – built by PowerChina and Indonesia’s state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), with a U$100 million loan from the China Development Bank – went online in 2023. It now adds 145 megawatts (MW) to the grid, enough to supply about 50,000 homes and reduce carbon emissions by more than 200,000 tons a year.

China’s presence extends beyond solar infrastructure. The State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) has partnered with PLN to modernize Indonesia’s transmission network, including ambitious plans for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) interconnections linking Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan. Meanwhile, in Sulawesi, Chinese investment exceeding $30 billion in nickel downstream processing has transformed the region into a global hub for electric vehicle battery production.

Taken together, these ventures are redrawing Asia’s energy map. Capital, technology, and industrial know-how now move southward, from China to its developing neighbors. It’s a kind of globalization that feels different from the one led by the West: faster, more state-directed, and, in some ways, more pragmatic. Yet beneath the cooperation lies a new kind of interdependence that Indonesia will have to manage carefully.

Subsidies and Surplus: China’s Engine Room

China’s green industrial ascent did not emerge from spontaneous market efficiency but from deliberate and sustained state intervention. The 2009 amendment to the 2006 Renewable Energy Law expanded the government’s capacity to guarantee grid access, subsidize producers, and regulate pricing. Between 2019 and 2022, the government spent roughly $237 billion supporting its green industries – around 1.7 percent of China’s GDP.

This policy muscle created global champions. BYD, now one of the world’s top electric-vehicle makers, received 2.1 billion euros in subsidies in 2022—ten times what it got just two years earlier. Mingyang Smart Energy, a key wind-turbine manufacturer, saw its support climb from 20 million euros to 52 million over the same period. Such backing helped drive down the cost of solar modules by more than 80 percent in just a decade.

But this success also bred new challenges. When the United States and the European Union imposed tariffs on Chinese solar exports in the 2010s, accusing Beijing of undercutting global prices, domestic markets became the fallback. For a while, massive homegrown investment kept factories busy. The Chinese government, through the National Energy Administration (NEA), implemented policies that encouraged state-owned enterprises to rapidly construct solar plants, wind farms, and related infrastructure. By 2022, China had installed over 392 GW of solar capacity, making it the largest solar market in the world.

However, while subsidies and tax credits spurred rapid expansion, they were not effectively aligned with market demand. As a result, production continued to grow even as demand declined, leading to a supply glut that negatively impacted both profitability and sector stability. As the domestic market struggled to absorb the excess production, Chinese manufacturers faced shrinking margins and declining profits, particularly as global demand weakened. This overcapacity posed a risk to the financial stability of China’s renewable energy sector, as producers grappled with reduced profitability due to oversupply.

In response, China redirected its strategy outward, transforming surplus production into the raw material of foreign policy. By exporting its green technologies through concessional loans and state-backed enterprises, China effectively converted its internal accumulation crisis into a global opportunity. The green surplus, in this sense, became not merely an economic outcome but a geopolitical instrument.

How the Outflow Works

China’s export of clean energy infrastructure follows a clear pattern. Policy banks such as the China Development Bank and the Export–Import Bank of China offer long-term, low-interest loans to developing countries for renewable energy projects. These loans are often “tied,” meaning that recipient nations must purchase Chinese-made equipment and contract Chinese firms for construction and maintenance.

The arrangement solves two problems at once. It helps Beijing manage its domestic oversupply of solar panels, turbines, and batteries, while allowing partner countries to access affordable technology and financing they could not otherwise secure. But the benefits come with strings attached: by relying heavily on Chinese capital and technology, recipient economies become more closely integrated into China’s industrial and financial ecosystem.

Indonesia illustrates both sides of this dynamic. The country’s infrastructure has expanded rapidly with Chinese funding, creating jobs and lowering the cost of renewable technology. Yet, this progress has deepened financial exposure. By 2024, PLN’s long-term liabilities had climbed to 539.16 trillion Indonesian rupiah (roughly $34.6 billion), much of it denominated in foreign currency. If energy demand softens or the rupiah weakens, those loans could become a heavy weight on the state utility’s balance sheet.

Local manufacturing also remains heavily dependent on imports. Even after the success of the Cirata solar project, Indonesia still sources most of its wafers, inverters, and modules from China. The pattern is even clearer in the nickel sector, where Chinese companies dominate the production chain – from high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL) technology to the export of key battery precursors such as nickel-cobalt-manganese compounds. Indonesia provides the raw material, but most of the value is captured elsewhere.

Debt, Risk, and Green Contradictions

Officials in Jakarta seldom use the word dependence. Partnership sounds far better. Yet the data hint at a more complicated reality. Indonesia’s overall public debt, around 39.8 percent of GDP, looks comfortable, but energy-sector liabilities are swelling. Many power-purchase agreements financed through Chinese loans are pegged to the U.S. dollar, exposing PLN and the government to currency swings. If electricity growth underperforms, a plausible scenario given slower industrial uptake and energy-efficiency improvements, those debts could become a long-term fiscal burden for both the company and the state budget. In short, the same financial mechanisms that enable renewable expansion today could entrench structural dependency tomorrow.

While financing inflows have been abundant, grid readiness has lagged behind. Indonesia’s power system currently holds a reserve margin exceeding 40 percent in the Java–Bali and South Sulawesi systems. This excess, equivalent to roughly 6–7 GW of unutilized capacity, reflects years of over-planning under the 35 GW program and the continued dominance of coal baseload generation.

Variable renewable energy (VRE), especially solar and wind, struggles to connect to an infrastructure designed for centralized, fossil-based supply. Transmission bottlenecks and slow grid-code reform have led to curtailments even for operational projects, while new solar proposals in East Java and South Sulawesi risk being built ahead of demand growth. Without significant investment in transmission and storage, additional solar and wind capacity will likely be under-utilized, creating the very scenario PLN sought to avoid: stranded green assets that echo the idle coal plants of the last decade.

The mismatch between industrial geography and renewable project sites amplifies the risk of regional overcapacity on one side and persistent energy poverty on the other. Renewable tenders frequently concentrate in high-demand provinces with already congested grid access, rather than in areas with excess land and solar potential, due to the lack of full synchronization between PLN’s procurement plan (RUPTL) and regional development plans. Total electricity demand is expected to increase from 482 TWh in 2024 to 1,813 TWh by 2060, according to Indonesia’s National Electricity General Plan (RUKN). However, the growth will be unevenly distributed, with Java–Bali continuing to dominate demand and the eastern regions remaining undersupplied.

Beyond the numbers, social tensions are also emerging. In Sulawesi, where most of Indonesia’s nickel downstreaming and battery projects are located, local communities have reported groundwater contamination, shrinking farmland, and air pollution from nickel-processing zones such as Morowali and Weda Bay. Land acquisitions have often proceeded with little consultation, sowing resentment among local communities. In parts of Central Java, disputes over compensation have slowed the development of solar farms, exposing gaps in regulation and weak protection for smallholders. For many, the clean-energy transition has arrived not as empowerment but as disruption.

These overlapping pressures – financial, infrastructural, and social – point to a deeper paradox. Indonesia’s renewable expansion is greening the grid, but it is doing so through mechanisms that replicate older hierarchies of dependence: dollar-denominated debt, imported technology, and uneven access to land and benefit.

China’s Growing Green Leverage

China’s ability to finance and execute renewable projects at scale has given it a commanding role in shaping the energy future of Asia. While Western-led initiatives such as the G-7’s Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) have made bold pledges, $20 billion for Indonesia among them, progress has been slow. Only a fraction of that amount has actually reached project sites. China, by contrast, moves quickly. Its financing carries fewer political conditions and usually arrives packaged with equipment, expertise, and on-the-ground execution.

This agility gives Beijing a decisive advantage. Through its state banks and corporations, China has positioned itself as the lender, builder, and standard-setter of Asia’s clean energy boom. By financing large-scale renewable projects, such as solar and wind farms in developing countries, China ensures that these countries become dependent on its technology and financial support. This dependence grants China significant leverage over their political and economic policies.

China’s domination of global supply chains in green technologies, particularly in lithium-ion batteries and solar panels, is a central element of its broader geopolitical strategy. This control spans all stages of the supply chain, from the extraction of raw materials such as lithium and cobalt to the large-scale production of solar panels and battery components. By controlling these critical sectors, China gains significant leverage over global renewable energy markets and the countries that rely on its technologies for their clean energy transitions.

Countries that rely on Chinese funding often find themselves aligning, intentionally or not, with Beijing’s technical and regulatory preferences. By exporting not only hardware but also technical standards, from grid codes to inverter software, China quietly defines how regional power systems operate.

For many Southeast Asian governments, this arrangement remains acceptable for now. Affordable and reliable electricity takes precedence over strategic autonomy, especially when domestic budgets are stretched thin. Yet as the region’s dependence on Chinese capital deepens, so too does Beijing’s ability to translate economic cooperation into geopolitical leverage. In this emerging “green order,” technological dominance begins to resemble a new form of influence, one that shapes power relations without territorial control.

From Carbon Neutrality to Power Neutrality

China’s rise as a clean energy giant is reshaping the global economy faster than any previous industrial shift. But it also reveals how the old habits of growth and control persist beneath the surface of the new low-carbon age. Solar panels and wind turbines may be replacing coal and oil, but the logic remains familiar: overproduction at home, surplus seeking markets abroad.

For Indonesia, this duality is both a blessing and a warning. The country gains infrastructure, investment, and access to cutting-edge technology, yet risks deepening financial and technological dependence. The real test lies not in the number of megawatts installed, but in whether Indonesia can turn this wave of green capital into lasting, self-sustaining progress.

For Beijing, leadership in the energy transition will eventually require more than speed or scale. True leadership will mean sharing technology more openly, easing financial control, and allowing partners genuine room to grow. For Jakarta, success will depend on building resilience, ensuring the transition not only decarbonizes the economy but also democratizes power itself, in both the electrical and political sense.

Because ultimately, the global shift to clean energy is about more than just cutting emissions. It’s about rewriting an old story, one that has always asked the same question: who builds, who pays, and who profits?",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2023-12-12-065515.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 02:18:50.036215

The city’s appeal seeks to block a 73-megawatt on-site fuel cell system to power the Amazon data center under construction on Scioto Darby Road.

City Councilwoman Emily Cole and other council members acknowledged that the city is facing a potentially expensive and uphill battle in filing the appeal as it will seek to challenge Ohio Revised Code established to give utilities, in certain conditions, the autonomy to proceed without local oversight.

Council’s action on Oct. 27 was in reaction to American Electric Power, owners of the natural-gas powered fuel cells, withdrawing an application before the city’s planning and zoning commission, citing that the Ohio Power Siting Board (OPSB), a division of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), has the sole authority to approve the fuel cells.

“Just because we may not win, does not mean we don’t try. There are some fights that are worth taking, particularly when we are fighting for our families, our friends, our neighbors, and our community. I believe this is one of those fights, and I’m willing to go down swinging,” Cole said.

City Council, in a unanimous vote, directed Acting City Manager Dan Ralley, through the city’s law director, Thad Boggs, to file the appeal.

Boggs said the appeal must be filed by Nov. 7, or within 30 days of the Ohio EPA issuing the permit to install.

The appeal process would play out internally within the Ohio EPA but after a finding either party would have the option to appeal to a court of law, according to Boggs.

Nine residents spoke in opposition to the installation of fuel cells at the data center.

Councilman Les Carrier called for the city to look into whether Amazon is correctly calculating the net profit taxes it owes the city and whether the city could rescind tax abatement agreements it has with Amazon because the site plan on which it was based when approved is being amended to allow for the on-site fuel cells.

“They haven’t acted in good faith. It’s not a data center. It’s a power plant with a data center attached to it and that is not what we agreed to,” Carrier said.

Carrier also questioned whether Boggs, an attorney at Frost Brown Todd, could effectively represent the city because of corporate clients that other attorneys at Frost Brown Todd represent.

Councilwoman Cynthia Vermillion also asked whether the city could use alternate outside council that are experts in representing residents or consumers challenging the actions of corporations and utilities.

Boggs indicated that at the direction of City Council, he would file an appeal by Nov. 7 but that he would discuss with Ralley options for alternate representation for the appeal process.

The city’s appeal seeks to block a 73-megawatt on-site fuel cell system to power the Amazon data center under construction on Scioto Darby Road.

Speaking in reaction to AEP’s withdrawal of an application to the city’s planning and zoning commission to install the fuel cells, Ralley said the city is “disappointed to not have the opportunity to formally review the project as we would with almost all other new development projects in Hilliard.”

The Planning and Zoning Commission first considered the case Oct. 9 but tabled it until Nov. 13 to further consider how the Ohio EPA or other entities might monitor the site after it is operational, but AEP notified the city Oct. 21 it was withdrawing the application and did not require any consideration from the planning and zoning commission.

“These are the types of issues that should be addressed at the local level. It is regrettable that state lawmakers have overridden local oversight, particularly since this technology is unfamiliar and new not just to our city, but also the entire state,” Ralley said.

Ralley is referring to Section 4906.13(B) of Ohio Revised Code, stipulating that the Ohio Power Siting Board has the sole authority to consider Amazon’s proposal for fuel cells.

FOOT OFF THE GAS: California officials are still riding high on the back of record-breaking electric vehicle sales — but the post-EV-incentive hangover is about to set in.

The Trump administration’s shredding of former President Joe Biden’s EV playbook — most notably the $7,500 federal tax credit for drivers — catalyzed a wave of purchases ahead of the Oct. 1 expiration date, resulting in a quarter where nearly 30 percent of all cars sold in California were battery-electric and plug-in hybrid.

Gov. Gavin Newsom is taking the rare win in a brutal year for EV policy, including Republicans’ rollback of the state’s EV sales mandate and plateauing EV market share.

“We’re setting new records because this state believes in innovation, not isolation,” Newsom said earlier this month after the state released sales data for July through September.

That victory lap is likely to be short-lived, though.

A J.D. Power market analysis released Thursday projected that EVs will represent just 5 percent of new car sales nationally in October, a nearly 60 percent plunge from September and a 40 percent drop compared to the same month last year.

And while California has by far the largest and most mature EV market in the nation, auto industry experts say the state isn’t immune to larger market shifts.

“Sales will decline in the short run for sure,” said Gil Tal, director of the University of California, Davis’ EV Research Center. “That’s pretty clear — we saw a lot of sales in September and we’ll see fewer the rest of the year.”

Meanwhile, the two major U.S. automakers — Ford and General Motors — said in earnings reports and calls last week that they’re planning to build more gas-powered pickup trucks and SUVs to make up for projected losses in their EV businesses.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said at an event a day before the federal EV tax incentive expired.

Car dealers say they’re already seeing the impact on the ground. Jessie Dosanjh, president of the California Automotive Retailing Group, said he’s seen a dramatic decrease in traffic online and at his 17 showrooms during October, and that he’s expecting a lower supply of EV models in the coming years. His dealerships represent 11 brands, including Chevrolet, Ford and Hyundai, which have all made major investments in EVs and battery manufacturing.

“They have to be profitable at the end of the day,” Dosanjh said of the automakers. “So I do see reduced EV production, and the ones that are produced are probably going to be cheaper.”

Market analysts say that despite the headwinds, the long-term trajectory of the American auto industry is still trending towards EVs. Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at automotive research firm Edmunds, said that while companies are rethinking how aggressively they’ll push the technology, they’re still rolling out new models and competing over pricing.

Hyundai announced plans earlier this month to slash the price of its popular Ionic 5 by $9,800, while Ford, GM and Tesla are all dropping prices or rolling out cheaper models.

“Automakers are committed to electric vehicles, so it’s not as if they’re going away,” Caldwell said. “I think all this means is that the timeline to get to a majority mix of electrified vehicles is just going to be a bit slower.”

California’s tools to speed up that timeline are limited in the face of Trump’s assaults on state policy and a looming budget deficit that has already forced Newsom to back away from his commitment to backfill the federal incentives.

State regulators launched rulemaking last week on new vehicle emissions standards — including the possibility of reviving an EV sales mandate — that they hope to complete by summer 2027. But those rules wouldn’t be submitted for the federal approval needed to enforce them until 2029 — if a Democrat wins the 2028 presidential election.

Even without sticks, EV advocates say they still have a trump card — the looming Chinese EV market behemoth. Chinese companies like BYD have rapidly grown into the world’s largest EV manufacturers, and while high tariffs have kept them out of the U.S. market, even American auto executives admit they pose an existential threat.

“The Chinese make 30 million cars a year, and they could make 50 million if they could find a market for them,” said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican consultant who founded a nonprofit that supports increased electric vehicle adoption. “If we want to have an auto industry, we have to figure out how to compete in EVs.” — AN

DON’T MAKE ME SAY IT: An oil giant is taking California to court.

Exxon Mobil sued the state on Friday over its first-in-the-nation climate disclosure laws, reports Lesley Clark for POLITICO’s E&E News. The corporation is arguing that the new rules will force them to use frameworks that disproportionately blame large companies for climate change.

“California may believe that companies that meet the statutes’ revenue thresholds are uniquely responsible for climate change; but the First Amendment categorically bars it from forcing ExxonMobil to speak in service of that misguided viewpoint,” the company wrote in its suit.

SB 253, the first bill the firm is taking umbrage with, would require corporations with at least $1 billion in revenue to report carbon emissions across their supply chains beginning in June 2026, according to draft guidelines. Its companion measure, SB 261,would require businesses with revenues of more than $500 million to disclose climate-related financial risks starting in January.

The California Air Resources Board is expected to finalize the disclosure rulemaking early next year

Last year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a suit similarly arguing First Amendment infringement. That litigation has failed to block the rulemaking process and an appeal is pending in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Newsom’s office pointed to that ongoing court case to defend the laws.

“Truly shocking that one of the biggest polluters on the planet would be opposed to transparency,” said Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for the governor. “These laws have already been upheld in court and we continue to have confidence in them.” — LC, NB

REFLECTION SEASON: Dozens of conservation and environmental justice groups are looking back on this year’s legislative session — and not liking what they’re seeing.

“Under the guise of ‘affordability’ and ‘abundance,’ you enacted the most regressive policies in generations,” the groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment, the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition and the Leadership Counsel on Justice & Accountability Action, wrote to Newsom and the Legislature in a letter on Monday.

They called out in particular this year’s passage of SB 131, which overhauled the California Environmental Quality Act in the name of building more housing, and SB 237, which cleared the way for more oil drilling in Kern County. — CvK

MILKING IT: A historic $40 million settlement with environmental groups in January was supposed to mark the end of most cattle and dairy farms in Point Reyes National Seashore. But it didn’t stop Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from getting involved, Heather Richards reports for POLITICO’s E&E News.

Kennedy has told people he’s enlisted Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who’s dispatched Wyoming lawyer and Interior political appointee Karen Budd-Falen to broker a Point Reyes solution.

It’s unclear what exactly the team could do. Most of the ranchers in the settlement have already closed operations and moved away. And some of them have sent a letter to GOP lawmakers investigating the settlement asking them to back down, calling the agreement the only “viable option” after years of litigation and uncertainty.

But the fight seems tailor-made for Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” agenda, which in part emphasizes small farms and weaning people off processed foods, something that also resonates deeply in Marin County. He got involved after appeals from one of the region’s pioneering organic dairy farmers, Albert Straus, and a wellness influencer named Chadwick Conover.

“It was the first glimmer of hope that I had that we could do something,” Straus said of Kennedy’s interest. — HR, CvK

BUMPY ROAD: Rivian’s announcement last week that it plans to lay off more than 600 workers was the latest blow in a year of bad news for the Irvine-based company.

The luxury electric SUV and truck maker has failed to replicate its 2024 quarterly sales at any point this year, according to data from the California New Car Dealers Association. Rivian’s sales through September are 3 percent lower compared to the same period last year, even with the sales boost driven by the expiring federal incentives.

Meanwhile, its most popular model — the R1S — has slipped from seventh to ninth on the EV sales list amid competition from new offerings like the Honda Prologue.

Rivian plans to add a $45,000 SUV and an e-bike to expand its consumer base, but the company faces an uphill fight to reverse $1.1 billion in losses during the second quarter. — AN

CAP AND RETURN: Newsom appointed Emily Wimberger chief of staff and policy advisor to new California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez on Friday. Wimberger was a cap-and-trade expert at CARB from 2019 to 2023, then worked at Rhodium Group and Hua Nani Partners. — CvK

Google and NextEra Energy sign a 25-year agreement for Duane Arnold’s energy, as well as an agreement to explore deployment of nuclear generation nationwide

JUNO BEACH, Fla., and MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Oct. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — NextEra Energy today announced two transformative agreements with Google, which will strengthen U.S. nuclear leadership and help meet growing energy demand from artificial intelligence (AI) with clean, reliable nuclear energy.

The cornerstone of this collaboration is the planned restart of the Duane Arnold Energy Center (Duane Arnold), Iowa’s only nuclear facility, which is located in Palo, near Cedar Rapids. Once operational, Google will purchase power from the 615-MW plant as a 24/7 carbon-free energy source to help power Google’s growing cloud and AI infrastructure in Iowa, while also strengthening local grid reliability, creating thousands of direct and indirect jobs, and driving significant economic investment to the Midwest region.

In addition to Google’s 25-year agreement to purchase carbon-free nuclear energy from the Duane Arnold plant, one of the plant’s current minority owners, Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO), will purchase the remaining portion of the plant’s output on the same terms as Google. NextEra Energy has signed definitive agreements to acquire CIPCO and Corn Belt Power Cooperative’s combined 30% interest in the plant, which will bring NextEra Energy’s ownership to 100%. Duane Arnold, which was shut down in 2020, is expected to be online and delivering electricity onto the grid by the first quarter of 2029, pending regulatory approvals to restart the plant.

Powering AI growth

As the U.S. enters a new era of innovation and opportunity driven by AI, this strategic collaboration aims to enable Google to grow its business needs responsibly. The power purchase agreement with Google enables the investment to restart the plant and covers costs for the production of energy from Duane Arnold. Restarting the plant will increase generation capacity for the region, and energy customers in Iowa will not bear any costs associated with the power Google purchases from the facility. NextEra Energy’s strategic investments in nuclear and advanced generation help position Google to deploy AI that can grow the American economy, create jobs, accelerate scientific advances, improve health and educational outcomes, and strengthen national and global security.

To that end, NextEra Energy and Google have also signed an agreement to explore the development of new nuclear generation to be deployed in the U.S., which would help power America’s growing electricity needs.

“Restarting Duane Arnold marks an important milestone for NextEra Energy,” said John Ketchum, chairman and CEO of NextEra Energy. “Our partnership with Google not only brings nuclear energy back to Iowa — it also accelerates the development of next-generation nuclear technology. Thanks to the leadership of the Trump Administration, Google and NextEra Energy are answering the call of America’s golden age of power demand, creating thousands of jobs, strengthening Iowa’s economy, delivering long-term value to our shareholders and helping power America’s future through innovation and technology.”

“Building on two decades of work in Iowa, including our recent $7 billion investment in the state this May, Google is proud to partner with NextEra Energy to reopen the Duane Arnold Energy Center – a project that will deliver nuclear energy and hundreds of new job opportunities in the Hawkeye State by the beginning of 2029,” said Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google. “This partnership serves as a model for the investments needed across the country to build energy capacity and deliver reliable, clean power, while protecting affordability and creating jobs that will drive the AI-driven economy.”

This announcement highlights NextEra Energy and Google’s long-standing relationship. NextEra Energy now has nearly 3 GW of energy projects executed with Google across the country, reinforcing its role of providing energy solutions to meet Google’s needs.

Iowa’s nuclear renaissance

According to a recently released economic study, the recommissioning of Duane Arnold is projected to generate substantial economic benefits, including:

Across Iowa:

More than 1,600 direct, indirect and induced jobs during the plant’s construction.

More than $340 million in annual economic output during operations.

In Linn County:

More than 800 direct, indirect and induced jobs during the plant’s construction and approximately 400 direct, full-time jobs during operations.

Local total earnings during construction of more than $89 million and local long-term earnings of more than $127 million.

More than $320 million in annual economic output during operations.

An average of $3 million in annual tax revenue to support schools, infrastructure and fire-rescue services.

“CIPCO has a proud and longstanding history with Duane Arnold Energy Center, and we’re thrilled that nuclear energy will once again contribute to our state’s energy future,” said Andrew St. John, executive vice president and CEO of CIPCO. “As a cooperative generation and transmission provider, CIPCO remains committed to our all-of-the-above energy strategy. The restart of Duane Arnold will strengthen our generation portfolio with clean, baseload generation — furthering our ability to deliver safe, reliable and cost-effective power to our cooperative member-owners across Iowa.”

“Iowa isn’t just a place to build; it’s a place to lead. Today’s exciting announcement from NextEra Energy and Google further cements Iowa’s leadership in powering America’s AI infrastructure,” stated Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds. “Meeting the demands of emerging technologies requires reliable, clean energy and the Duane Arnold nuclear facility is ideally positioned to deliver it. By advancing nuclear energy and AI innovation together, Iowa is shaping a sustainable digital future that drives economic growth, strengthens communities and keeps America competitive.”

“Bringing Duane Arnold back online is a big win for Linn County and the entire state of Iowa,” said State Sen. Charlie McClintock, who represents Iowa’s 42nd district. “Kids would watch their parents work at the plant and then grow up and work there themselves. Now, we’re bringing back multigenerational local jobs. This announcement shows that Iowa can support all forms of energy, and we can keep the lights on for our residents’ homes and local businesses, as well as the companies that we welcome to the Hawkeye State.”

The Duane Arnold restart follows a rigorous engineering evaluation, community engagement and close coordination with federal, state and local authorities. NextEra Energy is working proactively with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other governmental authorities to ensure a safe, timely and compliant return to service.

Nissan instead turned to Ford-SK for U.S. battery supply and now LiCAP for solid-state technology.","Nissan has developed prototype solid-state battery cells that promise to double driving range while cutting charging times in half compared to current lithium-ion batteries. The Japanese automaker achieved these performance targets through a partnership with U.S.-based LiCAP Technologies, marking a critical milestone in next-generation EV battery development—even as the company bleeds billions and shutters factories worldwide.

This isn’t just another battery announcement. It’s a technological lifeline thrown by a drowning automaker that’s betting its future on 2028 production targets while simultaneously slashing 20,000 jobs and selling off assets to survive the present.

Revolutionary Battery Technology With Desperate Timing

Nissan’s prototype all-solid-state battery cells have now reached performance benchmarks that could fundamentally reshape the EV market. The breakthrough builds on Nissan’s partnership with LiCAP Technologies, announced in August 2025, which focuses on developing a revolutionary “dry electrode” production process that eliminates the expensive, time-consuming wet-coating method used in conventional battery manufacturing.

Testing at Nissan’s advanced facilities in Japan and the United States has validated the technology’s potential. The automaker reports the new battery design achieves a significant jump in energy density and thermal efficiency, allowing vehicles to travel substantially farther between charges while reducing charging downtime to levels approaching gasoline refueling convenience.

Manufacturing Innovation Targets Cost Reduction

The key to Nissan’s confidence lies in LiCAP’s proprietary Activated Dry Electrode technology, which transforms how battery electrodes are produced. Traditional wet-coating involves mixing active materials with solvents, coating them onto collectors, then drying them in high-temperature ovens—a process that consumes massive energy and time. LiCAP’s dry process uses raw material powder applied directly to current collectors and flattened with roll presses, cutting production steps while reducing environmental impact.

This manufacturing efficiency is critical for Nissan’s ambitious cost targets. The company aims to achieve $75 per kilowatt-hour for battery packs, significantly below 2024’s industry average of $115 per kWh. Reaching that price point would make EVs competitive with gasoline vehicles on sticker price alone, eliminating one of the biggest barriers to mass adoption.

Nissan opened its all-solid-state battery pilot production line at its Yokohama plant in January 2025. The facility serves as a proving ground for scaling the technology from laboratory prototypes to mass-production-ready processes, testing everything from electrode manufacturing to cell assembly and quality control.

Production Timeline Faces Competitive Pressure

Nissan has committed to launching its first EVs equipped with in-house developed solid-state batteries by fiscal year 2028. While this represents an aggressive timeline for bringing revolutionary technology to market, the company faces fierce competition from rivals pursuing the same holy grail of EV batteries.

Chinese automaker Chery recently claimed 808-mile range with a solid-state battery prototype boasting 600 watt-hours per kilogram energy density, targeting 2027 production. Stellantis and Factorial validated 375 Wh/kg cells that charge from 15% to 90% in just 18 minutes, planning demonstration fleets by 2026. Toyota, leveraging partnerships with Sumitomo Metal Mining, aims for solid-state production as early as fiscal year 2027.

Perhaps most threatening: Chinese battery giants CATL and BYD, which control 55% of global battery sales, are both targeting solid-state launches around 2027. These companies possess the manufacturing scale and supply chain dominance that Japanese automakers like Nissan lost years ago.

Real-World Applications Still Speculative

While Nissan hasn’t confirmed which models will debut the new battery technology, industry speculation points toward future versions of the Ariya crossover or the company’s next compact EV platform. If performance claims hold up in real-world testing, EVs built with this technology could deliver more than 600 miles of range while recharging in less than half an hour—specifications that would reignite interest in Nissan’s performance sub-brands and potentially position the automaker as a frontrunner in the electric market.

The company’s investment into advanced battery chemistries reflects its broader push to align electric performance with affordability, longevity, and mass scalability. This approach mirrors global trends where automakers are pooling resources to overcome the cost and complexity of energy storage innovation.

EVXL’s Take

The timing of this announcement is almost comically tragic. Here’s Nissan, trumpeting a battery breakthrough that could revolutionize EVs by 2028, while simultaneously fighting for survival in 2025.

Let’s connect the dots from our recent coverage: In May, we reported that Nissan slashed 20,000 jobs and closed seven assembly plants after posting a $4.48 billion loss. The same month, the company announced plans to sell its $700 million Yokohama headquarters specifically to raise capital for “next-generation battery technology.” In July, Nissan shut down the historic Oppama plant that built the original Leaf—the vehicle that made Nissan an EV pioneer in 2010.

The company’s desperation shows in its scramble for partners. After merger talks with Honda collapsed in February, Toyota reportedly reached out—but nothing materialized. Nissan instead turned to Ford-SK for U.S. battery supply and now LiCAP for solid-state technology. This isn’t strategic collaboration—it’s survival mode.

The real question isn’t whether solid-state batteries work. We’ve seen impressive claims from Stellantis, Mercedes, and Chinese manufacturers. The question is whether Nissan can survive until 2028 to bring this technology to market. With Chinese competitors like Chery and BYD targeting 2027 production and controlling over half of global battery sales, Nissan’s three-year timeline might as well be a decade.

This announcement feels less like innovation leadership and more like a press release designed to reassure nervous investors that there’s still a plan. The technology is real, the partnership with LiCAP is legitimate, and the 2028 target might even be achievable. But none of that matters if the company runs out of cash before the breakthrough reaches production.

Despite having more than three years to develop and publish comprehensive guidance, Treasury has so far failed to do so.
“To date, the guidance issued by the Treasury Department has not addressed critical aspects of the 45Z credit, including how it can be claimed, validated, and ultimately monetized,” they continued.
“Many of these facilities have embraced innovation and are poised for further advancements if they are able to invest with long term clarity on the status of the 45Z credit.
“We urge the Treasury Department to take immediate action and finalize the rules to implement the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit,” the lawmakers continued.","More than two dozen federal lawmakers on Oct. 20 sent a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urging his agency to finalize guidance for the 45Z clean fuel production credit, as amended by the One Big Beautiful Bill earlier this year.

“The 45Z credit should be leveraged to increase our country's capacity to produce domestic renewable fuels, increase demand for domestic agriculture, and for the biofuel industry to make continued investment in expanding and improving their production capacity,” the lawmakers wrote. “At a time when farmers are struggling to find foreign market access for commodities, recurring domestic demand from the biofuels industry is more important than ever. The effective, timely, and scientific implementation of 45Z is essential to realize the credit's full potential.”

The letter stresses the importance of the updated credit’s feedstock provisions, which limit eligible feedstocks to those produced in North America. “It is vital Treasury ensures this intent is fully carried out in guidance, ensuring no loopholes are available to undermine the importance of the program for farmers,” the lawmakers wrote.

The 45Z credit was initially established by the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law more than three years ago. Despite having more than three years to develop and publish comprehensive guidance, Treasury has so far failed to do so. “Continued delays in finalizing 45Z rules may risk hindering economic growth, innovation, and job creation across the nation,” the lawmakers wrote. “Now that Congress has acted to change the provision to make it even more closely tied with the economic success of the American farmer, it is more important than ever to get clarity the biofuels industry has been desperately seeking.

“To date, the guidance issued by the Treasury Department has not addressed critical aspects of the 45Z credit, including how it can be claimed, validated, and ultimately monetized,” they continued. “This lack of clarity has left capital stranded, stalling investments that are essential for fueling American jobs and strengthening our domestic energy sector. Furthermore, the current guidance excludes many existing producers of clean fuels who have already undergone the Environmental Protection Agency's rigorous processes under the Renewable Fuel Standard.”

The letter also notes that many U.S. facilities that produce clean fuels from waste streams current lack a clear pathway to access the 45Z credit. Any rulemaking by Treasury must include all eligible fuel producers sourcing domestic feedstocks who have made significant investments and are adding substantial value to our rural communities today,” the lawmakers wrote.

“The United States' biofuels industry contributes billions in commerce for American farmers,” they added. “Many of these facilities have embraced innovation and are poised for further advancements if they are able to invest with long term clarity on the status of the 45Z credit. Our country relies on a thriving agricultural, food, and renewable fuels sector to support our economy and communities, especially in current times where farmers are seeing a lack of demand while still experiencing extremely high input costs. Delays in finalizing these rules threaten this vital industry and undermine the intent of the law.

“We urge the Treasury Department to take immediate action and finalize the rules to implement the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit,” the lawmakers continued. “Moreover, we strongly request that these rules provide a clear and understood path for all existing renewable fuels producers in the United States utilizing domestic feedstocks. If properly implemented, this credit can fully mobilize the biofuel industry, growing our domestic manufacturing base, creating jobs, diversifying the U.S. energy portfolio, adding value to crops grown by American farmers, and offering consumers better, more affordable, and lower carbon options at the fuel pump and in the skies.”

The project marks a significant milestone for SJI, as it will be the first to deliver RNG into the pipeline system of South Jersey Gas, a subsidiary of SJI. The milestone event was attended by local and state elected officials, and company leadership.

“We are thrilled to cut the ribbon on this project, which signifies another milestone for SJI,” said Chet Benham, president, SJI Renewable Energy Ventures. “This project underscores our commitment to innovation and continuing efforts in renewable energy solutions.”

The RNG produced at the ACUA plant is planned to be used as transportation fuel and directly injected into the South Jersey Gas pipelines, offering RNG for the first time to supply energy to homes and businesses in the South Jersey Gas territory.

The facility is anticipated to have a nameplate capacity of 2,500 SCFM of landfill gas and is expected to produce more than 650,000 MMBtu, which is equivalent to nearly 4.6 million gallons of gas, per year of RNG.

“ACUA has consistently demonstrated its commitment to exploring and implementing technologies that transform waste into a resource and improve our environment,” said ACUA President Matthew DeNafo. “This project embodies that commitment, and we’re happy to celebrate its opening alongside our wonderful partners OPAL and SJI.”

Once operational, the RNG produced at the ACUA’s solid waste landfill is also expected to reduce methane emissions from the landfill and avoid over 346,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year.

“The opening of this facility marks an important milestone in OPAL Fuels’ mission of turning waste into clean, domestic energy,” said Adam Comora, Co-Chief Executive Officer of OPAL Fuels. “This project reduces emissions, improves local air quality, creates jobs, and strengthens American energy independence. As we drive forward with a focus on strategic growth and operational excellence, this project serves as an example of how landfills can benefit from producing RNG by generating financial value, cutting methane emissions, and displacing diesel to decarbonize transportation.”

The process is expected to reduce the volume of methane gas combusted at the facility, resulting in a reduction in on-site emissions.

It’s just a shame the social media giant is also going big on gas plants in Louisiana to power its data centers at the same time.

The latest PPAs include ENGIE’s new 600-megawatt (MW) Swenson Ranch Solar project in Stonewall County, southeast of Lubbock. When it comes online in 2027, Swenson will become ENGIE’s largest solar farm within its 11 GW North American portfolio of solar, wind, and battery storage projects.

ENGIE says the $900 million project will create over 350 construction jobs and generate over $158 million in tax revenue for Stonewall County and the local hospital district over its lifetime.

“Our objective is to bring reliable, cost-competitive power to the grid as rapidly as possible, and projects like Swenson demonstrate the importance of solar to meet the timely needs of our customers,” said Dave Carroll, ENGIE North America’s CEO and chief renewables officer.

Meta’s head of global energy, Urvi Parekh, said the expanded deal with ENGIE “enables us to continue matching 100% of our electricity use with clean and renewable energy to support our data center operations,” Parekh said.

Electrek’s Take

Meta isn’t exactly putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to matching 100% of its electricity use with clean energy. The social media giant is also building a $10 billion data center – one of the world’s largest – in Richland Parish, Louisiana, that’s going to be powered by three gas-powered plants, which utility Entergy will build especially for Meta, which is paying 50% of the costs. Those three plants will produce 2,262 MW of dirty fossil fuel power. For perspective, that’s nearly 10% of Entergy’s current energy capacity across four states.

So while the 1.3 GW of clean energy that ENGIE will produce in Texas for Meta is great, it doesn’t make up for the CO2 emissions it’s about to create with this dirty project it’s building in a lower-income farming community in Louisiana. It certainly isn’t for speed, because solar is the fastest to put up. Limited state oversight – and a 2024 state law that lets the company skip paying sales tax – likely helped Meta make that destructive decision.

Huge wins, with much more to come.” Spear said ATA’s most important initiative remaining in its crosshairs is EPA’s low-NOx rule.
“We outright oppose any federal rule that intentionally wipes out individual choice, crushes opportunities, and sidelines hundreds of thousands of truckers who move our economy,” said Spear.
“We don’t lack people with CDLs… what we lack is the number of qualified drivers who meet our high standards of professionalism and safety.
“The overwhelming majority of America’s 3.6 million professional truck drivers take immense pride in their work,” Spear continued.","Against the backdrop of a three-year-long freight recession, American Trucking Associations’ President and CEO Chris Spear highlighted some of the organization’s wins as the trucking industry ushers in a more trucking-friendly political and regulatory era.

“We are in a market situation where demand remains low, and capacity is far too high,” said Spear to fleet executives, state associations, and industry suppliers at the 2025 ATA Management Conference & Exhibition in San Diego. “We know what a challenge that is and continues to be for each of you. It underscores why your advocacy of the ATA policy agenda is more important now than ever before.”

Spear touted several legislative and regulatory wins in the first nine months of the 119th U.S. Congress and the second Trump administration. “President Trump and the Republican-led Congress have wasted zero time moving several ATA priority issues,” said Spear, including the elimination of California’s Advanced Clean Truck, Advanced Clean Fleet, and Low NOx regulations; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas III requirements; English Language Proficiency enforcement; entry-level driver training; cabotage; cargo theft; and the use of recreational marijuana. “We upended the Biden-Su assault on independent contractors and expanded workforce development opportunities, dropped federal legislation on lawsuit abuse… and ATA helped add yet another $200 million for truck parking. Huge wins, with much more to come.”

Spear said ATA’s most important initiative remaining in its crosshairs is EPA’s low-NOx rule. “This rule is effective, but it’s also untested and littered with several added costs per power unit that have little to no impact on the environment,” he said. “Our conversations with the EPA are ongoing, and we’re pushing for an immediate answer on their reopening, delaying, and changing the rule. We’ll keep you posted.

The need for tort reform and the impact of nuclear verdicts were hot topics at this year’s MC&E, and Spear said ATA’s state-level support in recent years has helped nearly 20 states pass legislation to reduce the financial impact on the trucking industry.

“This White House and Congress may well be in a position to help us push through some federal reforms, including a bill we had introduced last month that would move these frivolous state suits to a level playing field in federal court,” said Spear. “So for the first time, ATA is putting a secondary lawsuit abuse strategy to advance federal legislation into full motion, further kicking the plaintiffs’ bar to the curb.”

On the labor front, Spear highlighted the need to erase Biden-era independent contractor regulations and focus on attracting and retaining qualified and skilled drivers.

“We outright oppose any federal rule that intentionally wipes out individual choice, crushes opportunities, and sidelines hundreds of thousands of truckers who move our economy,” said Spear. “Having a rule we understand and can comply with will protect the more than 350,000 independent contractors who have a critical role in our industry.”

The driver shortage didn’t rank in the American Transportation Research Institute’s Top Industry Issues report for the first time in the survey’s 21-year history, but Spear said a relative shortage of talent remains, highlighted by recently publicized crashes of unqualified drivers in Florida and California.

“It’s about qualifications,” said Spear. “We don’t lack people with CDLs… what we lack is the number of qualified drivers who meet our high standards of professionalism and safety. Qualified means you can speak English, read road signs, understand safety rules, and respect our laws. Qualified means you are not abusing alcohol or using drugs. Qualified means you earned your CDL the right way, not through a rubber-stamped process in a state that looks the other way.

“The overwhelming majority of America’s 3.6 million professional truck drivers take immense pride in their work,” Spear continued. “They meet every requirement every day, and they move our economy forward with skill, **responsibility,",https://img.ccjdigital.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/chrisspear.7wibnN8rUL.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-27 19:59:36.343960

In termination letters, the agency told several grantees that the projects no longer align with the Trump administration’s pro-energy, especially pro-fossil fuel, approach.

But a review of cut projects reveals that the Trump administration actually eliminated more than $1 billion for fossil fuel research.

The DOE also overstated how much it saved taxpayers, according to an agency list of terminated projects that CPR News matched with publicly available spending estimates.

The data indicate that the DOE actually terminated far less funding — $5.8 billion worth of federal awards, which ranged from money for transmission lines to research on capturing carbon from the atmosphere.

Around $403 million of that money has already been distributed to recipients, further limiting what the government is able to recoup.

In a press release, the department said the 223 projects it terminated “would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” and did not “expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy.”

But some recipients said their work supports the Trump administration’s agenda, raising questions about how exactly the DOE picked projects to cut.

Dan Zimmerle’s center at Colorado State University works directly with oil and gas companies to help them reduce methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. That has both an environmental benefit but also helps companies detect leaks, sell more natural gas and improve their bottom line.

He said in 14 years of working with the DOE, he’s never had a grant canceled. “Most of the projects we had canceled are quite well-aligned with the administration’s stated objectives,” he said.

The DOE did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the criteria it used to terminate projects or the discrepancy of the total cuts.

Yale School of the Environment professor Kenneth Gillingham said eliminating such funding is “incredibly disruptive,” and would set the U.S. behind. The government has historically played a major role in funding scientific research, which has led to medical breakthroughs and even the internet.

“Having funding pulled is a death knell to many projects that have real jobs and real people’s lives attached to them,” he said.

“Pulling back on that innovation is just simply short-sighted.”

Some projects received bipartisan funding

In a press release and a TV interview, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that each project underwent a “thorough, individualized financial review,” and denied the cuts targeted Democratic states.

“Our decisions have been made over the last few months,” he said during a CNN interview. He said a team of advisors evaluated over 2,400 projects on “whether it makes sense for the American taxpayers or not.”

White House budget director Russell Vought was more blunt — he said in a post on X that the projects were part of “Green New Scam” climate initiatives undertaken by Democrats.

But at least 56 terminated grants had already received congressional funding through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, according to grant descriptions. Others received congressional investments from the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark Biden-era climate law.

Some projects had even been greenlit to continue work by the Trump administration as recently as May, according to publicly available grant updates.

The terminations have caused uncertainty, looming layoffs and confusion in Colorado, where the DOE has marked 34 grants for termination.

In a letter, Colorado’s Democratic congressional delegation has demanded answers from the DOE about why projects were terminated. They have not received an explanation, according to a spokesperson for Sen. Michael Bennet.

A larger group of Democratic and independent U.S. senators also criticized the cuts and said the DOE likely broke the law by terminating contracts that Congress authorized.

“The illegality of your cancellations is the only thing as indisputable as the harm your cancellations will wreak,” they wrote in a letter to Wright and Vought.

Oil and gas projects get the axe

From a metal, springy catwalk, Zimmerle surveyed five large tanks that typically hold fluids collected from oil and gas drilling. The tanks are empty, though, and the wells around them are fake.

“It’s a Hollywood set,” he said, gesturing to an array of equipment that is not being actively used for drilling.

Zimmerle runs the Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center (METEC) at Colorado State University. It’s both a research group and the only test facility of its kind in the United States.

The facility allows researchers and oil and gas operators to study advanced ways to detect methane leaks and simulate tests around real equipment.

Part of the center’s funding comes from DOE contracts. The funds support its operations and emissions research. The money also supports oil and gas companies to get technical assistance from the facility.

“We probably work with 40 to 60 operators on any given year, and they’re getting value from that,” Zimmerle said.

In January, the DOE awarded Zimmerle’s group some of the largest grants CSU has ever received. One project, for $299 million, was for equipment and technical and job training for small oil and gas operators, many in Republican-led states.

But in October, the DOE said it canceled several of the center’s grants.

Zimmerle said a termination letter he received indicated his active projects did “not align with agency priorities.”

The Trump administration, though, has been an avid supporter of the oil and gas industry, which has also actively supported Zimmerle’s work.

The Environmental Partnership, a trade group representing U.S. onshore oil and gas companies and run by the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement that the facility has “played a vital role” in helping companies cut their emissions.

The DOE did not return a request for comment about Zimmerle’s projects.

Greener energy targeted

Around 80 miles south, on a grassy plain a few miles from the Denver airport, Hank Price is doing very different research. He stood in the shadow of a nearly three-story collection of curved mirrors, part of a large, curved solar device dubbed the Sun Beam.

It’s used as part of a technology called Concentrating Solar Power.

Unlike traditional solar panels, the technology uses mirrors to create heat. It then repurposes that heat to create electricity. Solar power plants built using the technology solve a perennial problem: they can generate power even after the sun sets.

Price’s company, Solar Dynamics, has been testing and improving the technology over the last decade, partly supported by contracts with the federal government, he said.

One project sought to improve how solar power plants collect heat in storage tanks. Those tanks can store heat using “molten salt” at over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. But in the past, they’ve developed leaks and failed, sometimes spectacularly, posing a major challenge for the solar industry.

A major plant backed by a DOE loan suffered tank issues and went bankrupt, costing American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.

Gillingham, the Yale professor, said it was not unusual for some DOE projects to stall, or even fail, because other projects may lead to breakthroughs.

“When the government is investing in grants that are competitively awarded, they recognize that some of those grants are not gonna work,” he said.

One of Price’s projects aimed to test how those storage tanks are designed, to understand why they failed and how to fix them. The work is also relevant to “advanced nuclear energy” sites that use molten salt.

While the Trump administration has expressed outright hostility towards solar power, officials have been bullish about advanced nuclear energy. Secretary Wright’s first secretarial order called for the DOE to prioritize research on advanced nuclear power.

But Price’s grant was canceled for not aligning with the DOE’s priorities, according to his termination letter.

It took Price years to apply for and receive the federal awards, and he just lost his two largest contracts. His company will likely shut down in a few months.

“We’ve had a heck of a ride,” said Patrick Marcotte, Price’s cofounder, who had helped engineer and then build the Sun Beam by hand. “We’ve had a lot of fun doing this stuff, and haven’t given up hope entirely yet.”

More cuts, and likely lawsuits, coming

Since its initial announcement, the DOE has canceled funding for $700 million in battery and manufacturing projects across the country. Another DOE list claims to show more than $20 billion in cuts, according to E&E News.

Recipients can appeal their grant cancellations, and also sue the government. Jennifer Danis, the federal energy policy director at the Institute for Policy Integrity, a think tank, said these types of lawsuits are “relatively uncharted territory.”

“Across the country, courts are actively grappling with the rapid-fire grant terminations coming from this administration, for non-alignment with new agency priorities and goals,” she said.

In some cases, states are pushing back. Last week, a federal judge issued a ruling preventing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from terminating several awards issued to Washington state.

“By allowing a change in an administration to upend multi-year grants would cause unnecessary chaos across the vast world of government-supported endeavors undertaken by states, universities, non-profits, and others,” Judge Marsha J. Pechman wrote in her ruling.

Danis said the Trump administration is proving itself an unreliable investment partner by canceling grants on such short notice.

The cancellation of funding for Zimmerle’s CSU lab has left his team urgently seeking new funding. Without it, he’ll have to lay off staff and maybe shut down his facility.

“The damage is done now,” he said. “Success in a court case six months or nine months from now isn’t going to impact what we have to do right now.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/20251016-federal-grants-solar-hank-price-hwv-019.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 19:59:17.703109

Our world is at a crossroads today. The biodiversity crisis is accelerating, with forests, rivers, and ecosystems that sustain people and wildlife under the growing strain of climate shocks. Worryingly, the global commitment to conservation funding is wavering even as the stakes rise.

For example, Germany, long a leader in financing Indigenous tenure rights, is openly debating cuts, while development and climate finance face serious headwinds in the United States. Around the world, conservation is at risk of slipping down the agenda. But here’s the problem: the demand for action has never been louder.

We know this because Environmental Defense Fund, along with its partners in the Coalition for Nature & People undertook research across Brazil, Zambia, and Indonesia to better understand how conservation projects funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) are perceived and experienced by communities.

Interviews with Indigenous leaders and experts, and nationally representative polling confirm that we are in a delicate moment: there is strong public demand for conservation, but it is underpinned by skepticism about whether it will be delivered in ways that last.

84% of respondents said protecting nature is a top national priority.

86% expressed support for internationally funded conservation projects in their country.

73% agreed that Indigenous Peoples and local communities should hold leadership roles in those projects.

Expert interviews confirmed that conservation outcomes are consistently stronger when communities themselves are decision-makers.

These findings capture the paradox of this moment. Public will is clear. Community leadership works. Yet international support is uncertain, and the funding situation remains fragile.

And that’s why the role of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) like EDF is so pivotal now: not to replace community leadership, but to build bridges, convene partners, and amplify voices in a moment when conservation needs both urgency and legitimacy. That responsibility endures even as politics and funding realities shift. That means those that adapt and listen will remain relevant while those that don’t will quickly lose ground.

Recent global convenings, like the IUCN World Conservation Congress echoed this direction: progress depends not only on channeling more finance, but also how support is structured: flexible, rights-based, and aligned with locally-defined priorities. That means moving beyond grants alone to strengthen decision-making power, simplify burdensome reporting that can be culturally inappropriate, and reduce reliance on intermediaries so communities can steer their own outcomes. It also means addressing gaps in visibility and finance for African Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLCs), even as momentum grows in regions like the Amazon.

The good news is that we are making progress. Organizations like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) are pledging to direct 20% of resources to Indigenous Peoples and local communities; and the Legacy Landscapes Fund opened a funding window for Indigenous Peoples. Mechanisms such as the Tropical Forever Finance Facility (TFFF) point toward models where IPLCs are true co-owners with flexible funding and streamlined accountability, pairing resources with secure rights and real authority.

Why does that matter? Because nature is our life-support system. It shelters wildlife, sustains livelihoods, and holds the key to climate resilience. Conservation succeeds when it is rooted not in top-down control, but in human rights and equity.

The good news is we have a clear arc to build on. Last year, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) strengthened the formal voice of Indigenous Peoples. As we look toward Belém and COP30, four priorities are rising: 1) Increase the share of climate finance that reaches IPLCs directly; 2) Recognize Indigenous and local territories as vital carbon sinks in policy; 3) Embed traditional knowledge in adaptation metrics; 4) Ensure meaningful participation and decision-making.

These are the partnership standards EDF is working to advance.

The public mandate for conservation is strong and evidence of community-led effectiveness is overwhelming. What remains is to close the gap between demand and delivery and to ensure that the future of conservation is one that empowers people as much as it protects nature. INGOs have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do so, as conveners and partners who help communities lead.",https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/wp-content/blogs.dir/7/files//b01c9f1e-754b-4bc6-8245-582f6f6f6181-e1761602813692.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 19:59:28.750161

In their campaign ads, both Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli promise they will help curb energy bills if elected.","Over the past year, Suzann Hernandez and Camilo Aguirre have put a lot of effort into lowering their energy bill. Beyond simple solutions like turning off lights or closing doors when either the heat or AC was on, the couple insulated their windows and kept the temperature set at a strict 76 degrees, even on the hottest days of summer.

Despite their best efforts, however, their energy savings strategy had little impact against a rate hike that went into effect in their home state of New Jersey on June 1. The increase, approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in February, raised the average electric bill for residents in the state by 17%, the utilities company informed customers in a letter sent out earlier this year.

""We thought it'd be, see at least like a $50 decrease,"" Hernandez told CBS News' correspondent Tom Hanson. ""When we compared it to what we got this year, we only saw a $20 decrease.""

It's not only residents in the Garden State who are feeling the pinch of higher prices.

""This is a national problem,"" Dan Cassino, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, told CBS News.

According to a new report from PowerLines, a nonprofit focused on lowering utility bills, utility rate increase requests and approvals totaled more than $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025. That's almost double the $16 billion in requests and approvals over the same period in 2024.

Those rate hikes are expected to show up in the bills of over 124 million customers this year, PowerLines found. That will create economic hardship for customers For those Americans already struggling to make ends meet the hikes will mean additional economic hardship potentially affecting the wider economy, the organization said in its report.

By and large, customers nationwide are feeling powerless in the face of the escalating energy costs.

""It feels like there's nothing we can do about it,"" said Karin Gudal, an AES Ohio customer quoted in PowerLines report. ""We can try to make our buildings as energy efficient as we can...but even that takes money.""

Data shows that utility prices for American households have continued to climb. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, residential electricity prices this year were up 11% in August from January.

Politicians, meanwhile, are using their campaign platforms to cater to frustrated voters.

In New Jersey, for example, rising energy prices is an issue gubernatorial race candidates have latched onto in the lead up to elections on Nov. 4. In their campaign ads, both Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli promise they will help curb energy bills if elected.

Cassino expects the issue, which has consumed the political race in New Jersey, will soon reverberate in races throughout the country.

Then there’s the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which is in effect a carbon tax imposed on goods based on their carbon intensity (i.e.","The United States should be an international leader in the fight against energy poverty and for energy freedom.

Because, as of now, many countries are using their power through international bodies to impose their harmful, anti-energy climate agenda on countries who don’t share their ideological objectives.

This problem has recently been highlighted by the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) proposed global carbon tax on the shipping industry. Until just a few days ago the IMO, a specialized agency of the United Nations, was set to impose its “Net-Zero Framework,” what is in effect a tax on carbon dioxide emissions from ships that exceed certain thresholds to be paid for by shipping companies. The IMO would have collected the revenue and then distributed it for such things as rewarding “low-emission ships” and for U.N. income redistribution schemes to “mitigate negative [climate] impacts on vulnerable States.”

This tax is especially egregious because it is a violation of the sovereignty of the U.S. and other nations. A U.N. international body would be imposing a tax on Americans, something that appears to be a first. The tax, according to the State Department, could increase global shipping costs by 10 percent or more.

It’s also yet another example of Europe and the U.N. trying to dictate the domestic climate policies of other countries. The State Department made it clear that it understood the fundamental problem this posed when it stated that the U.S. would penalize nations “that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.”

Fortunately, the Trump administration helped to delay a vote on the IMO tax plan for a year, but it is still looming. A tax delayed is not a tax canceled.

The IMO tax, though, is far from the only effort to impose climate policies on other countries. This past July, the U.N.’s top court, the International Court of Justice, issued a nonbinding advisory opinion that reads more like a climate manifesto than an example of logical legal reasoning. It concluded that member states have a duty to reduce and regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

It also stated the “failure of a State to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG [Greenhouse Gas] emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act which is attributable to that State.”

While a nonbinding opinion, there is a very real possibility that this opinion will be used in various ways to justify greenhouse gas regulation in policy contexts across the world, as well as in litigation in other jurisdictions.

Then there’s the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which is in effect a carbon tax imposed on goods based on their carbon intensity (i.e. how much carbon dioxide is emitted during production). The EU’s reason for the tax is clear: “to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries.”

Once again, here’s that “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.” The EU isn’t imposing a tax based on the specific attributes of a good itself. Instead, it’s trying to use trade to influence and change the climate policies and production methods of other countries, in part to protect what remains of European industries as decarbonization bites.

It isn’t enough that EU nations have adopted harmful policies that punish energy use and increase prices for their own citizens. They need to make sure other countries hurt themselves too, including developing countries that need fossil fuels to advance the well-being of their citizens.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1073161148-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 06:58:23.799780

For now, demand for liquefied gas remains rather robust, even at current prices. The as Exporting Countries Forum reported this month that global exports of the superchilled fuel had hit an all-time high in September, at 34.59 million tons, representing a 3.7% annual increase thanks to a surge in buying from Europe, which is filling its storage caverns ahead of winter heating season. European LNG imports soared by 40% in September.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration earlier this month forecast that LNG capacity in North America alone could surge by more than 100% between now and 2029, to a total of 20 billion cubic feet daily, from 14 billion cubic feet daily at the moment. The continent is set to drive the global expansion in LNG capacity over the medium term.

The investment reflects Entergy Louisiana’s ongoing commitment to helping educational institutions across the state lower energy costs and reinvest savings into student success.

“McNeese plays an essential role in educating the next generation and supporting the economic vitality of Southwest Louisiana,” said May. “We’re proud to partner with them on projects that make their campus more energy efficient and free up resources that can be redirected to students and academic programs.”

The upgrades were part of a comprehensive energy optimization project at McNeese’s central chiller plant. The university analyzed system performance and identified opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce energy waste.

The chilled water plant previously operated with excessive pumping and outdated control procedures. With support from Entergy Solutions, variable frequency drives (VFDs) were added to the motors powering the primary, secondary, and condenser water pumps, as well as the cooling tower fans. The improvements have reduced total energy consumption by 20%, generating an estimated $90,000 in annual savings for the university.

“If we can lower our energy footprint, that fits into our mission as a university to be more sustainable and good stewards of our resources,” said Dr. Wade Rousse, McNeese president. “More importantly, lowering the cost of our operations helps us lower the cost of attending our institution, a benefit to our students, their families, and our community. Making higher education more affordable and accessible is at the heart of what we do and Entergy is helping us do that.”

Detroit breaks ground on first solar field under mayor's clean energy initiative

""There was nothing but illegal dumping and illegal activity going on here about a year ago, and now it's going to power the city,"" Duggan said.

The solar field will generate 10 megawatts of clean, renewable energy. Duggan said the goal is simple: to lower energy costs and make Detroit neighborhoods better.

""This is going to power huge numbers of city buildings and the money that we're making from the electricity, we're using to improve the houses of the neighbors across the street that will be here for the long term,"" Duggan said.

Haley Henley has lived in the Van Dyke-Lynch neighborhood for 50 years and said she's excited to see the transformation.

""It's kind of sad when you live in a neighborhood and you get afraid to come out in it after dark,"" Henley said. ""Thanks to the mayor for not forgetting about us.""

Neighbors like Dorothy Gladney are receiving numerous home improvements including roofing and insulation. Gladney received what she called a life-saving upgrade: a carbon monoxide detector.

""The best thing that this solar panel did was brought us together,"" Gladney said.

Four more neighborhoods are set to receive solar fields: Gratiot Findlay, State Fair, Greenfield Park and Houston Whittier. The total project will cover 167 acres.

The project is made possible by tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

""We said we're only going to the neighborhoods where we're wanted and as you can tell, we were very much wanted in this neighborhood,"" Duggan said.

The solar field is expected to be completed by mid-2026. DTE will hold additional informational sessions throughout construction.

The continuing federal shutdown means food benefits provided to 3.5 million Texans could be cut off in November, The Texas Tribune reported. Of those affected, nearly half are children.

“SNAP has funding available for benefits and operations through the month of October,” according to a letter written by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service to state agencies. “However, if the current lapse in appropriations continues, there will be insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the nation.”

More than $614 million is distributed monthly in Texas to recipients.

Currently, other assistance programs such as Medicaid and the Children Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, are not affected by the shutdown, which is in its fourth week.

Oil prices at lowest level since pandemic

Oil prices have dropped to their lowest level since early 2021, the Texas Standard reported. In an interview with Matt Smith, lead energy analyst at Kpler, he said strong supply is driving the drop per barrel to about $57.

Average gasoline prices in Texas stood at $2.79 a gallon in September, down 67 cents from two years ago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Smith said U.S. oil production in July, the latest monthly statistic available, was at a record high. He predicted the low oil prices could slow domestic production by next year.

Fall enrollment sets record at Texas colleges and universities

More than 1.6 million students enrolled this fall at Texas colleges and universities — an all-time high, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board reported. The preliminary numbers cover all levels of higher education, both public and private, and represent a 4.7% increase from last fall.

“The record enrollment numbers will help the state’s continuing efforts to build a talent-strong Texas and an increasingly educated workforce,” said Commissioner of Higher Education Wynn Rosser.

For the first time since the pandemic, enrollment numbers surpassed pre-pandemic numbers in each sector of higher education.

Judge tosses Texas book rating law

A Waco federal judge last week threw out a 2023 Texas law that required booksellers and publisher to rate their books based on sexual content and reference, kut.org reported. The ruling makes permanent a lower court’s temporary injunction that was later upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The firm representing the coalition of bookstores and publishers hailed the ruling as a “major First Amendment victory.”

“The READER Act would have imposed impossible obligations on booksellers and limited access to literature, including classic works, for students across Texas,” attorney Laura Lee Prather said in a statement.

HB 900 sought to restrict which books are available in school libraries. It also required booksellers to rate their own books. The bill’s author, state Rep. Jared Patterson, R-Frisco, posted on X that he was “deeply disappointed” by the judge’s decision. However, he said SB 412 passed in the last legislative session holds school personnel “accountable” for exposing a child to what he termed “harmful materials.”

Proposition would fund dementia prevention research

As early voting continues through Oct. 31, the Texas Medical Association is backing Proposition 14, which would provide $3 billion in funding over a 10-year period for research into preventing dementia. The proposal, if approved, would create the Dementia Prevention Research Institute of Texas.

Houston neurologist Reeta Achari, MD, who testified in favor of DPRIT’s creation on behalf of TMA, said Proposition 14 has the potential to make Texas a leader in dementia research, and thus “attract much-needed physicians and subject matter experts and innovators from across the world.”

Alzheimer’s disease comprises 60-80% of dementia cases and is becoming a public health crisis, according to a report from the Texas Department of State Health Services. More than 450,000 Texans over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer’s, the report states.

Opponents of the measure, according to a nonpartisan analysis by the Texas Legislative Council, fear it would create a new state bureaucracy without sufficient accountability and an open-ended financial risk for taxpayers.

Feds slash ACA enrollment program’s budget

With open enrollment set to begin for the Affordable Care Act, funding for a navigator program that helped 65,000 Texans enroll for health insurance has been slashed by 90%, The Tribune reported. As a result, nonprofits are seeking other ways to fund their efforts to help uninsured Texans find health care.

The state received $17 million in navigator grants last year. Most of the nearly 4 million Texans covered by an ACA plan find coverage on their own. However, navigators enrolled about 26,533 Texans and helped nearly 39,000 others obtain Medicaid.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid said the return on navigator investment was too low.

“Despite receiving $98 million in the 2024 plan year, Navigators only enrolled 92,000 consumers—just 0.6 percent of plan selections,” according to a CMS statement in February.

About 17% of all Texans are uninsured, the highest rate of all states.

Nearly one fourth of traffic deaths in oil and gas regions

The Texas Department of Transportation is urging drivers to be extra cautious when driving in one of the state’s five main energy regions — the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale, Anadarko Basin and the Haynesville/Bossier Shale. One in four of the state’s 1,023 traffic fatalities in 2024 occurred in those areas.

“Oil and gas production activity means large trucks and heavy machinery share the road with local traffic on rural roads and highways,” according to the news release. “Increased truck traffic can mean limited visibility for drivers and wear and tear on road surfaces, potentially creating hazards that are difficult to navigate and maneuver around.”

Nearly 79,000 traffic crashes occurred in those five regions. Failure to control speed and driver inattention were the top two factors contributing to those crashes.

The state has announced the development of 34 high-speed EV charging stations, developed as part of a national initiative to increase charging options.
States like California, which boasts the highest market share of EVs in the country, have numerous state-funded to programs, such as the Fast Charge California Project, to build out charging infrastructure.
To date, the NEVI program has helped build and open 93 high-speed charging stations, providing 410 ports, in more than a dozen states, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data dashboard.
When it comes to public charging, there are now more than 200,000 charging ports across the country, Rachel Reolfi, senior policy analyst for Atlas Public Policy, said.","In the next year, drivers on Arizona’s major interstates and state routes should have nearly three dozen new high-speed charging stations from which to choose to power up their electric vehicles (EV).

The state has announced the development of 34 high-speed EV charging stations, developed as part of a national initiative to increase charging options. Officials are seeking bids for private companies to build, upgrade, operate or maintain 34 stations. Of those, 31 are new locations. Proposals are due Jan. 16.

Funds provided by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program (NEVI) will cover up to 80 percent of the construction costs of the stations, which will be privately operated, Garin Groff, a public information officer with the Arizona Department of Transportation, said. Construction on the initial round of stations, which are along interstates, is expected to begin by the end of 2025, Groff said, adding: “We expect it will take about one year to complete the stations.”

This round of charging infrastructure funding follows a previous series approved in 2024 for 18 stations along Arizona interstates. Arizona is eligible for up to $76.5 million from the NEVI program, a $5 billion component of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The state was also awarded $13 million for local and tribal governments in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant program.

The NEVI-funded chargers, which will supply at least 150 kilowatts of power per plug, will be placed about 50 miles apart, and generally within about a mile of a highway. Arizona was home to nearly 89,800 EVs in 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s most recently available data. And in 2023, 9 percent of all light-duty vehicle sales in Arizona were electric, according to Atlas Public Policy.

At least 439,000 fully electric cars have been sold in the United States this year, according to the Zero Emission Transportation Association. U.S. EV sales in the third quarter were up 30 percent year-over-year, according to Cox Automotive — owing, in part, to the phasing out of EV sales federal tax credits in September, which prompted stirring EV sales prior to the phase-out.

States like California, which boasts the highest market share of EVs in the country, have numerous state-funded to programs, such as the Fast Charge California Project, to build out charging infrastructure.

To date, the NEVI program has helped build and open 93 high-speed charging stations, providing 410 ports, in more than a dozen states, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data dashboard.

Not only is this infrastructure helping to advance the sale and use of EVs, but the development is having an economic development impact, industry observers and advocates said. When it comes to public charging, there are now more than 200,000 charging ports across the country, Rachel Reolfi, senior policy analyst for Atlas Public Policy, said. A research firm, Atlas focuses on clean transportation and clean energy.

“Only a very small portion of those were directly funded by these programs,” Reolfi said, referring to public-sector programs like NEVI. “But there’s all this additional investment that’s also happening.”

Each year, the NC Clean Energy Technology Center (NCCETC) celebrates National Drive Electric Month (NDEM) with events to showcase the opportunities alternative fuel vehicles provide. This year, NDEM took place September 12 through October 12, with 196 events organized across the country.

NCCETC hosted three alternative fuel vehicle showcases in North Carolina on September 11, October 4, and October 6.

The September 11 event was held at Wake Forest University’s Allegacy Federal Credit Union Stadium, ahead of the North Carolina State University vs. Wake Forest University football game. This electric vehicle (EV) display & tailgate event featured three red, white, and blue Ford F-150 Lightnings, two Mustang Mach-Es, a Mercedes EQB 300, and four Tesla Models including a CyberTruck.

Catawba College participated in the showcase and got into the tailgate spirit by grilling in the back of their EVs. The college also brought a solar powered battery pack to help power their operations. This event was an excellent way to show the unique ways EVs can apply in various situations.

The next alternative vehicle showcase NCCETC held was another football tailgate on October 4, at NC State’s Carter-Finley Stadium. This event took place right before the NC State vs. Campbell University football game.

The showcase was positioned along the route to the football game, leading to increased foot traffic and interest from passersby. Vehicles featured included a Mini Cooper S Electric, Chevrolet Blazer, Mustang Mach E GT, Volkswagen I.D. BUZZ, Ford F-150 Lighting, Organic Transit ELF, Rivian R1T Launch Edition, Hyundai Ioniq 9, BMW i3, Mercedes EQB 300, Genesis GV60, and several Tesla models.

The Organic Transit ELF is a solar-powered electric-assist tricycle that was a hit and drew attention from people of all ages.

The bright orange Tesla Roadster (the first Tesla model produced) also garnered lots of attention, with tailgate goers stopping by to take photos of the vehicle, sit behind the wheel, and admire its design.

The BMW i3 functioned as a cooler on this hot day, providing many with cold waters and sodas on their way to the game.

As part of NC State’s College of Engineering, NCCETC always looks forward to hosting this event to connect with fellow members of the Wolfpack.

The final showcase held by NCCETC took place October 6 at NC State’s Centennial Campus. This event saw a lot of turnout from first year engineering students, along with other students and professionals who were passing by and stopped to observe the display.

The static vehicles on display included a Chevrolet Blazer, Chevrolet Bolt, Mustang Mach E GT, Volkswagen ID 4, Ford F-150 Lighting, and several Tesla models.

This event was also a “Ride & Drive”, where individuals with valid driver’s licenses had the opportunity to test drive select EVs. The Ride & Drive vehicles included SPIN scooters and bicycles, Volkswagen I.D. BUZZ, F-150 Ford Lighting, Ford Mustang Mach E, Tesla Model Y, Model 3, and a CyberTruck. The CyberTruck had the most interest by far, with students lining up for the chance to ride in one.

This showcase was a great way to capture the attention of young adults who may be looking to purchase a vehicle in the coming years. By offering an opportunity for students to learn about these alternative fuel vehicles first-hand, many walked away with a new perspective on how these vehicles could fit into their everyday lives.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission took another step to advance U.S. private industry production for nuclear fuel. The agency issued an Oct. 23 Federal Register notice seeking public comments on its draft environmental impact statement regarding a proposed TRISO–X LLC fuel fabrication facility on a 110-acre site at the Horizon Center in Oak Ridge in Tennessee.

TRISO–X, a wholly-owned subsidiary of X-energy Reactor Co. LLC, is seeking a special nuclear material license from the NRC to operate the nation’s first High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel fabrication facility called TX-1.

On Sept. 30 the U.S. Department of Energy announced it had selected the following four companies for its nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Projects:

Oklo Inc. of California—to build and operate three fuel-fabrication facilities for advanced reactors

Terrestrial Energy Inc. LLC of North Carolina—to develop a fuel line assembly to demonstrate a fuel salt fabrication process.

Valar Atomics Inc. of California—to support TRISO fuel fabrication for the ultra-low power Ward250 reactor and possibly other high-temperature gas reactors. The Ward250 operates under 250 kilowatts with a 30 effective full power day range.

Tennessee-based TRISO-X—to build/operate an additional fuel fabrication facility to pilot processes for integrating, training and validating to support commercializing TX-1 fuel fabrication.

The NRC is in the process of granting TRISO-X a 40-year license to have and use special nuclear material at a fuel manufacturing facility. Public comments are due Nov. 17.

According to the NRC, the TX-1 plant would make “tri-structural isotropic–based coated particles and final fuel forms using uranium enriched to less than 20 weight percent uranium-235.” Both issuing the license to have and make this type of nuclear fuel would be the first time the U.S. government allowed this kind of domestic supply chain operation.

Texas Gulf Coast to Receive First Batch of HALEU Fuel

In August, TRISO-X and its parent announced the award of a $48.2 million construction contract for TX-1 to produce the first commercial batch of X-energy’s proprietary tristructural-isotropic fuel with the Dow Chemical Co. on the Texas Gulf Coast.

“X-energy is advancing its initial Xe-100 plant at Dow Inc.’s UCC Seadrift Operations manufacturing site on the Texas Gulf Coast. Once complete, the plant is expected to provide the site with safe, reliable, and clean power and industrial steam,” according to an Aug. 5 joint statement from TRISO-X/X-energy Reactor.

Once licensed to operate by the NRC, the TX-1 facility would be able to produce 5 metric tons of uranium to power up to 11 of the parent company’s Xe-100 reactors. Each Xe-100 is an 80 megawatt electrical reactor that can be combined into a four-pack with a total 320 MWe output.

Second Nuclear Fuel Plant Venture with Amazon

TX-1 is the first of two planned facilities at X-energy’s site in Oak Ridge that will manufacture HALEU fuel.

“X-energy is also advancing its second plant with Energy Northwest in collaboration with Amazon,” the joint statement noted. “This project is part of a larger strategy with Amazon to bring more than five gigawatts of new power projects online by 2039, furthering the company’s mission to provide scalable, secure, clean energy solutions that meet the growing demand for energy across the U.S. and around the world.”

Federal Government Accelerating Nuclear Energy at Rapid Pace

Both the DOE and NRC are working together to streamline efficiencies that support commercialization of nuclear energy to bring more electricity to the grid. Reasons for the push are due to growing energy needs by AI and data centers as well as efforts by the Trump administration to decrease reliance on foreign countries in critical national sectors such as energy.

“President Trump has made clear that a strong nuclear sector is a central component of America’s energy security and prosperity,” Deputy Energy Secretary James P. Danly said in DOE’s announcement. “Restoring a secure domestic fuel supply will ensure that advanced reactors can move quickly from design to deployment and into operation. The ability to produce these fuels is essential to ensuring American leadership in nuclear energy and to meeting the nation’s growing demand for reliable power.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/685dea96df7d60ca8c93b97a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-27 18:18:36.889801

The Dakota Resource Council filed the suit against the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality and Riverview ND LLP in Traill and Burleigh counties.

Three North Dakota residents and a member of the Manitoba Eco-Network are disputing a decision by the North Dakota Department of Water Resources.

The Dakota Resource Council filed the suit against the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality and Riverview ND LLP in Traill and Burleigh counties.

The Department of Environmental Quality in September approved a permit to Minnesota-based Riverview for a 25,000-cow milking operation southeast of Hillsboro. Crews began moving dirt at the site for what Riverview calls the Herberg Dairy near the Red River earlier this month.

“Dairies the size of Riverview’s Herberg Dairy create enormous amounts of wastes that contain pollutants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, bacteria, pathogens, sediments, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, salts, and metals,” the lawsuit says. “When discharged to waters, these pollutants pose serious threats to the health and wellbeing of nearby communities and ecosystems.”

International commission to review North Dakota dairy projects

The Herberg Dairy and another 12,500-cow Riverview dairy under construction north of Wahpeton, known as the Abercrombie Dairy, could quadruple the number of dairy cows in the state. North Dakota’s dairy industry has been dwindling for decades.

The Dakota Resource Council on Oct. 9 also filed a petition asking the Department of Environmental Quality to reconsider its decision to issue the permit for the Herberg Dairy. The petition cited the agency’s failure to consider Riverview’s plans to install a stormwater drain and a drainage system, according to the court document.

Riverview, which operates several large dairies in western Minnesota, issued a statement last week on the permit reconsideration.

“The permits for our North Dakota dairy farms were approved after careful, science-based reviews by North Dakota regulators, and our dairies are designed and operated to meet or exceed environmental standards,” the statement said. “We’ll continue to listen, learn, and work closely with the community to ensure our dairy farms support local families, create jobs, and contribute positively to the region.”

Drainage from the dairies also is the topic of another challenge to the projects.

Three North Dakota residents and a member of the Manitoba Eco-Network are disputing a decision by the North Dakota Department of Water Resources. The agency ruled that drainage ditches at the Riverview sites in Richland and Traill counties do not qualify as drains that would need a state permit.

The citizens contend the drainage ditches authorized by the state have the potential to pollute the Red River.

A preconference hearing before an administrative law judge has been scheduled for Friday in that case.

Manitoba environmentalists and the provincial government have taken an interest in the dairies because the Red River flows north into Lake Winnipeg, a major recreational and commercial fishing resource.

Manitoba announced earlier this month that the International Joint Commission has directed its International Red River Watershed Board to review permits related to the dairy operations.

The Dakota Resource Council filed a lawsuit earlier this year seeking to have the Abercrombie permit revoked. A judge ruled that attorneys for the Dakota Resource Council did not properly serve the Department of Environmental Quality and dismissed the suit.

The Dakota Resource Council has a different attorney in the suit filed Friday. The lawsuit lists attorneys from Washington, D.C.-based Food and Water Watch and the Wild and Scenic Law Center in Oregon. It also lists Bismarck attorney Sarah Vogel, a former North Dakota agriculture commissioner.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47646/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/riverview_cows_feed-1024x6521761605367.jpg?h=881fb769&itok=BsED4Q6J,N,,2025-10-28 06:58:28.249407

Now, she has shifted her energy to building out the long-term strategic plan for The Chip Bag Project.","Eradajere Oleita makes improving her community a priority.

She’s an advocate for environmental preservation through local organizations like Detroit’s Green Task Force, and as an EcoWorks school coordinator, where she taught students about climate change.

Oleita stumbled on a video of a woman in England who fused used chip bags into sleeping bags. With the help of YouTube tutorials, Oleita made a couple of sleeping bags and donated them to local residents as a project for her 25th birthday.

The impact would extend far beyond her community.

The bags were a hit and quickly garnered an international audience. Donations – and sleeping bag requests from as far away as Singapore — have arrived since the social initiative began in 2020. The Chip Bag Project has distributed than 100 sleeping bags, Oleita said.

The sleeping bags are created by ironing layers of chip bags together until they form a thick layer, or blanket. The mylar material used to package chips is extremely useful as a warming utility: it reflects the heat of the occupant, making the bags a kind of cocoon.

It takes nearly 200 chip bags to produce a sleeping bag. The mylar material is also waterproof, making the bags durable in harsh weather conditions. The lightweight nature of the bag makes it convenient for individuals who move around often.

Now, five years after prototyping her first bag and scaling production, Oleita is revving up to take The Chip Bag Project to the next level. With a $167,000 grant from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, The Chip Bag Project will place neighborhood collection kiosks throughout the state.

Oleita plans to install the first kiosk at the Detroit People’s Food Co-op this fall.

“Our members are passionate about recycling and composting, so we are excited for the project. It will definitely be an opportunity for people to learn more about the mission,” said Jason Ford, director of operations for the Detroit Black Community Food Sovereignty Network, the nonprofit that built the co-op.

The Chip Bag Project aims to install additional kiosks at locations around the state in time for Earth Day 2026. The kiosks will serve as both a collection site and educational touchpoint where residents can learn more about upcycling and the use of mylar.

‘I want to create something that’s sustainable’

For Oleita, the mission of The Chip Bag Project goes beyond sleeping bags. She wants the world to think about how it can produce less waste.

“I’m in the field of figuring out how we can minimize our waste, and how we can have socially conscious human practices,” she told Planet Detroit.

Oleita’s passion for environmental justice began when she was a child in Nigeria. That passion led her to be a Clean Air and Water Fellow in 2019, a Work For Me, DTE! Fellow, and a Detroit organizer for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition.

Oleita said she’s slowed down and shifted her priorities from production to building infrastructure, despite the demand for more sleeping bags.

“I don’t want to rush something that feels so ordained,” Oleita said.

When the goal was to make only a few sleeping bags, Oleita said she could get by with support from friendly volunteers. Oleita credits her team with giving her the support to move forward, and recalls the exhaustion she experienced from producing bags while trying to establish the organization.

“It felt as if I was trying to build the bike, ride the bike, and fix the bike, all at the same time.”

A lack of resources made it hard to expand Oleita’s vision past the initial goal, she said. Now, she has shifted her energy to building out the long-term strategic plan for The Chip Bag Project.

Oleita is focused on building a sustainable nonprofit organization that caters to the cause long after the trend has passed, she said.

The project has five team members and a co-director. A seven-person advisory board is being established.

Recognizing the importance of the project to the community, Oleita said she’s selecting team members who are dedicated to building a foundation with integrity.

“It’s not for me. It’s for the next executive director, who hopefully will come on in the next five years. I want to create something that’s sustainable.”

Her inventory of chip bag donations stands at 1 million pounds.

The Chip Bag Project spreads the word about upcycling

Aside from sleeping bags, The Chip Bag Project has distributed 5,000 warming kits to unhoused individuals, that include food donations this year.

Oleita plans to upgrade the sleeping bags. She is intent on delivering a bag that caters to the needs of unhoused people while protecting the environment. She’s working on the design and durability of the sleeping bags for the next release, scheduled for 2026.

“We see the sleeping bags, and they’re always so functional, but there are just little elements that are missing. They could be better.”

For a growing startup like The Chip Bag Project, a dedicated space is crucial. Oleita said she hopes to grow into a space that allows for production and education, where people can learn about upcycling and be part of the process.

In March, the organization held a bag production workshop with StockX as part of 313 Day. Oleita said she hopes to do more of these sessions when she has a physical location.

As The Chip Bag Project continues to grow, Oleita said she’s focused on one core mission: raising awareness about the benefits of upcycling.

“I want people to think more about upcycling,” she said. “Not just for fads, but to think about the second life of each product.”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChipBagProject2-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 18:04:35.828674

LPG is often overlooked in global energy debates, but its importance cannot be overstated.
The energy transition is not a race between good and evil technologies.","When people talk about the energy transition, the conversation is often dominated by wind, solar, and hydrogen. These technologies are vital for our long-term climate ambitions, but they are not the whole story. For billions of people and for the global energy system, the real bridge to a cleaner future is liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG.

BGN has built its legacy on partnership, adaptability and a commitment to sustainable progress. We hold a 10% share of the global LPG market. This isn’t just a statistic; it’s a testament to the role LPG plays in accelerating the global energy transition.

LPG is often overlooked in global energy debates, but its importance cannot be overstated. For much of the world, the choice isn’t between LPG and solar; it’s between LPG and far more harmful fuels such as coal, wood or kerosene. LPG burns cleaner than these alternatives, emitting up to 50% less carbon dioxide than coal and 20% less than heating oil. It also eliminates sulfur oxides and dramatically reduces particulate matter, improving air quality and public health.

More than two billion people still lack access to clean cooking fuels, relying on biomass and other polluting sources. These traditional fuels are linked to an estimated 3.7 million premature deaths every year, largely due to indoor air pollution. LPG offers a life-saving alternative, reducing emissions now and paving the way for future electrification. It’s not a luxury; it’s a necessity.

LPG’s versatility is another reason it’s so vital. It’s used for heating, industrial processes, agriculture, and even transportation. In regions where renewable infrastructure is limited and capital is constrained, LPG provides reliable, affordable energy that can be deployed quickly and at scale. It is a pragmatic solution for communities that cannot wait decades for solar panels or wind farms to arrive.

Critics sometimes argue that investing in LPG could delay the adoption of renewables. But this binary perspective ignores the reality on the ground. The energy transition is not a race between good and evil technologies. It is a complex, multi-stage process that must balance environmental goals with economic and social realities. LPG is not in competition with renewables; it complements them.

In fact, LPG plays a critical role in supporting renewable energy systems. It acts as a backup for intermittent power sources, enhancing energy security and grid stability. In countries with limited natural gas infrastructure, LPG generators provide reliable electricity, supporting economic development and decarbonization efforts. It is a flexible, scalable fuel that can be integrated into hybrid energy systems, making it a cornerstone of resilient energy planning.

This is where the United States comes in. As one of the world’s largest producers and exporters of LPG, the U.S. holds the key to unlocking its global potential. American infrastructure, innovation, and investment are essential to making LPG accessible and sustainable for millions of people worldwide. The U.S. has the opportunity to lead.

By expanding LPG exports, investing in cleaner production technologies, and supporting international partnerships, the U.S. can help accelerate the transition away from dirty fuels.

Moreover, the U.S. stands to benefit economically. The global demand for LPG is growing, particularly in emerging markets where energy access is still a challenge. By positioning itself as a reliable supplier of clean-burning fuels, the U.S. can strengthen its energy leadership while creating jobs and driving innovation at home.

We must also recognize the role of infrastructure. Investments in LPG terminals, storage facilities, and distribution networks are critical to ensuring that this fuel reaches those who need it most. These investments deliver real, immediate benefits: cleaner air, lower emissions, and greater energy security. They also lay the groundwork for future energy systems that are more sustainable and inclusive.

At BGN, we believe the path to sustainability requires a number of solutions. We are the largest offtaker of U.S. LPG, but are not limited to that fuel. We trade in a range of sustainability solutions, including LNG, ammonia and biofuels. We are also invested in critical minerals, which play a key role in the energy transition, and are used in wind, solar, hydrogen and nuclear energy.

The energy transition is not a straight line. It is a bridge, and LPG is one of its strongest pillars. It should get the attention it deserves.

The over 600-megawatt Duane Arnold Energy Center was shut in 2020 after operating for 45 years. No fully shut U.S. nuclear reactor has been brought back to life, but Duane Arnold would be among three plants in the country in the process of attempted restarts.

Duane Arnold Energy Center, located in Palo, Iowa, is the only nuclear power plant in the state and is expected to reopen by first quarter of 2029, NextEra said.

Under the 25-year agreement, the tech giant will purchase power from the 615-MW plant for its growing cloud and AI infrastructure in the state, while also driving significant economic investment to the Midwest region.

One of the plant's minority owners, Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO), will purchase the remaining portion of the plant's output on the same terms as Google, NextEra said.

The utility added that it had also signed agreements to acquire CIPCO and Corn Belt Power Cooperative's combined 30% interest in the Duane Arnold plant, bringing NextEra's ownership to 100%.

I spent most of my summers in Wyoming riding north of the interstate here, moving cattle

That’s Prometheus founder Trenton Thornock. His family has ranched this land for six generations.

He left for a career in finance, but now he has a new way to make money here - building data centers in the wild west. And he’s also finding ways to power them.

so right here, we're measuring the amount of sunlight that we get during the day

He points to a weather station. It’s finding the best angle for solar panels……for potential big tech customers - like Google and Meta.

If if you look this way along the ridgeline, you’ll see another big row of wind turbines. We sit right in the middle of all of this renewable energy infrastructure.

“Sustainable infrastructure for the age of AI” is Prometheus' tagline. But sustainability isn’t simple at the company’s flagship center - it will produce all its own power, recycle its water, use efficient cooling systems and even use heat from whirring servers to grow microgreens and farm shrimp.

And Thornock says all that - still won’t be enough.

You’ve got gas pipelines on both sides for natural gas generation.

The bulk of its energy – at least for now – is slated to come from fossil fuels - natural gas, which is abundant in Wyoming.

In the long-run Thornock wants to transition to small modular reactors…mini nuclear plants - but the tech is still a ways off.

So why not turn to wind and solar to fill the gap? Prometheus says it’s expensive.

You know, a thousand megawatt wind farm does not provide the same capacity as a thousand megawatt coal plant or a natural gas plant,

Mary Throne is a lawyer for Prometheus, and former lawmaker. She questions the reliability of renewable energy for data centers - some need as much power as a small city.

We really need to be more forward thinking and more open to taking advantage of all sources of energy. Technology is our friend

Technology like carbon capture. That’s how Prometheus plans to achieve net zero. Since it plans to use natural gas, it’ll offset the impact by paying another company to transport liquid CO2 from ethanol plants in the Midwest to Wyoming…then inject it into the ground about 60 miles from the data center.

But Amory Lovins says this isn’t very high quality sustainability. The Stanford professor is the founder of the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute.

It sounds like a pretty sketchy model.

He sits in what looks like a jungle –a solar banana farm in his Aspen, Colorado, living room. Lovins says carbon capture data isn’t always trustworthy - though Prometheus says its credits will be third-party certified.

It's a lot more straightforward to make your own clean power on site.

But Thornock says Prometheus will still build the first net-zero data center.

He gets in his car. He says he sees himself as a steward of the sagebrush-covered land.

We've been here for generations.

The name Prometheus comes from Greek mythology and means foresight.

We hope to be here for many more generations and my nephews and nieces will someday inherit the ranch.",https://knpr.org/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-27 17:04:36.968504

The company plans to mine deposits of rare earth metals in South America and ship them to Louisiana for processing at its proposed facility in Vinton. The facility will use hydrochloric acid to extract and separate the metals from the clay mineral deposits.

Rare earth elements — such as dysprosium, neodymium, praseodymium and terbium — are considered critical materials for many industries. Some are used as high-powered magnets in wind turbine motors, vehicle alternators and heat-seeking missiles, according to ScienceNews. Others are used as high-temperature alloys in aircraft engines and nuclear reactors, or as signal amplifiers in fiber optic cables, among other applications.

Aclara’s Louisiana facility is expected to directly employ 140 people. It will occupy an LED Certified Site at the Port of Vinton, prequalified for industrial development through environmental and engineering reviews.

“Louisiana provides ready access to the key reagents we depend on, helping ensure operational reliability and lower transportation costs,” Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa said in the news release. “The state’s world-class chemical industry and highly skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling. Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.”

The state is giving Aclara a $3 million grant to pay for infrastructure and an additional job-creation grant for as much as 22% of wages paid. Additionally, the company will be eligible for the state’s lucrative Industrial Tax Exemption Program through which it will be largely exempt from property taxes in Calcasieu Parish.

Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2027.

Aclara boasts what it calls a sustainable mining process that uses no explosives, milling or wastewater ponds. The company says it recirculates 95% of the water it uses for mining and plants trees after razing the land. It plans to begin its mining operations in Chile in 2027 and in Brazil in 2028, according to the company’s website.",https://asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 17:05:15.058955

The vehicle targets affordability and promises to deliver a ""living room on wheels"" experience.

Parent company Foxconn will reportedly help bring it to market by 2027.

Cars are becoming increasingly electrified and software-defined. This shift in the industry is making the car-making game increasingly attractive to companies that wouldn’t have considered making cars a decade ago. Back then, who would've been willing to bet Japanese electronics giant Sharp would announce a car project?

Hardly anybody, but that’s exactly what the company announced today. Next week, Sharp plans to unveil a concept for its first-ever car—a minimalist electric minivan with a price tag it says “families can comfortably afford.” Nikkei says the study previews a series model that will enter production in 2027.

This isn’t actually Sharp’s first vehicle concept. In 2024, it revealed its LDK+ study, which had more of a van form factor. But the company says this new design is completely different and lighter than last year’s study, although it keeps the same ethos of being a “living room on wheels.”

The concept isn’t a final representation of what the company plans to produce, but it is closer to production compared to the previous one.

The news that Sharp wants to build a car may not be so surprising if you know who owns the brand. Taiwan-based technology company Foxconn (best known as the manufacturer of the iPhone) paid $3.5 billion in 2016 to gain a controlling 66% stake in Sharp, which was and still is struggling financially. Pivoting to cars could be a way for the company to stay afloat.

And Foxconn has wanted in on the car business for a long time. Its attempts have included acquiring the former Lordstown Motors factory in Ohio (itself a former General Motors plant) as part of a plan to build EVs in the U.S., but that never came to fruition. And it's been rolling out its own EV concepts for years now. (Foxconn also announced a tie-up with Mitsubishi earlier this year, but it's unclear if the ventures are related.)

Maybe the deal with Sharp will actually happen this time. Foxconn will provide the underpinnings for the new Sharp car, which looks like a typical people carrier with sliding rear doors. We don’t know much else about it other than the fact that it will have a projector and roll-down screen to double as a mini mobile cinema. This is something that really appeals to Chinese buyers, hinting at which market this vehicle was being designed for.

HOUSTON, Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOV Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today reported third quarter 2025 revenues of $2.18 billion, a decrease of one percent compared to the third quarter of 2024. Net income decreased 68 percent to $42 million, or $0.11 per share, and operating profit decreased 45 percent to $107 million, or 4.9 percent of sales. The Company recorded $65 million within Other Items during the third quarter of 2025 (see Corporate Information for additional details). Adjusted EBITDA decreased 10 percent year-over-year to $258 million, or 11.9 percent of sales. Sequentially, revenue declined less than one percent, net income declined 61 percent, and Adjusted EBITDA increased two percent.

“NOV's operational performance improved sequentially in the third quarter,” stated Clay Williams, Chairman and CEO. “Strong execution on our offshore production backlog, disciplined cost control efforts, and continued efficiency improvements helped NOV maintain steady revenue and margins sequentially despite lower activity in energy and industrial markets. These efforts, combined with improved working capital management, drove robust free cash flow of $245 million during the quarter.

“Demand for NOV’s production equipment remains strong as the offshore upcycle gains momentum and global natural gas development expands. Bookings more than doubled sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 141%.

“While near-term industry fundamentals remain challenged, and inflationary pressures are prompting reassessments of both energy and industrial projects, the breadth and resilience of NOV’s portfolio continue to underpin our performance. We are encouraged by the resurgence in offshore investment and the emergence of unconventional development in new regions as these trends will rely on NOV’s differentiated tools and technologies.

“Our longstanding commitment to technology leadership and our diverse portfolio provide strength through cycles and opportunities for growth. Along with ongoing actions to improve our cost structure and better leverage our global platform, NOV is positioned to increase profitability, generate strong cash flow, and unlock long-term shareholder value.”

As part of its long-term succession plan, the Company also announced that its board of directors (the “Board”) had increased its size by one and appointed Jose Bayardo, President and Chief Operating Officer, to the Board. Mr. Bayardo served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since joining the Company in 2015, until his promotion to his current position earlier this year. Mr. Bayardo holds a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, a Master of Engineering Management and Master of Business Administration from Northwestern University.

Energy Products and Services

Energy Products and Services generated revenues of $971 million in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of three percent from the third quarter of 2024. Operating profit decreased $76 million from the prior year to $38 million, or 3.9 percent of sales, and included $41 million in Other Items. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $37 million from the prior year to $135 million, or 13.9 percent of sales. Revenue declined due to lower global drilling activity levels and delays in infrastructure projects affecting the timing of capital equipment orders. Profitability was negatively impacted by a less favorable sales mix, as well as tariffs and other inflationary pressures.

Energy Equipment

Energy Equipment generated revenues of $1,247 million in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of two percent from the third quarter of 2024. Operating profit increased $1 million from the prior year to $130 million, or 10.4 percent of sales, and included $21 million in Other Items. Adjusted EBITDA increased $21 million from the prior year to $180 million, or 14.4 percent of sales, representing thirteen consecutive quarters of year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA margin growth. Higher revenue from the segment’s growing backlog of offshore production-related equipment more than offset reduced demand for aftermarket spare parts and services. Improved profitability was the result of solid execution on the segment’s backlog, cost controls and increased operational efficiencies.

New orders booked during the quarter totaled $951 million, representing a book-to-bill of 141 percent when compared to $674 million of orders shipped from backlog. As of September 30, 2025, backlog for capital equipment orders for Energy Equipment totaled $4.56 billion, an increase of $77 million from the third quarter of 2024.

Q4 2025 Outlook

The Company is providing financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2025, which constitutes “forward-looking statements” as described further below under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

For the fourth quarter of 2025 management expects year-over-year consolidated revenues to decline between five to seven percent with Adjusted EBITDA expected to be between $230 million and $260 million.

Corporate Information

NOV repurchased approximately 6.2 million shares of common stock for $80 million and paid $28 million in dividends during the third quarter, resulting in a total of $108 million in capital returned to shareholders.

During the third quarter of 2025, NOV recorded $65 million in Other Items, primarily related to the write-down of certain long-lived assets and inventory, and severance charges associated with facility consolidations and other restructuring activities (see Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA).

As of September 30, 2025, the Company had total debt of $1.73 billion, with $1.50 billion available on its primary revolving credit facility, and $1.21 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

NOV secured a contract to supply a monoethylene glycol (MEG) reclamation system for operation in the Black Sea with a national oil and gas company. The system will be integrated into the production facilities of a newbuild FPSO under construction in Asia by a leading EPC contractor. This award follows a series of recent project wins supporting natural gas developments across the Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean, and Black Sea regions.

NOV’s success with offshore drilling automation continues to expand. A deepwater floater operating offshore Guyana with NOV’s latest NOVOS™ and Multi Machine Control (MMC) automation systems achieved more than 17% improvement in connection time compared to the rig’s prior campaign. Additionally, NOV secured contracts to upgrade three ultra-deepwater floaters with advanced rig automation and safety systems. The projects include NOVOS, MMC, Pipe Interlock Management systems, and Red Zone Manager™ (RZM) safety technology, and an active Crown Mounted Compensator system.

NOV’s ATOM™ RTX robotic technology was deployed on a land rig in the Permian Basin, marking the first installation of this system in the U.S. land market. Building on proven results from offshore operations as well as more than a year of operations onshore Canada, the system enhances safety by reducing manual work in the red zone while maintaining high levels of consistency and drilling performance. Results show improved connection and tripping efficiency, supporting faster and more predictable well delivery.

NOV secured several orders for flexible riser and flowline systems supporting deepwater production projects in the Black Sea, Guyana, and Brazil. The awards include a second contract for NOV’s Active Heated flexible riser system, which combines flexible pipe and heating technology to address flow assurance challenges in deepwater environments.

NOV secured a second order for its APL™ Submerged Swivel and Yoke (SSY) system to support a floating LNG (FLNG) project in the San Matías Gulf, Argentina. The project will allow LNG exports from a consortium of regional gas producers. An innovative offshore system, the APL SSY system enables safe mooring of an FLNG vessel and continuous gas transfer through a subsea pipeline while reducing topside infrastructure and project complexity.

NOV was selected to supply double-wall fiberglass-reinforced plastic fuel storage tanks for a major financial institution’s data center expansion in the Northeast United States. The project includes two 40,000-gallon tanks that will provide additional backup fuel capacity to support growing data storage and power resiliency requirements.

NOV supported drilling and completion of the first tight gas unconventional well drilled by an international operator in Bahrain with a suite of downhole drilling and completions technologies. Vector™ drilling motors with ERT™ power sections were used to drill multiple hole sections while a 7-inch by 9⅝-inch GSP liner hanger with a 7-inch PureFlow™ stage cementing tool was used to install and cement the intermediate liner string.

NOV secured an award to deploy its Max™ Platform technology stack in support of a next-generation remote operating center for a major U.S. operator. The implementation advances a “managed-by-exception” model designed to increase efficiency and performance across drilling operations. Powered by Max Platform Services and Max Drilling technology, the edge-to-cloud system leverages real-time data, smart alarms, and AI-driven insights to streamline oversight and focus expertise where it creates the most value.

NOV secured two major wireline intervention package orders in the Middle East. The awards include projects for an international service company operating offshore Qatar and a project supporting Abu Dhabi onshore development, and encompass crane winch trucks, masts, wireline pressure control equipment, and control modules, among other intervention equipment.

NOV achieved record drilling performance in Weld County, Colorado, where an integrated downhole assembly reached total depth in a single 19,000-ft run in the Wattenberg Field. The system combined a ReedHycalog™ TKC59 Tektonic™ drill bit, a DAYTONA 25 motor, and the new Agitator™ Rage tool, NOV’s most powerful friction reduction tool to date. Designed to harness higher downhole pressures, the Agitator Rage tool leverages high-specification rig capabilities to produce greater friction reduction energy for drilling longer, more consistent laterals in the most demanding environments.

NOV ReedHycalog’s 8½-inch RH63-A1 Pegasus™ drill bit delivered record performance for an operator drilling in Devonian-age formations in the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin. These deep, hard formations are known for challenging drilling conditions, where bit durability and efficiency are critical. The dual-diameter bit design eliminated multiple trips and achieved a 110% increase in rate of penetration and 31% longer intervals compared to prior wells drilled in the region. These gains reduced days on well and delivered the lowest well construction costs the operator has recorded in the area.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful tools for internal use and the investment community in evaluating NOV’s overall financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are broadly used to value and compare companies in the oilfield services and equipment industry. Not all companies define these measures in the same way. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should therefore be considered only as supplemental to such GAAP financial measures. Additionally, Free Cash Flow and Excess Free Cash Flow do not represent the Company’s residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as the calculation of these measures does not account for certain debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures. Please see the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

This press release contains certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA. Management cannot predict with a reasonable degree of accuracy certain of the necessary components of net income, such as other income (expense), which includes fluctuations in foreign currencies. As such, a reconciliation of projected net income to projected Adjusted EBITDA is not available without unreasonable effort. The actual amount of other income (expense), provision (benefit) for income taxes, equity income (loss) in unconsolidated affiliates, depreciation and amortization, and other amounts excluded from Adjusted EBITDA could have a significant impact on net income.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This document contains, or has incorporated by reference, statements that are not historical facts, including estimates, projections, and statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Other oral or written statements we release to the public may also contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties and reflect our best judgment based on current information. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in oil and gas prices, customer demand for our products, potential catastrophic events related to our operations, protection of intellectual property rights, compliance with laws, and worldwide economic activity, including matters related to recent Russian sanctions and changes in U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs and their related impacts on the economy. Given these uncertainties, current or prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any such factors or forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. You should also consider carefully the statements under “Risk Factors,” as disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated in Part II, Item 1A of our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in such forward-looking statements, as well as additional disclosures we make in our press releases and other securities filings.

ROCKVILLE, Md., Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Bancorp, Inc. (the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: CBNK), the holding company for Capital Bank, N.A. (the ""Bank""), today reported net income of $15.1 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for 3Q 2025, compared to net income of $13.1 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for 2Q 2025, and $8.7 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for 3Q 2024. Core net income ( 4 ) for 3Q 2025 of $12.2 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to $14.2 million, or $0.85 per diluted share in 2Q 2025, and $9.2 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for 3Q 2024.

The Company also declared a cash dividend on its common stock of $0.12 per share. The dividend is payable on November 26, 2025 to shareholders of record on November 10, 2025.

“We continue to execute on our strategic plan and see progress in driving long term growth and profitability,” said Ed Barry, CEO of the Company and the Bank. “The diversity of our business continues to be a strength as outperformance in our government servicing business offset a decline in USDA gain-on-sales revenues.""

“With and without the one-time items this quarter, we continue to grow our tangible book value and report solid returns on equity and tangible book value,” said Steven J Schwartz, Chairman of the Company. “We believe our continued investment in technology and infrastructure, while negatively impacting our current core earnings, will help us provide long-term superior returns to our shareholders. I am also pleased that the uptick in our credit metrics is almost entirely due to loans acquired in the IFH transaction, not to loans originated by Capital Bank. That gives me reason for confidence that our credit discipline, combined with our superior net interest margin, continues to constitute a core competency.”

Third Quarter 2025 Results

Earnings Summary

Net income of $15.1 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to net income of $13.1 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for 2Q 2025, and $8.7 million or $0.62 per diluted share, for 3Q 2024. 3Q 2025 core net income ( 1 ) of $12.2 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to 2Q 2025 of $14.2 million, or $0.85 per diluted share.

During the quarter there were two non-recurring events that impacted net income:

The Bank identified Fee Revenue that was also previously recognized as Interest Income in the first and second quarter. As a result, the Bank recorded a one-time reversal of $1.3 million of interest income (“Interest Income Adjustment”). There was no corresponding adjustment needed to Fee Revenue as the fee income was correctly recognized during those periods.

Also, during the quarter, the Bank issued a call of brokered time deposits acquired from the IFH transaction, resulting in the accelerated accretion of $4.6 million (“Call of Brokered Time Deposits”).

Net interest income of $52.0 million increased $4.4 million, or 9.2% (not annualized), compared to 2Q 2025, and increased $13.7 million, or 35.6%, year-over-year.

Interest income of $64.9 million increased $0.3 million, or 0.5% (not annualized), over 2Q 2025, and increased $12.3 million, or 23.3%, year-over-year. When excluding the $1.3 million Interest Income Adjustment, interest income increased $1.6 million from 2Q 2025, primarily driven by $1.3 million of growth from OpenSky ™ and $0.3 million from the investment portfolio, while the increase year-over-year was primarily driven by organic growth and the acquisition of IFH.

Interest income included $0.2 million from net purchase accounting accretion in 3Q 2025, compared to $0.4 million in 2Q 2025. There was no impact related to purchase accounting during 3Q 2024.

Interest expense of $12.9 million decreased $4.1 million, or 24.0% (not annualized) compared to 2Q 2025, and decreased $1.4 million, or 9.7%, year-over-year. When excluding the $4.6 million one-time impact from the Call of Brokered Time Deposits, interest expense increased $0.5 million, or 3.2%, compared to 2Q 2025, primarily driven by a shift in portfolio mix.

Interest expense included a $5.3 million benefit from net purchase accounting accretion in 3Q 2025, which included $4.6 million from the Call of Brokered Time Deposits, compared to a $0.9 million benefit in 2Q 2025. There was no impact related to purchase accounting during 3Q 2024.

The 3Q 2025 provision for credit losses was $4.7 million, an increase of $0.6 million from 2Q 2025. Excluding the impact of a loan sale during 2Q 2025 from the acquired IFH portfolio, the provision decreased $0.9 million quarter over quarter. Net charge-offs totaled $2.5 million, or 0.35% of portfolio loans (annualized), down from $5.1 million or 0.75% of portfolio loans (annualized), in 2Q 2025. Net charge-offs in the quarter include $0.3 million from the Commercial Bank and $2.1 million from OpenSky ™ loans.

At September 30, 2025, the ACL Coverage Ratio was 1.88%, up $5.6 million or 15 bps from June 30, 2025. The increase in the ACL Coverage Ratio over prior quarter was primarily driven by a 12 bps impact resulting from the reassignment of an IFH acquired loan from non-purchase credit deteriorated (""non-PCD"") loan to a purchase credit deteriorated (""PCD"") loan during the quarter as a measurement period adjustment to the Day-1 purchase accounting, increasing the allowance for credit losses (""ACL"") by $3.4 million.

Earnings Summary (Continued)

Fee Revenue of $11.1 million decreased $2.0 million, compared to 2Q 2025 and increased $4.4 million year-over-year primarily due to the contributions made by the businesses IFH brought to the merged entity. During 3Q 2025, core fee revenue ( 1 ) of $11.1 million decreased $2.0 million as a result of a $3.1 million decrease in government lending revenue (net gain on sale), $0.8 million lower SBIC investment income, and a $0.1 million decrease in other income, offset by a $1.0 million increase in loan servicing revenue, a $0.6 million increase in government loan servicing revenue (Windsor Advantage ™ ), a $0.2 million increase in credit card fees from OpenSky ™ , and $0.2 million increase in mortgage banking revenue. Core fee revenue mix was 18.9% of total revenue for 3Q 2025, compared to 21.6% during 2Q 2025, and 14.7% during 3Q 2024.

Noninterest expense of $38.4 million decreased $1.2 million compared to 2Q 2025 and increased $8.6 million compared to 3Q 2024. Core noninterest expense (1) of $37.7 million decreased $0.5 million compared to 2Q 2025 and increased $8.5 million compared to 3Q 2024. Core comparisons include:

The decrease of $0.5 million quarter-over-quarter was driven by decreases from personnel expenses and regulatory related expenses, offset by growth in advertising expense mainly from OpenSky ™ .

Year-over-year expense growth of $8.6 million was primarily due to the acquisition of IFH.

Income tax expense of $4.8 million, or 24.2% of pre-tax income for 3Q 2025, increased $0.8 million from $4.0 million, or 23.2% of pre-tax income for 2Q 2025. The Core effective income tax rate (1) for 3Q 2025 and 2Q 2025 would have been 23.8% and 23.2%, respectively.

Commercial Bank NIM (1) , of 4.64% increased 28 bps compared to the prior quarter, and increased 82 bps year-over-year. Net purchase accounting accretion for 3Q 2025 was 67 bps for NIM and 70 bps for Commercial Bank NIM (1) .

3Q 2025 includes the previously mentioned $4.6 million (59 bps) Call of Brokered Time Deposits and $1.3 million (17 bps) Interest Income Adjustment. Excluding these items, 3Q 2025 NIM would have been 5.95% and Commercial Bank NIM would have been 4.21%.

The average yield on interest earning assets of 7.93% decreased 26 bps compared to the prior quarter, mainly due to a 16 bps impact from the Interest Income Adjustment. Excluding this item, the average yield in the quarter would have been 7.77% a decrease of 10 bps compared to 2Q 2025 as a result of the overall rate environment. The average yield decreased 86 bps year-over-year primarily due to the acquisition of commercial loans diluting the positive impact from OpenSky ™ as well as the Interest Income Adjustment.

The Commercial Bank Loan Yield (1) of 6.74% for 3Q 2025 decreased 40 bps compared to 2Q 2025, and decreased 41 bps year-over-year. Excluding the Interest Income Adjustment, average yield in the quarter would have been 6.94%, a decrease of 21 bps compared to 2Q 2025 and 22 bps year-over-year as a result of rate environment.

The total cost of deposits of 1.73% for 3Q 2025 decreased 63 bps compared to the prior quarter and decreased 91 bps year-over-year, both mainly due to the Call of Brokered Time Deposits. Excluding this item, total costs of deposits for the quarter would have been 2.36%, consistent with 2Q 2025, and a decrease of 29 bps year-over-year due to shifts in product mix from the acquisition of IFH.

The total cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 88 bps quarter-over-quarter, due to the Call of Brokered Time Deposits. Total cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 151 bps year-over-year, to 2.41% for 3Q 2025 primarily due to the Call of Brokered Time Deposits as well as shifts in product mix from the acquisition of IFH.

1 As used in this press release, Commercial Bank NIM, Commercial Bank Loan Yield, Core fee revenue mix and Core efficiency ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial metrics exclude the impact of income from the call of brokered time deposits, merger-related expenses and other certain one-time non-recurring pre-tax adjustments and tax impacts of such adjustments. Reconciliations of these and other non–GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are set forth in the Appendix at the end of this press release.

Credit Metrics and Asset Quality – The ACL Coverage Ratio equaled 1.88% at September 30, 2025, an increase of 15 bps from June 30, 2025, and an increase of 37 bps year-over-year driven by a 12 bps impact resulting from the inclusion of an IFH acquired loan discussed below.

Credit metrics in the quarter were impacted by two loan relationships, both of which were acquired as part of the IFH transaction:

One relationship across three loans accounted for an $8.8 million increase to nonperforming assets. One loan of $5.0 million was previously identified as a PCD loan, which had a specific ACL reserve of $3.8 million established from Day-1 purchase accounting of the IFH acquisition. The other two are USDA loans with an unguaranteed balance of $3.8 million secured by underlying assets, which have no ACL reserve recorded.

The other relationship accounted for a $7.1 million increase to nonperforming assets. As previously mentioned, the loan was reassigned to a PCD loan as a measurement period adjustment to the Day-1 purchase accounting from the IFH acquisition. The measurement period adjustment for this loan resulted in recording a specific ACL reserve of $3.4 million during the quarter, or a 12 bps impact to the ACL Coverage Ratio.

Nonperforming assets were $52.2 million or 1.54% of total assets at September 30, 2025, an increase of $16.1 million or 47 bps compared to June 30, 2025, due to the $15.9 million or 47 bps of loans described above. Nonperforming assets increased $36.8 million or 94 bps year-over-year, mainly due to the acquisition of IFH. At September 30, 2025, substandard loans totaled $56.8 million, or 2.0% of total portfolio loans, compared to $44.6 million, or 1.7% of total portfolio loans, at June 30, 2025 and $23.8 million, or 1.2% of total portfolio loans, at September 30, 2024. The $12.2 million increase in substandard loans during the quarter was primarily driven by the $15.9 million of loans described above. At September 30, 2025, special mention loans totaled $71.5 million, or 2.5% of total portfolio loans, compared to $54.2 million, or 2.0% of total portfolio loans, at June 30, 2025, and $20.3 million, or 1.0% of total portfolio loans, at September 30, 2024.

Appendix

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

The Company has presented the following non-GAAP (U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures because it believes that these measures provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how the Company evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the Company’s industry. Investors should recognize that the Company’s presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures might not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and the Company strongly encourages a review of its condensed consolidated financial statements in their entirety.

EGLE has consistently supported clean power for Michigan school transportation as the technology became available.
The EPA’s Clean School Bus Program (CSBP) of grants and rebates provides $5 billion nationwide through fiscal year 2026.
EGLE Director Phil Roos recently joined officials welcoming 18 electric school buses and 20 chargers to Dearborn Public Schools.
“It’s a bold investment in reliability, cost savings, and the health of our students and drivers.” Cleaner school buses offer many benefits, according to the EPA.","On the roads and in school driveways all over Michigan, a quiet revolution is underway: the transformation of bus fleets from dirty diesels to clean energy.

In a state where nearly 17,000 school buses transport more than 800,000 students a year, six years of state and federal investments have so far supported the purchase of nearly 900 buses producing low or no emissions. Some are yet to enter service.

The latest awards, announced this fall, total $35.9 million from the Michigan Department of Education’s (MDE) $125 million Clean Bus Energy Grant (CBEG) program. They’ll help 23 schools and districts, listed below, add 87 electric buses and 10 propane buses, along with supporting infrastructure.

And they’ll help Michigan breathe easier.

“Children and others in their communities benefit from cleaner air,” said Interim State Superintendent Dr. Sue C. Carnell. “We are happy to work with our partners at the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) to make our state greener.”

Carnell said the CBEG program improves the health, safety, and wellness of all learners, a goal in Michigan’s Top 10 Strategic Education Plan.

EGLE has consistently supported clean power for Michigan school transportation as the technology became available. In 2019 and 2020, the department awarded about $13 million in grants through its now-closed Fuel Transformation Program toward the purchase of 317 electric, clean diesel, and propane school buses and support infrastructure for more than 25 Michigan districts.

In November 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) weighed in with $54 million for 138 new electric school buses and infrastructure serving 25 Michigan school districts, from Southeast Michigan to the Upper Peninsula. The EPA’s Clean School Bus Program (CSBP) of grants and rebates provides $5 billion nationwide through fiscal year 2026. Additional rounds of CSBP grants provided $5.9 million announced in January 2024 for up to 66 buses at eight districts and $23.98 million announced in May 2024 for 100 buses at 27 districts.

Also in 2024, MDE announced its first and second rounds of CBEG funding: nearly $30 million in June to help 29 school districts buy 114 buses powered by electricity, propane, or natural gas; and $15.2 million in October to help 21 districts buy 40 electric buses and 17 propane buses. Including the newest grants, CBEG has awarded more than $81 million.

Grant funds generally cover a significant portion of the costs for vehicles and infrastructure, with the balance paid from local sources.

EGLE Director Phil Roos recently joined officials welcoming 18 electric school buses and 20 chargers to Dearborn Public Schools.

“This is not just an upgrade to a school fleet,” he said. “It’s a bold investment in reliability, cost savings, and the health of our students and drivers.”

Cleaner school buses offer many benefits, according to the EPA. With no or low emissions compared to diesel engines, they result in cleaner air on buses, in bus loading areas, and in the communities where they operate.

Diesel exhaust can lower air quality and impact the environment and human health, especially for children who have breathe faster than adults and whose lungs are not yet fully developed.

Districts also save money on maintenance and gasoline, freeing up resources that can go back into classrooms.

And electric buses are quiet. Educators say without the racket of diesel engines, kids show up to school less distracted and more focused on learning.

Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases is a key goal of Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s MI Healthy Climate Plan for a prosperous, healthy, clean energy future for all Michiganders.

Applications for a final CBEG round of up to approximately $44 million are due Dec. 18, 2025.

Here are the schools and districts awarded grant funding for the latest CBEG round. Some awards include funding for charging infrastructure and related costs:",https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Images/Staff/EXEC/Dearborn-EV-School-Bus-event.jpg?rev=aebb3397189945068bcecfe49e92b257,N,,2025-10-27 17:18:27.359698

The One Big Beautiful Bill passed earlier this year expanded the 45Q carbon capture tax credit instead of ending it.","Louisiana Governor Landry’s recent order to hit “pause” on new carbon dioxide injection-well applications is a victory for Louisiana taxpayers, landowners, and communities who’ve grown tired of footing the bill for risky carbon capture ventures. For too long, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been touted as an innovative solution for reducing emissions. Yet despite generous federal tax credits and R&D grants, CCS remains heavily dependent on taxpayer subsidies, threatens private-property rights through eminent domain, and puts communities at risk of groundwater contamination.

After spending billions of taxpayer dollars, most CCS projects have been abandoned or underperformed—leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. A study examining eleven federally funded projects found that eight failed or were canceled, wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on projects that were never built. And even when projects were built, they missed their targets. According to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, not a single commercial CCS project has reached its target CO2 capture rate.

And it’s more than money that’s at stake. Carbon pipelines and underground storage sites pose real dangers—ruptures, groundwater contamination, and the looming threat of eminent domain abuse. In Satartia, Mississippi, a CO2 pipeline rupture sent dozens to the hospital. In Illinois, leaks from a carbon sequestration site near the sole source of drinking water for nearly a million residents have raised alarms about groundwater contamination. Many CCS developers are claiming “common carrier” status—despite offering little public benefit—to justify seizing private land for pipelines and storage sites, often against landowners’ will.

Following fierce opposition from local residents and parishes, Governor Landry issued Executive Order JML 25-119, directing the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources to temporarily stop accepting new Class VI well applications—a category of injection wells used by CCS projects to store captured carbon—while the state develops stricter oversight, financial-assurance, and safety standards. The order does not halt reviews of existing applications; instead, it requires the agency to re-evaluate pending projects, coordinate with other state and federal agencies, and ensure greater transparency and public participation before any new Class VI permits are issued.

The EPA typically oversees these injection wells but can grant states the authority to administer the program as well—a process known as “primacy.” Louisiana received primacy from EPA in December 2023, giving the state authority to issue Class VI permits. The first permit authorized the injection of up to 2 million metric tons of CO2 per year for 20 years for a single project, and since then, 33 applications have been filed. The order and accompanying departmental guidance set clearer review timelines, prioritize only a handful of existing projects for continued assessment, and strengthen public-comment and landowner-rights provisions.

This is not the first step Louisiana policymakers have taken to protect Pelican State taxpayers and communities. The state legislature passed several laws in June to protect landowners from eminent domain abuse by CCS pipeline developers. One requires disputes to be settled in the parish where they arise. Another requires companies to prove that a CO₂-storage or pipeline project provides a public benefit before land can be taken. A third requires consent from 85% of landowners before a carbon-injection well can be located in an area.

Louisiana is on the right track: real emissions reduction should not come at the expense of property rights, public safety, or fiscal responsibility. Unfortunately, federal lawmakers have gone the opposite direction and doubled down on CCS subsidies. The One Big Beautiful Bill passed earlier this year expanded the 45Q carbon capture tax credit instead of ending it. Originally projected to cost taxpayers more than $30 billion over the next decade, the latest expansion adds another $14 billion. The bill also increases the 45Q credit to $180 per ton for captured carbon used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects—a technique the oil industry has relied on since the 1970s to extract more oil from aging wells. Now, companies conducting EOR as part of their normal operations will be rewarded even more generously by the supercharged 45Q credit.

By declaring this pause, Louisiana is protecting its communities with stronger rules, deeper scrutiny, and a fairer process that prioritizes residents over corporate CCS interests. It’s time for other states—and Congress—to follow suit. Instead of doubling down on costly, unproven CCS subsidies, policymakers should invest in emissions-reduction initiatives that truly benefit taxpayers and communities, or at least require stronger safeguards, transparency, and accountability for every taxpayer dollar spent.",https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/CCS-Implied-1024x574.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 17:05:21.421553

Fighting for National Protections Against PFAS Forever Chemicals Folks like Fred Stone never should have had to be heroes.

Two streets in rural Alabama are facing 54 cancer cases and 14 cases of kidney failure. A military family has been devastated by illnesses. A farmer lost a century-old family dairy farm due to contaminated milk. PFAS “forever chemicals” are poisoning drinking water and communities across the country.

In their new book Poisoning the Well: How Forever Chemicals Contaminated America, reporters Rachel Frazin and Sharon Udasin show how PFAS contamination became a national public health crisis — and they center the folks on the front lines of this crisis who are fighting for protections.

PFAS (“Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances”) refers to a class of more than 15,000 lab-made chemicals with stain-, stick-, and water-resistant properties. They don’t break down in nature, and they’re everywhere, from clothes to cookware to cosmetics. Every day, it seems, a new study emerges underscoring these chemicals’ pervasiveness and their links to a litany of health harms.

While many of the worst harms appear with major contamination, PFAS are in all of us. The CDC estimates that 97% of people living in the United States have PFAS in their blood, where it can persist for years.

“This is a massive, massive problem that is only going to grow over the years as we learn more in scope, in scale, about health problems, about where the contamination is, about how long it lasts,” said Rachel.

In October, we sat down with Rachel and Sharon to discuss the human toll of this crisis and the heroes who have worked to turn the tide. Despite the widespread harm, there is hope and work we can do — nationwide, everyday people are joining together to defend their communities and win protections.

The Everyday Heroes Fighting for PFAS Protections

Across the country, corporations making PFAS and using them in their products have dumped these forever chemicals into our environment and drinking water sources. As Rachel and Sharon explained, this has endangered the lives and livelihoods of people who just happen to live nearby.

And while companies learned more about the harms of their own products, they kept mum on the science for decades, continuing to proliferate and profit from PFAS.

The authors shared the story of Maine dairy farmer Fred Stone, who received a state permit to spread sewage sludge on his fields back in the 1980s. This sludge is the semi-solid leftovers from waste treatment plants. The state of Maine encouraged farmers to use it as fertilizer for decades. But in recent years, testing showed that it’s highly contaminated with PFAS.

“When [Fred] first found out that his area was contaminated, he got his cow’s milk tested,” Sharon told us. “He jeopardized his own business, this dairy business that’s been in his family for a hundred years. It has now crumbled to nothing. They’re in bankruptcy.”

But Fred’s personal sacrifice had an important impact. “He helped drive a lot of the forward-thinking legislation that the state of Maine has implemented,” Sharon said. Maine became the first state in the country to ban sludge-spreading and non-essential uses of PFAS.

Fred hadn’t ever been an activist. He said he just wanted people’s water to be clean — a basic right.

A similar story repeats throughout Sharon and Rachel’s reporting, from Colorado to North Carolina to Maine and Alabama. Everyday people discovered PFAS pollution in their drinking water and took action, fielding calls from their neighbors and educating their communities. And they’ve successfully pushed local, state, and national leaders to pass protections.

Fighting for National Protections Against PFAS Forever Chemicals

Folks like Fred Stone never should have had to be heroes. But thanks to the tireless pressure from frontline activists, we’ve now seen progress on PFAS after decades of nonexistent regulations.

In 2024, the Biden administration set drinking water limits for six common PFAS, requiring public water utilities to monitor these PFAS in their drinking water supplies and install technology to filter them if they reach a certain level.

It also finalized a polluter pays rule allowing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to force corporations to pay for the cleanup of major PFOA and PFOS (two common types of PFAS) pollution.

Both rules were threatened by lawsuits, and it wasn’t clear if Trump’s EPA would defend them. Food & Water Watch immediately jumped into action, driving 20,000 comments to the agency. Then, in September, the EPA announced it would defend the polluter pays law in court.

However, the EPA also wants to axe four of the six PFAS from the drinking water rules and delay the requirements for the other two. That would add two more years during which people could be drinking contaminated water.

Sharon and Rachel’s reporting underscores the stakes of this fight — not just for these protections, but against PFAS overall. Preserving the polluter pays rule and drinking water limits are essential first steps. But we need to address this crisis at the root. To stem the flood of PFAS into our air, water, and lives, we need to end non-essential uses of all PFAS.

If there’s anything we can take from this event, it’s that everyday people do have the power to make a difference. When we come together, we can defend our food, water, and communities.

This could mean fast-tracking greenhouse gas emission reduction and further protection of the state’s coastal marshes.

“It’s not only a more efficient, effective use of funds [compared to a years-long survey and mapping endeavor],” Jacob Boyd, salt marsh program director for the North Carolina Coastal Federation, said. “But in those areas that are disappearing quickly, implementing [a solution] the sooner the better is always the best option.”

According to analyses from the UNCW Coastal and Estuarine Studies Lab, the salt marshes, particularly in the New Brunswick area, have significantly shrunk over the years due to sea-level rise. The shoreline has shrunk by at least 11 kilometers, and has lost thousands of acres of wetlands.

A $421-million pollution reduction grant from the EPA to the Atlantic Conservation Coalition — which includes North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland — is funding a partnership between the North Carolina Coastal Federation and the nature-based and sustainability tech company, Natrx. The North Carolina Coastal Federation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to environmental education, advocacy, and restoration of the state’s coastal habitats.

Since 2021, Natrx has been working on an AI model that uses satellite imagery and a high-resolution geographic information system to create a map of the salt marshes along the coast. Having a higher resolution image allows for a more precise estimate of the erosion.

Natrx’s AI model takes satellite imagery from the last 15 years — publicly and privately uploaded — to assess how the wetlands have eroded and identify the patterns within that information. While Natrx does not take its own images, the AI tool is able to create projections of how the wetlands and marshes will continue to erode, based on how already happened in the past. That information will then be used to create customized solutions for specific sites. Bald Head Island, Oak Island, and Southport all contain salt marshes and will be under observation from Natrx’s AI model and the Coastal Federation.

The analysis provided by the program will include information on natural vegetation, the salt content or salinity of the marshes, the amount of carbon within those marshes, and how much erosion the areas have undergone due to ocean waves. The information is then compiled into a dataset for the North Carolina Coastal Federation, so the organization can locate high-salinity salt marshes, or a coastal wetland, and work to maintain those environments.

As sea levels continue to rise, and the rate of their rising accelerates — 4.5 millimeter per year, up from 1993’s 2.3 mm, and continuously growing — the need for protecting salt marshes grows in significance. Rising sea levels result in faster erosion, so there is a need to collect information on marshes at most risk annually.

Currently, the Coastal Federation has to make its own projections using historical satellite images and old maps, compiled by sending people to the individual sites to collect data. Boyd said it could take “several years,” though Natrx’s new model could speed up the process. It will provide new projections within 12 months.

“So this cuts it down pretty significantly,” Boyd said — “at least half or more.”

Natrx is able to capture more information from more sources over the last 15 years, and create a projection of the rate of erosion of the shoreline in a shorter timeframe.

According to Natrx’s COO, Tad Schwendler, the Raleigh-based company began the AI project in April 2025. He said this new way helps create “large swaths” of mapping into the future, whereas before people on the ground could only capture the present day.

But this isn’t just about protecting the shorelines. It’s also about keeping harmful carbon gas out of the atmosphere.

“Salt marshes are actually one of the highest carbon-sequestering habitats in the world,” Boyd said. “It holds a lot of carbon in the soil, so when the salt marsh erodes, the carbon is released from the soil and goes into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.”

Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, which further exacerbates global warming.

When the marshes get eroded, they release the carbon that is usually kept within the soil, so having a quicker process for mapping allows the federation to address climate change sooner.

The AI mapping will help inform solutions the Coastal Federation can propose to local governments and property owners as well. Schwendler said Natrx’s datasets allow them to provide solutions on how to be cost effective, give budgetary estimates for the shoreline solutions and even design recommendations.

Natrx has a technology called “ExoForms,” individual blocks that mimic the natural landscape, and are supposed to be a better alternative to seawalls and bulkheads, hard structures that disrupt the natural flow of water. The ExoForms start off as part of Natrx’s digital designs, but Natrx has technology to essentially 3D print the blocks.

The implementation of the ExoForms is not a requirement to use Natrx’s data; however, living shorelines can also be developed based on the AI mapping, which is Coastal Federation’s preferred method. Living shorelines — such as native plants, sand, soil, and other organic materials to act as a barrier and stabilize the marsh — absorb energy from the tides that normally lends to erosion.

The federation prefers the use of living shorelines as opposed to hard structures like bulkheads and sea walls. Boyd explained maintenance of living shorelines is normally cost efficient. A living shoreline can cost thousands less than bulkheads, for example.

The Coastal Federation expects to get Natrx results by April and from there will send surveyors to at-risk, or high-salinity and high-carbon value, sites and speak to property owners the salt marshes are on. The survey will allow the Coastal Federation to figure out erosion prevention remedies and costs.

Ultimately, though, the cost of the upkeep for these living shorelines would land on the property owners where the marshes are located, whether residential or government entities. The Coastal Federation has plans to educate both, presenting solutions as need be.

“The good thing is, too, these are going to be a couple-of-year projects, so we’ll have a lot of opportunity to do outreach in the areas where we’re doing the projects,” Boyd said, “and hopefully, there’ll be some education opportunities as well.”

And, uh, the film was about how she, after that, was kind of looking for what she was gonna do next and ended up in the arctic part of Alaska and found herself helping climate scientists with ground truthing their data because she had this crazy unique skillset of being able to be out in the wilderness and, uh, survive and, and a scent, the peaks there that other people couldn't do.

CARLYLE: so she was verifying the science in these very hard to access place. She helped measure how much glaciers had receded…alll kinds of stuff that helps us better understand climate change. Amazing story.

And it actually got Rachel thinking about citizen scientists, whether they think of themselves that way or not. People with unique skillsets who were not in Alaska but all around her.

RACHEL: And so, um, she ended up using this unique skill set of hers to help as a citizen scientist. And so kind of really got me thinking when I was here. How are all of the people here in South Louisiana, uh. How, how are people down here in South Louisiana using their own skillset in the same way of adapting and mitigating to our changing climate and and environment? how are people down here in South Louisiana using their own skillset in the same way of adapting and mitigating to our changing climate and environment?

CARLYLE: and so Rachel went out and discovered people who are finding ways to adapt to this very quickly changing place.

I’m Carlyle Calhoun and you’re listening to Sea Change. Coming up we meet a cross section of Louisianas from a poet to a minister to a computer programmer…each with their own story about how they are finding ways to adapt and to fight for the future of their communities.

MIDROLL

SUMMER: In Chauvin, there’s only one road in and the same road out. So we reference where we live as down the Bayou and up the bayou.

CARLYLE: That’s Summer Skarke. an elementary school principal and poet.

RACHEL: she talks a lot about kind of what's happening in Chauvin. She's really on the forefront of all of these different environmental, uh, um, changes that are kind of happening all at once.

CARLYLE: But you know, even though she's on the front lines of all of this, um, summer talks about how it's really just a difficult subject to, to discuss with people. And you talk to her about that.

RACHEL: How do you talk to students or kids about what's happening with the rising water and the erosion and the storms?

SUMMER: I feel that Chauvin people don't talk about it because it's a reality that you don't want, you live it, and so you don't wanna like, stay in it….(later tape) it's such a touchy subject and it's almost like something you don't wanna, how do you talk to someone about, that one day the place where you live might not exist, or it might be under water. It's a hard concept to imagine that the house that I live in may not be there one day 'cause it's just water. Even though I've seen things like that happen to some degree, I, I don't know that I even know how to touch that subject because I've seen that it could be a reality, you know? It's something I don't wanna talk about because it makes me mad.

RACHEL: Uh, summer's amazing. You know, it's really, it was really interesting to me talking to her about how her feelings are about this and, and just the fact that it's, um, it's so hard for people to understand what is coming, even if you know it. Like to actually be able to comprehend it in a more, in a more real way.

It's just such a big thing, you know? She says at one point, how do you, how do you understand that your home will one day be underwater? And she, and she did tell this, uh, interesting story too about this time.

She was at the symposium about wetlands and there was, um, she was there representing education with Louisiana in the bottom of the boot as she says. Uh, and you know that if you wanna play that story, I think that's another kind of amazing example of that.

CARLYLE: yeah let’s hear it.

SUMMER: and I was sitting with these engineers from Switzerland and all these places. And I remember them saying, you know, what are you gonna do when your school's not there anymore? Or your school's surrounded in water and like, are your kids gonna take a boat to get to school? And I remember them telling me all these things and I got mad and I was like, what are you talking about? Because in my head, as an adult, I could not wrap my mind around what they were telling me cause that was never going to happen. So why are we talking about things that's like ridiculous? That's how I felt.

RACHEL: Yeah, and you know, people at the symposium were talking about, you know, different places where you might have to put a school in a barge and maybe that that would be a viable solution down there for Chauvin and, you know, maybe 40, 50 years down the line. And that's, that's something that she could not imagine.

But then, you know, just five years later.

SUMMER: Ida hit, and took out every school in our community and I remember me crying. I cried in front of grown men 'cause I was mad that they were trying to tell me that there was a possibility that they wouldn't have education where I lived. And then it happened and I was like, whoa, they messed this up. They like, I couldn't have handled the truth if they'd have told me five years I'd have then really thought they were crazy, right?

CARLYLE: And I mean that to her point, it was just all the changes were happening so fast, you know, she thought it was gonna be decades away and all of a sudden, all the schools were destroyed.

ADD RACHEL: She couldn’t even conceive it would be decades…let alone, you know

CARLYLE: yeah. So what's happening in Chauvin now? Are there, are their schools still closed?

RACHEL: my understanding is there were four or five schools there. And, uh, only one has plans to be rebuilt. Um, and otherwise all of them are gonna end up being in other places. And it's interesting 'cause now Summer's a, a principal at a school in Montague, which is just kind of the, a town over, but it's still not Chauvin, you know?

CARLYLE: and part of what you talked to Summer about too is, is how she's helping her students think about the future because she knows, like, it was a hard thing for her to grasp the these changes and how quickly they're happening.

And she wants them to start thinking about you know, do they want to stay or do they want to go? And if they want to stay, you know are there different kinds of avenues they could be exploring..

SUMMER: There's jobs that are here that people could have that would make a difference here, and some of it was about coastal erosion or do biology work. It got them thinking in other directions besides just the typical things that, you know, being a trawler or being a oysterman, or being a doctor or a teacher, you know, just those jobs that everybody just kind of does. Whereas like, let's branch out and think about other things that actually could help to save the community you live in.

RACHEL: Yeah, Summer's a gym. I love her so much. taught English for a while and I love that she had her students kind of process a lot of what was happening through writing.

You know, with Katrina, she had people keep diaries and she, herself is a poet. And the title of this, the project came from a poem of hers, which I love. Um, and I could, I could share the, the quote with you if you want, but yeah,

CARLYLE: Yeah. Tell us the quote!

RACHEL: Yeah, she says the, the line of her poem is we have learned a lot from the redfish that can still hang on and adapt no matter what the water, it finds itself in salty or fresh. And there's so many different things I love about that because I think it's, it's talking about like the water, salty or fresh. It's kind of this change that we're going to and adapting. It's very literal where she is. 'cause the brackish water, it's changing as the sea level rises of what water it is. But then there's also just kind of this wide, um, you know, a very diverse, um, people down here who are handling this in different ways.

And it doesn't matter why you think these are happening, these issues are happening. It doesn't matter, um, what your perspective is, where you're coming from, where you live, no matter what. We're all kind of like this school of redfish and we're having to figure out, adapt together. And that's, and that's what we have to do. No matter what the water that we're in, we have to kind of come together and figure these things.

CARLYLE: and I feel like, you know, something else that your your series really gets to is, is adaptability and also resilience, so I wanted to ask you about Reverend Harris. Um, he is just a, a hilarious guy. And also, um, you know, he really, he thinks about resilience in this really holistic way.

RACHEL: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think, um, you know, some of the things he does are really practical in terms of talking about go bags and, um, making sure that he knows who's in his community outside of his congregation, that's gonna need to be checked in on if a storm's coming, um, handing out pamphlets, having a tool library.

But then there is also that kind of, you know, I, I think resilience could be a dirty word down here, but it is that inner resilience, um, that he, that he talks a lot about and has kind of, you know, really beautiful things to say about.

CARLYLE: Yeah, let's listen to it.

TAPE: Rev Harris: Spiritually, it's very, very, very important so that you'll be able to mentally, psychologically deal with whatever outcome is.

You know what I'm talking about and I realize that 'cause uh, it can be depressing, it could be hard when you lose everything. But if you get distorted with it, you know, it's just, it's hard to recover psychologically and emotionally and stuff like that.

You know, we have to understand that there are things that hurt, but, uh. Don't let it be so devastating to you that it destroy you, because all of the material things you know, can be replaced if you see it as just everything's wiped out, that I have no hope, no way else to do it. It could be more devastating for you.

So come back to that same question. You know, okay, God, this is where it is. What would you have me do now. economically, I can't come back and build a house that I had, but can I come back and build a small house? Should I. Can I clear my lot off and put a trailer on it off? So I, I try to get us to understand that we've gotta be detached to some degree from that type of stuff.

If we going to, to do well when we experience it and, and realizing that we live in an area that it's primed for that to happen, it's even more critical.

CARLYLE: I think that's such a powerful point that he makes that we need to maintain some space from all the stuff we own, the physical stuff. And I mean, Reverend Harris also talks about, um, that that was really helpful for him when their church was damaged in a storm.

RACHEL: The roof was actually ripped off. And Laura, which was a huge storm down there, um, and you know, he, he kind of had that perspective. He said, you know, the physical church is damaged, but that's not the church. And so church can still happen. And I think that perspective of his really helps him deal with the loss and, and talk to his congregation and, and the people he ministers to about it too.

REV HARRIS: As I listened to people saying their church was damaged, I took a different twist. I said the church wasn't damaged, it was just the building. So the church kept meeting and we kept having church in the parking lot. It. It was awesome. You know, and you could just pull up and park in the parking lot and we had somebody out there kind of helping direct the cars, the sound people put together a sound system that we used outside and we just just go out there and people just pull up and park in their cars, and we’d just have a regular church service.

Rachel: it was like a drive in movie theater!

Rev Harris: except without speakers hanging off your cars.

CARLYLE: I mean, that is a hard thing to practice though, because it's easy to be attached to the places and things we love. And I mean, a lot of times it's not just losing the stuff, but we're losing a way of life. And you, you hear that in your conversation with Monique, Tell us a little bit about Monique who’s from St Bernard Parish.

MONIQUE: There was just this freedom to do what you want and to like be barefoot for weeks and not have to comb my hair. I miss that like, rhythm of life. It's, it was so like simple, uncomplicated, no TV really, you know, I. Turn the air conditioner on only on Sunday and only 'cause we were going to church, which was the reason why I had to comb my hair, which I hated. (cries)

I'm sorry, I'm, it's like, um, when Katrina washed in, it really, it just like flipped life upside down. I. And you know, my grandmother was able to go back to her land and some of the other elders were, but all the elders have passed at this point, pretty much. And I think that that like community and, you know, collective survival, the sharing of the labor and like the abundance, uh. It just doesn't exist anymore. In that way,

RACHEL: Yeah, that's, there's a lot to unpack in that one. It's, um, it's, I mean, I, I think she says so beautifully. So many, um, so many things that are challenges. Part of the challenges of what we're up against right now, you know. My interview with her was really about thinking about migrating communities and that communities are gonna have to shift. And it's something that Monique's really thinking about in an interesting way in terms of how do you keep home with you whenever you're doing that, and how do you, um, figure out how to be, uh, home and as long as you can, I think you can get something out of that.

CARLYLE: Right. And I mean, she's bought land, uh, as she describes it, north of I 10. Right. In order to, to kind of have a place to be safer,

RACHEL: Yeah. And you know, north of I 10 is this thing. I don't, I don't know if it's the same in across the state, but I know definitely in Lafayette, Kana area, like north of I 10, is where it's safe to buy and safe to be. And so it's kind of, you know, she laughs about that. But, um, but you know, she has a lot of her, um, her Homa relatives and Homa, meaning the indigenous tribe, not.

The place, um, who are affected by storms that are coming and, and they're kind of scattered in different areas along the coast, and then also her community and New Orleans that she's built over the years. And so she's thought a lot about when a storm's coming, where do you go? And, um, thinking, and she's, and she's created this place in Arville that is gonna be a sanctuary and really an amazing resource with solar panels.

And, um, also just a place that people can come and recharge their phones on their way to where they're going or if they need to crash their night when they are figuring out what's gonna happen because the storm's coming or you just need water or whatever it is, there's a place that you can go that you know you have a safe place to go to.

CARLYLEL Yeah. And, you know, listening to her story, I was just reflecting on the fact that, you know, the state of Louisiana has known for 20 years or so that migration is gonna be a necessary thing for a lot of people who live in South Louisiana. Um, but there's no funding for it, there's no infrastructure for it, there's no agency in charge of it.

Um, and that's true, you know, uh, you know, generally with our country at large too. And so, I mean, I just think about how it's, it's kind of put in, left in the hands of people like Monique to, to take this on and think, you know, she's thinking beyond herself too, making plans, not just like, where am I gonna be safe, but like, where can I provide a place for a larger community?

So, I mean, do you think about her as kind of a leader in this way?

RACHEL: Oh, a hundred percent. I mean, it's like you said, she is, she's. Not waiting for someone else to take it on, which I will say the indigenous communities down here, I feel like are the leaders in this space so much of just saying like, you guys aren't, there's, there's no help coming for us. We're figuring this out, and it's really, really inspiring.

MONIQUE: Post Katrina My family land in St. Bernard was under 11 feet of water when the surge came in, and I think that. I was just like, this is done. We're not gonna be able to be here. I really felt that way that there was something that died. I really was an advocate for like, okay, friends, let's all buy some land north of I I 10. Okay, family. Let's figure out a safe place for us all to go to. We gotta kind of like cut our losses, and the older I get, the more I recognize that we have a right to remain and reclaim. I need to have a foot in the sinking swamp over here. I don't wanna just go because this is home.

… And I think that my decision to invest in this small little 12 acre plot is maybe in the hopes that others will, will see that maybe we can retreat and return and maybe we can have relationships in other places. And have community that's north of I 10, and maybe some people will stay and maybe some people will always return home…but you know you can always go to Praires de Femmes.

RACHEL: I loved hearing her thought process and kind of how there's community that's helped her make these decisions. And, you know, one of the things I really love is part of her inspiration is, um, a member of the Homa community from years ago who she's never met. Um, but the story that, that this woman Rosalina, she went ahead and bought a bunch of land knowing that her people were gonna need a place to go. And so that's something that's always been in her mind.

And so I love that she's taking this experience of a community and this powerful woman of stories that she's. Been passed down to her and really putting that into effect and, and saying like, yes, I am. I'm gonna also make sure that my people have a place to go.

CARLYLE: yeah and then you met somebody who instead of relocating because of rising sea levels and land loss, um, has just figured out how to safely stay put. So, tell me about Buddy.

RACHEL: Yeah, buddy is, uh, I, I feel like he's like the uncle you wish he had. In a lot of ways. He's just so endearing and everyone loves him. but he is just a sweetheart. He's 80, he might be 81 now, I'm not sure. And he, uh, traveled the world. He got into computers early and traveled the world working on them, and then just got tired of all the traveling he did and moved back home to like South Central, I would call it Louisiana. And so, you know, he was living at home and he, a friend came up to him and was like, Hey, I have some debt I need to take care of. I have this trailer and this lease, um, you know, will you buy it and, and help me settle my debt? And so he did. And then, um, I feel like Buddy should take over what happened from there.

BUDDY: when I drove out here, I drove up on the levee and boom, there was nothing but water. I said, Lord, I called him and said, he said, oh, it's in the field.

Over there. The farmer pulled it out. I said, well, thanks for telling me.

RACHEL: so it was flooded the first time you came out?

BUDDY: oh yeah…yeah

RACHEL: so after a while, um, the trailer kind of couldn't take going over the levee back and forth when it flooded anymore, and it was time to build a new home.

So I think, um, you know, in south Louisiana and probably a lot of places that deal with water, when you drive around, you see a lot of houses that have been raised up on stilts, um, to help prevent flooding so that, you know, the water comes in and the house is raised higher. But for a buddy, he really didn't wanna do stilts. He, um, was born with a, a leg shorter than the other. And so he knew the stairs would be a problem. He didn't wanna do an elevator for various reasons. And so he had seen a camp in, um, the same area that had created what's really called an amphibious home, A house that floats.

And he decided to do the same, but with his home,

BUDDY: They think I'm nuts, I guess, you know, really. I mean, who would want to live in a floating house in the middle of the woods with. With alligators and snakes, you know, but it was only the practical solution for me. It seemed very logical what I did to me.

CARLYLE: that's so cool. And he's inspired other people to build similar houses, right?

RACHEL: Yeah, now there's about 40 structures. There's the, the landing there, um, where it's a restaurant and boat landing that is floating. Um, and it's just, it's really amazing.

CARLYLE: Has there been like a big flood that's tested all of these floating structures? Yeah.

RACHEL: yeah, actually in 2011, there was a big flood there. Um, and a lot of the stilted homes actually ended up flooding because they weren't built high enough for that particular flood. Whereas amphibious homes, they're not built to a certain level per se. They just go up and go down. And so, um, as long as your poles are high enough, you can go high enough.

CARLYLE: Let’s hear Buddy talking bout that flood.

RACHEL: Yeah. How did the floating houses fare during that, that flood?

BUDDY: I don't think any of them flooded. None of 'em did.

I'm not going to flood when it floods. I'm here just to make sure everything goes right. I mean, there's a mental benefit. For me, it would be a crisis probably for anybody, a lot of other people, but they don't go with the flow. You know the old saying, go with the flow. Well, that's pretty much what you gotta do on the river.

I mean, you're not gonna stop the river. This is a way to live with the threat of water.

CARLYLE: Oh, he's great. And I love this question you ask buddy.

RACHEL: Why do you think you're the person who was like, I'm just gonna live here full time and I'm gonna make my house float.

[00:15:19] Buddy: I don't know. You know, I have no idea. My friend Tommy, we were just talking about what we did, how our lives had played out.

He's 80 as well as I am, and, uh, he, he is said, well, you took the road less traveled. I, I said, yeah, but it just happened to me. I'm normal. I, I don't consider myself a wild man that lives on the river. I don't consider myself different from other people, but it just happened and I'm glad it did happen. It, it was a good way to live my life.

It was peaceful after traveling the world, working in Manila and Caracas and these big cities, it's just, it brings me back to my childhood. I was raised on a dairy farm. Outside of Bunky where nature was just nature. I mean, it was just part of us. And I get that same feeling here that I'm, I'm just part of nature out here.

It's, it's a nice feeling.

CARLYLE: I just think that's something that everybody you talk to really, you know, in a beautiful way discusses is that deep connection to place.

RACHEL: Yeah for sure. The environment and the nature here is just so beautiful and so special. Um, and it's not. It's not just that, it's also the people.

And so I think that's kind of the sentiment with, you know, across the board, the five different people I speak with, because that's why, that's why we're finding solutions to stay here.

That's why we don't wanna leave. And I think that's the thing a lot of people not from here don't understand is, you know, there's always the question of why don't you just leave? Why don't you just move? And I think more people are understanding it more as disasters are happening elsewhere. But it's because this is your home and you sh. It's not, it's not something that can be replicated anywhere else, and it's really special and, um, you can't, you can't really move a culture somewhere else. That's part of the receiving migrating community thing is figuring out how do we make room for cultures and, and make it feel more like a home as a receiving community.

But, um, you know, it's something that I think a lot of these people speak really eloquently about, probably more than I am right now, about why, why it's worth staying, why it's worth figuring out how to adapt, why it's worth figuring out how to mitigate the solutions. Um. Prolong our ability to stay where we wanna be for as long as we can.

We know that at some point we're not gonna be able to in a lot of places, in a lot of situations. Um, and so coming to terms with that, but also saying, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna fight to be here as long as I can because it's worth it. And I think that's an important message for everyone. And I think it's also important to just say that as the people living here and acknowledge that that is what you're doing, that this is important.

It's who you are. It's part of who you are, it's part of your history.

CARLYLE: Yeah. And I just, I loved meeting these five people and I loved hearing their stories and I found them all really hopeful and inspirational.

RACHEL: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

CARLYLE: Well, thank you so much, Rachel.

Yeah. Thank you so much for having me, Carlyle. It's been really great to visit the stories with you.

,Indiana and Evs,2025-10-27 19:13:24+00:00,Roll Call,Fuel economy standards rewrite poised to deal a blow to EVs - Roll Call,Valerie Yurk,,,,,https://rollcall.com/2025/10/27/fuel-economy-standards-rewrite-poised-to-deal-a-blow-to-evs/,"Electric vehicle advocates are bracing for the Trump administration’s anticipated reversal of the coupling more than a decade ago of vehicle fuel economy standards with EPA goals to reduce tailpipe emissions.
The finding gave the EPA the authority to regulate vehicle tailpipe emissions.
Manufacturers could get credit for each EV they sell in a model year, bringing up the average fuel economy for all vehicles sold that year.
But the likely end to tailpipe standards, expected next year, and the lowering of CAFE standards will ultimately make it easier for the manufacturers.
This is really historic, wiping them off the books.” Alson added that reversing the linkage between CAFE and EPA standards is an easy target, too, since there’s no formal legal or statutory mandate to use fuel economy standards to address tailpipe emissions.","Electric vehicle advocates are bracing for the Trump administration’s anticipated reversal of the coupling more than a decade ago of vehicle fuel economy standards with EPA goals to reduce tailpipe emissions.

The Transportation Department’s upcoming rewrite of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards — paired with the 2025 reconciliation law’s elimination of fines for not meeting the standards, rollback of EV tax credits and other reversals of long-standing emissions rules — is expected to further water down federal support for the EV market.

“All of these things combined will have some impact on the deployment of EVs in the near term,” Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said in an interview. “And these are difficult investments to make.”

The CAFE standards, which require automakers to meet an average fuel economy level for all the cars and light trucks they sell in a model year, were established in 1975 to reduce the nation’s reliance on foreign oil and ease costs for consumers in response to the 1973 oil embargo.

The EPA changed that in 2009 with its endangerment finding, a determination that greenhouse gas emissions pose a public health threat and thus need to be regulated by the agency. The finding gave the EPA the authority to regulate vehicle tailpipe emissions.

Jeff Alson, a former EPA senior engineer and policy adviser who helped establish the vehicle emission regulations, said EPA then worked with the DOT to “harmonize” tailpipe emission and CAFE standards to ease the impact on automakers.

Manufacturers could get credit for each EV they sell in a model year, bringing up the average fuel economy for all vehicles sold that year. Companies whose fleets fell short of the CAFE standard could face big fines.

“[Automakers] can kind of meet them with the same kind of technologies,” Alson said. “Even though they were different laws and had different objectives and all that, in terms of the impacts on the manufacturers, they were pretty much the same.”

But the Trump administration appears poised to change both sides of the balance: tailpipe emissions rules and the fuel economy standard that helps meet those rules.

The administration in June released an interpretive rule that prohibited the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency that sets CAFE standards, from considering “alternative fuel” vehicles, like EVs and hydrogen-powered vehicles, and associated credits when setting the standards — a move that essentially decouples NHTSA’s CAFE standards from EPA tailpipe standards, in theory making it much harder to achieve either. But the likely end to tailpipe standards, expected next year, and the lowering of CAFE standards will ultimately make it easier for the manufacturers.

Republicans in Congress and some automakers, who lauded delinking, say the Biden administration’s ratcheting up of the goals unfairly pushed automakers toward producing more EVs and eliminated consumer choice.

“This is a positive development and important clarity from the Department of Transportation,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association for car makers, said in a statement about the interpretive rule. “In multiple comments to NHTSA during the Biden administration, automakers said NHTSA’s standards were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles.”

‘Historic’ reversals

The Trump administration has already taken steps to reverse the Biden administration’s EPA tailpipe emissions standards and the endangerment finding on which the rules are based.

“The first Trump administration didn’t even dream of wiping out all the standards,” Alson said. “They were just going to weaken them and slow them down. This is really historic, wiping them off the books.”

Alson added that reversing the linkage between CAFE and EPA standards is an easy target, too, since there’s no formal legal or statutory mandate to use fuel economy standards to address tailpipe emissions.

“It was always a linkage based on common sense,” he said. “It’s just a basic scientific fact … every time you burn a balance of a gallon of gasoline, you’re going to get about 20 pounds of carbon dioxide. That’s how people like me ended up linking them under the Obama administration and the Biden administration.”

Impact on EVs

The EV market, having grown over the past few years thanks in part to the EV tax credit and Biden administration regulations, has slowed since Republicans took control of Congress and the White House.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said in Detroit in September, just before the EV tax credits were set to expire, that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if EV sales fell to a market share of 5 percent after the credit ended from around 10 percent to 12 percent at the time.

Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, senior visiting fellow in the climate and energy program at the left-center think tank Third Way and a former chief economist at both Ford and the Commerce Department, said in an email that she had estimated the EV industry would reach a 50 percent market share by 2030 with the tax credits and other federal incentives.

Now, she estimates 30 percent could be ambitious, especially in light of rising risks of recession during the second half of this decade.

“Our legacy automotive companies are incorporating new headwinds and tailwinds. For headwinds, the elimination of EV tax credits for vehicle buyers has incentivized a shift to delay or even cancel EV product plans,” Hughes-Cromwick said. “At the same time, easier regulations on fuel economy and emissions looks like it incentivizes the companies to amp up profitable SUV and truck production.”

She added that “only time will tell” on the prognosis as automakers await finalized CAFE standards, emission regulations and tariff policy.

In spite of slowing EV growth and rollback of federal support, Gore estimates global demand for EVs will still drive market interest in the United States.

“The CAFE standard is not necessarily meant to push the ceiling higher but to raise the floor and ensure that automakers who are not moving quickly to manufacture in high volumes lots of fuel-efficient vehicles are nonetheless continuing to improve over time,” Gore said.

According to an International Energy Agency outlook in May, EV sales topped 17 million worldwide in 2024, rising by more than 25 percent. China continued to dominate the market.

“The return on the invested capital, although there’s less of it out there, which makes it a bit riskier from a cost of capital perspective, is much higher. It’s because the market is less competitive, but there is a lot of demand,” Gore said. “I think people don’t want to be left out of technological innovation and a vision of the future.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/10/blink_charging_545_031124.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 15:19:52.625036

A regional water supplier in North Texas discussed water infrastructure needs and a proposed constitutional amendment that advocates say is part of the solution.

The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) runs the Wylie Water Treatment Plant, which sits on over 500 acres of land in Collin County.

“The North Texas Municipal Water District is a wholesale supplier of water, wastewater and solid waste to all of the cities and suburbs north and east of Dallas,” said David Kelly, the government affairs and special projects manager at NTMWD. “We are responsible for attaining raw water rights, treating and transporting raw water to a city’s take point, and then they’re responsible for distributing that water to their citizens.”

Kelly said cities in the plant’s service area currently distribute water to roughly 2.3 million residents.

“It’s one of the fastest growing areas in the entire country, and we’re adding about 75,000 people a year to our service area, so the biggest challenge that we have is keeping up with that growth and getting new water supplies to make sure that we are able to keep the Texas miracle going,” he said.

The population growth is sparking concerns about water shortages, failing infrastructure, droughts and floods. State lawmakers voted to put Proposition 4 on the November ballot, proposing a constitutional amendment that would allocate $1 billion a year for the next 20 years toward water infrastructure projects. Kelly says rural and disadvantaged areas would benefit as well.

“It’s going to go to the state and then be able to come back to the Texas Water Development Board to create projects like this here,” Kelly said.

Opponents of Proposition 4 argue that transferring the oversight of the revenue from lawmakers to the board would limit transparency and accountability. They also say it lacks adequate safeguards against environmental hazards. Advocates, who held a recent discussion during a Texas Tribune panel session, hope voters will support the proposition.

“The Legislature is recognizing what the importance of reliable water infrastructure is to Texas communities, and that’s why they’re submitting Proposition 4 to the choice of the voters,” said Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at Texas 2036, a nonprofit public policy organization.

Adopt standardized deposits, readiness criteria, and withdrawal penalties to deter speculative large loads and improve queue management.
Getting large load interconnection right is a generational opportunity that’s key to winning the AI race, reshoring American manufacturing, and keeping electricity reliable and affordable for everyone.","On October 23, 2025, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to conduct a rulemaking to assert jurisdiction over load interconnections to the bulk electric transmission system and establish standardized procedures for the interconnection of large loads.1 The Directive included an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANOPR) that sets forth the legal justification for asserting jurisdiction over transmission-level load interconnections and fourteen principles that should inform FERC’s rulemaking process. The Secretary has directed FERC to take “final action” on the Directive no later than April 30, 2026.

Citing “unprecedented and extraordinary” electricity demand driven by the rapid proliferation of data centers, onshoring of manufacturing, and trends in electrification, the Directive would have FERC address the lack of standardized rules governing how large loads—which it preliminarily defines as greater than 20 MW2 —are interconnected at the transmission level. The Directive issued shortly after the Senate confirmation of two new Republican FERC commissioners, Chair Laura V. Swett and Commissioner David LaCerte. Swett and LaCerte are the first appointments of the second Trump Administration to the agency and provide Republicans with a majority for the first time since August 2021.3 The new makeup of the agency along the Directive’s ambitious timeline suggest that FERC is likely to move quickly to address the issue of large load interconnection. Commissioner David Rosner, the agency’s prior Acting Chairman, has already expressed eagerness to work on the Secretary’s proposal.4

The ANOPR provides FERC with a critical opportunity to clarify FERC policy on large load interconnections. Although FERC has held a technical conference on the co-location of large loads5 and instituted a Federal Power Act (FPA) Section 206 proceeding regarding co-locating large loads in PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.,6 FERC has not provided comprehensive guidance on the process, cost allocation requirements, or timeline that transmission providers must follow when addressing large load requests. Additionally, the limited orders that FERC issued under the leadership of former Chairman Mark Christie appeared skeptical of the ability of the grid to accommodate loads without impairing service to other customers, including certain well-publicized orders thwarting efforts to co-locate large loads with existing generation in PJM.7 The ANOPR provides FERC with an opportunity to articulate a coherent policy framework that creates a path for the interconnection of large loads that recognizes the strategic and economic importance of large loads while maintaining reliability and resource adequacy.

Section 403 Authority

The Directive is issued pursuant to Section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, which allows the Secretary of Energy to “propose rules, regulations, and statements of policy of general applicability with respect to any function within the jurisdiction of the [FERC].”8 The legal impact of the Directive is, however, somewhat limited. FERC is not required to adopt any DOE proposal. It must only “consider” such proposal and take final action on the proposal in an “expeditious manner” and “in accordance with such reasonable time limits as may be set by the Secretary…”9

The directive marks the second time10 that the current Secretary has invoked his Section 403 authority following his August 29, 2025 directive for FERC to terminate its long-running proceeding addressing proposed updates to its policy statement on the certification of new interstate natural gas facilities.11 FERC followed the August 2025 Directive by issuing an order terminating its interstate natural gas facilities certificate proceeding just 14 days later.12 Prior to the August 2025 Directive, the DOE Secretary had not issued a Section 403 directive to FERC since former Secretary Rick Perry directed FERC to consider action to require transmission providers to compensate generation resources with on-site fuel supplies.13 Following extensive and widespread opposition to the Secretary Perry’s directive, FERC declined to adopt his proposed rule and terminated the proceeding.14

Jurisdiction Over Transmission-Level Interconnections

Parties are likely to contest whether FERC has jurisdiction over the interconnection of large loads to the transmission system. Historically, FERC has declined to assert jurisdiction over load interconnections in deference to the states’ authority over retail sales. In anticipation of these arguments, the Secretary’s Directive asserts that the interconnection of large loads to the transmission system falls “squarely within the [FERC’s] jurisdiction.”15 The ANOPR draws upon the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in New York v. FERC, in which the Court upheld FERC’s decision to exercise jurisdiction over unbundled retail sales but declined jurisdiction over bundled retail sales.16 The Court explained that “[t]he unbundled retail transmissions targeted by FERC are indeed transmissions of ‘electric energy in interstate commerce,’” subject to FERC jurisdiction and “[t]here is no language in the [FPA] limiting FERC’s transmission jurisdiction to the wholesale market…”17 It found that FERC had “discretion to decline to assert such jurisdiction [over bundled retail transactions] … in part because of the complicated nature of the jurisdictional issues.”18 The ANOPR questions FERC’s decision not to exercise jurisdiction over bundled retail sales, by citing to Justice Clarence Thomas’s dissent in which he disagreed with the Court’s conclusion that FERC could decline such jurisdiction since “FERC has jurisdiction over all interstate transmission, regardless of the type of transaction with which it is associated…”19

The ANOPR also finds support for the Secretary’s jurisdictional assertion in FERC’s generator interconnection framework. The ANOPR explains that in Order No. 2003 FERC found that generator interconnection is a “critical component of open access transmission service” over which it has jurisdiction to establish a standardized set of non-discriminatory procedures that transmission providers are required to adopt.20 Although the ANOPR does not directly compare the pre-Order No. 2003 generator interconnection process in which generators faced an “inefficient,” “case-by-case approach” to interconnect that “frequently result in complex, time consuming technical dispute about interconnection feasibility, cost, and cost responsibility,”21 the parallels between such process and current load interconnection processes are not difficult to draw.

From this background, the ANOPR identifies four legal justifications for FERC to assert jurisdiction over large load interconnections:

Load interconnection are, like generator interconnections, a “critical component of open access transmission service” over which FERC has jurisdiction.22 FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction over interstate transmission service would appear, based upon the discussion of New York and FERC’s generator interconnection framework, to be the primary basis that DOE believes FERC has jurisdiction over large load interconnections.

Load interconnections directly affect FERC-jurisdictional wholesale electricity rates, for which courts have found FERC has jurisdiction.23 Although the ANOPR does not elaborate on how FERC’s “affecting” jurisdiction extends to large load interconnections, courts have approved FERC’s assertion of jurisdiction over other entities that were engaged in activities that touched on state jurisdiction. For example, courts have found FERC has jurisdiction to establish rates for demand response participating in wholesale markets and to require states to allow energy storage resources to participate in wholesale markets, including by interconnecting at the distribution level.24

FERC’s assertion of jurisdiction over large load interconnections will not infringe on states’ authority over retail electricity sales or the siting of generating facilities.25 The ANOPR explains that while states have authority over retail sales and the siting, expansion, and modification of generating facilities, FERC’s adoption of processes governing large load interconnections will not impinge on this authority since the ANOPR does not address retail sales or the siting, expansion, and modification of generation facilities.

Finally, “[a]ny contrary view of the proposed reforms conflicts with the FPA’s core purposes.”26 The ANOPR’s point appears to be that that a core purpose of the FPA is that FERC shall be vested with exclusive jurisdiction to oversee the rates, terms, and conditions of transmission service and large loads interconnecting to the transmission system intend to obtain such service and its associated benefits. The interconnection of large loads thus falls within FERC’s jurisdiction.

Principles for Large Load Interconnection Processes

The ANOPR sets forth 14 broad principles that “should inform [FERC’s] rulemaking procedures.”27 Some of these principles may be relatively uncontroversial (e.g., utilities serving large loads must meet all applicable North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) reliability standards and transmission provider tariff requirements).28 But many other principles are likely to generate significant comment from utilities, large loads, generators, and consumers.

The 14 principles that the ANOPR instructs should inform FERC’s rulemaking are as follows:29

Limit FERC’s jurisdiction to interconnections directly to transmission facilities, consistent with FERC’s seven-factor test, to avoid infringing on state regulation of distribution facilities.30 FERC historically has applied the seven-factor test to evaluate whether facilities constitute transmission facilities subject to FERC’s jurisdiction or local distribution facilities subject to the exclusive authority of the states.

Apply the load interconnection process to new loads greater than 20 MW (and hybrid facilities with greater than 20 MW load).

Study large loads jointly with generation to promote efficient siting and minimize costly network upgrades.

Adopt standardized deposits, readiness criteria, and withdrawal penalties to deter speculative large loads and improve queue management.

Study hybrid facilities (i.e., facilities consisting of both load and generation) based on their net injection/withdrawal rights to encourage co-location and efficient grid use.

Require system-protection equipment for hybrid projects to prevent unauthorized injections or withdrawals, with potential penalties for violations.

Expedite studies (potentially as fast as 60-days) for large loads that agree to be curtailable.

Assign full responsibility for network-upgrade costs to interconnecting loads, with potential crediting or recovery mechanisms.

Provide large loads the option-to-build interconnection facilities and certain network upgrades, consistent with the generator option-to-build.

Require SSR/RMR-type studies when generators partially suspend operations to serve new load, ensuring reliability before suspension.

Charge for transmission service based on withdrawal rights to reflect the capacity and energy transmitted to serve such load.

Utilities serving large loads should be responsible for ancillary services based on peak demand without any consideration of co-located generation; however, any co-located generation should be fully compensated for the provision of ancillary services.

Establish transition plans for pending large load interconnections under study.

Require compliance with NERC standards, including possible new registration categories or modified standards to protect the bulk-power system.

The 14 principles set forth in the ANOPR appear designed to push FERC in the direction of resolving certain issues related to the interconnection and integration of large loads that already are being hotly contested before the FERC. For instance, the principle that facilities be studied and charged for transmission based on a net basis appears to put DOE’s weight behind parties that have argued that large loads should be permitted to serve a portion of their demand behind the meter without being subjected to transmission charges. At the same time, the ANOPR appears to make a concession to those parties that have argued that certain charges—such as ancillary services—should be allocated based on the gross capacity of a large load even if a portion may be served by onsite generation, although the ANOPR also confirms that onsite generation should have the opportunity to supply and be compensated for these services.

The ANOPR seeks comment on many of the 14 principles, including how to define large loads,31 what financial commitments or withdrawal penalties should apply to large load interconnections processes,32 and whether expedited study processes should be available for curtailable large loads.33 If FERC moves forward with a large load interconnection rulemaking, interested parties will have the opportunity to comment on other principles and present alternatives for FERC’s consideration.

It will now be on FERC to take up the ANOPR. While FERC has discretion regarding the substance of any orders that it issues in response to DOE’s directive, FERC will need to move quickly if it is to meet the DOE’s deadline of taking “final action” on the proposal by April 2026. Given that DOE’s proposal is cast as an ANOPR—which typically precedes the issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking and final rule—it seems likely that any actions that are taken by FERC by April 2026 may represent the first steps in a longer rulemaking process. Nevertheless, an order by the FERC articulating its view on the principles included in the ANOPR would represent a milestone in the FERC’s articulation of a policy respecting the interconnection of large loads.

USW International President

Edwin Sanchez had the seniority he needed to bid into a higher-paying position in the control room at the oil refinery in Texas City, Texas, where he’d worked for more than 15 years.

But Sanchez, lighthearted and sociable, seemed to prefer the company of his close-knit, 30-person unit responsible for a range of duties inside and outside the sprawling facility.

Sanchez, a member of United Steelworkers (USW) Local 13-1, showed up for his shifts like clockwork. And then, one day, he didn’t show up at all.

Concerned co-workers ultimately learned that Immigration and Customs Enforcement decided to deport Sanchez, whom local police detained after a traffic stop, even though he had an up-to-date work permit.

His deportation to Honduras—a country he hadn’t seen since leaving as a child nearly four decades earlier—occurred in March. The loss angered fellow union members, who fought to hold open Sanchez’s job during his months-long detention, and it underscored the heavy toll that Donald Trump’s dragnet exacts not only on deportees and their families but on the workplaces and industries they leave behind.

“It just leaves a hole,” observed Brandi Sanders-Lausch, president of Local 13-1, recalling how months of uncertainty about Sanchez’s fate affected about 1,000 union workers at the refinery.

“They were definitely distracted and probably a little uncomfortable,” she said of Sanchez’s co-workers, especially members of his unit who worked most closely with him. “They had questions. They didn’t understand. Everyone still talks about him.”

In all, the nation so far lost more than a million foreign-born workers like Sanchez amid Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

It’s already causing labor shortages that drive up employer costs and delay work, according to new data from the Federal Reserve. It’s ultimately going to balloon the federal deficit, hinder growth and lower Americans’ standard of living, according to a study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, one of whom explained that “fewer people means a smaller economy.”

The campaign against immigrants puts large swaths of the economy at risk, not merely by decimating the work force but by depriving the nation of people with the skills and knowledge essential for operating key industries and keeping them viable for the long term.

For example, Sanchez held a trusted role at the refinery, a veritable small city, where workers refine up to 631,000 gallons of crude oil a day for gasoline, petrochemicals, fuel oil, propane and other products needed by various kinds of businesses across the country.

Sanchez graduated from a local high school and completed a process technology degree at a community college to prepare for his work as an operator, which involved scaling ladders, monitoring gauges, performing maintenance and checking for leaks, among other responsibilities, Sanders said.

He continued his education on the job. Both the USW and the company invested in Sanchez on an ongoing basis, providing the safety and other training that empowered his work.

In return, Sanchez invested himself in his work and in his colleagues. He was a dependable, conscientious team player, with an upbeat personality that helped to lighten 12-hour shifts and the overtime that often followed, Sanders said, calling him a favorite among his co-workers.

“They all became really good friends,” she said, noting that Sanchez earned respect for his dedication to picket-line duty during the USW’s 2015 unfair labor practice strike against big oil and his commitment to watching others’ backs in a high-risk work environment.

“You can’t replace a person like that,” Sanders said. “You feel that loss. It’s almost like someone passing away.”

In his mid-30s, unmarried, with no children, Sanchez ended up relying on friends to sell his assets so he’d have some means of supporting himself in Honduras. He also accessed his retirement account, providing additional funds.

But co-workers never saw him again.

Instead of helping to meet America’s energy needs, he’s now figuring out his next steps in an unfamiliar country that has no oil industry, let alone a need for skilled refinery workers.

“He doesn’t speak Spanish,” Sanders said. “He still calls and checks in with everybody from time to time. His friends are here.”

Just like Sanchez, José Galo parlayed hard work and a union contract into a good middle-class life.

But it’s all in pieces now. Galo—who made his way to the U.S. on his own at 14, sometimes sleeping on a couch and skipping meals for lack of money—says he has little choice but to return to Honduras following the deportation of his wife, Karla.

Galo, a U.S. citizen and member of USW Local 1693 in Lexington, Ky., accompanied his wife, also a native of Honduras, to a routine check-in with immigration officials in June. Thirty minutes later, a woman returned to the waiting room and told Galo, “She’s no longer here.”

“They took her out the back,” recalled Galo, a manufacturing worker. He made a brief trip to Honduras shortly thereafter, taking the couple’s 6-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, so he could live with his mother.

Galo said he’s done his best to contribute to America, joining the ranks of the manufacturing workers who built the country and standing in solidarity with fellow USW members.

He availed himself of the advantages that the USW and other unions have provided all of their members, including members of various immigrant groups, for decades: good wages, affordable benefits, safe working conditions and a brighter future.

Galo bought a house and a car, willingly paid taxes and started a lawn care business to explore his entrepreneurial side. He liked nothing more than greeting his son when he walked through the door at the end of a long shift.

Now, his hardships cast a pall over the factory floor, where Galo says his co-workers, a second family, try to cheer him up even though they share his grief.

Powering 3,000+ homes and creating 50 jobs during construction, Foster Clean Power is Humboldt County’s first new-build large-scale solar + storage project under a power purchase agreement with Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA).

Owned by Radial Power, the portfolio includes Foster Clean Power A (4.457 MWDC) and Foster Clean Power B (4.951 MWDC). Both sites provide a pollinator-friendly habitat for native wildlife.

Early in development, the projects faced significant challenges, including outdated public records that showed incorrect water and utility easements encroaching on the planned site and access road. Renewable America addressed them by mobilizing survey teams and partnering with Humboldt Water to remap boundaries, adjusting the project layout and road design accordingly.

Through these efforts, Renewable America reduced access road construction costs by 75% (over $180,000) and accelerated the production timeline by six weeks while maintaining compliance, performance and energy yield.

Therefore, the EPA does not believe it is necessary to include air quality regulatory provisions in SIPs that limit the strategic use of prescribed fires.

EPA’s policy guidance comes on the heels of Administrator Lee Zeldin’s March 12 announcement that the EPA was revisiting its ‘Exceptional Events’ rulemaking to prioritize the allowance of prescribed fires in SIPs.","Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency issued its “Policy on Provisions to Allow Wildland Prescribed Fire in Clean Air Act State Implementation Plans” in accordance with Section 4 (Strengthening Wildfire Mitigation) of Executive Order 14308, ‘Empowering Commonsense Wildfire and Response.’

This policy guidance comes in the wake of the EPA completing its largest-ever wildfire hazardous material removal effort in response to the January 2025 Los Angeles County fires. In particular, EPA’s policy guidance directs its 10 regional offices to work with local, state, tribal, and federal partners to remove barriers in State Implementation Plans (SIPs) that discourage prescribed fires.

SIPs are used by a state, tribe, territory, or local air district to implement, maintain, and enforce the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and to fulfill other requirements under the Clean Air Act (CAA). For example, several states have rules incorporated into their SIPs that include statewide or areawide provisions relating to the use of prescribed fires. However, under the CAA and the EPA’s ‘Exceptional Events Rule,’ prescribed fires are eligible to be treated as an exceptional event in which air quality data resulting from these strategic fires does not need to be taken into account when determining whether a particular area meets NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA does not believe it is necessary to include air quality regulatory provisions in SIPs that limit the strategic use of prescribed fires.

EPA’s policy guidance instructs its regional offices to engage with local, state, tribal, and federal partners to develop approaches, consistent with the CAA, that will not limit the use of prescribed fires. In addition, these offices must also collaborate with state air agencies to evaluate both existing provisions already incorporated into SIPs and proposed provisions for inclusion into SIPs to ensure they are consistent with the CAA and do not limit the strategic application of wildland prescribed fires. Moreover, EPA’s regional offices will also encourage air agencies to collaborate with wildland prescribed burners, including state, tribal, and federal agencies, to implement smoke management strategies to minimize health impacts during prescribed fires and to promote recordkeeping of prescribed fire activities, which will enable more effective coordination and collaboration on smoke and air quality management.

EPA’s policy guidance comes on the heels of Administrator Lee Zeldin’s March 12 announcement that the EPA was revisiting its ‘Exceptional Events’ rulemaking to prioritize the allowance of prescribed fires in SIPs.

What are Connecticut's plans for its energy future?
Bottom line, you pile all these together, you've got an absolute target on offshore wind.
But basically, can we say that there is a glimmer of a silver lining to the dark clouds for our energy future?
In a sense, the biggest issue here is that you have all kinds of entities preparing for future power needs.","Connecticut had high hopes for wind and solar energy. Changes at the federal level have cast clouds over those plans.

WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Jan Ellen Spiegel to discuss her article, “CT needs to plan for its energy future, but the view is cloudy,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Jan’s story here.

WSHU: Hello, Jan. This summer, the Trump administration issued a stop-work order on Revolution Wind, the offshore wind project, which is backed by Connecticut and Rhode Island. Is that what prompted you to explore this issue more?

JES: Actually, no. It was one, certainly one factor. But this was already well underway. There have been a series of moves by Donald Trump in the second administration, starting from day one, that clearly were designed to, shall we say, impede, if not outright kill, certain types of renewable energy, most prominently offshore wind, to some degree, onshore wind and solar. And we were all forewarned. He slow walked this stuff in the first administration, and with a variety of executive orders on day one, you could see he was coming for him again, and he was coming for them much stronger.

The stop-work order on Revolution Wind, which didn't come until the end of August, and the subsequent stop-work order on another offshore project in New York, are more closely symptoms of all the other things he'd done, and he had done a number of things.

WSHU: Let's take a step back. What are Connecticut's plans for its energy future?

JES: Well, what they are and maybe going forward could be very different. First of all, there was a lot of emphasis being put on offshore wind, and certainly getting this project up and running was critical. If you may recall, there was an earlier offshore wind project that eventually got canceled as a result of the pandemic and increased prices and whatnot, and Connecticut had backed off on any additional stuff. Whether there would be more remains to be seen. The state itself, like almost every other state in New England and many other states in the northeast, has clean energy goals, as does Connecticut, and there are different ways that those can be attained. But offshore wind in particular was a huge component, because you can get massive amounts of energy and energy akin to one of the units in the Millstone nuclear power station.

Plus, there were some other things underway designed to get onshore wind down from Maine, which has been a goal now for 15 years; it just hasn't really materialized. And the transmission line to do that had been seriously delayed for years. That is actually almost done as well. The concern broadly on all this stuff, is that the Trump administration, which does not like renewable power, especially offshore wind, he doesn't like onshore wind all that much either, but he has a little less control over it, because unless it's on federal land, offshore wind, because it is in federally controlled waters that he has a lot of control over.

He doesn't like solar much either. Solar, of course, also would not necessarily end up on federal land, but it has enjoyed some very, very robust energy tax credits, federal tax credits on the order of 30% which is a big tax credit for a number of years now, and that for certain systems, most residential purchase systems, that ends at the end of this year. That was another action by the Trump administration. It came in early July, and for commercial systems and lease systems, it has another year to go. Bottom line, you pile all these together, you've got an absolute target on offshore wind. You have a financial target on solar that can make it a lot more expensive. You have the prospect of having to deal with federal permitting on certain things. And if you and the Trump administration don't like it, they can slow that down or kill that, which is part of what they've done with other offshore wind. It's not the kind of perfect storm you want to see if you're, if you're the Department of Energy Environmental protection.

WSHU: Now, the Trump administration has been pushing clean coal. We got rid of all our coal-fired power stations in Connecticut. Is there any future there?

JES: First of all, let's just be clear, there is no such thing as clean coal. People need to understand that Donald Trump may use that terminology, but what he is loosely referring to is a coal plant that will capture the emissions from it and store them. It's a technology that has never been perfected. It is barely in use. It is not something that exists. New England has no more coal plants. The last one, which was in New Hampshire, closed recently, which was a year earlier than expected. Coal is worldwide and in the U.S. a dying industry at the moment. I mean, I can't speak for financial people, but would investors reinvest in coal plants? Hard to say. But if I were a betting person, I would bet not. He has issued permits to extend the use of coal plants in other parts of the country for longer periods. But will that happen in New England? No. I mean, they're basically shut down. It's not stuff that is due to shut down. Where New England has to worry about coal is the emissions coming from it, because we are located where we are located, we get all kinds of pollution from that, from greenhouse gases to, you know, standard pollutants that cause all kinds of health problems here.

WSHU: Now, energy prices aren't coming down. So what is the future? What are regulators and policymakers looking at right now?

JES: What is being looked at right now at the federal level? The feds, yes, they want to keep coal going. They are also doing more oil and gas leasing, which has either been eliminated or tamped down in some ways. Will that impact folks here in Connecticut? Potentially, natural gas plants could stay open longer than had been intended. The likelihood of building another natural gas plant is very expensive, and the materials for them have been in very short supply for years to come. We also don't know what tariffs are going to do to various materials. We don't know what is going to happen in terms of needed minerals for that kind of thing. So that's one bucket. A lot of folks look at the millstone plant, which has a lot of power. It's 2100 megawatts more or less together, can run 24/7, and it supplies about a little less than a third of the power along with the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire. It supplies about a third of the power in New England. It's already extended its license.

Again, nuclear plants can run for quite a while. There's a lot of discussion about advanced nuclear plants and whatnot, and there's a lot of misconceptions and misinformation out there in terms of what is actually available in terms of that advanced nuclear, and the bottom line is, it's not available. In some cases, the technology doesn't fully exist yet, and it's many, it's, you know, you're talking 2030, at the earliest. And I will have more details on that in the future.

WSHU: Okay. But basically, can we say that there is a glimmer of a silver lining to the dark clouds for our energy future?

JES: Oh, there are a couple of yin and yangs to them. Look at one of the reasons everybody is scrambling for power; presumably, we're going to have all this AI. We're going to have all these data centers, not many of which have ever ended up in New England, for a lot of economic reasons. Land is expensive. There's not all that much space. And it's unclear whether it's going to pan out to the levels that some people think it will, and I've heard that from some, you know, pretty high-end economists who are a little skeptical, we're going to need that much power. Also, if you're pulling tax credits off things like electric vehicles, which are gone, that was going to be kind of a power suck. Will those tax credits being gone then diminish the demand for EVs so you won't need as much power as possible?

The flip side of that is, if people aren't building as much solar, then you are taking away that great hedge of not needing enough power. So it's hard to say. What people in New England and Connecticut don't always realize is that power demand in the region for 10-15 years has been flat, if not lower than it was expected. The independent system operator that runs the grid expects that in the next 10 years, it'll increase by about 11% but that was before all this happened. Will it continue to increase like that? Unclear. In a sense, the biggest issue here is that you have all kinds of entities preparing for future power needs. There are so many wrinkles and so many uncertainties and so many outright hand grenades being thrown into this thing. I keep asking people, well, how do you plan? And it's hard. These guys just don't totally know now how to plan for a future where the power plant they were expecting, just like Revolution Wind, might get stopped. And now, what do we do? It's very, very difficult for that future. We can say what's out there, you know, maybe more nuclear way down the road, you know, would someone build another gas plant? Unclear. Will people keep investing in solar because it will help their own personal electric rates? It's possible, but we don't know. So the trajectory we have been on, the odds of the region, because we are a regional grid staying on. That could be anybody's guess at this point.

WSHU: So, bottom line, it's much more difficult for policymakers to try and figure this out.

JES: Yes, if their goal is to keep energy rates low, boy, this is about the biggest wrinkle that could have been thrown at them.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2db946/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x2722+0+292/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F92%2F3d%2Fb06c9f9b4098bc4fc749851247d9%2Fap23321628142358.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 16:23:06.015710

The stakes at this year’s COP30 climate conference couldn’t be higher.

Global temperatures are breaking records, extreme weather is hitting harder and more often, and food and energy systems are under severe strain. At the same time, political headwinds are growing stronger. In many countries, climate ambitions are colliding with concerns over competitiveness, cost of living and security. This risks slowing progress at the very moment when science warns the window for decisive action is closing.

This year’s UN climate conference in November will bring delegates from around the world together in Belém, Brazil to set goals for reducing the impacts of climate change. Ahead of the conference, POLITICO hosted a three-part live event series, presented by Bayer, held in Berlin, Germany; Brussels, Belgium; and Brasília, Brazil. These discussions convened leaders from politics, business and civil society to test new ideas, challenge assumptions and highlight pathways forward. With events in Europe and Latin America, the conversations captured the different regional forces shaping the debate: from Europe’s struggle to maintain momentum in the face of political and economic obstacles, to Brazil’s effort to harness its resources to create a more sustainable model of development.

What emerged was a clearer sense of the barriers and the possibilities: The transition to climate neutrality will require cooperation across borders, sectors and policies that are durable enough to withstand shifting political winds. It will also demand innovation in how food is produced, energy is generated and natural ecosystems are protected. As delegates head to COP30, the discussions offer timely context for what hangs in the balance. They point to the difficult choices that lie ahead, but also to the opportunities for building new coalitions capable of turning ambition into action.

Europe’s climate ambition under strain

Despite significant progress in recent years, Europe faces complex questions around maintaining momentum in reaching climate goals. The event, which convened in early September, revealed tensions playing out on the wider political stage, as EU member states look to balance climate ambition with economic realities — while seeking to set actionable new goals.

“The European Commission’s proposal for a 90 percent cut [in emissions from 1990 levels] by 2040 is not just something nice to have, it is essential,” said Jochen Flasbarth, state secretary at Germany’s Environment Ministry, at the event. Flasbarth will also be the lead negotiator for Germany at COP30. His concern reflects a competitive reality: If EU-wide targets are weakened, German companies — bound by strict domestic climate laws — could face higher costs than competitors in less ambitious European nations, potentially driving business elsewhere in the market.

This fracturing, a key topic at the Berlin to Belém event, came to the fore in late September, when the Commission was unable to agree on a firm reduction target for 2035. Instead of presenting a fully-fledged plan at the UN’s climate meeting in New York, EU ministers had to settle for proposing a target decrease range of 66.25 percent to 72.5 percent. Countries like Slovakia opposed the higher figure, while others, including Germany, considered the lower bound of the range unacceptably weak.

Business has a vital part to play

The discussion also unpacked how companies are navigating an increasingly fraught political landscape. Following last year’s U.S. election, there have been some boardrooms that are reassessing their climate commitments. Matthias Berninger, Bayer’s Executive Vice President and Head of Public Affairs, Sustainability, and Safety, said he’s seen four types of reactions. Some companies, he noted, are simply turning around in order to sail with the political winds. Others are giving up entirely. A third group is hitting the pause button. But, he says, there remains a substantial cohort of businesses — including Bayer — standing firm on climate goals despite the shifting tides that come with substantial headwinds.

This corporate determination matters more than ever. “Paris was possible because key industry players supported the climate agenda, and I think that is what is also necessary in Belém,” Berninger said. Other panelists seemed to agree that this is as much a business imperative as it is an environmental one: While the dismantling of ESG frameworks might tempt some enterprises to scale back, the smartest companies understand that weather volatility and supply chain disruptions affect bottom lines regardless of political rhetoric.

Genuine collaboration between sectors must, for this reason, be the way forward, panelists said. “The entire climate issue can only be addressed in a public-private effort,” argued Philipp Rösler, CEO of Consessor AG, a management consultancy, and former German Vice Chancellor. While acknowledging that business has to remain profitable, he stressed that sustainability should be integrated into core operating models, not treated as charity or public relations. This partnership approach — combining policy frameworks with private innovation — offers the only viable route to meaningful climate action at scale.

We have a totally different environment in comparison to [previous] COPs… Now it's time to stand together and to make it a success — because, if Germany and Europe [don't] take over leadership, no one else will do it.

Dr. Philipp Rösler

CEO of Consessor AG, former German Vice-Chancellor and Federal Minister

Brazil’s moment to lead

With COP30 on the horizon, panelists noted an increased urgency and importance of the conference and Brazil’s unique position to reshape global climate governance in an increasingly fractured world. The shifting landscape creates challenge and opportunity for the host nation, which brings credibility both as a victim of environmental degradation and as a potential solution provider — with its agricultural strength, significant forest cover and environmental investment, and future opportunities for large-scale land restoration.

“Let’s not lose the focus of this event; we need to get Belém to be a success,” urged Lisa Badum, Green Party member of the German Bundestag. She underscored Europe’s pivotal role in achieving meaningful progress by building coalitions with Latin America and climate vulnerable states — alliances that can push back against governments that may be trying to weaken decarbonization targets and other climate initiatives.

Panelists praised Brazil President Lula’s proposal for a financing facility for standing forests as potentially game-changing, addressing the grievance of nations that have preserved their forests while watching deforested countries access climate finance. The Tropical Forest Forever Facility would use a novel approach: Investing $125 billion in financial markets and directing returns — potentially $2.8 billion annually — to countries that successfully protect their rainforests. Unlike traditional climate funds that reward reforestation, this mechanism would compensate states for keeping forests intact. With Brazil pledging the first $1 billion and support from partner nations and private banks, the initiative seeks to establish a new model where conservation results in financial gain.

The disconnect between vision and budget

As part of the EU’s next long-term budget package, known as the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), European Commissioners plan to merge the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) into an €865 billion fund alongside cohesion, migration and border policies. This change will significantly alter how farm support works across Europe. The EU says the goal of this new fund is to help close the gap between regions, while allowing more flexibility and efficiency to help member states reach wide-ranging goals. The Brussels panel revealed deep concerns about this restructuring, with Dacian Cioloș, former Prime Minister of Romania and Commissioner for Agriculture and Food, European Commission, delivering a stark assessment of what it means for farmers. “With the legislative proposals on the MFF package, including agriculture, this is the beginning of the end of a common agricultural policy,” he said.

The proposal shifts significant budgetary control to member states, which would design national plans with discretion over spending priorities. This would fragment what has been one of Europe’s most integrated policies, Cioloș argued. When different countries can set vastly different payment levels for the same farming activities, market distortions follow. A wheat farmer in Romania might receive far less support than one in France, despite operating in the same single market. “In agriculture, once you lose some farmers, they will not come back,” he said.

Cioloș called for maintaining common European rules while connecting agricultural policy with trade, environmental and energy objectives. He emphasized a need to transform direct payments into clearer incentives that reward environmental services and food security contributions — not social support, which undermines the policy’s legitimacy.

Climate and environmental ambition at risk

There were also concerns among the panel’s environmental advocates, who warned of degraded climate measures in a reformed CAP. Marco Contiero, Greenpeace’s EU Agriculture Policy Director, acknowledged some positive elements in the proposal such as better targeting of support and transition planning for farmers, but said that the numbers were worrying. Currently, 32 percent of CAP funding goes to environmental measures through eco-schemes and agri-environmental programs. Under the new structure, that could fall to one-fifth, or less, he said.

“The remaining 20 percent, more or less, will have to be divided between agri-environmental decisions, investment support, support for areas of natural constraints, knowledge and innovation spreading, et cetera,” Contiero explained. With so many mandatory measures competing for a shrinking pot, environmental ambitions could face severe constraints.

This comes at a moment of mounting climate costs: Between 2020 and 2023, Europe suffered more financial damage from extreme weather than in the entire previous decade, with annual losses averaging €44.5 billion.

On the one hand, farmers need stability. They need, to a certain extent, the assurance with regard to the business they're in, that it's remaining a viable, professional and profitable business going forward. On the other hand, farmers also need an incentivization scheme towards innovation. So how can we ensure that farmers are recognized and appreciated for driving sustainable agriculture?

The link between innovation and resilience

Industry representatives stressed that building agricultural resilience requires embracing innovation across the board. Jens Hartmann, Head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Bayer’s Crop Science division, pointed to a troubling reality — no new conventional crop protection molecules have been registered in Europe for five years. “It’s the combination of innovation which ultimately drives resilience,” he argued, calling for new breeding techniques that can create heat, drought and pest-resistant crops.

Opening the event, Max Müller, Bayer’s Head of Global Public Affairs, framed the issue in broader terms. He warned that Europe risks falling behind if it continues to move too slowly in bringing new technologies to market at a time when farmers face mounting climate pressures. “With innovation, agriculture can move from being part of the problem to become part of the solution,” he said, pointing to advances in biotechnology and crop science that could boost sustainability and competitiveness.

But technology alone won’t solve Europe’s agricultural challenges. The panel agreed on the sector’s aging crisis: Young people aren’t entering farming due to income unpredictability and lack of respect for the profession. Hartmann linked this directly to recent farmer protests: “It was a lot about whether farmers are actually recognized as a very, very important and strong contributor to food security in Europe.”

The solution requires what Hartmann termed a “regenerative” approach — not just producing more on the same land, but rethinking entire crop cycles while ensuring farmers have access to new revenue streams like carbon farming, which rewards practices that capture and store atmospheric carbon in the ground.

Betting Big on the Future with Biofuels

Brasília

At the third event in Brasília, “Brazil's Biofuel Revolution,” officials and industry leaders outlined how a mix of policy, land use and technology could let the country scale renewable fuels without displacing agriculture.

On Brazil’s leading the way

On the biofuel bet that paid off

From competition to coexistence

The idea that biofuels threaten food security and undermine environmental goals has long shaped the global energy debate. Critics warn that crops grown for fuel can compete with food supplies, push up prices and drive land-use change. Brazil is chipping away at this narrative, audience members in Brasília learned, by expanding energy production without displacing food or forests. In doing so, COP30’s host nation is “teaching the world how to produce food while making a sustainable energy transition,” explained Francila Calica, Vice President of Agricultural Affairs and Sustainability, Bayer Crop Science Latin America.

Gabriel Delgado, the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture’s representative in Brazil, echoed the point, arguing that technological advancements and smarter land use are making the supposed trade-off between food and energy “obsolete in a very short time.” That shift, speakers said, is not the product of a single innovation but of a layered system designed to make food and energy production work in tandem. Sugarcane provides the backbone, supplying sugar, ethanol and surplus electricity; corn contributes a second stream by turning off-season harvests into biofuel; and macaúba — a native palm used as a biofuel feedstock — offers further expansion without claiming new land.

Policy and markets as enablers

Brazil’s biofuel strategy is being propelled as much by policy design as by agricultural innovation, with clear, consistent rules giving producers and investors the confidence to scale. Pedro Guerra, Chief of Staff to the Vice-President and Minister, Brazil's Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade and Services, highlighted the Future of Fuels law — a new framework that sets long-term biofuel blending trajectories and market signals — as an important example. “The first measure was to approve a bill and create predictability in terms of blending percentages. This was key for the development of the sector — not only in the biodiesel industry, but also in the ethanol sector,” he said.

That policy clarity is reinforced by increasing mandatory blend levels, which determine the share of biofuels that must be mixed into conventional fuels. Brazil currently blends around 14 percent biodiesel into its diesel pool, with plans to raise that to 20 percent by 2030. Ethanol production is expected to expand from just over 30 billion liters a year today to nearly 50 billion by 2034. RenovaBio, Brazil’s national decarbonization program, has underpinned that growth by issuing tradeable carbon credits to low-carbon fuel producers — avoiding more than 100 million tonnes of CO2 emissions since its launch in 2019.

Brazil has this large experience in biofuels, in ethanol, thanks to the oil shock in the seventies. It was a little bit traumatic, and the country learned to diversify its energy grid, thanks to this sort of experience. I think that the Europeans are having this harmful lesson nowadays. This is our first message, [...] the important thing is to diversify.

Pedro Guerra

Scaling through technology and inclusion

Speakers stressed that Brazil’s biofuel strategy is no longer just about proving a concept but about making it work at scale. Julia Cruz, Secretary of Green Economy, Decarbonization and Bioindustry, Brazil's Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade and Services, said new solutions are making it possible to rethink where and how fuels are produced. “We have technologies that can put a refinery at the size of a truck,” she said, pointing to smaller, modular biorefineries that can operate close to where feedstocks are grown.

Such flexibility, Cruz argued, could help broaden participation beyond major agribusinesses, creating new income streams for smaller producers while keeping supply chains local. It also complements Brazil’s large-scale land restoration plans, which aim to bring degraded areas back into productive use without threatening forests.

Panelists said these developments position Brazil to play a larger role internationally — not just as a major biofuel producer, but as a country exporting know-how and practical tools for others to follow. “This is one of the learnings that Brazil can show in this COP30, for the world,” said Calica. That message is expected to feature prominently at the climate conference, where Brazil will push for wider adoption of biofuels as part of the global energy transition.

The path to progress

Behind every promise to cut emissions is a harder question about balancing environmental goals with security, food and economic pressure. That tension ran throughout the discussions in all three cities, surfacing in debates over security, fiscal limits and the role of renewable fuels.

Countries are pursuing competing strategies, driven as much by domestic politics as by global climate ambition. Some rely on technology, others on market reform or energy diversification. Brazil’s approach adds another layer, a bid to prove that growth and decarbonization can be built on the same land.

When leaders meet in Belém, those fault lines will define the debate — and test whether nations can align their paths closely enough to make progress.

They illustrate a broader economic reality. Hydrogen as an energy source, as opposed to its use as an industrial feedstock, is increasingly failing under scrutiny. Fortescue’s projects had significant financial backing, government support, and appeared viable on paper. Yet the underlying economics simply could not withstand changing conditions.

The Arizona project was an 80 MW green hydrogen facility originally intended to establish Fortescue’s foothold in the American market. As I noted a year ago, building a green hydrogen project in an increasingly waterless desert was insane to begin with. The project’s cancellation followed shifts in US energy policy under the Trump administration, particularly the removal of certain hydrogen-related subsidies. This policy uncertainty quickly revealed the true economics of hydrogen production. With the incentives removed, the project’s already tenuous financial viability vanished, prompting Fortescue to write off approximately $150 million in pre-tax losses.

In Australia, Fortescue’s PEM50 hydrogen plant in Gladstone had already commenced partial operations. The project had secured approximately $40 million (about A$60 million) in government grants. Despite initial optimism, the facility proved costly and uncompetitive.

Officials in a news release on Monday said the “project will utilize lower-carbon natural gas and recovered steam in a combined-cycle configuration to deliver flexible, more sustainable energy to the MISO [Midcontinent Independent System Operator] grid.”

Bechtel Serves as EPC Lead

Bechtel Infrastructure & Power Corp. will serve as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor for the facility.

“Developing these grid-scale generation projects typically takes years, and this agreement with GE Vernova marks a pivotal milestone in the execution of a project that began in 2021,” said Tom Spang, Advanced Power’s CEO. “Maple Creek will soon be ready to deliver reliable, dispatchable power to one of the fastest-growing load centers in the country.

PV-Tech – October 15

Market-averaged solar PPA prices hit $59.77/MWh in the third quarter of this year, according to LevelTen Energy. The average price of a solar power purchase agreement (PPA) signed in North America increased 4% between the second and third quarters of this year, a change that is “unsurprising” considering the “policy headwinds” facing U.S. solar at present. The report notes that market-averaged prices across all three profiled project types—wind, blended, and solar—saw prices increase quarter-on-quarter.

EIA’s latest monthly “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through August 31, 2025) shows that utility-scale solar generation in August increased nearly 30% from August 2024, while rooftop solar increased 10.8%. Combined, they provided 9.5% of the nation’s electrical output during August, up from 7.6% one year ago.

The SUN DAY Campaign reviewed the EIA data and found that solar-generated electricity year-to-date (YTD) easily surpassed — by over 58% — the output of the nation’s hydropower plants (5.6% of total generation). In August alone, solar-generated electricity more than doubled the output of the nation’s hydropower plants. In fact, in both August and YTD, solar produced more electricity than hydropower, biomass and geothermal combined.

Moreover, for the second consecutive month, utility-scale solar generated more electricity than the nation’s wind farms — by 4% in July and by 15% in August. Including small-scale systems, solar has out-produced wind four months in a row and by almost 50% during August.

During the first eight months of 2025, electrical generation by wind and all solar provided almost one-fifth (19.1%) of the U.S. total, up from 17.2% during the first two-thirds of 2024. The combination of wind and solar provided 16.2% more electricity than did coal during the first eight months of this year, and 11.7% more than the nation’s nuclear power plants. In fact, as solar and wind expanded, nuclear-generated electricity dropped by 0.7%.

The mix of all renewables produced 9% more electricity in January-August than they did a year ago and provided (26.1%) of total U.S. electricity production compared to 24.5% twelve months earlier. Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second to only that of natural gas whose electrical output actually dropped by almost 4.1% during the first eight months of 2025.

Strong growth was also experienced by battery storage which grew by 63.9% during the past year and added 13,377.5 MW of new capacity. In the course of the past year, battery storage actually surpassed pumped hydro storage (PHS) — in October 2024 — and now accounts for 50% more storage capacity than PHS. EIA also notes that planned battery capacity additions during the next year total 20,179.8 MW.

On the other hand, natural gas capacity increased by only 3,337.7 MW and nuclear power added a mere 46.0 MW. Meanwhile, coal capacity plummeted by 4,185.1 MW and petroleum-based capacity fell by an additional 658.7 MW.

Thus, during the past year, renewable energy capacity, including battery storage and small-scale solar, ballooned by 55,419.6 MW while that of all fossil fuels and nuclear power combined actually declined by 1,486.3 MW.

“The Trump Administration and its Republican supporters in Congress may slow renewable energy growth a bit,” noted the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong. “However, EIA’s data reinforce the conclusion that the transition to solar, wind, other renewables and storage continues, is accelerating, and has become inevitable.”

EV sales freefall by around 43% as the $7,500 federal tax credit dries up

If you purchased a new EV earlier this year, you likely qualified for a hefty federal tax credit. As of the end of September, the government stopped offering a $7,500 tax credit for qualifying electric cars, trucks, and SUVs.

The credit significantly deferred the cost of entry for EV adopters, making a battery electric vehicle like the Nissan LEAF or Tesla Model Y much more affordable for new buyers. All in all, American buyers saved over three billion dollars using the tax credits during its 17-year run.

The incipient end of the tax credit in September did, however, boost EV sales in September. According to J.D. Power, “The expiration of federal EV credits on Sept. 30 caused EV shoppers to pull ahead their purchases, driving a significant increase in EV sales and inflating the overall industry sales pace,” said Thomas King at J.D. Power. “In September, EVs accounted for 12.9% of new-vehicle retail sales, the highest ever, and well above the 8.5% recorded a year earlier.”

But now the federal tax credit is no more, and American electric vehicle sales are feeling the squeeze. Projections put EV sales down 43% in October, one of the largest-ever year-over-year declines.

Analysts, however, believe that the impact could have been worse. Despite the sharp deterioration in EV sales, the decline could have been worse,” King said in a press release. “Actions by multiple manufacturers to reduce EV prices and increase discounts to offset the loss of the federal credit are helping to maintain EV affordability, thereby preventing an even larger decline in EV sales.”",https://www.motorbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Nissan-Ariya-EVs-jetcityimage-via-iStock.jpg?w=1200,N,,2025-10-27 14:19:07.561655

""It got a $250 million grant to deliver solar and battery storage to nearly 30,000 households in Texas.""
Fletcher co-led 100 House Democrats in sending a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding he restore the program and reinstate the grant funding.
""This letter is responding to something even bigger than the Solar for All program,” Fletcher said.","Congressional Democrats are pressing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to restore funding to a program expanding the deployment of solar energy for working families. The move follows Harris County's lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration to restore the program.

The EPA announced on Aug. 7 that it would terminate the Solar for All program and take back $7 billion in funds from grant recipients, saying the Trump administration's rescission package required it to do so. Houston Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher played a key role in passing the program into law three years ago.

""This is a huge, important renewable energy program, and here in Texas, Harris County led a statewide coalition that won one of the five largest awards of any group in the country,"" Fletcher said. ""It got a $250 million grant to deliver solar and battery storage to nearly 30,000 households in Texas.""

Fletcher stressed that the program was designed to create thousands of well-paying jobs and to boost American manufacturing, in addition to making the electrical grid more reliable.

""All of that was happening here in Texas, in Houston, in Port Arthur, and in Waco,” she said. “Training programs were already underway to certify Texans in solar installation and energy efficiency. So, we’re talking about benefits for consumers, benefits for workers, and benefits for our environment and our economy.""

Fletcher co-led 100 House Democrats in sending a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding he restore the program and reinstate the grant funding. Fletcher said Zeldin's office has yet to respond.

""This letter is responding to something even bigger than the Solar for All program,” Fletcher said. “It’s about responding to the Trump administration’s continued efforts to consolidate power and overrule the other branches of government, and that would be Congress and the courts. What we see here is yet another example of the administration ignoring or rejecting the law that Congress has passed and programs that Congress has put into place for no reason or for reasons that they just don't agree with it.”

Invest in clean energy: Better regulations and stronger market confidence are key to unlocking renewable energy, storage capacity and energy efficiency.","Now comes the harder part: turning this political choice into real progress. The new government must strengthen the rule of law, push forward with reforms, and build the institutional capacity needed to make EU membership a reality.

Among the challenges ahead, two stand out – energy and the environment. Moldova has benefited from strong European support. The European Commission’s Growth Plan for Moldova, worth more than EUR 1.9 billion, has already been approved. Yet, the biggest obstacle is not money, but the country’s ability to deliver reforms and put policies into action.

A recent National Green Transition Assessment Report , launched by SEI in June, offers a roadmap for Moldova’s green transition. The report reviews progress across climate action, energy, buildings, industry, pollution, agriculture, transport and biodiversity. It highlights real achievements but also major gaps that must be closed.

Moldova has set an ambitious goal: to cut emissions by more than 70% by 2030 – exceeding the EU average. Yet serious challenges remain with green transition, governance and financing. Implementation often lags behind commitments, due to the already limited administrative capacity being pushed to their limits with the gigantic tasks related to EU accession.

This matters because Moldova is already feeling the effects of a changing climate. The country is highly exposed to droughts, floods and other extreme weather. A joint SEI and ACT Global public perception study found that 73% of Moldovans say climate change affects them or people close to them, 85% report health impacts, and more than half face economic hardship linked to climate-related issues. These disasters already cost the country about 1.3% of GDP each year.

Our assessment identifies areas where the new government must act fastest:

Accelerate digital and green transformation: Expanding digital services, creating decarbonization plans, and scaling up green technologies are essential for innovation, exports and green jobs. These steps can also improve living standards and open EU markets.

Improve adaptation readiness: Moldova needs stronger adaptation measures – public and private – to reduce damage from climate change, which hits vulnerable groups hardest.

Unlock green capital: Moldova will need over EUR 30 billion in investment to reach net zero. Closing this gap means attracting new climate finance and more private investors.

Empower local leadership and green finance: Municipalities need more tools, better capacity, and domestic green finance to lead climate action beyond reliance on international aid.

Invest in clean energy: Better regulations and stronger market confidence are key to unlocking renewable energy, storage capacity and energy efficiency. Workforce and infrastructure gaps must also be addressed.

Promote sustainable agriculture: Export-oriented agricultural reforms can make Moldovan products more competitive while protecting the environment and supporting EU market access.

Protect nature and biodiversity: Moldova needs urgent afforestation and updated environmental policies to ensure sustainable land management and meet EU biodiversity standards.

Upgrade waste and water solutions: Modern wastewater treatment and circular economy practices are vital for public health and pollution control.

Modernize transport: Shifting from a road-centric system to smarter, cleaner public transport will cut emissions and improve access to mobility.

Moldova has made its political choice for Europe. Now it must prove that choice through action. The elections showed how crucial European support has been – and continued backing will be vital. The EU, its member states, and the international community can help Moldova succeed through technical assistance, mobilization of green finance, knowledge sharing, and political partnership.

Helping Moldova carry out these reforms is not just about one country’s future – it is an investment in stability, energy security and resilience at Europe’s eastern frontier. With sustained support, Moldova can turn its European vision into lasting prosperity.",https://www.sei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-2237548126-2-1488x708.webp?modtime=1761584824,N,,2025-10-27 16:23:14.984195

“ When the government is back to work, we'll pick up the ball with the EPA,” said Burns.","Powell is working with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revitalize Park County’s main streets and build a big-picture strategy to boost outdoor recreation in the area. But the project is currently on pause because of the government shutdown.

The Powell Economic Partnership (PEP) is the first organization in the state to be part of the EPA’s Recreation Economy for Rural Communities planning assistance program, which launched in 2019. Communities get support from federal experts on a project to help enhance local economies and get people outside. PEP was one of 25 to be selected out of a pool of about 200 this year.

“ It's very much like when you have any sort of consultant come in who is planning something for the community,” said PEP Executive Director Rebekah Burns. “It's a very similar process to the land use plan or the county regulations. This one is just focusing on economic development and revitalizing downtowns using the outdoor recreation economy.”

Burns said she’s had her eye on the grant for a number of years, and that building a network of trails and pathways between towns was a big part of its application pitch.

“ We really wanted it to be a countywide effort that would benefit all of the counties downtown – the city of Meeteetsee, the city of Powell, and the City of Cody – and really connect our communities,” she said.

Instead of funding, the EPA program brings expertise. Consultants work with a local steering committee and hold a public meeting to source input from the broader community.

But getting that federal feedback isn’t happening right now because of the nationwide federal government shutdown. Burns said she was notified that the folks the group had started to work with are currently furloughed.

“That's good news as far as I'm concerned,” she said. “We have a status update and know that it's just a furlough. It's not a firing or something like that, which would be way more devastating to a project like this.”

PEP started in 2011 and took over the town’s Chamber of Commerce and Visitor Center a handful of years later. The organization has been focusing on developing the outdoor economy since 2019, with a goal of boosting frontcountry recreation to support the growth of associated businesses. But getting the infrastructure in place is no small feat.

“ [Building those assets] takes a lot of time and concerted effort, because there's so many players and stakeholders at the table when you're talking about land managers,” said Burns. “Often, around Powell or really anywhere in Park County, it's not uncommon to have three or four land managers potentially needing to collaborate on one project. And that doesn’t even include private landowners.”

Burns added that she hopes people come to community conversations about the topic with “an open mindset and a little bit of wonder” about what it could look like to connect the communities of Meeteetse, Powell and Cody, and what that would actually look like on the ground.

Despite the ongoing shutdown, PEP is continuing to work on a project to build 11 miles of trail from Garland to Ralston, nestled between a railroad track and a canal. It’s currently collaborating with two organizations to move that planning process along. But when it comes to figuring out a bigger-picture strategy for outdoor recreation in Park County?

The decline in October sales is largely attributed to the end of the $7,500 EV tax credits that expired at the end of September.
""The EV sales story will really change going forward from here,"" noted Chesbrough.
""Sales of EVs and PHEVs are expected to collapse in October as tax credits expire.
Cox Automotive maintains its full-year sales forecast between 15.8 and 16.4 million vehicles, with 16.1 million as the baseline projection.","Investing.com -- New vehicle sales in October are forecast to slow from the strong pace seen in the third quarter, with electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) sales expected to drop significantly following the expiration of tax credits.

According to Cox Automotive, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for October is projected to reach 15.7 million vehicles, down from 16.1 million last year and 16.4 million in September. Sales volume is expected to hit 1.30 million units, representing a decrease of more than 3% compared to October 2024, though this marks a 2.7% increase from September.

""The new-vehicle sales pace was surprisingly strong this summer despite ongoing tariff uncertainty,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive. ""However, as more tariffed products replace non-tariffed inventory, prices are tracking higher, which should lead to slower sales through the remainder of the year.""

The decline in October sales is largely attributed to the end of the $7,500 EV tax credits that expired at the end of September. These incentives had previously driven EV sales to record levels in the third quarter of 2025, when sales reached 438,487 units - a 40.7% increase from the previous quarter and 29.6% higher than the same period last year.

""The EV sales story will really change going forward from here,"" noted Chesbrough. ""Sales of EVs and PHEVs are expected to collapse in October as tax credits expire. In addition, market conditions for other vehicles are expected to become more challenging in future months as prices increase.""

Cox Automotive maintains its full-year sales forecast between 15.8 and 16.4 million vehicles, with 16.1 million as the baseline projection. The company has adjusted its forecast for both fleet and new retail sales higher following strong third-quarter performance, while lowering its lease penetration forecast from 25% to 24% due to the anticipated decline in EV leasing during the fourth quarter.

TXSE Rule 16.312(c).","Article Insights

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's recent approval of the Texas Stock Exchange LLC (TXSE or the Exchange) as the newest national securities exchange marks a significant development in the U.S. capital markets.1 Headquartered in Dallas and backed by major institutional investors, TXSE aims to offer an issuer-friendly listing process while maintaining some of the highest quantitative standards in the industry.2 Trading and listings are expected to begin in 2026.3

For Canadian issuers, TXSE introduces a new pathway to the U.S. capital markets. This article explores what makes TXSE unique and why Canadian issuers should start planning now.

Key Features of TXSE

Unlike traditional exchanges, which offer lower tiers for smaller issuers, TXSE will operate as a single-tier exchange and require a confidential pre-application review before formal listing, allowing companies to assess readiness without public disclosure – available at no cost.4 TXSE has also collaborated with state leaders to create a pro-business environment, aimed at reducing regulatory friction and enhancing predictability for issuers.5

Why This Matters for Canadian Issuers

1. Cost Efficiency Compared to Other Exchanges

TXSE has committed to a competitive fee structure for going and staying public, coupled with a streamlined listing process.6

2. Dual-Listing Opportunities

Canadian issuers can maintain their TSX or TSXV listing while adding TXSE to broaden their investor base and access U.S. capital markets.

3. Sector Alignment

TXSE's Texas base positions it as a natural fit for energy, infrastructure, and industrial issuers, sectors where Canadian companies excel.

4. Issuer-Friendly Corporate Laws

Texas has adopted provisions designed to create the nation's ""most pro-business environment.""7 These reforms reduce litigation risk, limit shareholder activism, strengthen director protections, streamline governance, and provide tax clarity. A proposed constitutional amendment would also ban financial transaction taxes, creating a predictable, low-cost environment for public companies and market infrastructure.8

Initial Listing Standards

A. Domestic Issuers

Domestic issuers may qualify under one of two quantitative tests:9

1. Earnings Test

$10-12M in aggregate pre-tax earnings over three years, with minimum thresholds in recent years; or

2. Global Market Capitalization Test

Minimum $200M market value, with a bid price of $4.00 per share for 90 consecutive trading days.

Additional requirements include four Market Makers (unless the company meets certain income, equity, and market value requirements),10 and distribution criteria of 400 round-lot shareholders, 1.1M publicly held shares, and $40M public float.11 These thresholds broadly align with NYSE and Nasdaq's upper tiers, but notably exceed Nasdaq's lower-tier Capital Market.12

B. Quantitative Standards for Foreign Private Issuers (FPIs)

FPIs may qualify under the above domestic criteria, or TXSE's alternative listing standards,13 which mirror NYSE requirements for FPIs.14 Under the alternative standard, FPIs must maintain a broad, liquid market in their home country,15 and satisfy one of the following financial tests:16

1. Earnings Test

$100M aggregate pre-tax earnings over three years, with a minimum of $25M in each of the two most recent years.

2. Valuation / Revenue Test

Option 1: $500M in global market capitalization, $100M revenue in the most recent 12-month period, and $100M aggregate cash flow over three years, or

Option 2: $750M in global market capitalization with $75M revenue in the most recent year.

3. Affiliated Company Test

$500M global market cap with minimum 12-month operating history, and the parent or affiliate must be in good standing and retain control or be under common control of the entity.

In addition, FPIs must have four Market Makers (unless the company meets certain income, equity, and market value requirements),17 and meet the distribution criteria of: 5,000 round-lot shareholders, 2.5M publicly held shares, and market value of $100M ($60M for companies under the Affiliated Company Test).18

Key Considerations for Canadian Issuers

TXSE offers Canadian companies an alternative to traditional U.S. exchanges, but its listing standards are rigorous. As a single-tier exchange, TXSE's quantitative thresholds align with the upper tier of other U.S. exchanges and, unlike NYSE or Nasdaq, does not offer lower tiers for smaller issuers. Eligibility will depend on meeting these criteria, so early-stage issuers may need to scale before qualifying.

Cross-border compliance is another key consideration; companies must adhere to U.S. federal securities laws and Canadian regulations, including disclosure obligations under the Multi-Jurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS) where applicable. With TXSE expected to launch in late 2026, early engagement through the confidential pre-application process is recommended.

Next Steps

TXSE combines familiar financial tests and governance provisions while introducing unique elements like mandatory pre-application review and high, single-tier quantitative thresholds. Issuers should start by reviewing size, governance structure, and reporting capabilities against TXSE's standards, and compare scenarios such as dual-listing on TXSE versus NYSE, Nasdaq or over-the-counter alternatives. Early engagement can help position companies ahead of the exchange's launch.

An increase in auto sales

After two straight quarters of big declines in its core auto business, Tesla's auto revenue grew in Q3. This was likely because of U.S. customers rushing to buy EVs before the $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired at the end of September.

After a 13% drop in deliveries in both the first and second quarters, Tesla's deliveries rose by 7% in Q3. Model 3 and Model Y deliveries increased by 9%, while other models plunged by 30%.

Tesla's auto revenue rose by 6% to $21.2 billion in the quarter. However, within its auto revenue, its regulatory credits, which are pure gross margin, dropped by 44% to $417 million. This led to its profitability metrics falling despite the increase in auto sales.

Overall, Tesla's revenue climbed 12% to $28.1 billion. Its energy generation and storage revenue soared 44% to $3.4 billion, while its service revenue jumped 25% to nearly $3.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) plunged 31% to $0.50, missing the analyst consensus of $0.54, as compiled by LSEG. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), meanwhile, fell by 9% to $4.2 billion.

Tesla did, however, see a nice increase in free cash flow, as it reduced its capital expenditures (capex) in the quarter. Its operating cash flow was flattish at $6.2 billion, while its free cash flow climbed by 46% to $4 billion.

Near-term uncertainty, but big promise for the future

While Tesla noted it will be facing near-term uncertainty, it once again made big promises for the future. Musk was upbeat about the company soon achieving unsupervised self-driving (FSD) capabilities. He said that with just a software update, he could turn millions of cars into full self-driving cars. However, it is notable that the company subtly changed the language in its shareholder letter, saying that ""Every Tesla vehicle delivered today is designed for autonomy."" It has also recently changed the definition of FSD.

Given his confidence, Musk said that he would ramp up vehicle production, and that Tesla could be able to produce 3 million vehicles a year within the next two years. This will be to support its Cybercab ambitions, as well as the increase in demand it expects it would see from offering unsupervised FSD technology with its cars, which would allow people to do things like text and watch videos instead of having to focus on the road.

Musk was also upbeat about its Optimus robot, saying Tesla plans to unveil Optimus V3 early next year and begin production toward the end of 2026. He stated that the company is planning to produce a million Optimus robots annually in the future, even though manufacturing presents some difficulties.

Should investors buy or avoid the stock?

Tesla's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of over 188 based on 2026 analyst estimates, while its profitable auto peers -- like Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Stellantis -- typically trade at multiples of 10 or less. Even luxury automaker Ferrari trades at just 33 times 2026 EPS estimates.

At this point, most of Tesla's stock value comes down to whether Musk can deliver on FSD and his Optimus robots. Without FSD, its core auto business is likely to struggle in the near term with the end of federal tax credits and high tariffs, along with rising competition in the EV space. Notably, Musk has expressed his confidence in FSD for the past six years with little progress, and its supervised robotaxi pilot in Austin has run into issues, so you can decide for yourself whether to share his enthusiasm.

For me, Tesla is a stock to avoid at the moment.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/839561/gettyimages-1348349243.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 16:23:09.999671

Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe.
The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors.
The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast.","Connecticut, along with the rest of New England, has long recognized that its energy future lies in cleaning up the electricity sources in its power grid.

And since the 1990s, with the start of the effort to close the “sooty six” coal and oil plants, cleaning up the air for health and climate reasons has figured equally with saving money by using free renewable sources like sun and wind.

The Trump administration has now made that a lot harder, if not impossible, to do, leaving Connecticut and the entire region with the question: Now what?

Since his first day in office, Trump has set about eliminating future development of onshore and offshore wind on federal property, which effectively means all offshore wind, a form of renewable power Trump openly despises. So far, his administration has issued stop-work orders for two northeast offshore wind installations already under construction, including one for Connecticut. Each resumed construction after about a month, losing millions of dollars in the process.

Trump has also succeeded getting a law on the books to end the widely popular and effective federal tax credits for wind, solar and energy efficiency projects. The administration also threw its weight behind keeping old and dirty coal plants operating longer than previously planned, as well as subsidizing more coal mining. And it is ramping up oil and gas drilling, all in the name of an “energy emergency” that Trump claims exists, even though the country is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.

“Singling out and disfavoring renewable resources while many other resources continue to enjoy favorable tax treatment, including fossil resources — this is not leveling the playing field. This is definitely putting a finger on the scale to disadvantage clean renewable energy resources,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She called the end of the tax credit “really challenging,” noting the state had a pipeline of projects it had hoped to bring forward, and warned that power prices would likely increase.

“We are doing what we can within our state jurisdictional programs to try to fill in some of the gaps. Obviously, we can’t fill all the gaps,” Dykes said. The state is urging residents, businesses, governmental entities and energy developers to take advantage of the tax credits before many of them disappear at the end of the year. To that end, DEEP issued an expedited request for proposals for solar and onshore wind. Proposals were due Oct. 10. Energy efficiency, especially useful to lower income and environmental justice communities, may feel the impact most acutely.

But it is offshore wind and the massive amount of carbon-free power it can generate, that Connecticut, and really the entire Northeast, had been counting on.

DEEP must sort through all of this uncertainty as it devises its new Integrated Resource Plan, a 10-year look ahead at energy needs and how to meet them, in keeping with the energy and climate policies the state has in place.

But in addition to the federal government’s energy policies, DEEP now has to reckon with the administration’s tariffs, policies on imported critical minerals, supply chain concerns and environmental about-faces. And it risks the potential for retribution if the state defies Trump’s wishes on anything, not just climate policy.

“We are undertaking planning efforts that are intended to try to assess as best we can what some of the different future scenarios will look like in terms of electricity needs, but also climate planning, and to do our best to identify the types of investments that might make sense, on what time horizon, given the change in the federal landscape, but also demand growth and reliability needs and so on,” Dykes said.

Dan Dolan is also thinking about what to do now. He’s president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade organization that represents about 95% of the generating capacity in the region.

“Where we stand right now is this muddled middle period,” he said.

Demand isn’t rising quite as fast as anticipated due to the impacts of solar and energy efficiency on the grid. But there’s also uncertainty about whether that trend will continue without tax credits and whether planned large power source additions will come online on time or at all.

“In terms of new supply sources, I am not seeing meaningful, large-scale new developments happening anytime soon in the region,” Dolan said. “If demand continues to be more muted in its growth, we can handle that.“

But he said if demand does go up significantly, despite individual state commitments to transition from fossil fuel power sources to clean and renewable ones, the region might have to look at keeping older, dirtier power sources operating for longer than planned, and that might mean spending more than a little money to upgrade them.

“I’m seeing a lot of investors watching but staying on the sidelines for the moment,” Dolan said.

Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, is co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. He has been a member of the committee since entering the legislature in 2011, so he has seen the twists, turns and growing pains as the state endeavored to create and implement its first short- and long-term strategies toward renewable energy while addressing climate change, health of citizens and high energy rates.

“We had, in our procurement planning and our capacity analysis, obviously — in conjunction with (grid operator) ISO-New England — counted on the availability of renewable energy sources to meet our needs,” he said. With the federal government now undermining those supply plans, “That is now a crisis that might have been 10 years away. It is now moving closer and closer to being an actual, impending crisis.

“We’re really low on options, but renewables were a critical part of that picture going forward.”

After many years of delay, a transmission line for hydropower from Canada — the Northeast Clean Energy Connect, NECEC — is months from completion. The power is being purchased by Massachusetts, but it provides a relief valve for the entire New England grid. Breath-holding is underway that the Trump administration will not sabotage it, given the administration’s fraught relationship with Canada as well as the blue-state northeast.

If that and the two offshore wind projects under construction off New England are finished, Dykes said, it will add about 13% of supply.

But any offshore wind beyond that, including projects approved by the Biden administration? ‘Unlikely’ would be a generous assessment of its future.

How dead is offshore wind?

Offshore wind was the big prize. At the end of the Biden administration, 11 projects had been approved nationally that would have provided the power equivalent of nearly 10 Millstone power stations and gotten the U.S. about two-thirds of the way to the Biden goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.

Today, five are under construction. A sixth, South Fork Wind off the eastern tip of Long Island, is completed and began operating about a year ago. The remaining five have been stopped either at early stages or through efforts by the Trump administration to review or outright rescind already-issued federal permits. The administration ended all new lease-area designations and permits.

Of the two under construction that faced stop-work orders, one is Revolution Wind, a joint Connecticut and Rhode Island project that is already 80% complete. While it and the other project — New York’s Empire Wind — have restarted, it’s unclear what might happen to the other three. In the case of Revolution, a legal dispute is still underway.

“I think there’s no question that East Coast states, particularly from the mid-Atlantic up, have to continue to fight for offshore wind,” said Elizabeth Klein, who served as the final Biden administration director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, the entity within the Interior Department responsible for offshore wind.

“There’s no question that what the current administration is doing is damaging to the industry and causing a great deal of harm,” she said. “The looming question is whether or not these companies who are involved will be able to essentially wait it out and invest their time and resources in parts of developing offshore wind that aren’t directly about getting permits and approvals to move forward with new projects.”

Ørsted, the company developing Revolution Wind and other projects, declined to comment on the situation. Avangrid, the company developing Vineyard Wind 1, the only other New England project under construction, did not respond to inquiries.

Klein said the Trump administration claim that it was concerned about national security issues with Revolution Wind is “specious.” She said national security is reviewed in conjunction with several departments throughout every stage of the offshore wind process, beginning with the basic identification of offshore areas that might be suitable for leasing.

“All of those things are considered throughout the process, starting with where these sales first take place,” she said. “This is arbitrary and capricious decision-making. There’s no evidence that there’s something new or unusual or that had not been considered.”

Trump himself has circulated a host of falsehoods about offshore wind — that it causes cancer and kills an outsized number of birds and whales, and that it only runs some of the time. Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe. Onshore wind is far older.

A one-year assessment of South Fork Wind by its developer, Ørsted, showed the turbines operated every month of the year. The data, which came from U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration, EIA, showed some of South Fork’s highest outputs were during the winter, when the power is needed most, due to natural gas being used for heating as well electricity. The wind power can prevent electricity price spikes.

The company also found the turbine foundations were already operating as artificial reefs that supported marine life.

The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors. And since the region doesn’t have any fossil fuel resources, even with steep up-front costs, offshore wind is likely to quickly become cost effective, given the fuel is free.

A recent analysis by Politico of EIA data showed that adding wind and solar to the electricity mix tended to lower the cost of electricity, not increase it, as the Trump administration claims. The Politico analysis said: “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data.”

“Undermining viable sources of energy is inconsistent with the objective of addressing an energy ‘emergency’ and will instead exacerbate energy supply challenges in the Northeast,” said Peter Shattuck, a director at Power Advisory LLC., a joint Canada/U.S.-based energy consultant. Shattuck also is an energy and grid expert with long experience in New England.

He said that, in something of a tarnished silver lining, the Trump blockage will give long-term projects such as transmission extra time to plan. But trying to strategize through all the Trump executive orders, other policy changes and legal battles is bound to make projects more expensive.

“It will likely raise the risk profile and risk premiums that are included in projects,” he said.

“The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated. In our view, it’s holding back a huge source of power that is so desperately needed,” said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president of communications and external affairs for the educational nonprofit Oceantic, which supports marine renewable energy world-wide including offshore wind.

“The administration talks about an all-of-the-above energy strategy and unleashing American energy dominance. We advocate that offshore wind is a critical component to that strategy.” She said energy needs to be depoliticized so the market, not the government, can pick the winners and losers.

“They’re looking to take apart an entire industry that could support energy demand in the U.S., address national security issues actually, because there is nothing better from a national security perspective on energy supply than generating it yourself at home, here in the U.S.,” Klein said.

Those concerns are not lost on the region’s grid operator, ISO-New England, which released an uncharacteristically blunt warning a couple of days after work stopped on Revolution Wind.

“The ISO is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability. Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” the statement read. “Unpredictable risks and threats to resources —regardless of technology — that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” it continued.

The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast. The ISO has already said it expects demand to begin to increase after years of flat or even declining energy needs.

“I think in the short term we still expect to be OK, but it’s kind of in that longer-term and the uncertainty that’s brought into this that’s challenging from a grid planning standpoint,” said ISO spokesman Matt Kakley.

The ISO’s most recent estimates are that region’s annual electricity consumption will increase by about 11% over the next decade. On one hand, the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles and heat pumps could shrink that demand. On the other, their removal for solar systems and energy efficiency could increase it.

In addition to the offshore wind and the NECEC transmission line, the ISO is also expecting the six New England states to move ahead with their first joint development of transmission that, after more than a decade of delay, would finally get onshore wind from northern Maine onto the southern part of the New England grid.

Kakley said six proposals from four different developers were submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Now there is the concern that the need for any federal signoffs could mean further delay, or worse.

Kakley said the ISO always deals with uncertainty when predicting power needs in the face of the complexities of long-term power and transmission projects. “This is a different sort of uncertainty than what we’ve seen,” he said. “We’re really looking at what we can do to enhance our ability to forecast and synthesize all the different factors that are coming in – adding resources, taking resources out, and seeing what that does to the region’s risk profile.”

What about solar?

Solar’s outlook is a little squishier than offshore wind’s. Yes, the coveted 30% tax credits are slated to disappear — for purchased residential systems at the end of this year and in another year for leased and commercial ones.

But costs for solar have come down dramatically over time, making it one of the cheapest forms of power to purchase. It’s also the fastest to install. So it’s possible residential consumers and commercial investors will still consider it a cost effective option.

Another unknown factor is the effect of tariffs and other restrictions on imported components on that low price and availability, as well as to storage systems that can be paired with it.

New England has never been a hotbed for huge commercial installations the way the desert southwest and other parts of the country, with large sunny expanses, can be. But rooftop solar for homeowners and on municipal and commercial buildings still has huge potential in the region and can be extremely useful to grid reliability.

It is already more useful than the ISO ever imagined it would be. The ISO says it has prevented brownouts and worse on hot summer days with air conditioning cranked up around the region. It has sent spot market prices into negative territory, especially on sunny days when neither heat nor air conditioning is needed.

“I think there’s capital out there that’s willing to invest,” said DEEP Commissioner Dykes. “I think the question is, what’s the price of solar without federal support, and with tariffs, all these other things coming into play? How does that affect the cost benefit for investment, and how much can we bring those costs down?”

Dykes has a few ideas. One is to look into swapping out solar panels in older systems for new, more efficient panels as a means to increase power output. Another is to use — in her words — already disturbed sites, such as the site of a retired oil-fired generator, for grid-scale storage for excess solar power. Using a preexisting power site would mean there’s already connections to the distribution system.

The biggest open question for Connecticut is what might change in state policy to help make up for the lost tax credit. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority will be weighing that as part of its reconsideration of the rules for the solar program it established. That reconsideration was already planned and underway, with recommendations due in March.

Another policy aspect involves what the state might do legislatively. Unlike most of its neighbors, Connecticut has kept caps on the amount of solar allowed, only loosening some of them in the last few years.

It’s also an open question whether state money would be authorized to make up some of the tax credit shortfall, or whether the state might do as Canada already does and establish an infrastructure bank to leverage private and public money into the financing pipeline, or create a Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator like California recently enacted to access low-cost public financing for such projects as a way to save money overall. The northeast-based advocacy group Acadia Center is helping the six New England states explore financing models.

“My only priority for next session is to set the stage for some extension or enhancement of our solar incentives,” said energy co-chair Steinberg. “This is very important to me as the godfather of solar, as Katie Dykes once called me, and that will be very hard.

“Everybody says it’s over; federal government has killed solar, game over, there’s nothing Connecticut can do. I cannot accept that,” he said. “Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us. To abandon it and not offer any incentives, or to backtrack to the point where the incentives don’t stimulate actual implementation — shame on us.”

But there are other ways to indirectly reduce costs for solar; specifically by streamling permitting, the regulatory process and siting – soft costs, as they are sometimes called.

Massachusetts is already doing that.

“We’re going to have to throw everything we can at permitting, streamlining and reducing soft costs in order to support the affordability of more solar investment for grid-scale projects,” Dykes said.

Kat Burnham, senior principal at the consulting and policy group Advanced Energy United and the state lead for all three southern New England states, said Connecticut and other states need to step up and put some financial skin as well as policy in the game. She pointed to financial tools like the Green Bank.

“I think what’s important is to make sure that we’re looking at a range of different options and trying to find the right one that fits the particular need or situation,” she said. “What are the tools in our kit, and how do we use those so that we minimize our risk?”

She said there’s a cost to building things. And she said there’s “a cost to inaction … We can’t just sit on our hands and hope for the best.”

DEEP is also in the final throes of accepting bids for innovative energy efficiency and energy upgrade proposals designed to help lower energy bills.

In Massachusetts, for instance, all three major utilities — one of which is Eversource — have agreed to discount electric rates in the winter for people who use heat pumps. While they run on electricity, aside from being efficient, they free up other fuels like natural gas to run power plants. In Connecticut, DEEP is continuing with its focus of lowering the upfront installation costs for heat pumps.

Solutions

Barbara Kates-Garnick, a former Massachusetts energy official, now a professor of practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said the path forward she sees is bringing together utilities, regulators, policy makers, other stakeholders and system participants to explore some of the out-of-the-box solutions.

“The answers aren’t clear, but I think we have to look at how we regulate, what we regulate, and come to some conversations with the utilities so that we come to a bigger grand bargain,” she said.

She noted, however, the Biden idea of promoting clean energy by providing incentives, funding and jobs — especially in red states — “when push comes to shove, it didn’t work.”

Dykes is not ruling out increasing fossil fuel-run power as part of Connecticut’s solution to the Trump anti-renewables effort.

“It’s a possibility,” she said, noting that Lamont has talked about the need to be open to natural gas as part of a solution.

If the offshore wind and other projects do not come online, she said, “that will certainly put us into a very challenging place in terms of having an adequate reserve margin and ability to maintain reliability even under some normal weather conditions.

“In light of that, we have to consider what are the alternatives that make the most sense to ensure we can continue to have an affordable, reliable grid in the early 2030s, and natural gas is part of that. Retaining those oil units — is that a solution that we’ll have to rely on?” Dykes said.

Dolan of the Power Generators Association, while also advocating continued use of the region’s gas and oil fleet, doesn’t have specific facilities he’d like to see targeted for reinvestment.

“I think there needs to be a refocus around the meat and potatoes about what is operating today and making sure it continues to operate tomorrow. Now the replacement energy supplies are not coming or not coming anytime soon, and for these power plants to be able to continue operating and operating at higher capacity, reinvestment is going to be necessary,” Dolan said, taking a thinly-veiled swipe at Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which all plan to have net-zero grids in the next 20 to 25 years.

For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.

“The industry is going to weather this administration. Who knows what the next will bring,” she said. “But I think it won’t be the orderly advancement that it once could have been.”

Former BOEM Director Klein said she thinks it’s important for states to keep supporting the offshore wind projects that are underway.

“It’ll demonstrate to the project developers that there are important entities in the U.S. that are still supportive and want to find a path forward,” she said. “Folks aren’t building this for kicks, because it’s fun. This is about actual energy supply needs … and actually communities, when presented with alternatives, are likely to see that offshore wind is the best of the bunch.”

In the meantime, some of the wind focus may shift to Canada, where the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador are exploring the development of huge amounts of offshore and onshore wind. Whether New England will be able to access some of that is years and likely many diplomatic twists away.

The Trump administration’s pivot away from wind and solar in particular and back toward fossil fuels is already taking the U.S. globally out of step. Recent data from the European clean energy think tank, data and policy tracker Ember showed that worldwide, in the first six months of 2025, renewables overtook coal power for the first time. And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period. But while fossil fuel generation and its emissions dropped in China and India, the world’s most populated countries, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased in the U.S. Clean generation growth did not keep pace with demand growth in the U.S.

“For a bunch of largely economic reasons, we do still think that solar and wind are going to out-compete fossil fuels,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, though she admitted the Trump actions are slowing down their adoption.

But she wondered whether the industry would be able to pivot enough in the face of multiple challenges to keep investors confident enough to continue.

“That, I guess, is the big question mark,” she said.

Dykes sees the same challenge.

“Investors need to know that after a multiyear permitting process, when you have a project that’s 80% constructed, that you can bring it online, sell your power and get your money back,” she said. “And if we can’t guarantee that in the Northeast or in the U.S. anymore, I think that affects the investment climate for all types of resources at a time when we can least afford to increase investor perception of risk.”

The energy committee’s Steinberg added a warning. “That’s an excuse to be paralyzed. That’s an excuse to basically throw up our hands and say, ‘we just have to wait out the feds,’” he said. “That’s going to mean that the ramping up stage is going to be even more complicated on the other side, assuming there is another side.”",https://assets.hartfordbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Turbine_installation_underway_for_Revolution_Wind_opt-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 14:18:54.030824

BluWave-ai and Electricity Maps announced today a strategic partnership to eliminate data fragmentation and drive global decarbonization efforts across electric vehicle (EV) charging and energy storage optimization.

The partnership enables the suite of artificial intelligence software products from BluWave-ai, including EV Everywhere™ and Energy Storage Autopilot™, to scale deployment rapidly across new international markets by leveraging the standardized, high-resolution, and global grid data from Electricity Maps. BluWave-ai, as a pioneer in AI-driven energy optimization, has deep expertise backed by an intellectual property portfolio currently including 49 patent filings covering AI-based renewable energy and electric vehicle optimization.

From Fragmented Data to Optimized Action.

Across all electricity-intensive industries, companies face a major hurdle in acquiring and standardizing grid data which are inherently different at each utility. While integrating with a single grid is manageable, expanding solutions globally requires immense data preparation due to the vast array of incompatible formats and varying data maturities of grid operators worldwide. For global operators like BluWave-ai, which manage pools of distributed energy resources (DERs), storage and EV fleets across multiple regions, this complexity slowed down time to market and commissioning of AI products.

The need for a scalable, automated solution to manage this load intelligently is urgent with over 85 million EVs on the roads by the end of 2025. This will consume approximately 5.7 TWh of electricity per week, a demand comparable to approximately 143 large data centers over a week.

""By integrating the standardized API from Electricity Maps which provides access to real-time and historical grid signals across over 190 countries and zones, our AI models can adapt seamlessly without custom data preparation for each new market,"" said Thomas Triplet, VP of Technology at BluWave-ai, ""Our patented AI predictors and optimizers intake features from diverse data streams in a manner best suited to trigger high performance AI and generate our patent pending BluScore™ to forecast grid health in real-time. To enable fast time to operations, our team at BluWave-ai has built an interface to ingest from Electricity Maps activate our AI modes both for inference and continuous training. By setting up this system we have taken operationalization spanning multiple utilities from what could be multiple days or weeks to sub 1 hour.""

Real-Time Decarbonization and Optimization

The BluWave-ai software platform utilizes the data from Electricity Maps - including real-time grid signals for carbon intensity, power mix, and price information - to optimize customer operations, maximizing renewable energy utilization and lowering emissions globally.

Electricity Maps provides BluWave-ai with validated, standardized real-time data on grid carbon intensity and price signals, effectively acting as the crucial input layer. BluWave-ai's patented AI platform then executes complex, multi-variable optimization.

Specifically, the integration enhances BluWave-ai's product lines by allowing them to:

Dynamically calculating and scheduling energy assets (e.g., EVs, battery energy storage, and data centers) to maximize cost savings and minimize carbon intensity in real-time, a process that is unique to BluWave-ai's proprietary algorithms.

Creating a federated, virtual power plant capable of operating across diverse global markets without the costly, time-consuming effort of manual, one-off grid integrations.

""A big hurdle to deploying AI-driven optimization globally is data fragmentation. Grid data is messy, inconsistent, and often requires bespoke integration for every single geography to work consistently with AI models that require standardized input features,"" said Devashish Paul, CEO and Founder of BluWave-ai. ""With a European EV fleet projected to exceed 12 million and spread across dozens of distinct national power systems, the challenge of standardizing grid integration to manage this massive new load is paramount. This partnership with Electricity Maps provides the standardized, high-resolution foundation our AI platform needs to operate seamlessly across countries and electricity systems, dramatically reducing time to operationalize and revenue from customers.""

""Our mission is to empower everyone, from developers to global enterprise platforms, to build a truly sustainable future by providing transparent, actionable electricity data,"" said Olivier Corradi, CEO of Electricity Maps. ""By integrating our standardized, real-time grid signals, BluWave-ai's Energy Storage Autopilot and EV Everywhere platforms can make the most optimal decisions, ensuring that every charge and discharge cycle maximizes clean energy use and minimizes carbon emissions worldwide.""

Hydrogen made with renewable-powered electrolyzers was dependent on the tax credit for making economics work.
Last year, BNEF reported a 94% plunge in green hydrogen investments, while spending on electrolyzer deployment tanked by orders of magnitude.
The company was one of a half dozen to announce U.S. electrolyzer factories, banking on the $3 per kilogram tax credit to spur demand, as Latitude Media reported.
It is unclear if and when Topsoe will secure a final investment decision for its Richmond factory.","Danish manufacturer Topsoe has paused work on its $400 million electrolyzer factory in Richmond, Virginia, citing the poor demand for green hydrogen due to the early sunsetting of a federal tax credit that promised to jumpstart this sector.

Topsoe, which last year received $135 million in advanced manufacturing tax credits, has “paused” its work on the Virginia plant ahead of reaching a final investment decision, spokesperson Gabe Martinez confirmed; the company is evaluating market conditions, such as demand and supply chain constraints before deciding if and when to move forward.

“Looking ahead, increased demand will be critical as the hydrogen industry matures,” Martinez told Latitude Media. “Unlocking that demand will require strong policy support, infrastructure investments, and continued cost reductions as production scales.”

The firm’s decision echoes a move made earlier this year by the Norwegian Nel Hydrogen to cancel its planned electrolyzer factory in Michigan. Together, they underscore the risk a nascent cleantech sector faces when priorities change under a new administration.

Martin Tengler, head of BloombergNEF’s hydrogen research, told Latitude Media that he is “not surprised” by Topsoe’s pull-back: “If there is no demand for green hydrogen, then there’s no demand for electrolyzers, the machines used to produce green hydrogen.”

When President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, Tengler said, “everyone was super excited that the U.S. will have massive amounts of green hydrogen with this super generous tax credit, but then nothing happened.”

This is largely due to the Biden administration’s long delay in issuing the final 45V guidance, leaving it until just before leaving office. The months that the industry spent without clarity about what projects would be considered “green” and therefore eligible for the tax credits left many companies in limbo. And though the hydrogen sector mounted a largely successful lobbying effort this summer and ultimately came out ahead of wind and solar in the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the credit’s two-year sunset has nonetheless compromised the U.S.’ appeal as a place to do business.

Hydrogen made with renewable-powered electrolyzers was dependent on the tax credit for making economics work. Now, the U.S. market is primed for cheaper blue hydrogen made with natural gas equipped with carbon capture and storage, which retained tax credits under OBBB.

Last year, BNEF reported a 94% plunge in green hydrogen investments, while spending on electrolyzer deployment tanked by orders of magnitude.

The shift across the pond

Topsoe, operating in the U.S. since 1940, announced plans in 2023 to build the country’s first and largest solid oxide electrolyzer factory in Richmond, Virginia, a move welcomed by Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin and Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine. The company was one of a half dozen to announce U.S. electrolyzer factories, banking on the $3 per kilogram tax credit to spur demand, as Latitude Media reported.

Now Topsoe is shifting its focus to Europe, where it will launch a 500 MW factory in Denmark on October 30. Its first customer, Texas-based First Ammonia has already signed an agreement for a 5 MW electrolyzer. Martinez emphasized that the company is “optimistic about the market” despite the global slowdown at present.

It is unclear if and when Topsoe will secure a final investment decision for its Richmond factory. For now, it has paused work on site design, supplier arrangements and financing. The firm says it welcomes the extension of the clean hydrogen tax credit to 2027, “which is one of several important signals supporting the growth of clean hydrogen in the United States” — but notes that’s not the only factor driving their decision.

“Our decision to pause pre-Final Investment Decision activities in Virginia reflects broader global market conditions — including the pace of global demand development, tightening financial conditions, and supply chain complexity — not a single policy outcome,” Topsoe said.

It’s not just European companies reconsidering their U.S. plans. With an absence of green hydrogen demand and a glut of electrolyzers, U.S.-based manufacturers are also eyeing exports, mainly to Europe and the Middle East and to a lesser extent to Asia Pacific, said Tengler. “It is such a difficult environment for electrolyzer manufacturers everywhere, but especially now in the United States.”

That is certainly true of the 10 currently operating factories in the U.S. and three still under construction today tracked by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the Rhodium Group and MIT CEEPR. New York-based Plug Power, which runs three of those factories, exported most of its electrolyzers to Europe last year, according to Tengler.

The California-based EvoloH, unlike Topsoe, is forging ahead with a single production line of half a gigawatt of electrolyzers in 2028 at its Center of Excellence in Lowell, Massachusetts, northeast of Boston. EvoloH has a few domestic clients, but it also is scouting for clients in Europe and Asia — but is excluding China, which already is mass-producing its own alkaline electrolyzers.

“The absence of a clean hydrogen tax credit has cast a cloud over U.S. demand for green hydrogen, but fortunately our business model was not based on government subsidies,” Scott Blanchet, EvoloH chief operating officer, told Latitude.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-10-27T105009.276.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 14:07:29.327836

“Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,” American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) President Everett Kelley declared in a statement.

“It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship.”

For more than a month, Republicans have insisted on funding the government at current levels through Nov. 21 to allow time to negotiate longer-term spending.

However, Senate Democrats have blocked the so-called “clean” short-term spending bill a dozen times, instead demanding that Republicans make expensive concessions on healthcare policy in exchange for reopening the government.

Only three Democrat or Democrat-aligned senators have backed the House-passed stopgap measure: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and independent Angus King of Maine. Republicans need five more Democrats to flip and get the legislation past the 60-vote legislative filibuster.

“These are patriotic Americans – parents, caregivers, and veterans – forced to work without pay while struggling to cover rent, groceries, gas and medicine because of political disagreements in Washington. That is unacceptable,” Kelley stressed.

“Unfortunately, shutdowns have become a recurring tactic in Washington. But there is no ‘winning’ a government shutdown.”

At least 1.4 million government workers missed their full paycheck last week. According to federal law, public sector employees will receive back pay when the shutdown concludes. However, Kelley warned that many of his members are not prepared to go extended periods without compensation.

“When the folks who serve this country are standing in line for food banks after missing a second paycheck because of this shutdown, they aren’t looking for partisan spin,” he said. “They’re looking for the wages they earned. The fact that they’re being cheated out of it is a national disgrace.”

According to Aptera, there are over 50,000 reservations for this vehicle, which it plans to sell in four versions with up to 1,000 miles of range.","YouTuber Marques Brownlee drives the Aptera three-wheeler validation prototype, revealing many of its unique traits.

The vehicle in the video is very close to what Aptera intends to put into production starting next year.

This is clearly a vehicle designed for warmer climates, since it doesn't look like it would cope very well with ice and snow.

The Aptera three-wheeled solar-charging electric vehicle is what science fiction movies said cars would look like in 2025. It is so radically different from anything else on the road that even if it had four wheels, calling it a car wouldn’t do it justice. But it's been in the works for years, and we’re still not sure if it’s actually going to make production.

Yet Aptera says it's still in the game. And it lent one of its three-wheelers to someone outside the company to drive and document the experience. Marques Brownlee is that someone, and he made a video for his car channel called Auto Focus. He goes over the entire car, showing many details that we hadn’t had a good look at in Aptera’s official videos. It all seems to come together into a believable, production-ready package, even if it's not all final or functional yet.

Who knew that the way to open the doors and the cargo hatch in the back is to double-tap on specific parts of the body? I’m not sure how practical that is compared to a normal door handle, but it certainly adds to the futuristic aura that this vehicle has, as does the exposed forged carbon fiber that you see when opening it up.

And speaking of cargo room, even though the Aptera looks like it wouldn’t be that practical, it actually appears to be. Marques has no problem fitting in the trunk and, in fact, you could probably fit two Marqueses in there with some space to spare. There’s even an additional, deeper storage space in the trunk, which you access by lifting a little lid, and there are also tie-down points where you could fit a net to prevent stuff from rolling around while you drive.

Sitting in the driver’s seat, it immediately becomes obvious how few physical buttons there actually are in the Aptera. There are two of them on the steering wheel and one for the hazard lights, but that’s literally it. You control everything else, including the electric windows, through the touchscreen, which is the first time I’ve ever seen that in a vehicle. This will stay this way for production, as will most of the interior that you see in the video.

One less positive aspect of sitting in the three-wheeler is outward visibility. There’s a thick border where the part of the side window that opens meets the part that doesn’t, and that’s in your line of sight. This does seem to impair over-the-shoulder visibility, although this will vary depending on the driver’s height. That’s why Aptera put the feeds from the side cameras on screens right in front of the driver, to make it as easy as possible to see what’s around.

Driving the Aptera is more normal than you may think—the fact that it’s a three-wheeler isn’t really obvious until you encounter a pothole that you can’t avoid—but the visibility issue does become more apparent. The fact that the car doesn’t end where the body ends is also unusual and you have to get used to the fact that the wheels stick out when threading it through a narrow space.

Even though there is a lot of skepticism regarding this vehicle making production, Aptera still says it’s on track and has been posting regular updates. The fact that it has gotten this far may be surprising to some, but the road to the actual start of production is still uncertain. The company says it wants to start making this vehicle “as soon as possible.” It’s currently in the validation stage and the plan is to begin limited production in 2026 and then ramp up production through 2028.

According to Aptera, there are over 50,000 reservations for this vehicle, which it plans to sell in four versions with up to 1,000 miles of range. You will also be able to choose between two sizes of solar array, providing up to 22 or 40 miles of free range daily.

The launch version will have 400 miles of range and a target price of $40,000, while the lower-range base model, planned for future release, will have 250 miles of range and cost from around $28,000.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/Zn1Ole/s1/autofocus-aptera-drive.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 16:04:19.265111

Most significantly, the American Rescue Plan Act “enhanced” the premium tax credits, making them more generous and expanding eligibility by removing the 400 percent FPL subsidy cliff.
Unfortunately, despite a previous extension as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, these enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year.
The premium tax credits won’t go away entirely, but they would default back to their original inadequate levels.
In fact, in anticipation of the expiration of the enhanced tax credits, insurers are already promising enormous increases in premiums.","At the heart of the current federal budget standoff lies an esoteric but consequential policy choice: whether to extend the enhanced premium tax credits (EPTCs) that help millions afford health coverage. But what exactly are EPTCs, and what would letting them expire mean?

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace was set up to provide individuals the ability to purchase health insurance for themselves and their families. It was part of the ACA’s larger strategy to extend health insurance coverage to as many as possible: expand Medicaid eligibility, require employers of 50 or more to provide adequate and affordable coverage through employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), and provide an individual market option for those not eligible under other categories (e.g., independent contractors, self-employed workers, and employees of small businesses).

The ACA also made important changes to the way insurance companies were allowed to do business. They were no longer allowed to deny health insurance to individuals because of “preexisting conditions,” and they could not charge people more for having those conditions or for “lifestyle” factors like obesity. Of course, insurance companies only make money if they take in more than they pay out, and that is harder to do when they are required to cover everyone and to do so at the same price regardless of risk. So the ACA included a variety of sticks and carrots to encourage younger and relatively healthier people to obtain health insurance. This included the “individual mandate”—a tax imposed on individuals who did not purchase insurance coverage—and the “premium tax credits.”

The premium tax credits are meant to subsidize the cost of purchasing an insurance plan on the ACA marketplace. They are available to people who do not already have adequate and affordable health insurance coverage offered through their employer (whether or not the employer is subject to the mandate). They are fully refundable and in many cases can be claimed in advance and paid by the government directly to the insurer at the time of purchasing insurance on the marketplace. In theory, they should have made quality health insurance affordable for consumers and profitable for insurers to offer. However, things didn’t go as planned for the ACA.

The Supreme Court made the Medicaid expansion optional for states, and several states have refused to implement it. That means millions are trapped in the “Medicaid gap”: too poor to qualify for the ACA marketplace and not poor enough to qualify for legacy Medicaid.

The Supreme Court made the Medicaid expansion optional for states, and several states have refused to implement it. That means millions are trapped in the “Medicaid gap”: too poor to qualify for the ACA marketplace and not poor enough to qualify for legacy Medicaid. And those who did qualify for the marketplace in these states often found insurance too expensive to purchase even with the subsidy support. On top of this, Congress, as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, set the individual mandate penalty to $0, effectively ending it.

Meanwhile, the premium tax credits proved to be inadequate more generally. Individuals were expected to contribute to their premiums on a sliding scale according to their household income. For example, those between 100 and 133 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL) were expected to contribute 2.1 percent of their income to premiums each year. This percentage rose and the subsidy fell as income rose until the household reached 400 percent of the FPL, at which point the subsidy abruptly ended in a cliff.

There was no theory behind these numbers or this range. They were merely what could be offered given the politically feasible revenue structure available when the ACA was first passed. This meant that the marketplace was unaffordable for millions of American families—a problem that, when combined with the end of the individual mandate, threatened the health of the marketplace. When insurance becomes too expensive and there is no penalty for remaining uninsured, those who opt out tend to be younger and healthier, while those who stay enrolled are generally older or have greater health needs. Economists call this “adverse selection.” This dynamic has led some insurers to leave the marketplace and others to raise premiums to offset the higher costs of a poor “risk pool.”

When the Biden administration took office, it introduced a series of measures to strengthen and improve the ACA marketplace. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for example, addressed the long-standing “family glitch,” which had created problems in how employer-sponsored insurance affordability standards interacted with premium tax credit eligibility. Most significantly, the American Rescue Plan Act “enhanced” the premium tax credits, making them more generous and expanding eligibility by removing the 400 percent FPL subsidy cliff. Under these changes, families below 150 percent of the federal poverty line no longer have to contribute anything toward premiums for a benchmark silver plan, and families at higher income levels pay substantially less than they would have before.

The result has been tens of millions of new marketplace users, over 4 million people no longer uninsured, a healthier marketplace with more options, and many millions of dollars in savings for millions of American families. Sounds good, right? Unfortunately, despite a previous extension as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, these enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year. As with many initiatives passed through budget reconciliation, the EPTCs were not made permanent. And the most recent reconciliation package did not include an extension of the EPTCs, leaving their future uncertain. So what will happen if there isn’t a deal before then?

The premium tax credits won’t go away entirely, but they would default back to their original inadequate levels. Some families will no longer be eligible for the tax credits at all. Those still eligible will see their total subsidy drop considerably. Experts expect almost 5 million people to lose their health insurance as a result. This will hit rural communities and people in states, mostly in the South, that have not expanded Medicaid particularly hard. Millions more will only be able to maintain health insurance coverage by downgrading their plan to one with higher deductibles and more limited coverage, a recipe for more medical debt in a country that already has a medical debt crisis. The marketplace will become more expensive, not just because of the lost subsidies but because of another factor: Remember adverse selection and the risk pools? The first people to leave will be relatively younger and healthier. Those who stay behind will be relatively sick. As a result, insurers will have to raise their premiums because the average cost of insuring sicker people is higher (which can set off further cycles of pool shrinking and cost increases). In fact, in anticipation of the expiration of the enhanced tax credits, insurers are already promising enormous increases in premiums. And others may throw in the towel altogether.

So there will be fewer, more expensive options. And there will be less aid to cover these more expensive options . . . a “double whammy” that will subject millions of families to truly shocking costs at a time when they are already struggling with rising prices.

So there will be fewer, more expensive options.

The “Charge as you drive” project, spearheaded by a consortium, including VINCI Autoroutes, Electreon, VINCI Construction, Gustave Eiffel University, and Hutchinson, is testing a system that allows electric vehicles, from heavy-duty trucks to passenger cars, to recharge directly from the road while driving.

The core promise of this Electric Road System (ERS) could drastically reduce the required size of vehicle batteries. Smaller batteries mean vehicles that are less expensive, lighter, and more energy-efficient. As a result, it increases cargo capacity and eliminates downtime for stationary charging. This also brings substantial environmental benefits, reducing the demand for raw materials and lowering the carbon footprint associated with battery manufacturing.

Charge As You Drive

Following extensive laboratory tests and mechanical durability trials, induction coils were installed over 1.5 km of the A10 roadway. Now, prototype vehicles, including a truck, utility vehicle, car, and bus, are driving on the motorway under real traffic conditions.

The initial findings are highly encouraging. Three laboratories from Gustave Eiffel University conducted on-site test campaigns. They reported that “the installed inductive system can safely deliver peak power above 300 kW and average power above 200 kW under optimal steady-state conditions.”

Consortium leaders see this as a pivotal validation of the technology.

“The initial results of the ongoing trials on a section of the A10 motorway confirm the findings of previous studies,” Nicolas Notebaert, CEO of VINCI Concessions and President of VINCI Autoroutes, said. “Deploying this technology on France’s main road networks, in addition to charging stations, will further accelerate the electrification of heavy-vehicle fleets—and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the freight and logistics sector, which alone accounts for more than 16% of the country’s total emissions.”

Oren Ezer, Electreon’s CEO, emphasized the technological achievement. “This is a pivotal moment in the global development of electric roads,” he said. “The system’s outstanding performance, demonstrated through the project and verified by independent laboratories in France, shows that our technology is the only one capable of delivering dynamic vehicle charging with such power and reliability—without any competitors able to match its standard.”",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-43.png,N,,2025-10-27 14:06:39.833885

Energy department DESNZ has confirmed £900m will be made available to fixed-bottom wind projects, with a further £180m for floating schemes ahead of a bidding window next month.
“It’s important that this allocation round supports further development of floating wind technology.
“Every gigawatt of new offshore wind capacity we install boosts our economy by £2-3bn, and with the right level of support we can more than double the number of offshore wind jobs from 40,000 now to 95,000 by 2030.
“It’s critical that the government continues to work closely with the sector to maintain ambition for the upcoming auction rounds for offshore wind and other technologies.”","Industry has urged the UK government to reconsider the budget made available to offshore wind projects in the AR7 Contracts for Difference auction.

It follows today’s earlier announcement that London will allocate £1.08bn across fixed-bottom and floating technologies.

Trade association RenewableUK warned that the figure “will not maximise investment” into new projects and is likely to cover only about a quarter of the 20GW of eligible capacity for this year’s tender.

Energy department DESNZ has confirmed £900m will be made available to fixed-bottom wind projects, with a further £180m for floating schemes ahead of a bidding window next month.

RUK executive director of policy and engagement Ana Musat said: “Given the amount of competition in this year’s auction, we expect to see competitively-priced bids, so the government should adjust the budget to maximise procurement, which could attract up to £53bn in private investment in the UK economy.

“It’s important that this allocation round supports further development of floating wind technology. Early investment in these demonstration-scale projects will help build up supply chains and bring down costs to enable us to scale up in the next decade.

“Every gigawatt of new offshore wind capacity we install boosts our economy by £2-3bn, and with the right level of support we can more than double the number of offshore wind jobs from 40,000 now to 95,000 by 2030.

“This would strengthen our energy security, drive economic growth and reduce our exposure to volatile gas prices.”

The trade group added an “ambitious pipeline” of renewable energy projects is “crucial for triggering large-scale private investment” in offshore wind supply chains and manufacturing.

Scottish Renewables chief executive Claire Mack also urged the government to “carefully consider” the budget to reassure investors of its commitment to wind farms off Scotland.

“This year’s auction is a pivotal moment to inject fresh momentum into Scotland’s offshore wind sector and build on the strategic investments made in our supply chain to date,” Mack said.

“An auction that fails to deliver for Scotland will seriously undermine our ability to maintain and secure the growth that is essential for energy security.

“A record amount of capacity is eligible for AR7 and this fierce competition will ensure new capacity is secured at the best possible value to consumers, despite increasing global cost pressures.

“The budget announced today would significantly restrict that value from reaching consumers and communities. We urge careful consideration to ensure the final budget best delivers on our long-term national interests.

“Given no contracts have been awarded to new fixed-bottom projects in Scotland since 2022, the industry needs to be reassured that the UK government remains committed to continued deployment of Scottish fixed and floating offshore wind projects.

“This will be critical for driving economic prosperity across all corners of the country, including the North East of Scotland.”

The UK government’s head of Clean Power 2030 Chris Stark said bids for fixed-bottom wind farms will “by design” likely exceed the budget limit, noting London’s new ability in this year’s auction to contract more offshore wind generation later in the process by adjusting the budget if it sees value for money.

“For the first time, we will be able to ‘see’ the bid stack (but not the bidders) beyond the agreed budget and make informed decisions to contract for more offshore wind capacity at a price that offers real value to consumers,” Stark stated.

Energy UK’s director of policy and advocacy Adam Berman said the AR7 budget is a “step in the right direction” towards a secure UK energy system with offshore wind as the backbone of the UK’s renewables capacity.

“It’s right that the government is focused on procuring renewables projects that represent best value for money,"" Berman added. ""This is only the start of the auction process, and expanding the budget remains a possibility if it can represent strong value to consumers and the broader economy.

“Today’s budget announcement will provide investors with the confidence needed to continue investing millions of pounds every day to secure our country’s energy future.

One notable example of green employment is the Misa Campus Complex, a newly licensed investment project located in Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone, implemented by Kotia SaiGon Joint Stock Company. With a total investment of 600 billion VND (22.8 million USD), the project focuses on software production, IT services, and technology transfer consulting — all key sectors of the green economy.

Company Director Nguyen Thi Ngoan shared that green jobs at the company go beyond creating a smoke-free, low-emission workspace. They also foster open, innovative environments that require employees to master technology and integrate artificial intelligence into work processes. The company has about 2,000 staff members, mainly specialising in implementing accounting, education management, and operations software.

In Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone, one of the pioneers in transforming traditional industrial models towards greener practices, efforts are underway to attract technology enterprises and develop high-quality human resources training services. The goal is to establish innovation centres contributing to the development of a smart hub in the southern part of the city.

At Tan Tao Industrial Park, a rooftop solar power company is currently recruiting design engineers, installation technicians, and system operation consultants. A representative from its HR department said this sector directly contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting ecosystems, and adapting to climate change.

Alongside manufacturing, clean energy and green transport are also generating new workforce demands. According to the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Home Affairs, the demand for labour in renewable energy and electric vehicles is expected to grow by 12–15% annually through 2030. These sectors are essential for the city’s goal of converting 100% of public transport vehicles to electric power by 2030, contributing to the national commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The International Labour Organisation (ILO) also reports a rapid increase in green jobs across industries such as renewable energy, waste management and recycling, sustainable construction, and environmental protection. As more businesses adopt cleaner production methods and eco-friendly technologies, the demand for “green” human resources continues to rise.

Green jobs as a driver of growth

According to Nguyen Thi Thu Trang, Brand Director of Manpower Viet Nam, a recruitment and HR consultancy, the green transition is projected to create around 30 million jobs globally by 2030, fundamentally reshaping the labour market. Green jobs are emerging across all industries — from sustainable materials engineering and electric vehicle charging technicians to smart transport system operators and urban agriculture experts.

However, the rising demand comes with significant challenges regarding workforce quality. “Up to 75% of employers struggle to find skilled workers, and 94% of businesses report difficulty recruiting candidates who meet ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) standards,” Trang noted.

To ensure green jobs become a true driver of development, workers must take responsibility for upskilling and learning new competencies, while businesses and authorities must play an active role in enabling this transition. Employers need to invest in systematic internal training, and educational institutions should align their programmes with green and sustainable development goals.

As the country’s economic powerhouse, Ho Chi Minh City is entering a new stage of development centred on innovation and green growth. In this context, green jobs are no longer a passing trend but a fundamental component of the city’s sustainable development strategy. From industrial parks undergoing transformation and booming tech enterprises to policies promoting clean energy transition, a vibrant green employment ecosystem is clearly taking shape.

Therefore, building a comprehensive training system and forecasting labour market demands aligned with green industries is imperative. This requires close coordination between state agencies, vocational education systems, and enterprises to ensure a skilled workforce and create greater development opportunities for workers.",https://en-cdn.nhandan.vn/images/3c6b1d7d6cd77f0dc549536a41e2cb9b45a71e1dbdb5406c25f1d8c9a6d0e61cc0308870180c38777f2c575365c82f066ae70becd9f49b834a8b9195e077c25b/viec1.jpg.webp,N,,2025-10-27 16:23:41.095718

The retail price of electricity for residential customers was up 6.1% in August over the same month last year, reaching an average of 17.62 cents/kWh, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s monthly update on electricity released Friday.

Total net generation and retail sales were down slightly, by 0.8% and 0.5% respectively, which experts attributed to a mild summer in much of the eastern part of the country. Nationally, there were 9.1% fewer cooling days this August compared to August 2024, though parts of the West saw between 5% and 50% more.

Natural gas prices were up 47.4% to just over $3/MMBtu, per Henry Hub, and natural gas consumption fell 5.6%.

Dive Insight:

Aaron Denman, who heads Bain & Company’s Americas utilities and renewables practice, said the reasons behind the rise in prices are complicated and nuanced, and vary depending on region.

“I think if you look at aggregate headline numbers, it’s hard to blame data centers for much of the increase, and I think part of that is just because it’s still such a small percentage of the overall load,” Denman said. “But I think when you get into specific regions, they’re so large, they’re so meaningful, that you can start to see some of that impact.”

He said Bain’s projections put data centers at about 40% to 60% of new load growth in the coming years, with manufacturing and electrification making up most of the remainder. He said the longterm fundamentals remain strong for load growth, despite some recent negative economic data. U.S. factory activity shrank in September for a seventh consecutive month, according to Bloomberg.

“This [much] load growth, this fast, is going to put upward pressure on residential prices,” Denman said. “We’re going to need to see creative solutions to minimize the impact on particularly residential customers.”

Impacts to residential customers are fast becoming a political concern among constituents who were promised by President Donald Trump during his campaign that he would cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months, said Heather Reams, president and CEO of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, which describes itself as a right-of center non-profit.

She said the EIA data confirms what she has been hearing from voters and politicians alike.

“This isn’t a myth or fake news ... prices are indeed going up, and voters at some point are going to be asking, ‘Who’s responsible for this?’” Reams said.

Reams said permitting reform is desperately needed, but Republicans, in particular, are hesitant to take strong positions without a signal from the White House.

“The president really should be weighing in here if he wants to see things developed, built, meeting the challenges,” she said.

For Jorge Vargas, co-founder and CEO of solar developer Aspen Power, the EIA’s data confirms that the Trump administration’s actions targeting renewable energy are effecting prices. He pointed out that prices were up though less electricity was being generated and sold.

“I hate to be right about this, but it’s like they’re curtailing generation at a time where there’s a lot of demand, and consumers and businesses are going to be the ones who pay for this,” he said.

Vargas added that many other factors, including an aging grid and insufficient transmission, also play a role. He said the U.S. needs a predictable regulatory landscape and a diversified energy system to keep electricity affordable and reliable.

“These are 30-year assets,” he said. “These are critical infrastructure assets that should have a very stable regulatory framework governing them — unfortunately it isn’t.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Ad-ivOzMYw-VmqJ1hqxIrgpdRN5Qbft-Vik12Y_A568/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9wb3dlcl9saW5lX2hvdXN0b24uanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-27 13:09:02.827868

The rapid rise in electricity demand, following decades of stagnation, will challenge utilities in a few ways, according to Morningstar.
Uncertainty around needed data center capacity “makes it challenging for utilities to accurately forecast future power demand and the required investment,” according to the report.
“Utilities are increasingly looking to private capital to fill funding gaps,” while increased ratepayer-funded investments lead to regulatory lag.","U.S. electric utilities are entering a five-year capital expenditure “super-cycle” as they build out transmission and generation networks to meet new demand from data centers, Morningstar DBRS said in a Monday research note.

“Investment in electricity infrastructure is projected to be $1.4 trillion from 2025 to 2030, double the amount invested in the prior 10 years,” the firm said. And based on data from the North American Electric Reliability Corp., Morningstar said many regions can expect load growth to increase from previously estimated 6.1% to around 11.6% over the next decade.

“The challenges posed by the rapid buildout of data centers are overlaid on existing concerns for most utilities, including decarbonization and guaranteeing the reliability of grid infrastructure while increasing the contribution of renewable power,” Morningstar said. “The projected surge in demand provides opportunities for utilities that must be counterbalanced with structural changes and regulatory support for utilities and rate payers.”

“We anticipate that regulated utilities with supportive regulatory commissions, solid credit ratings, and access to capital markets will deploy the needed capex to take advantage of the data center boom,” Bukola Folashakin, Morningstar assistant vice president of corporate ratings, said in a statement. “We expect this capex investment in turn to make such utility locations attractive for more data center construction, potentially creating a cycle of increased revenue for as long as data centers remain economically viable.”

Some states — Morningstar named California, Texas, and Louisiana — will see elevated risks of resource inadequacy next year that “in extreme conditions, could trigger electricity shortfalls,” according to the note.

Morningstar’s analysis mirror’s recent capital expenditure estimates from the Edison Electric Institute, which expects U.S electricity generation to grow “for the foreseeable future.” The group, which represents investor-owned utilities, said generation rose 3% in 2024 and generation investments as a share of the industry’s total capital expenditures have risen for four straight years.

The rapid rise in electricity demand, following decades of stagnation, will challenge utilities in a few ways, according to Morningstar.

Uncertainty around needed data center capacity “makes it challenging for utilities to accurately forecast future power demand and the required investment,” according to the report. And those data centers bring demand surges that are driving “higher tolls for other customer segments,” which “will be exacerbated as more data centers become operational.”

Meeting the demand requires massive utility investment but “traditional funding sources are inadequate to meet future investment needs,” Morningstar said. “Utilities are increasingly looking to private capital to fill funding gaps,” while increased ratepayer-funded investments lead to regulatory lag.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/394xNrqpS7J8fSDfaMxdYfQujziRSKf4QV8geqE2rIk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS81MzEwNjc4MDM2MV80YWRmMzMxMDFmX2suanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-27 14:07:05.791449

Affordable coverage keeps people healthy, keeps workers on the job, and keeps hospitals financially stable.
Congress should act now — not next year or next month — to make these tax credits permanent and protect affordable health care for Michigan families.
You can help protect affordable health care by contacting your lawmakers today.","For millions of Michiganders, affordable health insurance isn’t just a policy issue. It’s peace of mind. It’s knowing that an unexpected illness won’t mean financial ruin, and that parents can take their kids to the doctor without worrying about the bill.

But that security is at risk. The enhanced premium tax credits, which have made coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) affordable for families, small business owners and individuals, are at risk of vanishing without action from Congress.

If these enhancements are allowed to lapse, thousands of Michigan families could see their monthly premiums skyrocket, increasing by hundreds of dollars per month. That’s not just a bureaucratic detail buried in the federal budget. It’s a kitchen-table crisis that will hit real people across Michigan.

The premium tax credit (PTC) enhancements were first expanded under the American Rescue Plan and later extended through the Inflation Reduction Act. They capped what families pay for coverage as a percentage of income, dramatically reducing costs for many. For example, a family of four earning $65,000 annually would see their annual premiums increase by 208% on average if these credits are allowed to expire. For older adults, self-employed workers and families already stretched thin by rising costs for housing, food and prescriptions, that’s simply unaffordable.

The result would be devastating. Families would drop their health insurance altogether, hospitals and clinics would see more uncompensated care, and communities would face the ripple effects of poorer health outcomes and increased financial stress. At a time when Michigan’s health care system is already under strain from workforce shortages, inflation and cuts to Medicaid, allowing premiums to spike would be a serious step backward.

We’ve seen what happens when coverage becomes unaffordable. Before the ACA and these enhanced tax credits, too many people were forced to choose between paying their rent and paying their premiums. The coverage gap widened, emergency rooms filled with preventable crises and uncompensated care costs rose.

For Michigan’s small businesses, this issue goes beyond compassion. It’s about competitiveness. When health coverage becomes unaffordable, employees lose access to care, productivity drops and absenteeism rises. Workers who skip routine care or delay treatment for chronic conditions are more likely to miss work or leave the workforce entirely. The tax credits have helped small business owners attract and retain employees by keeping coverage affordable and predictable.

Losing these tax credits will ultimately drive up costs that employers, hospitals and taxpayers will pay.

In Michigan, state leaders are already stepping up to defend these critical protections. Senate Resolution 81, sponsored by Sen. Kevin Hertel, urges Congress and the President to permanently extend the enhanced tax credits, recognizing that affordable coverage isn't just about health, it's about economic stability, workforce strength, and community well-being.

Maintaining these tax credits isn’t about politics. It’s about priorities. Every lawmaker who claims to care about working families, small businesses, and economic stability should view this as common sense. Affordable coverage keeps people healthy, keeps workers on the job, and keeps hospitals financially stable. It also ensures that people can access preventive care before minor problems become costly emergencies.

The enhanced premium tax credits are among the most effective bipartisan tools we have to make health care accessible. Allowing them to expire would undo years of progress, widen health disparities, and increase costs for everyone. Congress should act now — not next year or next month — to make these tax credits permanent and protect affordable health care for Michigan families.

Health care coverage is a lifeline. No one should have to lose it because of inaction in Washington. Michigan’s families and businesses deserve stability, not uncertainty. We must continue to build on what works and not tear it down.

These measures will apply to projects with a maximum generation capacity of 50MW, reflecting the current scale of community energy initiatives.","Local communities are to get new opportunities to benefit from renewable energy developments under a pilot scheme announced by the Scottish Government.

Community groups, from South Lanarkshire to the Highlands, will be given the chance to lease one of 10 publicly-owned Forestry Land and Scotland (FLS) sites with windfarms as they approach repowering.

The pilot, which makes changes to the Community Asset Transfer Scheme (CATS), will provide a protected window for local groups to make an asset transfer request to lease FLS sites to extend the operational life of the windfarms.

The new approach, developed with FLS, will help strengthen the community asset transfer process which enables communities to request to buy or lease publicly owned land they feel they could make better use of.

Other changes to CATS will see community groups given:

advance notification of upcoming lease opportunities, so they have time to prepare asset transfer requests before sites go to market

dedicated guidance for repowering projects, including support on financing projects, evaluation and governance

targeted support through the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES), including help to develop proposals

Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said:

“Ownership and control of land is a powerful tool for communities to drive change and can help to develop local economies, provide activities and services, and boost community identity.

“These new measures will make it easier for groups across Scotland to reap the rewards from renewable energy projects on Forestry Land Scotland sites with the potential to deliver real benefits to a local area.

“It is yet another way that we are ensuring that communities can benefit from Scotland’s transition to renewable energy and that we are helping provide a just transition to net zero for people across the country.”

Community Energy Scotland CEO Zoe Holliday said:

""We have seen time and time again the transformation impact of land ownership and ownership of energy assets on communities across Scotland.

""Right now, repowering of private developments represents one of the biggest opportunities to upscale the community energy sector at pace and meet the Scottish Government's community energy targets; community energy groups are increasingly ambitious but gaining grid access continues to be a challenge, which is why taking on existing sites has so much potential.

""Today's announcement is a promising first step by the Scottish Government in starting to open up the public estate for large community energy projects and we look forward to working with them to continue to unlock opportunities for the community energy sector going forward.""

BluWave-ai and Electricity Maps announced today a strategic partnership to eliminate data fragmentation and drive global decarbonization efforts across electric vehicle (EV) charging and energy storage optimization.

The partnership enables the suite of artificial intelligence software products from BluWave-ai, including EV Everywhere™ and Energy Storage Autopilot™, to scale deployment rapidly across new international markets by leveraging the standardized, high-resolution, and global grid data from Electricity Maps. BluWave-ai, as a pioneer in AI-driven energy optimization, has deep expertise backed by an intellectual property portfolio currently including 49 patent filings covering AI-based renewable energy and electric vehicle optimization.

From Fragmented Data to Optimized Action.

Across all electricity-intensive industries, companies face a major hurdle in acquiring and standardizing grid data which are inherently different at each utility. While integrating with a single grid is manageable, expanding solutions globally requires immense data preparation due to the vast array of incompatible formats and varying data maturities of grid operators worldwide. For global operators like BluWave-ai, which manage pools of distributed energy resources (DERs), storage and EV fleets across multiple regions, this complexity slowed down time to market and commissioning of AI products.

The need for a scalable, automated solution to manage this load intelligently is urgent with over 85 million EVs on the roads by the end of 2025. This will consume approximately 5.7 TWh of electricity per week, a demand comparable to approximately 143 large data centers over a week.

""By integrating the standardized API from Electricity Maps which provides access to real-time and historical grid signals across over 190 countries and zones, our AI models can adapt seamlessly without custom data preparation for each new market,"" said Thomas Triplet, VP of Technology at BluWave-ai, ""Our patented AI predictors and optimizers intake features from diverse data streams in a manner best suited to trigger high performance AI and generate our patent pending BluScore™ to forecast grid health in real-time. To enable fast time to operations, our team at BluWave-ai has built an interface to ingest from Electricity Maps activate our AI modes both for inference and continuous training. By setting up this system we have taken operationalization spanning multiple utilities from what could be multiple days or weeks to sub 1 hour.""

Real-Time Decarbonization and Optimization

The BluWave-ai software platform utilizes the data from Electricity Maps - including real-time grid signals for carbon intensity, power mix, and price information - to optimize customer operations, maximizing renewable energy utilization and lowering emissions globally.

Electricity Maps provides BluWave-ai with validated, standardized real-time data on grid carbon intensity and price signals, effectively acting as the crucial input layer. BluWave-ai's patented AI platform then executes complex, multi-variable optimization.

Specifically, the integration enhances BluWave-ai's product lines by allowing them to:

Dynamically calculating and scheduling energy assets (e.g., EVs, battery energy storage, and data centers) to maximize cost savings and minimize carbon intensity in real-time, a process that is unique to BluWave-ai's proprietary algorithms.

Creating a federated, virtual power plant capable of operating across diverse global markets without the costly, time-consuming effort of manual, one-off grid integrations.

""A big hurdle to deploying AI-driven optimization globally is data fragmentation. Grid data is messy, inconsistent, and often requires bespoke integration for every single geography to work consistently with AI models that require standardized input features,"" said Devashish Paul, CEO and Founder of BluWave-ai. ""With a European EV fleet projected to exceed 12 million and spread across dozens of distinct national power systems, the challenge of standardizing grid integration to manage this massive new load is paramount. This partnership with Electricity Maps provides the standardized, high-resolution foundation our AI platform needs to operate seamlessly across countries and electricity systems, dramatically reducing time to operationalize and revenue from customers.""

""Our mission is to empower everyone, from developers to global enterprise platforms, to build a truly sustainable future by providing transparent, actionable electricity data,"" said Olivier Corradi, CEO of Electricity Maps. ""By integrating our standardized, real-time grid signals, BluWave-ai's Energy Storage Autopilot and EV Everywhere platforms can make the most optimal decisions, ensuring that every charge and discharge cycle maximizes clean energy use and minimizes carbon emissions worldwide.""

The natural gas industry has been telling the public that domestic natural gas production will continue to rise dramatically through mid-century.
That would produce a double squeeze on natural gas supplies as LNG exports continue rise in the face of falling domestic natural gas production leaving less for U.S. natural gas consumers.","The noticeable upward tilt in graphs of the U.S. natural gas price since April 2024 is likely a hint of things to come for U.S. consumers of energy. That's because record amounts of U.S. natural gas are now being sent abroad in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). And much more export capacity is planned. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that U.S. LNG export capacity will double by 2029. That's all gas that cannot be delivered to American users.

I have written about these trends (see here, here, here and here) and predicted they would mean considerably higher heating and electricity costs for Americans and much higher costs for American-based chemical manufacturers; for industries that rely on natural gas for process heat in the manufacture of steel and other metals, concrete, and glass; and for farmers who use natural gas to dry crops.

There's been a lot of talk about U.S. ""energy dominance"" by which the current administration means policies that maximize production, maximize exports, and yet somehow ""reduce energy costs"" at the same time. It's the ""reduce energy costs"" part that is now running into trouble.

A central cause of rising U.S. natural gas consumption (and ultimately prices) is the vast expansion of natural gas-fired power plants by American utility companies. From 2001 through 2024 electricity generated by natural gas has almost tripled while coal-generated electricity has declined dramatically and nuclear and hydroelectric generation have plateaued. Renewables (not including hydroelectric) grew 10-fold in that period, now nearly matching nuclear in percentage terms, nuclear at 18 percent and renewables at 17 percent. But, today natural gas is by far the leading fuel for electricity generation in the United States providing 43 percent of the country's electricity.

Cheap natural gas provided by the so-called ""shale revolution"" in the United States that began in the late 2000s has also prompted considerable expansion of the chemical industry which uses natural gas to make agricultural chemicals (especially fertilizers), methanol, and chemicals such as ethylene and propylene used to produce plastics. Related: Heat Pumps Face Their Toughest Test Yet

And, of course, Americans continue to use copious amounts of natural gas to heat their homes and businesses.

All that rising consumption spells trouble for American consumers when it comes to energy costs. The natural gas industry has been telling the public that domestic natural gas production will continue to rise dramatically through mid-century. But independent analysis based on the actual performance of gas wells suggests that production will plateau and then decline in the not-too-distant future. That would produce a double squeeze on natural gas supplies as LNG exports continue rise in the face of falling domestic natural gas production leaving less for U.S. natural gas consumers.

When the natural gas industry sold the story of endless abundance in order to get the U.S. Department of Energy to allow expansion of natural gas exports, it knew that such a move would increasingly link U.S. domestic prices to the much higher global prices. In fairness, the industry was simply asking for what had been granted to almost all other American industries, namely, the right to sell products to the highest bidders no matter where they may be.

In an age of increasing focus on the importance of domestic production of strategic resources, the U.S. government may yet come to regret its decision to commit so much of America's natural gas resources to other countries. Will there come a day when the anger of American consumers over high energy costs due to rising natural gas prices causes the government to force LNG exporters to abrogate their export contracts and keep that gas in America for consumption by American households and American businesses? The clock is now ticking.

Nissan said in a statement: “Nissan has formed a pool with BYD for its CO2 fleet emissions in Europe for the 2025 calendar year.
But under the car pooling arrangement, car manufacturers can pay electric car companies to use their zero emissions record to average out the pollution from sales of their combustion engine cars to avoid fines.
The industry in the past has said the 2025 emissions targets could have led to as much as €15bn (£13.03bn) in fines.
The latest car pooling agreement, confirmed by Nissan, mirrors that of other companies who have teamed up with other big name electric car brands including Tesla and Polestar.","The Japanese carmaker Nissan is to team up with its Chinese electric vehicle rival BYD in an attempt to offset their carbon emissions and avoid EU penalties for 2025, it has confirmed.

It is part of a wider offsetting scheme the EU has sanctioned for the car industry that could help manufacturers of combustion engine cars head off an estimated £13bn in fines.

Nissan said in a statement: “Nissan has formed a pool with BYD for its CO2 fleet emissions in Europe for the 2025 calendar year. The scope of the agreement covers passenger vehicles within EU markets and will contribute to Nissan’s commitment towards zero emissions in a sustainable way, while continuing to support the EU’s 2050 decarbonisation target.”

It added that it had entered into the agreement to “ensure the business is better able to comply with EU regulations and continue the transition towards our own goal of zero emissions”.

Chinese exports of EVs to the EU are already posing an existential crisis to the European car industry but are now, like Tesla, helping traditional car firms meet their decarbonisation targets courtesy of an EU regulation that in effect allows car firms to “pool” emissions.

The EU has already extended the period for compliance with emissions rules from one year to three years, fuelling fears this will further delay the already slow take-up of EVs in the EU, particularly in southern Europe, but also in key states such as France and Germany.

Fredrik Eklund, responsible for carbon credits trading at the Chinese-owned Swedish brand Polestar, which only makes electric vehicles, said: “It risks delaying the transition from legacy cars to EVs. We are already seeing car manufacturers pushing at the 2027 expiry date, but from our point of view and from the point of view of society, we really don’t want to delay this.”

Under the rules, car manufacturers have to meet emissions targets of 93.6g of CO2 per kilometre.

But under the car pooling arrangement, car manufacturers can pay electric car companies to use their zero emissions record to average out the pollution from sales of their combustion engine cars to avoid fines.

The industry in the past has said the 2025 emissions targets could have led to as much as €15bn (£13.03bn) in fines.

The latest car pooling agreement, confirmed by Nissan, mirrors that of other companies who have teamed up with other big name electric car brands including Tesla and Polestar.

Polestar has a pooling arrangement with Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Smart cars, while Tesla’s zero emissions record is being mopped up by Toyota, Ford, Mazda, Alfa Romeo and Suzuki.

The price car companies are paying EV firms to offset their emissions remains confidential. But in January it was reported that carbon credit sales accounted for almost 3% of Tesla’s $72bn (£54bn) total revenue in the first nine months of last year – just over £1.6bn.

The car industry is now fighting for a softening of the EU’s 2035 target for banning the sale of new combustion engine cars, arguing that the public is still not prepared to make the switch in sufficient numbers, citing lack of infrastructure in southern and central Europe as part of the problem.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4229b89c6c0221b5358c92b2d2859dafcffd3dbe/340_0_4561_3648/master/4561.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b4a5b4129b2c06a79a8aa5fa6aac752",N,,2025-10-27 13:10:31.876483

A division within the North Carolina Department of Commerce will administer the money, partnering with five workforce development boards that span the entire western region of the state.
Early jobs under the program focused on cleanup, said Nathan Ramsey, the director of the Mountain Area Workforce Development Board.","North Carolina counties hit by Hurricane Helene last year will get $4 million in new money from the federal government for temporary jobs and workforce training, Gov. Josh Stein announced Friday.

The grant funds, awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor, represent the rest of a $10 million award designed to employ displaced workers to help recovery and humanitarian efforts. The grant also pays for local workforce development boards to train workers at community colleges and other locations.

“This federal grant will enable folks in western North Carolina who are out of work to get a job helping their neighbors and businesses recover and rebuild,” Stein said in a statement. “It is a win-win.”

More than 275 North Carolinians have participated in the program since it was created last year, according to the governor’s office. Workers may be eligible if they have been “temporarily or permanently laid off” as a result of Helene. The program supports wages up to 2,008 hours per worker with a minimum wage of $15 per hour.

A division within the North Carolina Department of Commerce will administer the money, partnering with five workforce development boards that span the entire western region of the state.

Early jobs under the program focused on cleanup, said Nathan Ramsey, the director of the Mountain Area Workforce Development Board. Now, many of the job placements have evolved to focus on homebuilding and other long-term recovery roles.

“Our region has spent over a million dollars on that program, and supporting individuals who were helping our region recover,” Ramsey said.

Stein has asked the federal government to send an additional $38 million for workforce support as part of a larger funding request to continue recovering from Helene.

Geothermal will grow in California no matter what — of that, Darago said, she’s certain.","In the early 2000s, the owners of the Mammoth Pacific geothermal station proposed expanding the plant into an area just east of California’s Yosemite National Park. The project boasted on its website in 2004 that the potential new wells, which would be located in one of the state’s richest heat resources, had been ​“carefully chosen to reduce or avoid potential environmental impacts.”

By 2009, the company had produced a study on how the development could impact plant life. The power station had been running since the 1980s, so the decades of data on its safe operation seemed to bode well for a swift approval at a moment when, much like today, rising electricity demand and concern over climate change were converging to bolster development of carbon-free power. The prospects looked so good that, in 2010, geothermal giant Ormat Technologies bought the company that owned Mammoth. In 2013 — a decade after the expansion was first conceived — federal regulators gave the project the green light.

Yet that was just the start of Mammoth Pacific’s permitting saga.

An environmental group and local opponents quickly accused regulators of failing to properly consider how the geothermal project could release organic gases into the atmosphere and groundwater, and filed a lawsuit under the California Environmental Quality Act. The litigation took years to resolve. By the time Ormat finally completed the expansion in 2022, the so-called Casa Diablo IV project had been in the works for nearly two decades.

“People in the industry know it took 17 years to expand an existing facility,” said Joel Edwards, the cofounder and chief technology officer at the geothermal startup Zanskar. ​“And that’s the last facility that’s been built in California.”

Building a new geothermal plant from scratch on an undeveloped site, he said, would presumably ​“be an even bigger lift.”

A bill that California lawmakers passed almost unanimously last month promised to change that calculus for the geothermal industry. AB 527 would have provided geothermal developers with categorical exemptions to CEQA reviews, clearing the way for companies to carry out the most expensive part of the process — drilling wells to identify viable hot-rock resources — without the costly burden of lawsuits and ecological assessments the state’s landmark environmental law imposes. A companion bill, known as AB 531, designates geothermal energy under the special ​“environmental leadership development projects” status that state law already directs the California Energy Commission to grant to solar, wind, energy storage, and hydrogen facilities. Despite garnering more nay votes from lawmakers, that legislation is now law in California.

But, in a move that has mystified the industry, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) vetoed AB 527. In his letter explaining the rejection, Newsom said the legislation would have required state regulators to ​“substantially increase fees on geothermal operators to implement the new requirements imposed by the bill.”

Of more than half a dozen industry executives and analysts that Canary Media spoke to, however, none believed that argument.

“Something doesn’t add up,” said Samuel Roland, a research fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation who has tracked the bill. ​“It was a political play for him.” The foundation is a right-leaning think tank that advocates for speeding up energy deployments.

While Roland said it’s difficult to determine exactly which groups may have persuaded the governor to block the legislation, ​“the only people who were objecting were environmentalists,” a dynamic that echoes the fight against Mammoth Pacific’s expansion.

“It does seem like it was a giveaway to environmental groups,” Roland said.

Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for Newsom, declined to comment. ​“The Governor’s veto message speaks for itself,” he wrote in an email to Canary Media.

California dreamin’

California’s unique geology has made it the destination for the geothermal industry for decades. The Western Hemisphere’s first commercial geothermal power station opened in California in 1960. That plant — The Geysers geothermal complex, located in a valley of the Mayacamas Mountains north of the San Francisco Bay Area — remains the world’s largest electrical station powered by the planet’s heat.

The state has enormous untapped potential — and a growing need for electricity. California has shut down all but one of its nuclear power plants over the past few decades. In recent years, persistent drought has made the state’s hydroelectric stations less dependable. Solar generation has soared, and a growing fleet of batteries has helped steady the supply when sun-soaked days threaten to overwhelm the grid with electrons and dark nights send panels’ production plummeting. But the state remains reliant on natural gas and power imports from neighboring states to meet surging demand. To achieve its carbon-cutting goals and bring down electricity rates that are more than double that of nearby states, California needs to increase its supply of clean, firm generation.

Burning biomass, such as dry wood cleared from California’s forests to help prevent wildfires, could provide one option — but that still generates carbon dioxide, and the demand for wood might encourage logging of healthy trees. Despite the state’s reversal of its plan to shut down Diablo Canyon, its final atomic station, building new nuclear reactors is still banned in California. Hydropower is dogged by water scarcity. That makes geothermal a particularly attractive choice.

It’s not without some drawbacks. Conventional geothermal, which involves drilling down into underground reservoirs warmed by volcanic heat, is limited to easily accessible areas and comes with the challenge of maintaining the subterranean water source over time. Next-generation geothermal companies are rapidly advancing drilling techniques that the oil and gas industry perfected in recent years to go deeper and harvest heat from dry, hot rocks, vastly expanding the locations with potential to generate energy. In a seismically active state, that carries some risk since the version of next-generation geothermal that uses hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology to drill could trigger earthquakes.

But every energy source comes with challenges, and neighboring states such as Utah, Nevada, and New Mexico are aggressively pursuing next-generation geothermal projects.

In theory, the best place to develop those first-of-a-kind plants would be California, with its energy-affordability woes and status as a major global economy.

“Utah has low prices, and geothermal is still expensive,” said Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure and energy policy at the Foundation for American Innovation. ​“If you want to bring geothermal down to cost parity with other technologies, you have to sell it to Californians. As a result, geothermal scaling runs through California.”

For the most part, however, developers are steering clear of the Golden State. Companies such as Fervo Energy, XGS Energy, and Sage Geosystems — three of the biggest next-generation startups — are based in Houston and are pursuing debut projects in Utah, New Mexico, and Texas itself. Zanskar, a developer using modern prospecting methods to tap conventional geothermal resources, is headquartered in Salt Lake City. States such as Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, and Oregon are ​“really exciting” as potential next areas for development, Edwards said.

“If California ever fixes CEQA,” he added, ​“it could be huge.”

The regulatory hurdles represent ​“the only real barrier” to geothermal taking off in the Golden State, said Wilson Ricks, a Princeton University researcher who focuses on geothermal.

“You can find projects pretty much all across the Western states but very few, if any, in California, despite it being the biggest potential market,” Ricks said.

“It’s stark. People are exploring projects in Texas, which has far, far worse-quality resources than the ones in California,” he added. ​“That’s because of the regulatory environment there. So the fact that regulatory barriers are going to remain in place doesn’t give me a lot of confidence that California’s going to be leaping ahead on geothermal anytime soon.”

In response to emailed questions, Fervo said it maintains leases near the Salton Sea region, an area with vast geothermal potential. But those parcels aren’t currently under development since the state’s permitting regime makes investing in drilling too risky.

“With the right legislative and permitting reforms, similar to those that were proposed in AB 527, the state could better position in-state resources for development and unlock the enormous economic benefits that come with local clean energy development,” said Sarah Harper, Fervo’s senior policy and regulatory affairs associate.

A revolution for geothermal?

Not everyone is so bearish. Ormat, the nation’s largest geothermal operator of conventional sites, said the fact that the vetoed bill passed in the Legislature without a single no vote, just a handful of abstentions, shows there’s political support for geothermal ​“like we haven’t seen in the past.”

“It’s like a revolution for geothermal,” said Marisol Collons, Ormat’s manager of communications and government affairs. ​“We’re still highly optimistic about the future and ready to kickstart all our next legislative sessions across the country.”

While Fervo lamented the small number of groups that dissented on the bill, the company said the fact that there were ​“more environmental groups in favor than there were ones opposed, or even neutral” left it feeling hopeful about the possibility of future legislation.

For XGS, a next-generation company whose technology forgoes fracking and minimizes its water usage by keeping the fluid for its operations contained in a closed tube, California remains ​“the highest-priority market.”

“We feel that California provides a unique combination from both a resource perspective and a market perspective,” said Lucy Darago, chief commercial officer at XGS. ​“It’s a high-demand market that really needs the attributes that geothermal brings.”

The key, she said, is time. Geothermal will grow in California no matter what — of that, Darago said, she’s certain. The question is whether that happens in time to stave off blackouts and slash emissions on the trajectory the state has set for its electrical system.

“The industry is going to happen. It will get there,” she said. ​“But if it’s going to get there on a timeline that’s meaningful for California’s resource-adequacy challenges and climate goals, we’ll need some of these changes.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/geothermal-field.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=810e4fdc520fa3d26f026ce210739298,N,,2025-10-27 13:09:07.053104

“Coal is complex — there’s no single right way to deal with it,” said Sidney Gathrid ’22, the study’s lead author.
“Instead of asking only why coal plants retire, we asked how we can make retirements happen faster — and in ways that are efficient and grounded in data,” Gathrid said.
“That’s a powerful approach to a geographically diverse and politically fragmented challenge.” Their analysis found that about 28% of coal plants without retirement plans are already highly vulnerable to closure — potential “quick wins” for policymakers and advocates.
“It’s flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.” Gathrid, now a co-founder of an AI and data start-up, Krv Analytics, based in Los Angeles, said the framework’s open-source design makes it especially valuable.","Even as coal power continues its steady decline in the United States, more than a hundred plants still have no retirement plans — a gap large enough to derail national climate goals. A new study led by UC Santa Barbara researchers offers a way forward, showing how targeted, data-driven approaches could help accelerate the transition.

Published in Nature Energy(link is external), the study tackles a critical question: if market forces have already driven many coal plants to close, why are so many still running? Despite years of decline, roughly 105 gigawatts of coal capacity — representing 114 plants — are still slated to operate through 2035, even though a complete phaseout by that date is widely considered essential for meeting U.S. net-zero emissions goals.

“Coal is complex — there’s no single right way to deal with it,” said Sidney Gathrid ’22, the study’s lead author. “Our goal was to build tools that reflect that complexity, so different actors can take on different facets of the problem. There’s no one straightforward path, and we wanted to do research that represented that reality.”

Working with Grace C. Wu, an assistant professor in the Environmental Studies Program and senior author on the paper, Gathrid and his team show that reaching those goals will require policymakers to move beyond age-based or one-size-fits-all approaches — and instead focus on the specific contexts that accelerate the retirement of certain coal plants.

To do that, the researchers — including Jeremy Wayland, Stuart Wayland ‘22, and Ranjit Deshmukh, an associate professor in the Environmental Studies Program and the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management — developed a new framework combining graph theory and topological data analysis to classify the entire U.S. coal fleet into eight distinct groups based on 68 technical, economic, environmental and socio-political factors. They also introduced a “contextual retirement vulnerability” score that measures how susceptible each plant is to early retirement by comparing it to facilities that have already announced closures.

The framework goes a step further by identifying “retirement archetypes” — patterns that explain why plants in each group are retiring. These range from regulatory and health-based drivers to unfavorable economics or political pressure, offering a clear set of levers that can be applied to similar facilities elsewhere.

“Instead of asking only why coal plants retire, we asked how we can make retirements happen faster — and in ways that are efficient and grounded in data,” Gathrid said. “Our framework helps policymakers and advocates identify where they can have the biggest impact.”

The study began as Gathrid’s senior thesis in UCSB’s Environmental Studies Program, supported by the campus’s Manalis Leadership Fellowship, sponsored by Howard and Lisa Wenger, and evolved into a years-long collaboration. Wu said the project’s scope and impact are rare for undergraduate research.

“This is Ph.D.-level work,” Wu said. “It’s extremely unusual for a project that started as a senior thesis to reach this level of sophistication and impact. What’s exciting is that this framework doesn’t just describe which plants might retire — it shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.”

Using their model, the team grouped 198 active U.S. coal plants into clusters such as High Health Impacts Plants, Expensive Plants, and Plants in Anti-Coal Regions, each linked to specific vulnerabilities that can be targeted with policy or advocacy. For example, plants associated with high asthma rates and poor air quality could be prioritized through public-health campaigns and environmental enforcement, while those struggling financially might respond more effectively to economic incentives or market-based mechanisms.

One striking example is Belews Creek in North Carolina — a nearly 50-year-old, 2.49-gigawatt coal plant that the study categorizes as both highly vulnerable to retirement and part of Group 0: Fuel Blend Plants. The facility can burn up to 50% natural gas, yet remains one of the nation’s top particulate polluters, ranking 26th out of 198 for fine particle emissions. Financially, it’s among the most unprofitable plants in the country, carrying roughly $46 million in debt as of 2020.

Belews Creek is also located in a state seeing rapid growth in solar development and the implementation of coal debt securitization policies designed to help utilities transition away from uneconomic fossil assets. “Given the drivers for retirements in this group,” the authors noted, “advocates can leverage state and utility clean energy targets.” There were even preliminary discussions about replacing Belews Creek with a small modular nuclear reactor, but the plant’s owner, Duke Energy, has since postponed its retirement — underscoring the financial and operational complexities that the UCSB framework aims to untangle.

“We can simplify nearly 200 plants into clear groups and pair each with evidence-based strategies,” Wu said. “That’s a powerful approach to a geographically diverse and politically fragmented challenge.”

Their analysis found that about 28% of coal plants without retirement plans are already highly vulnerable to closure — potential “quick wins” for policymakers and advocates. But it also revealed that the least vulnerable plants are spread across several groups, underscoring the need for a diverse set of strategies to address the most persistent facilities.

The implications extend beyond coal. Because the model captures the multi-dimensional forces that shape real-world decisions — economics, politics, health and grid reliability — it could be adapted to other complex decarbonization challenges.

Wu, whose research focuses on sustainable energy transition planning, said the framework bridges mathematical and applied environmental science in a way that could transform how analysts and decision-makers approach energy policy.

“This work takes state-of-the-art mathematical tools and puts them into the practitioner’s toolbox,” she said. “It’s flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.”

Gathrid, now a co-founder of an AI and data start-up, Krv Analytics, based in Los Angeles, said the framework’s open-source design makes it especially valuable.

“The methods we developed are meant to be used,” he said. “Whether you’re working on coal, renewables or industrial emissions, the idea is the same — use the data you have to see where progress can happen first, and why.”",https://news.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2025-10/coal-opt.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:09:51.841251

Overall, customers are set to see a nearly $90 billion hike in their utility bills through 2028, the analysis finds. The increases are affecting more than 107 million electric customers and more than 46 million natural gas customers across 49 states and Washington, D.C.

These spikes are being driven by a combination of increasing demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, aging electric grids, extreme weather, higher natural gas prices, and the Trump administration’s irrational policy assault on new clean energy deployment.

Instead of addressing rising utility costs, the Trump administration has canceled projects for new energy supply, taken away support for grid resilience, issued massive new tariffs that worsen supply chain concerns, and increased consumer costs by forcing expensive coal plants to run past their scheduled retirements.

“Utility customers are suffering because of surging electricity bills, but the Trump administration is making it worse,” said Amanda Levin, director of policy analysis at the NRDC and co-author of the analysis. “While it keeps trying to prop up the struggling and expensive energy of the past century, it’s harming the fastest and cheapest sources of power that are ready to join the grid today. What a shame.”

The Trump administration’s attacks on clean energy and giveaways for the fossil fuel industry, coupled with the effects of rolling back clean energy tax credits, mean that American households could spend upward of $430 more per year on their energy bills within the next decade.

“Millions of Americans are struggling with higher utility bills. But the Trump administration insists on propping up the fossil fuel industry and taking away solutions that help lower costs for Americans,” said Lucero Marquez, associate director of federal climate policy at CAP and co-author of the analysis. “That means we will continue to see utility bills rise and have no relief for the Americans that need it.”

The updated tracker analyzed the rates of 210 utilities based on examination of online filings by the companies and records of decisions in state public utilities commission dockets. An earlier analysis, released in September, examined rates from 102 utilities.

Overall, the analysis finds that utilities around the country are raising costs on customers by $89.9 billion through 2028. About $71.2 billion of that increase is electric and $18.6 billion is natural gas.

MERCK CONTINUES U.S. INVESTMENT TOUR

Global pharmaceutical giant Merck has officially launched the construction of a new $3 billion manufacturing facility in Virginia. The new 400,000 sq. ft. plant will join operations at the company’s 85-year-old site in Elkton, enhancing space for active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product investments to support small molecule manufacturing and testing. This project comes as another step in Merck’s greater $70 billion commitment to its U.S. manufacturing operations, which saw new production facility investments in North Carolina, Delaware and Kansas earlier this year. “This investment helps advance our goal of providing new, innovative treatment options for people facing serious health challenges in the U.S. and around the world,” said Merck Chair and CEO Robert M. Davis. The construction phase of the new Elkton facility will create up to 8,000 jobs and and plant will create 500 direct roles once operational. Merck’s press release notes that the company additionally plans to invest $3 billion into future biologics and small molecule facilities, as well as a fresh $3.5 upgrade to its Rahway, New Jersey, HQ.

PITTSBURGH CAPTURES ENERGY INNOVATION

A $352.9 million investment decision will move Eos Energy Enterprises’ current New Jersey headquarters out of Edison and into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by late 2026. The zinc-based battery energy storage systems manufacturer selected a 40,000-sq.-ft. office space at Nova Place in the city’s North Shore neighborhood, a strategic location to not only tap into expertise at local universities like Carnegie Mellon University, but to support the company’s growing operations. Eos Energy will further cement roots in Allegheny County with the expansion of its manufacturing capabilities, which includes leasing a 430,000-sq.-ft. facility in Marshall Township to integrate additional production lines. The company currently occupies two production plants in Turtle Creek with 265 employees between the two, although this expansion project will bring an influx of 735 new jobs to the region. “What we are announcing today is built upon a strong industrial history, combined with a world class university ecosystem,” said Eos Energy CEO Joe Mastrangelo. “Pennsylvania is positioning itself at the forefront of America’s energy transition — enabling us to bring America’s battery to scale.”

Discussion has increased ahead of the special session regarding the potential impact of redistricting on Indiana’s two Democratic seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Reports from FOX59 indicate that federal Republicans are supporting the proposed map changes. However, there may not yet be enough votes to approve the redistricting, as Niki Kelly, editor of the Indiana Capital Chronicle, noted uncertainty about the state senate vote count. Braun stated that the votes are ""getting very close.""

Additionally, Indiana Democratic Party Chair Karen Tallian commented on Braun's position in a statement to WTHR, saying, ""At best, Braun has been brow-beaten, changed his mind, and finally kissed the … ring … of the man who would be King.""

Citizens from different political backgrounds have shared their views on the redistricting effort. A poll by Independent Indiana found that 53% of voters opposed the plans, while 34% supported them.

Biodiesel In addition to slower growth in renewable diesel production capacity, biodiesel production capacity decreased slightly.

A deceleration in production capacity in our category renewable diesel and other biofuels accounted for most of the slowdown in growth. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane make up virtually all of the other biofuels.

Renewable diesel and other biofuels

Renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity increased just 391 million gallons per year (gal/y) in 2024, less than one-third of the growth observed in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, only two capacity additions came online, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to exclusively produce biofuels and the new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield.

With the completed conversion, the Rodeo plant has a capacity of 767 million gal/y, up from 180 million gal/y in last year’s report. This increase makes it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the United States, behind Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana.

U.S. capacity growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138-million-gal/y Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities. Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively. Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy closed plants in Mobile, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi, respectively.

The loss of renewable diesel capacity at four facilities reflects changes to biofuel margins and petroleum refining margins since 2020. Low refinery margins and rising biofuel credit values in 2020 and 2021 prompted a wave of renewable diesel capacity announcements. As more of those plants started operations, biofuel production began exceeding target volumes, and biofuel credit values and margins decreased in 2023. At the same time, petroleum refinery margins were much stronger than their 2020 lows, resulting in a slowdown in investments to expand renewable diesel capacity for the upcoming years.

A notable shift in 2024 was the increased focus on SAF. SAF is an alternative to petroleum jet fuel that we capture in our other biofuels category. Other biofuels includes SAF, renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline, and other emerging biofuels. We combine other biofuels with renewable diesel capacity because other biofuels are mostly produced at renewable diesel plants as byproducts or, often in the case of SAF, in place of renewable diesel. Following the completion of conversion projects in 2024, Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant can shift about 150 million gal/y of its renewable diesel production capacity to SAF, and Diamond Green Diesel can shift about 235 million gal/y to SAF.

Biodiesel

In addition to slower growth in renewable diesel production capacity, biodiesel production capacity decreased slightly. In 2024, eight biodiesel plants closed due to poor margins, resulting in a loss of about 100 million gal/y of production capacity.

Fuel ethanol

Unlike renewable diesel and biodiesel, U.S. fuel ethanol production capacity increased more in 2024 than in previous years. Fuel ethanol accounts for 73% of all biofuels production capacity, with a total of almost 18.5 billion gallons of capacity per year. Most of this production is concentrated in Midwest states, where corn is produced for feedstock. Because U.S. fuel ethanol consumption has been somewhat flat in recent years, the increased capacity is mostly contributing to growing exports of ethanol.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/EIA_chart_12_13.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 12:10:32.079556

In 2005, the city's voters approved a divorce from Progress Energy, which later merged with Duke Energy.
""If we look at Winter Park, your city's going to be able to reinvest into itself,"" he said at the September meeting.
“During Milton, Helene, and Debbie, Duke Energy was able to bring in 27,000 resources from across the country.
Research shows Duke Energy has the highest average residential rates in the state, followed by Tampa Electric.","St. Petersburg and Clearwater are considering doing something very few Florida cities have done recently: unplug from the electric company.

If either city decides to disconnect from Duke Energy, here's a little advice from someone who knows something about it.

“I would tell them to expect a big fight,” said Randy Knight, the city manager of Winter Park, just outside of Orlando.

In 2005, the city's voters approved a divorce from Progress Energy, which later merged with Duke Energy.

ALSO READ: Tampa Electric and Duke are increasing their electric rates starting in March

“From a public relations standpoint, they will be going around the community telling everybody they don't know what they're doing,” he said. “They've never run an electric utility.”

""The joke in Winter Park at the time was we would have five guys in a pickup truck trying to restore power,"" Knight said. ""That's what they were telling people, and so they will attempt to get elections overturned to where more favorable people will be in office that would support a new franchise. So that's what I would expect.""

Knight added his city was given an estimated price tag of $106 million from Progress Energy. After prolonged battles in court, it ended up costing about $43 million, including the powerlines and poles. Most of the money paid for the utility’s lost business and investment. Winter Park paid another $30 million in legal fees.

Switch has a positive effect

But voters approved a referendum by 69% and the city's utility bills are now 28% lower than Dukes'. The city has used the profits it makes to bury 81% of its power lines, meaning fewer outages during major storms.

“I will tell you that when the last hurricanes came through last year, all the utilities around us had outages for a few days,” Knight said. “We had everybody back up the same day the storm left the city.”

Knight said there's even an industry manual out — a kind of a how-to book that companies can use to fight municipalities looking to get off the utility grid. The 70-page manual from the Edison Electric Institute includes ways to prevent takeovers at the legislative level and at the ballot box.

“They fought us every step of the way,” Knight said. “We were, of course, the first one in Florida to do this. And so they first filed a lawsuit challenging whether we really had the right to purchase.”

Winter Park bought the electric distribution system in the city limits from Duke and buys power on the open market through long-term contracts. Knight said they buy the bulk of the power through the Florida Municipal Power Association, but had to buy energy through Duke after they bought the system.

""We enter into seven- to 10-year contracts to buy power,"" he said, ""And then it comes across the transmission lines, in our case, owned by Duke Energy, because they're all around us.""

The Orlando-based Association describes itself as a wholesale power agency owned by municipal electric utilities in Florida. It serves the 33 municipal electric utilities located across the state.

In September, Clearwater's City Council voted unanimously to study creating its own municipal electric utility to replace Duke.

During that meeting, residents were in favor of the change. Shane Marr said the Charlotte, North Carolina-based utility charges higher rates to pay its investors.

“Duke has fleeced the Clearwater community for many decades,” he told council members. “People across the community have struggled to pay the bonuses of shareholders who have no regard for their well-being.”

ALSO READ: Electricity prices are climbing more than twice as fast as inflation

Councilman Ryan Cotton noted that Winter Park is on track to bury all their power lines underground by 2030.

""If we look at Winter Park, your city's going to be able to reinvest into itself,"" he said at the September meeting. ""So not only are you going to be getting upfront savings that still continue through the 30-year (contract) generationally, but you will also get the reinvestment of undergrounding service lines just like Winter Park is doing.""

An independent study commissioned by NewGen Strategies and Solutions predicts that electric bills would become up to 18% lower than Duke Energy's rates.

City council members agreed to go forward with a more detailed feasibility study. The city's 30-year agreement with Duke ends in December.

Duke states its case

Duke spokeswoman Ana Gibbs says they're the most reliable source of electricity for the region — especially right after hurricanes.

“During Milton, Helene, and Debbie, Duke Energy was able to bring in 27,000 resources from across the country. That means crews came in from Colorado, California, and even Canada, and we were able to restore more than 2 million customer outages,” Gibbs said.

""In addition to that, our advanced self-healing technology was able to reroute power and avoid more than 325 million minutes of outages. And what that means was the lights were able to stay on during those 325 million minutes, when customers needed the lights on the most. The investments we've made to upgrade the grid was able to avoid outage minutes during those storms, and that's really important to our customers.""

Duke added that it’ll fight moves by the city to disconnect. It's study showed a transition could cost Clearwater up to $1 billion.

The city plans to get its own estimate after the new study is complete.

Research shows Duke Energy has the highest average residential rates in the state, followed by Tampa Electric. Winter Park had one of the cheapest rates.

It's been done before

Many Florida cities have run their own electric services for decades, including Jacksonville, Orlando, Gainesville, Kissimmee, and Alachua.

In Polk County, Lakeland Electric has operated as a public power utility since 1904. Bartow has had its own electric utility since the early 1900s.

St. Petersburg is also considering creating its own utility. Its 30-year contract with Duke ends in August.

Council member Corey Givens Jr. said during a meeting that he knows the city could end up in litigation for years. But he said he has personally felt the pinch of high prices.

“$450 was my bill yesterday, the highest bill that I have ever received. And I was disgusted because I felt what my constituents are feeling,” he said. “They want help now.”

But Mayor Ken Welch has already discussed a new decade-long agreement with the company.

There have also been arguments to stay with established utilities. In 2018, Vero Beach voters agreed to sell their century-old, debt-laden municipal utility to Florida Power and Light.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4bad71/2147483647/strip/true/crop/968x508+0+69/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3c%2Fe1%2Fe9f228ca4f0b901b1b717b855970%2Fwinter-park-electric.png,N,,2025-10-27 12:10:35.421553

The Economic Backbone Campbell Provides Campbell is more than a power plant.
Direct Jobs: Campbell directly employs about 300 highly skilled workers — operators, engineers, mechanics, and electricians.
Without Campbell, Michigan becomes far more exposed to that volatility.
It can continue to provide Michigan with reliable baseload power, economic stability, and energy security while complementing new technologies.","Picture this: it’s one of the coldest nights of a Michigan winter. The wind howls off Lake Michigan, the snow piles high, and the temperature plunges well below zero. Families across the state turn up their thermostats, hospitals lean on electric heating to protect patients, and factories fight to keep machinery from freezing. But the wind has gone calm, leaving turbines idle. The sun has set, leaving solar panels dark. Natural gas pipelines, stressed by extreme cold, are constrained or frozen. And there are no coal plants like J.H. Campbell left to carry the load.

In that moment, the lights flicker, the furnaces cut off, and millions of Michiganders realize what policymakers never accounted for: you cannot run a modern state on promises and press releases. You need real, on-demand power. You need coal.

That’s not a distant scenario. It’s a real and growing risk if Campbell is shut down early. For over 60 years, this plant has supplied Michigan with 1,400 megawatts of reliable, fuel-secure electricity. It has kept homes warm through every polar vortex and heatwave. It has supported hundreds of good jobs and poured millions into schools, first responders, and local services. To shutter Campbell prematurely is to gamble with Michigan’s reliability, affordability, and prosperity.

This is not progress. It is a deliberate weakening of America’s energy foundation at the very moment we need it most.

A Reliable Grid Demands Real Power

Coal has always been America’s insurance policy against the unpredictable. When the weather doesn’t cooperate, when gas prices spike, when demand surges — coal is the steady hand that keeps the grid from collapsing.

Campbell is part of that safety net. With three generating units, it delivers more than 1,400 megawatts of baseload electricity — enough to power 800,000 average sized homes. It does so with on-site fuel that can be stored and dispatched on demand, regardless of the weather. That makes it unique in today’s fragile energy mix.

Michigan’s grid operator, MISO, has already warned of capacity shortfalls during periods of peak demand. That’s before Campbell is removed from the system. If it closes, the state becomes even more vulnerable to blackouts during extreme heat and cold. Blackouts aren’t just inconvenient. They shut down hospitals, freeze water pipes, halt production lines, and put lives in danger.

We’ve seen what happens when that safety net is pulled away. During Winter Storm Uri in 2021, Texas lost both renewables and large portions of its natural gas fleet. Millions of Texans shivered in the dark, 210 Texans died and Texas incurred an estimated $130 billion in economic losses—serious losses to consider for one State during one storm. Coal units that remained online provided critical backup. In the Midwest, every polar vortex tells the same story: coal is the last line of defense when demand surges and other fuels fail.

Supporters of Campbell’s closure argue that renewables and imports can “fill the gap.” But wind and solar don’t generate at will, and imports depend on neighboring states having excess power to sell — a dangerous gamble when cold snaps grip the entire region.

The reality is simple: Campbell is not outdated. It is essential. Without it, Michigan risks power shortages, higher costs, and a less resilient grid.

The Economic Backbone Campbell Provides

Campbell is more than a power plant. It’s an economic engine that supports jobs, families, and communities across Michigan. Its annual impact is measured not only in megawatts, but in paychecks, tax dollars, and local investment.

Direct Jobs: Campbell directly employs about 300 highly skilled workers — operators, engineers, mechanics, and electricians. These are family-sustaining careers with good wages, healthcare, and pensions.

Indirect Jobs: More than 1,000 additional jobs are tied to Campbell through coal mining, rail and trucking, equipment suppliers, contractors, and local businesses that serve employees and their families.

Payroll & Benefits: Together, these jobs deliver an estimated $35–40 million annually in wages and benefits into the Michigan economy. Those dollars ripple through local diners, grocery stores, car dealerships, and small businesses.

Tax Contributions: Campbell contributes tens of millions of dollars every year in state and local taxes. That money funds schools, fire departments, police forces, and infrastructure in Ottawa County and beyond. Without Campbell, those tax dollars vanish — forcing higher taxes elsewhere or cuts to vital services.

Affordable Power Value: Campbell’s 1,400 megawatts of baseload generation insulate Michigan families and businesses from the wild price swings of natural gas. In 2022, when gas prices spiked, coal kept electricity bills from skyrocketing even higher. Without Campbell, Michigan becomes far more exposed to that volatility.

This economic profile isn’t hypothetical. It’s measurable, it’s real, and it would be impossible to replace with the handful of temporary construction jobs offered by intermittent renewable projects. Campbell sustains communities year after year. Closing it prematurely tears that foundation away.

What We Stand to Lose

If Campbell closes ahead of schedule, here is the reality Michigan will face:

Higher Costs: Michigan already has some of the highest power rates in the Midwest. Removing a low-cost baseload provider like Campbell guarantees higher bills.

Job Losses: Hundreds of direct plant jobs and more than a thousand supply-chain jobs disappear, with no comparable replacements.

Community Harm: Local governments lose millions in tax revenue, cutting funding for schools, emergency services, and infrastructure.

Weaker Reliability: Blackouts and brownouts become more likely during peak demand, threatening safety and economic competitiveness.

Eroded Energy Security: Without Campbell’s fuel-secure stockpiles, Michigan becomes more dependent on weather-based renewables and volatile natural gas.

This is not a “just transition.” It’s a forced disruption that puts ideology over reality and punishes the very families and communities that have powered Michigan for generations.

A Smarter Path Forward

America needs an all that works energy strategy. Coal remains the backbone of reliable, affordable, fuel-secure electricity. Rather than tearing down what works, policymakers should invest in modernizing the coal fleet.

Campbell doesn’t need to be sacrificed. It can continue to provide Michigan with reliable baseload power, economic stability, and energy security while complementing new technologies. What we need is balance, not blind adherence to political talking points.

Conclusion

Imagine again that bitterly cold Michigan night — the wind calm, the sun down, the gas lines strained. Without Campbell, without coal, millions would be left in the dark. That is not an abstract risk. It is the direct consequence of energy policies that dismiss coal’s value while offering no real replacement.

The J.H. Campbell plant has served Michigan faithfully for six decades. It supports thousands of jobs, powers over a million homes, funds local schools and first responders, and provides a bedrock of reliability the grid cannot do without. Shutting it down early is not progress. It is a reckless gamble with Michigan’s economy, its families, and its future.

If we care about affordable power, about strong communities, about American energy independence, then we must keep Campbell online. Michigan’s future — and America’s strength — depend on it.

The collaboration aims to connect global knowledge across regions to support the clean energy transition across ADB’s developing member countries and builds on shared commitments to inclusive, sustainable growth and country-led development.

Through this initiative, U-M and WDI will work collaboratively with ADB on a wide range of projects across the Asian region, including in clean energy and e-mobility, climate and health, water, food security, and biodiversity. Experts from U-M and WDI will serve as academic research partners and collaborators to ADB’s teams and their counterparts in the bank’s developing member countries, ranging from government officials to stakeholders across industry and academia. Established in 1966 and based in Manila, ADB today has 68 member countries, 49 of which are from the Asia region.

“This collaboration will help us tap into Michigan’s expertise and access global innovation to create more opportunities to advance inclusive and sustainable development in the region,” said Scott Morris, vice president of the Asian Development Bank. “By joining forces with the University of Michigan and the William Davidson Institute, ADB is reinforcing our commitment to empowering communities with knowledge, skills and access to solutions that will build resilience, drive economic opportunity, and shape a more prosperous future for Asia and the Pacific.”​

The partners will commission actionable research, engage in projects in ADB member countries, facilitate regional roundtable discussions and host cross-learning activities—both in Asia and in Michigan—allowing for knowledge sharing and collaboration among policymakers and practitioners from ADB member countries and Michigan-based experts and decision makers.

“This partnership underscores the University of Michigan’s commitment to global collaboration in addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the energy transition and the drive for more sustainable development,” said Jonathan Overpeck, dean of SEAS. “By connecting U-M’s leadership in workforce and technology innovation and research with deep regional and local expertise across Asia, we can help advance equitable, resilient development. No one nation or region has all the answers, so the benefits of us learning from and with one another are very exciting. Partnerships focused on Asia provide the opportunity for growing our research and innovation impact in society not just at home, but across the globe. The climate crisis is a global problem that requires global solutions.”

SEAS brings unparalleled strength in the interdisciplinary education, research and innovation that is needed to accelerate the energy transition and create a more resilient and sustainable planet. Work across campus, with WDI and ADB, creates opportunities for partnerships between universities and other stakeholders in Asia to support a common goal of developing the leaders of tomorrow in a region that has the largest greenhouse gas emissions and is facing the most devastating impacts of the climate crisis. The partners will continue to define and implement joint initiatives through mechanisms such as knowledge sharing, convenings, study tours, training programs, student internships and access to shared publications.

Recognizing the critical link between human capital and sustainable growth, the collaboration will also promote training and entrepreneurship to connect innovators from ADB member countries with Michigan’s research institutions and entrepreneurship ecosystems and open opportunities for Michigan ventures to access Asian markets. WDI will lead efforts to foster cross-regional learning, business opportunities, technical training and market access.

“This agreement reflects WDI’s deep belief that innovation and thriving ventures are central to building healthier, more sustainable futures,” said Wendy Taylor, president and CEO of WDI. “By working alongside the University of Michigan and the Asian Development Bank, we’re creating pathways for inclusive economic growth that engage communities, strengthen innovation ecosystems and accelerate progress toward a clean energy future—from Detroit to Manila.”

The partnership also aims to accelerate e-mobility development by working with key stakeholders to support electric vehicle adoption, supply chain innovation and workforce development, building on work to date. In July, with support from ADB, WDI released the report “Driving a just transition to e-mobility in the Philippines” with research findings based on its collaboration with ADB and the Apl.de.Ap Foundation International. In addition to extensive market research, WDI’s engagement in the project involved field work in the Philippines and engagement via focus group discussions, interviews, and company and university site visits. While the research primarily focuses on the Philippines, the team also examined e-mobility progress in other countries in Southeast Asia, particularly in the policy realm, to contextualize the findings.

The partnership can also capitalize on learning from other regions. WDI’s Energy and Mobility team previously partnered with the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, a region with a heavily automotive and supplier manufacturing base, increasingly looking to transition toward an e-mobility future. The collaboration resulted in the Chihuahua Charging Forward project. In that initiative and related work, WDI’s Energy & Mobility team partnered with local economic development organizations, companies, researchers and innovators along the EV value chain.

Perpetua Resources and the Stibnite Mine fit neatly into every one of those categories. As I first detailed here in 2021, antimony, though little known to most people, is a key component in a vast variety of products that are central to our modern way of life, including smart phones and other gadgets, bullets, major military weapons systems, and most forms of renewable energy.

Put simply, there can be no energy transition without ready and affordable supplies of this key mineral. That thick, heavy glass used in solar panels? It’s made with antimony. Those 300- to 700-foot-tall windmills that produce electricity when the weather’s good? Made with antimony. Antimony is a key element in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries, and even more crucial is the fact that it is integral to the development of the next-generation battery technologies that could hold the key to truly scalable energy storage for wind and solar power.

""This is all about putting America first again relative to the supply chain, in this case for critical minerals,"" said Jon Cherry, Perpetua’s CEO. JPMC obviously agrees, and it is not alone in that assessment.

The Pentagon considers the Stibnite mine important enough to national security that it sent a representative, Major General John T. Reim, to participate in the ribbon cutting ceremony when the mine was formally re-opened on September 19, following an arduous 15-year-long permitting process. Speaking to an audience of local, state, and company officials, Reim said the restart of its operations puts the Pentagon “one step closer to establishing a complete domestic supply chain,” for its antimony needs.

Mining For Gold, Antimony, And More

In addition to the infusion of $75 million from JPM, Perpetua also announced a $180 million investment into its operations on Monday by Canada-based Agnico Eagle Mines Limited, the world’s second-biggest gold producer. As with JPM’s deal, the up-front investment is in Perpetua common stock, and comes with warrants to buy additional shares at discounted prices over the coming three years.

“The Stibnite Gold Project is an excellent opportunity in a premier mining jurisdiction. Our investment in Perpetua aligns with Agnico Eagle’s commitment to disciplined and strategic investments through emerging and high-quality opportunities and provides measured exposure to one of the highest-grade open-pit gold deposits in the United States, with significant exploration upside,” said Ammar Al-Joundi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Agnico Eagle.

The Stibnite Mine is an obvious fit for Agnico Eagle and its prominence in the gold industry, given that the mine was originally established in 1927 as a gold mining operation. But early exploration quickly identified major stores of silver and antimony inside the targeted rock. Long a key player in ensuring U.S. national security, this single mine supplied 90% of America’s antimony needs throughout the war effort of World War II. Today, the Stibnite Mine is considered one of the largest resources of antimony outside of the control of China, Russia and their allies. In an email, a Perpetua spokesperson indicated that, in addition to is capital infusion, the mining operation also stands to benefit from Anglico Eagle’s deep technical expertise.

“The investments from Agnico Eagle and JPMorganChase are a vote of confidence in the Stibnite Gold Project and America’s critical mineral strategy,” said Jon Cherry, President and CEO of Perpetua Resources. “Investments from two leading, world-class institutions strengthens our capital position, reduces financing risk, and accelerates the development of one of the nation’s most strategic resource projects.”

With China cracking down on its exports of critical minerals such as antimony, the reopening of the Stibnite Mine and these associated investments could not be more timely. Readers can expect to see many more similar investments in America’s suddenly expanding mining industry in the coming months.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68ff76f94c72711e3854a4ad/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-27 11:21:32.968184

The pledge, announced as part of the company’s Centennial celebration, aims to grow interest in advanced manufacturing careers and prepare U.S workers for the future, unlocking quality jobs and industry-wide innovation.

Christy Pambianchi, Caterpillar chief human resources officer, said, “The future workforce will need skills for what comes next. We have our experts working on innovative training and resources to help skill and inform the next generation on how to navigate the worksite of tomorrow, and we’re excited to be starting here in Indiana to enable U.S. workers to enter high-quality jobs in the American manufacturing industry.”

Caterpillar said it will announce future workforce pledges in other states soon.

The company made the announcement at the company’s large engine facility in Lafayette, Indiana, which recently announced a $725 million capital expansion to greatly increase engine production and help meet the nation’s growing power needs.

Jason Kaiser, Caterpillar energy and transportation group president, said, “Many of the engines manufactured here in Lafayette will support power generation customers by providing reliable power – keeping operations running during outages and helping meet the growing energy needs driven by AI, data centers and other critical infrastructure across America and around the world.”

One of America’s oldest manufacturers, Caterpillar has more than 65 primary locations across 25 states. As a net exporter, Caterpillar workers in the U.S. build products that are shipped around the world, growing U.S. exports by 75% since 2016.

,EVs,2025-10-27 13:59:49+00:00,The Motley Fool,Where Will Rivian Stock Be in Three Years? | The Motley Fool,"David Butler, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/27/where-will-rivian-stock-be-in-three-years/,"An expensive stock Rivian stock has lost 90% of its value since going public.
After a certain point, earnings are what matter, and EV companies like Rivian and Tesla are all going to answer to it eventually.
In all, Rivian is reporting net losses of billions annually, with a loss of $4.75 billion last year.
As long as the Trump administration is in the White House, it doesn't seem likely that tax credits for EVs are coming back.
Even though Rivian stock is up this year, I don't think overall momentum is going to last if we do see U.S. demand for electric vehicles weaken in the short term.","This is a loaded question, and the answer isn't an exact science. Rivian Automotive (RIVN +1.54%) held some serious traction in 2022 and 2023, but stalled out in 2024 -- it dropped from 167% revenue growth to 12%. So what happened? And what's Rivian to do?

As I see it, Rivian faces two major challenges over the next three years: Getting more affordable car models to market, and handling the loss of the tax credits that electric vehicle (EV) companies enjoyed.

Other automakers have been sounding the alarm on EV demand. Stellantis (STLA +1.61%), maker of the popular RAM pickup trucks, cancelled its REV pickup due to weakening North American demand. General Motors announced last week that it will be cutting back its EV production due to the loss of tax credits, and subsequent weaker demand.

These are clear indicators of a potentially major problem for a company attempting to solely sell electric SUVs and trucks in the United States.

An expensive stock

Rivian stock has lost 90% of its value since going public. Even after that decline, the company remains at over $16 billion in market value, but is losing billions annually and is seeing slower top-line growth.

One of the often overlooked, but very important things to keep in mind here is the actual valuation trends for auto stocks. The established players, most of which all have their own EV lineups, trade at around 10 times earnings. A few might trade slightly higher, such as Ford Motor Company, which trades at 15 times earnings.

But as a whole, investors just aren't overly enthused about giving high valuations to most car stocks. Admittedly there's a differentiation between the traditional names and the new guys. These new players are getting traded on different metrics, such as price-to-sales, speculation, and so on, but I don't see them maintaining this momentum for the long term.

After a certain point, earnings are what matter, and EV companies like Rivian and Tesla are all going to answer to it eventually. Because of that, I see eventual downward pressure on the valuations given to names like Rivian.

Back to gross losses

Last quarter, gross results shifted back to losses of $206 million after two quarters of gross profits. In all, Rivian is reporting net losses of billions annually, with a loss of $4.75 billion last year. Given that its working on adding new and more affordable models, expenses don't seem likely to lessen in the coming months.

Perhaps the one big differentiator here is the partnership, and $1 billion in equity gained from Volkswagen back in July. This clear partnership is the redeeming indicator for this stock. Volkwagen is a global company, and a partnership with it has some significant potential in terms of Rivian being able to provide its software for use.

This is just a piece of the $5.8 billion agreement between the two companies. Still, this is a long path forward, and as stated, without tax credits for EVs, I think the industry will struggle to create the same momentum it has enjoyed in the United States, which is one of the prime auto markets.

The next three years

When trying to figure out Rivian's potential over the next three years, one has to consider the costs and time it'll take for Rivian to ramp up its cheaper models, as well as how it's going to manage what could become a tougher market. In its most recent quarter, production, deliveries, and total auto revenues were down year over year. Total revenue expanded thanks to increased software revenue, which reached $376 million last quarter.

Rivian is working to bring lower-priced options to market, such as the R2 SUV, which will theoretically help attract more customers to the table, but it is still priced at $45,000. That's not so cheap when you consider the number of traditional options available, like cars that you don't need to charge, and that have better maintenance and repair infrastructure.

While electric vehicles certainly have their place, the current environment doesn't seem primed to create huge increases in demand for EVs right now. As long as the Trump administration is in the White House, it doesn't seem likely that tax credits for EVs are coming back.

Because of that, the next three years don't seem overly bullish for automakers that only produce electric vehicles. Even though Rivian stock is up this year, I don't think overall momentum is going to last if we do see U.S. demand for electric vehicles weaken in the short term.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/839214/car-batteries.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:18:18.983722

The bottom line is that we need more people working in renewables to deliver the projects ahead of us. The good news is that many of the skills we need already exist - in oil & gas, mining, the armed forces, and trades. Our job is to connect that talent with the huge opportunity we have in our sector. The skills gap is most visible in technical roles. In Europe, wind alone supports 370,000 jobs and is projected to hit 600,000 by 2030. Two-thirds of those won’t require a university degree. For me, one of the most powerful stories of the energy transition is the creation of long-term, high-quality careers. To make that a reality, we need to attract talent from all walks of life by building meaningful roles in the regions where renewables are developed - often far from capital cities. These careers not only power the transition but also strengthen local economies and shape the next generation of clean energy professionals.

That torque you feel after hitting the accelerator of an electric car happens because of special magnets used in motors.

It involves separating ionic clay that the company will source from its new mines in Chile and Brazil.

“What our customers need is a robust supply chain that is separated from the geopolitical issues that are going on today,” Broadhurst said.

(The Center Square) – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has reintroduced yet another bill to support the U.S. oil and natural gas industry.

Cruz on Monday reintroduced the Natural Gas Export Expansion Act, which would expedite the federal approval process for exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG). He first introduced it in 2021 and again in 2023 as the Biden administration took more than 200 actions against the industry, including halting permits and banning LNG exports.

“Increasing U.S. energy exports is good for America, and there is no bigger energy producer than the state of Texas,” Cruz told The Center Square. The legislation he has proposed now for the third time “expedites permits for LNG exporters to ensure that Texas-produced gas can be sent to our allies around the world. It will enhance American energy dominance, create jobs, and drive investment.”

He did so as the industry in his home state continues to break multiple production and methane emissions reduction records, The Center Square first reported.

The U.S. became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017 for the first time since 1957, led by Texas and Louisiana “primarily because of increased LNG exports,” according to the EIA.

If Texas were its own country, it would be the world's third-largest producer of natural gas and the fourth-largest producer of oil. In the first half of 2022, the U.S. became the world's largest LNG exporter, led by Texas and Louisiana, according to EIA data.

The bill has Republican cosponsors; U.S. Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, is introducing companion legislation in the House.

It would amend the Natural Gas Act to expedite non-free trade agreement (FTA) export permits enabling an accelerated application approval process. It doesn’t change existing restrictions for some countries, clarifying that “any nation subject to sanctions or trade restrictions imposed by the United States is excluded from expedited approval.” It also states that the president or Congress “may designate nations that may be excluded from expedited approval.”

“Congress finds that expanding natural gas exports will lead to increased investment and development of domestic supplies of natural gas that will contribute to job growth and economic development,” the bill states.

Cruz also reintroduced the Protect LNG Act earlier this year to ensure courts can’t vacate previously authorized LNG permits. It would prevent courts from halting LNG permits when a lawsuit is filed and require that cases only be filed in the circuit court jurisdiction where the LNG facility is located, not the location of a federal agency that issues the requested permits, The Center Square reported.

If signed into law, it would prevent federal judges in Washington, D.C., from halting LNG permits in Texas, as they did last year. In 2023, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a $24 billion Rio Grande LNG Terminal and Rio Bravo Pipeline project in South Texas. Last year, three federal judges in Washington, D.C., halted the permits.

Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño, Jr., a Democrat, argued they took “unprecedented” action and “threatened thousands of jobs, undermined economic growth in Texas, and put future investment in renewable energy infrastructure at risk,” The Center Square reported.

Houston Mayor John Whitmire, a Democrat, also blasted former President Joe Biden’s LNG ban, saying it was “a huge mistake,” The Center Square reported. Biden suspended LNG exports as Europe was “begging for it. They need it for national security,” Whitmire said, adding that Texas exports helped lessen European dependence on Russian oil.

After Russia invaded Ukraine and failed European wind and solar projects couldn’t meet demand, oil and natural gas and electricity prices skyrocketed. European countries found themselves scrambling to obtain reliable energy sources, turning to Texas. U.S. LNG exports provided a lifeline “largely thanks to Texas energy production and export infrastructure,” Texans for Natural Gas argued, The Center Square exclusively reported.

Under the Trump administration, the RGV FERC approvals were reinstated, Biden administration policies were reversed and new policies were implemented to “unleash” domestic production, including expediting permitting approvals.

The U.S. leads the world in LNG exports, with the Port of Corpus Christi leading LNG exports in Texas, The Center Square reported.

Nearly 25% of U.S. natural gas reserves are located in Texas; 30% of the largest hundred natural gas fields in the U.S. are in Texas, The Center Square reported.

The U.S. LNG industry “contributes a whopping $43.8 billion toward the U.S. GDP, and generates $11 billion in tax and royalty revenues for local, state and federal governments,” The Center Square reported.

Ramona Timmons, who lives in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood, bought a two-meter-wide balcony solar unit this summer.
Körnig of BSW says there is a “very large potential” for uptake of balcony solar across the 30 million residential units in Germany’s two-family or multi-family houses.
“There are legal gray areas — authorities often haven’t distinguished between rooftop and balcony solar,” he says.
The British government is considering allowing balcony solar to be installed in households across the country as part of its solar power strategy.","The sun was shining brightly one August morning in Möckernkiez, a minimalist housing complex beside the leafy Gleisdreieck Park in central Berlin.

Inaugurated in 2018, the innovative, cooperative-run estate is a model of green living. More than 3,000 residents across 471 apartments in the car-free district receive heat and electricity via clean energy such as biogas and rooftop solar.

And two years ago, the residents received a novel boost to their green energy supply when 70 solar panels were installed on their balconies. Today, the panels are dotted all across building façades, hanging beside plants and racks of drying clothes.

“It was the wish of several residents,” says Bernhard Drechsel, technical director at Möckernkiez. “They came together and proposed this. They wanted to make an extra individual effort.”

In doing so, the residents joined the ranks of what are today more than a million people across Germany who have installed balkonkraftwerk (balcony solar), an increasingly popular renewable energy technology that is democratizing access to solar across Europe’s largest economy. While each unit currently only produces a modest amount of energy, the cumulative impact of their large-scale adoption is contributing to Germany’s target of sourcing 80 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

Balcony solar — also known as “plug-in” solar, since it can be connected directly to a wall outlet — is accessible to practically anyone that has minimal outdoor space with decent sunlight, including those who may not even have a balcony.

Installation, which requires little more than plugging in the appliance, is easily done without an electrician. And thanks to falling production costs and government subsidies for balcony solar units, which can be bought online or in stores for just a few hundred euros, it’s easier than ever for individuals to produce their own green energy.

The result is that these panels are opening the solar market to huge numbers of German citizens, including renters previously excluded from access to domestic solar generation due to red tape for rooftop panels, which often requires users to own their residence and to obtain permission from a local utility.

“Plug-in solar devices help reduce household energy costs and create greater energy independence for citizens, regardless of subsidies or large investments,” says Carsten Körnig, managing director of the German Solar Association (BSW), which represents more than 1,000 solar companies across the country. “They also increase acceptance of climate protection measures and the urgently needed global energy transition.”

Balcony solar emerged in Germany around the 2000s but didn’t catch on until a few years ago, according to Körnig, when policy changes brought plug-in solar devices “out of their niche” and turned them into a consumer product. In 2019, for example, the government passed its technical regulations for plug-in solar devices, allowing them to use standard electrical plugs and feed into the grid via their in-built inverters.

“That made a big difference in Germany,” says Berit Müller, managing director of the Berlin Brandenburg section of the German Solar Energy Society, the country’s oldest consumer protection association for renewables. “Before, obtaining a permit required a lot of paperwork. Now it’s a lot easier [to obtain permission for] than rooftop solar. Balcony solar has exploded in popularity since then.”

Experts like Müller say that the pandemic lockdown also helped fuel the surge in popularity, as people spent more time at home, allowing them to carry out household upgrades. More recently, escalating energy prices in Europe linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made balcony solar even more economically attractive, he adds.

Last year, further policies were passed, with Germany streamlining its regulatory framework for balcony solar.

The registration process was “simplified considerably,” recognizing that plug-in solar devices are essentially power-generating household appliances, says Müller. Last fall, it also became mandatory for landlords and homeowners to approve the use of plug-in solar devices for tenants, whereas in the past it was up to their discretion, if they were asked.

As a result, the take-up has been lightspeed. As of late June, 1,009,390 balcony solar systems were registered with the German Federal Network Agency, including more than 220,000 added in the first half of 2025 alone. Given many haven’t been officially registered, Müller says that the real figure is likely to be two or three times higher.

Ramona Timmons, who lives in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood, bought a two-meter-wide balcony solar unit this summer. “I’d been thinking about it for a few years,” said Timmons, an office manager who lives with her partner. “The more energy we can produce without coal, the better for the planet.”

Rock-bottom prices have sweetened the deal: Timmons bought a 800W unit for just €80 after receiving a €250 subsidy from Berlin city authorities.

“It’s basically no cost,” she adds. “The installation was so easy.”

The practical advantages of plug-in solar devices, which quickly pay for themselves, are convincing more and more people. A YouGov survey commissioned by BSW at the end of 2024 found that around eight percent of the 2,043 respondents said they planned to purchase a plug-in solar device within the next twelve months. A further nine percent said they could imagine purchasing a plug-in solar device at some point in the future.

Körnig of BSW says there is a “very large potential” for uptake of balcony solar across the 30 million residential units in Germany’s two-family or multi-family houses. “The solar boom on Germany’s balconies is likely to continue,” he says.

Yet not everyone is convinced. Dieter Wettig, who has a ground-floor apartment in Möckernkiez, says that even if he did have a balcony he would not install a plug-in unit due to the emissions made during their manufacturing.

“Electricity from balcony power plants is not entirely emission-free, mainly due to manufacturing processes,” he says, expressing a preference for wind or hydropower.

Wettig nevertheless added that, during operation, balcony solar systems are “practically emission-free, quiet, and climate-friendly … its contribution to the decarbonization of energy supply therefore remains significant.”

But given their relatively low capacity and the fact that the market is still in its infancy, even proponents admit that plug-in solar devices are only expected to contribute a low single-digit percentage to solar generation capacity in Germany, despite their popularity and increasing prevalence. Regulations currently limit each system to a maximum 800 watts — enough to power household appliances like refrigerators — though if there is enough space, multiple units can be installed.

Dylan Ryan, a lecturer in mechanical and energy engineering at Edinburgh Napier University in Scotland, adds that while balcony solar is undoubtedly becoming more attractive, geographical and political contexts such as electricity prices, building regulations and weather will dictate their popularity elsewhere.

“Germany is further south than Scotland, so there’s more sun, and electricity is more costly there,” he says. “It’s a much more clear-cut offer. But here it’s not the same.”

Ryan, who has calculated the effectiveness of balcony solar in certain settings, adds that the fast-growing market still has a number of planning, workforce and legal issues to iron out.

“There are legal gray areas — authorities often haven’t distinguished between rooftop and balcony solar,” he says. “And at this stage, there’s a lack of expert advice for the public. More workers need to be trained.”

Some manufacturers don’t meet the required safety levels either, which could lead to fires — even if there’s been little sign of that so far, says Ryan.

But those issues could soon be addressed.

In order to guarantee technical safety and to create legal certainty, the world’s first balcony solar product standard is being developed by BSW and will be published in December, enabling manufacturers and testing laboratories to produce and test plug-in solar devices in accordance with the standard.

Batteries are also being developed to store energy from balcony solar units, allowing energy to be used at a later date, increasing the benefits to users.

And the market continues to scale up, in Germany and abroad. Earlier this year, Utah legislators streamlined regulations for homeowners to buy and install them — and Vermont is set to follow suit. The British government is considering allowing balcony solar to be installed in households across the country as part of its solar power strategy. Meanwhile, sun-kissed Spain is emerging as a “rapidly growing” market.

“The German example can be implemented worldwide,” says Körnig.",https://reasonstobecheerful.world/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_8745-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 11:20:56.469006

In the three months ending on Sept. 30, Norfolk Southern moved nearly 8.8 million tons of coal for U.S. power plants, according to a financial presentation on Thursday, a 6% increase from the year before.

That’s the reverse of a year ago, when the railroad moved 8.8 million tons for overseas markets. This year, the railroad’s export tonnage fell 16%.

Export coal has fallen this year amid foreign competition in metallurgical coal, the kind used to make steel.

Norfolk Southern taps southern West Virginia’s coal reserves, which are rich in met coal. It is shipped by rail to the port of Norfolk, Virginia.

Rival CSX has seen a similar change in its coal shipment patterns. Norfolk Southern is preparing for a merger with the nation’s biggest rail carrier, Union Pacific.

The shift in coal shipments reflects two other factors. One is the rising price of natural gas, which makes coal more competitive to generate electricity.

It could as well reflect the energy policy preferences of the Trump administration, which has favored fossil fuels instead of renewables.

The White House has ordered at least one coal generator in Michigan to stay on the grid past its retirement date, and there could be others.

For the first nine months of the year, Norfolk Southern’s domestic coal shipments surged 11%, while its export tonnage declined 7%.

Challenges and the path forward The working group underscored that policy coordination, legislative certainty, and efficient institutional capacity remain the main prerequisites for success.","Namibia’s emerging energy mix – spanning oil, gas, renewables and green hydrogen – is poised to transform the national economy by the end of the decade, with the combined potential to add more than US$3 billion in annual GDP and create tens of thousands of jobs.

At the Namibia Public-Private Forum held in Windhoek from 23 to 24 October 2025, Dr Grant Muller of the Namibia Green Hydrogen Association and Eduardo Rodriguez of the Namibia Petroleum Operators Association co-chaired the Energy, Oil, Gas and Green Hydrogen Working Group, outlining a consolidated strategy to align the sectors with the Sixth National Development Plan (NDP6) and the Swapo Manifesto Implementation Plan.

Integrated growth vision

The working group described the four sectors as complementary and interdependent, forming the backbone of Namibia’s industrial transformation. The approach positions green hydrogen, hydrocarbons, renewables, and nuclear energy as mutually reinforcing pillars that, together, can unlock Namibia’s long-term energy security, fiscal stability, and export competitiveness.

According to projections tabled at the forum, the combined industries could lift national GDP by between 6.8% and 25% depending on the scale of investment and production achieved by 2030.

Muller said the transformation “requires no direct government equity or funding, only a stable and predictable policy environment.”

The group emphasised that precise, enabling regulation was the key to unlocking multi-billion-dollar private investments and accelerating industrialisation under NDP6.

Namibia’s new export frontier

Namibia’s green hydrogen and ammonia projects are projected to produce 2.2 million tonnes of green ammonia and 2 million tonnes of direct reduced iron (DRI) per year by 2030, surpassing the initial targets of 1.3 million tonnes.

Once commercialised, the sector could inject about US$2 billion annually into GDP and create more than 30,000 direct jobs, with an estimated multiplier effect of two to three times across supporting industries.

The working group said green hydrogen has now moved from feasibility to the financing phase, but lengthy approval processes and fragmented institutional oversight constrain the sector’s growth.

It recommended the establishment of a single inter-ministerial governance framework to coordinate permitting for land, servitudes, environmental clearances and access to export infrastructure.

The group also called for the government to designate flagship hydrogen projects as nationally strategic and to assign a responsible entity with the authority to fast-track approvals and coordination.

On financing, developers are requesting the enactment of sector-specific legislation to provide investors with protection and legal certainty for large-scale project finance. A globally competitive fiscal regime, benchmarked against hydrogen-producing countries such as Mauritania and Saudi Arabia, was also proposed to improve Namibia’s position in the global market.

Converting discoveries into production

In the offshore Orange Basin, Namibia’s oil and gas prospects have gained international attention following discoveries by TotalEnergies, Shell and Galp Energia. The working group said these discoveries could propel Namibia into the ranks of oil-producing nations within the decade if development is accelerated and licensing delays are resolved.

The group projects that by 2030, Namibia could have three final investment decisions (FIDs) and at least one floating production storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) in operation. This initial phase could contribute 6.8% GDP growth, equivalent to US$1 billion annually, and create about 12,000 jobs.

In a high-development scenario of four FPSOs, production could reach 150,000 barrels per day – about 55 million barrels per year – generating approximately US$3.3 billion in GDP contribution and supporting more than 45,000 direct and indirect jobs.

To maintain investor confidence, the working group recommended a phased, flexible implementation of the National Upstream Local Content Policy, with differentiated requirements for the exploration, appraisal, development, and production stages.

It also called for the regular awarding of new exploration licences, noting that none had been issued since 2022. The group urged the Ministry of Mines and Energy to finalise outstanding offers from previous bid rounds and to institute at least one annual licensing round to sustain investor momentum.

To reduce duplication and enhance efficiency, operators are proposing a system to facilitate the trading and sharing of seismic and well information among licensed companies, thereby accelerating prospect appraisal and shortening exploration timelines.

The group further proposed that Namibia ratify the ICSID and New York Conventions, which provide international arbitration mechanisms to safeguard investor rights and to introduce rebalancing mechanisms in petroleum contracts. These would allow contract terms to be adjusted fairly in the event of material changes, such as tax reforms, regulatory shifts, or force majeure events.

Expanding grid and market access

Namibia’s renewable energy programme, supported under NDP6, targets installing 400 MW of renewable capacity by 2030, up from the currently installed 367 MW. Solar and biomass remain the main focus areas, with projections suggesting that local photovoltaic manufacturing alone could contribute N$37 billion to GDP by 2050.

However, the group identified significant infrastructure constraints and minimal transmission capacity for electricity exports.

It called for urgent bilateral engagement with South Africa, Zambia and Botswana to explore grid interconnection and expansion opportunities, including greater utilisation of the Zambezi interconnector and flexibility to allow renewable producers access to the HVDC transmission line.

To encourage private-sector participation in energy infrastructure, the working group recommended legislative amendments that would allow private companies to invest directly in grid expansion and transmission projects.

Regarding the Modified Single Buyer (MSB) market model, the group requested that embedded-generation projects operating under take-or-pay agreements be exempted from complex scheduling and balancing rules, which they say discourage investment.

It further proposed allowing Regional Electricity Distributors (REDs) and Local Authorities (LAs) to enter short-term power purchase agreements – up to 3 years – if they can secure power at a price below NamPower’s current tariff levels, enabling cost reductions for end users.

Employment and fiscal impact

If implemented as planned, the energy, oil, gas and hydrogen portfolio could collectively generate more than 75,000 direct jobs by 2030, with indirect employment effects exceeding 200,000.

The combined GDP contribution is projected to rise to between US$2 billion and US$3.3 billion per annum, depending on the scale of oil output and hydrogen exports.

Renewables are expected to add about 800 direct jobs, while the hydrogen and hydrocarbons sectors will account for the bulk of employment growth through industrialisation and infrastructure development.

The plan aligns with NDP6 economic targets, including achieving 7% annual GDP growth, expanding industrial exports, and supporting the Swapo Manifesto goal of transforming energy into the country’s number-one economic enabler.

Challenges and the path forward

The working group underscored that policy coordination, legislative certainty, and efficient institutional capacity remain the main prerequisites for success.

It is recommended that the government establish an Inter-Ministerial Energy Coordination Mechanism, with representation from the Ministries of Mines and Energy, Environment, Finance, and Industrialisation, as well as NamPower, NamWater, and NamPort.

The mechanism would ensure faster project approval, harmonised regulation, and alignment of infrastructure investments with NDP6 priorities.

As part of the following steps, the group proposed that all pending Energy and Petroleum policy instruments be finalised within six months, and that Namibia position its strategic projects as regional models for energy transition partnerships.",https://africanminingmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/exxon-mobile-corp_oil-exploration.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 11:21:12.186802

One of the companies that has been underpinning this growth is Fluor and we sat down with Sunil Vyas, Technical Director for Business Incubation and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) Subject Matter Expert at the company.

We talked about the company’s evolving role in the carbon capture sector, its work with emerging climate technologies, and how shifting global policies are shaping the pace of decarbonization.

Could you start by telling us about your background and current role at Fluor?

I’ve been with Fluor for about 26 years, based in Southern California. I started as a process engineer working on syn-gas generation projects for hydrogen, methanol, ammonia. Later, I joined our carbon capture technology team, which was developing post-combustion capture solutions even back in the late 2000s.

People were already interested, but they were still trying to understand the true costs and implications. One of the major early projects was the Boundary Dam competition in Canada where Fluor was one of the bidders. I led the process engineering side. Had we won, my career might have gone in a different direction.

A few years later, I moved into corporate strategy and now split my time between two roles. One is leading business incubation—working with startup technology companies focused on the energy transition. We don’t invest or take equity; we act as engineering partners to help them scale and commercialize. The idea is, when they reach demonstration or commercial scale, we already have a trusted relationship.

The other role is as Fluor’s CCUS subject-matter expert. That means working on strategy, client engagements, and helping to change the perception that Fluor is only an EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction). We are that, but we also license our own carbon capture technologies.

Where does Fluor stand today in the CCUS space?

We play three roles. First, as a technology licenser. Our Econamine FG Plus post-combustion capture technology has been around for over three decades. We’ve licensed about 30 plants—mostly smaller, older facilities. The technology has evolved significantly since then, especially in reducing energy use and improving solvent management.

Right now, we have four projects in or near completion of the FEED phase across the U.S., Canada, and Europe, covering power generation, waste-to-energy, and refinery reformers. On the pre-combustion side, we also license Fluor Solvent technology for removing CO2 from natural gas or syngas streams.

Second, we are an EPC provider, historically technology-neutral. We’ve built capture projects using other technologies. One example is Shell’s Quest project in Alberta, where we handled pre-FEED through EPC. We’re also working on Heidelberg’s oxy-combustion project in Germany.

Third, we’re active in emerging technologies. This is where we differ from most EPCs, we engage with startups early. We’ve worked with CarbonFree, which produces calcium carbonate and HCl from CO2; with several e-fuels developers; and we’ve signed an MOU with Carbfix for mineralization storage, where CO2 is injected into basalt to form rock.

“When startups work with experienced engineering partners, it boosts bankability. For us, the partnership also helps us stay “smart.”” – Sunil Vyas, Fluor

We’ve also worked with direct air capture (DAC) players like CarbonCapture Inc. Unfortunately, DAC has faced headwinds lately after the DOE cancelled the DAC Hub awards in the U.S., and we were part of four of those proposals. But we expect smaller projects to continue in Europe and Canada.

Lastly, we’re part of the Carbon to Value Initiative, a carbontech accelerator now entering its fifth year. It’s been invaluable in connecting us with startups and keeping us close to where innovation is happening.

That accelerator connection ties to the “bankability” issue startups often face. Is Fluor’s engagement partly about improving project credibility?

Exactly. When startups work with experienced engineering partners, it boosts bankability. For us, the partnership also helps us stay “smart.” By engaging with early-stage technologies, our subject-matter experts stay current on where the market is heading—whether in carbon capture, energy storage, or advanced nuclear.

So while we’re helping startups scale, we’re also helping ourselves evolve and stay aligned with the next generation of technologies.

You mentioned that your post-combustion technology has improved. How so compared to a decade ago?

The biggest advances have been in energy efficiency, environmental performance, and especially solvent maintenance.

Every flue gas has contaminants like oxygen, SOx, NOx, that degrade amines over time. Most systems use a reclaimer intermittently, which causes performance swings. We operate solvent maintenance continuously, like a pool filter, keeping degradation products low at all times.

That allows what we call “day one operation” indefinitely—consistent performance without fluctuations. This was successfully tested at TCM in Mongstad, Norway.

What capture rates can your systems achieve today?

Historically, clients asked for 90%. Now, almost all designs target 95% CO2 capture, and we can achieve that. Above 95%, costs start to rise steeply, so it’s about finding the right balance. There’s no real regulatory mandate for 95%, but many projects set it as a target, especially in Europe where some funding models or offtake agreements tie incentives to reaching that threshold.

“The key is that 45Q remains intact” – Sunil, Vyas, Fluor

Do your current projects involve enhanced oil recovery (EOR)?

None of our recent projects have included EOR, though we’d be open to it. The updated 45Q tax credit, which increased utilization value to $85 per ton, could revive interest if oil prices support it.

On the topic of 45Q—what happens if greenhouse gas reporting requirements are rolled back in the U.S.?

For Fluor, probably minimal impact. But for the broader CCUS industry, inconsistent federal rules could create a patchwork of state regulations, potentially chaotic.

That said, most companies are under investor pressure to report emissions anyway. Transparency has become tied to credibility and access to capital. If reporting were relaxed, it might slow progress but not stop it.

Relevant: EPA Rollback Set To Erase Carbon Emissions Reporting And Limits

The key is that 45Q remains intact, and that’s huge. While other clean-energy incentives faced changes this year, 45Q was strengthened, particularly for utilization. So despite headwinds like DOE cancellations, CCUS in the U.S. still has momentum.

How do you see regional trends like the U.S. versus Europe and beyond?

Europe’s arrow is pointing up. You’ve got Northern Lights operating, Heidelberg’s Brevik cement project capturing CO2, and new UK government funding for capture projects. Even when it’s a competitor’s technology, every successful project lifts the entire industry.

In the U.S., things are slower at the moment, but globally, we’re seeing strong government support in Europe. We’re focused mainly on North America and Europe, with offices in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, though activity there is still limited.

Data centers and AI are creating massive new power demands. How do you see carbon capture fitting into that?

Data centers are a hot topic. Their power demand is huge and they want it fast. Options range from natural gas to nuclear, geothermal, and renewables plus storage.

If developers go with gas-fired generation, it’s unlikely they’ll include capture immediately, it takes longer to build. But they can design carbon-capture-ready plants, making it easier to retrofit later.

Hyperscalers are new players that have never built power plants before. They’re learning fast, and if they’re willing to pay a premium for clean power, it could accelerate innovation across several technologies.

Finally, what’s next for Fluor in this space?

We’re focused on helping both established companies and startups move from concept to commercial scale. We want to be there when these technologies scale up, because that’s when decarbonization really happens.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sunil-vyas.png,N,,2025-10-27 12:09:45.110703

A record number of Americans went electric vehicle shopping last quarter. Between July and September, EVs accounted for 10% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. and almost 30% in California. Cue the confetti cannons? Maybe hold off. This EV demand surge was partly a mad dash before federal tax credits vanished on September 30.

Permitting reform to the rescue?

Permitting reform writ large is having a moment. It’s one of very few initiatives—along with National Seersucker Day —that both Democrats and Republicans can get behind. California has been running an EV station permitting reform experiment for over a decade.

Our 482 cities and 58 counties are responsible for permitting new EV-charging infrastructure. That adds up to 540 potential bottlenecks and a thicket of local rules to navigate. In 2015, the state tried to streamline this permitting process. Under AB 1236, localities must approve an EV-charging-station permit unless there’s substantial evidence of specific and adverse impacts on public health or safety. When many local governments ignored this directive, legislators upped the ante with a “shot clock.” Under AB 970, cities and counties have 20 or 40 days to make a decision, depending on the size of the project. If the timer runs out, the permit is automatically approved.

So how is permitting reform working on the ground? I live in Piedmont, a three-square-mile city with high incomes and green politics. Over a year ago, I blogged about our local Shell gas station’s proposal to re-invent itself as an EV-charging hub. That project has given me a front-row seat to watch EV infrastructure permitting reform in action.

Developers first applied for a permit in 2024. During the long and deliberative process, community members raised concerns about noise, traffic, and crime. When the city of Piedmont finally approved the permit last November, approval was subject to 45 conditions: signage, fencing, security plans, operating-hour limits, staffing, noise-mitigation measures, picnic benches, lighting, landscaping, canopies – the list was long.

In March of this year, the state Attorney General issued a pointed alert to all local governments reminding them of their obligation to streamline EV-charger permitting and remove unreasonable barriers to entry. After that letter was issued, the Shell project withdrew its original permit and re-applied under the streamlined process. Developers could remove requirements that the design review process had imposed —no canopies, no benches, no limits on operating hours. The city, facing a ticking shot clock, had no choice but to issue the permit in a matter of days. The neighbors, as far as I understand, felt blindsided.

I’ve been curious to know whether similar stories have been playing out across California. I went hunting for permit data and found this treasure trove. The team at Shovels has been building an impressive dataset that tracks building permits, contractors, and project attributes. They generously shared their county-level permit data for publicly accessible EV charging projects in California. The graphic below summarizes how permitting waiting times have been falling over time.

The graph clearly shows that permitting times have been decreasing in recent years. If you squint, it looks like wait times started to decrease after the AB970 “shot clock” took effect, and decreased further after the stern reminder from the AG. Correlation need not imply causation, but these data suggest that California permitting reform has helped to grease the wheels of EV infrastructure development in communities across the state. Presumably, with shorter permit turn-arounds comes fewer costly conditions and lower barriers to entry.

Where the permitting reform rubber meets the road

There’s an emerging consensus, thank you Ezra Klein, that progressives have become so good at blocking “bad” development that we’ve completely hamstrung our ability to build good and necessary projects. At a moment when decarbonization headwinds are blowing strong, clearing permitting roadblocks and limiting NIMBY veto power seems particularly urgent.

One lesson I think we are learning in California is that permitting reform isn’t just about rewriting the rules, it’s about making sure people know what the rules are, and that someone’s keeping time (with a stop watch!) to make sure the rules are followed. My hometown anecdote also has me thinking harder about the losing side of this reform experiment because the NIMBY’s in this story are my neighbors. It’s painfully clear that the NIMBY veto has had far too much power and needs to be reined in. That said, if “deemed approved” means “no one asked the neighbors,” things can get messy. Permitting reform is not going to be a one-and-done rule change, it’s an ongoing experiment in balancing community voice with the urgency of building the clean infrastructure we need.",https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-26-at-7.42.13-pm.png,N,,2025-10-27 08:58:55.075436

A study last year by project planning software developer Paces that focused on New York and Illinois said prospective acreage and potential renewable project site capacity are in decline. Moreover, developers often face opposition to large projects on optimal land from rural landowners and neighboring communities.

One way to open up greenfield acreage to solar is to demonstrate how well a project can fit with the life and commerce of the region. Last spring, Texas-based Vesper Energy commissioned its 600 MW (AC) Hornet Solar project, the first of a trio of projects that will bring 1 GW of new solar capacity along with 400 MW of storage to the Texas panhandle. In addition to providing renewable energy to the ERCOT grid, the project’s 3,800 acres is also hosting upwards of 2,500 sheep grazing among the rows of tracking PV modules.

Zach Wald, vice president of engineering, procurement and construction at Vesper, told pv magazine USA that the key to success in rural solar development is to meet early and often with the community and stakeholders at all levels.

“Our community affairs team really did a great job of going out, meeting individuals and spending a spending a lot of time explaining what solar looks like,” Wald said. “What’s the process like and what does it mean for them?”

In the case of Hornet Solar, the discussions involved how the project would exist in conjunction with vegetation that was important to pollinators, such as insects, which are a vital part of agriculture. Wald said that concerns about the pollinator mix for a given prospective site and other agrivoltaics issues are not just good for business but are part of the company’s core principles and guidance to be as environmentally responsible as possible.

“A lot of counties require a report on pollinator mixes, but even if they don’t we’re going to do it anyway,” he said. “That’s one of the benefits of solar. While the footprint at Hornet might be 3,800 acres, there is a lot of open space between the panels. Pollinator mixes and grazing sheep, like we have at Hornet, are perfect use cases for the land while you are generating the energy.”

Co-locating sheep with solar is an interesting development. Vesper reports the site also is patrolled by 11 herding dogs monitoring their charges. According to Wald, sheep grazing on large-scale rural solar projects has evolved industry wide over the last five years or so. Such projects don’t have a lot of moving parts (trackers move sedately and don’t startle the animals) and support lot of growing grass.

“We tried out goats, but they didn’t work so well,” Wald said.

Goats are too rambunctious, perhaps, and have a tendency to climb things. You don’t want goats on your solar array.

The project includes more than 1.36 million Boviet bifacial solar modules mounted on Array Technology Duratrack HZ V3 single-axis trackers. Sungrow supplied 195 of its 3600 inverters.

Hornet Solar and its follow-on projects, Hornet Solar II and Nazareth, each planned as 200 MW (AC) arrays with 200 MW of storage (the original Hornet project does not have storage), are located in what is essentially an optimal location.

“That area of West Texas is just great for solar in general,” Wald said. “It has all the characteristics you’re looking for. It’s nice flat land, lots of sunshine and a transmission line running right through there with load available. So, when searching for a perfect solar site, that’s the blend you’re looking for.”

Again, Wald credits early engagement with the landowners and the community with enabling Vesper to lease the land necessary to move such a significant solar project forward. You need to have a lot of conversations and answer a lot of questions, he said. On top of that, a developer needs to be able to move forward on the project quickly once the deal is made so as not to generate any bad blood.

“I’ll just say as a general construction practice, especially in solar, you want the planning to take a long time and you want construction to take a short time, right?” Wald said. “That’s a successful project.”

An agrivoltaics mindset is essential for gaining access to the dwindling number of greenfield potential project sites that are still available. Each region will have different needs and concerns.

The opportunities are out there. Luigi Resta, president and CEO of Utah-based developer rPlus Energies told pv magazine USA that utility-scale solar projects are generally welcomed by landowners and rural communities in his part of the country. The company’s Pleasant Valley Solar projects in Idaho are situated on flat sage brush high-plains desert that doesn’t have much value as agricultural land. The landowners derive more income from leases than they would from farming or ranching.

“Solar is kind of the highest and best use of this rural land,” Resta said.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Dog-at-Vesper-2-1-1200x835.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 11:21:50.898657

The expanding applications in pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and emerging energy sectors, including small modular reactors (SMRs), present fruitful avenues for market players. Increasing collaborations among industry, academia, and governments to develop cutting-edge microreactor designs and materials add momentum, allowing companies to tap into new industries and geographies.

Regulatory frameworks globally emphasize safety, environmental sustainability, and energy efficiency, which enhances the adoption of microreactor systems over conventional batch reactors. Stringent compliance requirements, especially in pharmaceutical and chemical productions, heighten the need for advanced technologies that offer precise control while meeting environmental standards. Different regions witness varying regulations that encourage the implementation of microreactor technology through grants, tax incentives, and pilot project support.

Top players in the market adopt strategies centered on intensive R&D investment to develop innovative, high-performance reactors and continuous flow systems. They form strategic partnerships, collaborations, divestments, and acquisitions to broaden technology portfolios and enhance market presence. For instance, in September 2025, Nano Nuclear Energy entered a letter of intent to transfer its ODIN low-pressure coolant microreactor technology to Cambridge Atom Works. This strategic move enables NANO Nuclear to concentrate on its gas-cooled microreactor lineup, including the KRONOS MMR, LOKI MMR, and ZEUS microreactors, while supporting expanding transatlantic partnerships on advanced nuclear technologies between the U.S. and UK.

“We’re a team of experienced professionals but we also think fresh about investing and fees,” said Arbor Avenue co-founder Neil Weissman.
Instead of working under contract, Arbor Avenue partners hold equity in &Partners, so they share success, rather than just fee income, with the national firm that stands behind them.
Local advisors help shape the national firm and its strategies.
“Arbor Avenue, with the national power of &Partners are disrupting financial services and investment management, for the better.” The practice is located in Ann Arbor with clients across Southeast Michigan and Northwest Ohio.","While so much in business has changed, one sector stands out as it operates much the same as when stock tickers dominated its offices.

Now, one Southeast Michigan-based independent practice, Arbor Avenue Private Wealth, has set out to lead disruption in personal financial services by doing things differently.

It starts with cutting fees and costs

Arbor Avenue combines big investment firm experience with a nimble, client-centered approach that works to be different in important ways for its clients. It starts with reducing fees and costs that clients may have been paying at other firms for many years but also may not see just by glancing at their statements. “We’re a team of experienced professionals but we also think fresh about investing and fees,” said Arbor Avenue co-founder Neil Weissman. “It was very difficult to find an environment like that, so we joined one to benefit our colleagues and our clients.”

No limits on types of investments

Arbor Avenue does not have limits, as many large firms do, on the types of investments it can offer its clients so they can work to protect and build their families’ financial futures. “We have the freedom to work with our clients in ways that we couldn’t before, including investments in commercial real estate and private equity,” Weissman added. “There’s no reason, now, for our clients to have to find another firm to be able to invest in the ways that they want, with carefully selected leaders in their sectors.”

Multi-generational family business

Another difference is that under its model, Arbor Avenue can work as a multi-generational family business, assuring its clients continuity in the future. “My sons, Mike and Rob, both investment pros in their own right, have joined us as partners,” said Ron Eppler, co-founder. “Erica Fowler, our invaluable director of operations and client service, is also a partner. We’re committed to the long-term future of our team, so our clients don’t have to worry about getting passed from advisor to advisor. Our clients appreciate that in years to come, they’ll be working with someone at Arbor Avenue they know and trust.”

A different kind of national partnership

The practice’s relationship with the fast-growing and pioneering national firm, &Partners, represents another key difference for Arbor Avenue, which was the sixth group in the country to affiliate with the firm that started in 2023. Instead of working under contract, Arbor Avenue partners hold equity in &Partners, so they share success, rather than just fee income, with the national firm that stands behind them. In less than two years, &Partners approached 90 teams nationwide, with more than 300 advisors, and nearly $50 billion in assets under management, providing strength and collaboration that all points toward client success. Local advisors help shape the national firm and its strategies.

“Our promise to clients is that we’ll serve as their Personal CFO,” added Mike Eppler. “We now have the system to do that and act, at all times, in their best interests.”

“We all hear a lot about disruption in business now,” added Rob Eppler. “Arbor Avenue, with the national power of &Partners are disrupting financial services and investment management, for the better.”

The practice is located in Ann Arbor with clients across Southeast Michigan and Northwest Ohio. More information is available at arboravenue.com.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/eppler-team-jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 17:04:49.248756

“This partnership underscores the University of Michigan’s commitment to global collaboration in addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the energy transition and the drive for more sustainable development,” said Jonathan Overpeck, Samuel A. Graham Dean of SEAS.
“Partnerships focused on Asia provide the opportunity for growing our research and innovation impact in society not just at home, but across the globe.","The University of Michigan, led by the School for Environment and Sustainability, the William Davidson Institute, and the Asian Development Bank, have signed a memorandum of understanding establishing a partnership to strengthen collaboration on sustainable development initiatives across Asia and the Pacific.

The collaboration aims to connect global knowledge across regions to support the clean energy transition across ADBs developing member countries and builds on shared commitments to inclusive, sustainable growth and country-led development.

Through this initiative, U-M and WDI will work collaboratively with ADB on a wide range of projects across the Asian region, including in clean energy and e-mobility, climate and health, water, food security, and biodiversity.

Experts from U-M and WDI will serve as academic research partners and collaborators to ADB’s teams and their counterparts in the bank’s developing member countries, ranging from government officials to stakeholders across industry and academia. Established in 1966 and based in Manila, ADB today has 69 member countries, 50 of which are from the Asia-Pacific region.

“This collaboration will help us tap into Michigan’s expertise and access global innovation to create more opportunities to advance inclusive and sustainable development in the region,” said Scott Morris, vice president of ADB.

“By joining forces with the University of Michigan and the William Davidson Institute, ADB is reinforcing our commitment to empowering communities with knowledge, skills, and access to solutions that will build resilience, drive economic opportunity, and shape a more prosperous future for Asia and the Pacific.”​

This announcement comes on the heels of Morris’s visit to U-M, where he participated in an event, “Powering Asia’s Future: Climate Innovation and the Energy Transition,” which was a wide-ranging discussion on the energy and climate transition across the continent and what it means for the world. The talk was followed by the panel discussion, “Great Lakes to the Pacific: Energy Transition Insights in Michigan and Asia.” Both events were sponsored by SEAS and WDI. Morris also visited Detroit, where he met with members of the SEAS Detroit Sustainability Clinic, Michigan Center and Newlab Detroit.

The partners will commission actionable research, engage in projects in ADB member countries, facilitate regional roundtable discussions, and host cross-learning activities — both in Asia and the Pacific and in Michigan — allowing for knowledge sharing and collaboration among policymakers and practitioners from ADB member countries and Michigan-based experts and decision-makers.

“This partnership underscores the University of Michigan’s commitment to global collaboration in addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the energy transition and the drive for more sustainable development,” said Jonathan Overpeck, Samuel A. Graham Dean of SEAS. “By connecting University of Michigan’s leadership in workforce and technology innovation and research with deep regional and local expertise across Asia and the Pacific, we can help advance equitable, resilient development. No one nation or region has all the answers, so the benefits of us learning from and with one another are very exciting.

“Partnerships focused on Asia provide the opportunity for growing our research and innovation impact in society not just at home, but across the globe. The climate crisis is a global problem that requires global solutions.”

SEAS brings the unparalleled strength in the interdisciplinary education, research and innovation that is needed to accelerate the energy transition and create a more resilient and sustainable planet.

Working across campus with WDI and ADB creates opportunities for partnerships between universities and other stakeholders in Asia and the Pacific to support a common goal of developing the leaders of tomorrow in a region that has the largest greenhouse gas emissions and is facing the most devastating impacts of the climate crisis.

The partners will continue to define and implement joint initiatives through mechanisms such as knowledge sharing, convenings, study tours, training programs, student internships, and access to shared publications.

Recognizing the critical link between human capital and sustainable growth, the collaboration will also promote training and entrepreneurship to connect innovators from ADB member countries with Michigan’s research institutions and entrepreneurship ecosystems and open opportunities for Michigan ventures to access Asian markets. WDI will lead efforts to foster cross-regional learning, business opportunities, technical training, and market access.

“This agreement reflects WDI’s deep belief that innovation and thriving ventures are central to building healthier, more sustainable futures,” said Wendy Taylor, president and CEO of WDI. “By working alongside the University of Michigan and the Asian Development Bank, we’re creating pathways for inclusive economic growth that engage communities, strengthen innovation ecosystems, and accelerate progress toward a clean energy future — from Detroit to Manila.”

The partnership also aims to accelerate e-mobility development by working with key stakeholders to support electric vehicle adoption, supply chain innovation, and workforce development, building on work to date. In July, with support from ADB, WDI released the report “Driving a just transition to e-mobility in the Philippines” with research findings based on its collaboration with ADB and the Apl.de.Ap Foundation International.

In addition to extensive market research, WDI’s engagement in the project involved field work in the Philippines and engagement via focus group discussions, interviews and company and university site visits. While the research primarily focuses on the Philippines, the team also examined e-mobility progress in other countries in Southeast Asia, particularly in the policy realm, to contextualize the findings.",,N,,2025-10-27 09:17:59.304076

Tesla is licking its wounds after a weak Q3 earnings print. Revenues grew nearly 12%, reversing two consecutive periods of decline. But the sales rebound looks inflated, with demand pulled forward as customers rushed to capture expiring EV tax credits.

Tesla’s third-quarter revenue hit $28.1 billion, comfortably exceeding the $26.4 billion forecast. Automotive revenue rose 6% to $21.2 billion, from year-ago $20 billion. Profit, however, told a harsher story. Tesla reported adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share, missing the 54-cent estimate. Net income declined 37% to $1.37 billion, or 39 cents per share, compared with $2.17 billion, or 62 cents, a year earlier. The sharp drop in profitability is attributed to a 50% surge in operating expenses, much of it tied to AI and other research and development initiatives.

Regulatory credit revenue fell 44% to $417 million from year-ago $739 million. Regulatory credits are rewards for Tesla for producing electric vehicles (EVs) that have zero emission. Tesla monetizes its regulatory credits by selling to traditional automakers that can’t meet their emission quotas.

The quarter marked the abrupt end of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, which expired at the close of September under a new law signed by President Donald Trump in July. The legislation ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs.

The incentives were originally scheduled to last until 2032 under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The retroactive elimination prompted a rush of consumer purchases before the deadline and left the market bracing for a slowdown in subsequent quarters. While the immediate effect was a temporary lift in Tesla’s U.S. sales, it was essentially a borrowing of demand from future quarters.

The decision to end the EV credits well before time may have been shaped by the acrimonious relationship between Trump and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. What was once a brewing bromance devolved into open hostility and public insults, effectively collapsing the rapport in May-June of this year. The ugly spat began with Elon Musk criticizing the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” - a new tax and spending bill proposed by Trump. In characteristic fashion, the president struck back forcefully and Musk’s unfiltered comments seem to have hardened that stance.

Trump has a history of reacting sharply and then reconsidering his position, a pattern that Wall Street has dubbed as the basis of TACO trades, by which investors profit from his policy reversals.

The President even sought to justify Musk’s outburst, acknowledging that Musk was frustrated by the removal of EV subsidies and mandates that could hurt Tesla’s business. Had Musk exercised more restraint, there is a reasonable likelihood that the administration might have delayed or somewhat softened its decision to end EV credits. Instead, Musk’s combative posture appears to have worsened the policy outcome, with consequences extending well beyond Tesla to the broader EV industry.

Elon Musk’s infamous quotes:

June 3, The first cracks in the bromance, when Musk criticized Trump’s Beautiful bill : “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” - (Pork is a term in U.S. politics used to describe government spending seen as wasteful or politically motivated — typically funding directed to specific constituencies or local projects to curry favor or votes.)

Accusing Trump of ""ingratitude”: ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election.""

Expanding criticism from Beautiful Bill to Trump’s trading policy: “The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year.”

Making a serious public allegation: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” - This post on X, was later deleted by him. (Epstein was a convicted sex offender, who ran a vast network exploiting underage girls. His high-profile connections in politics, business, and entertainment fueled controversy after his death in jail in 2019.)

Damage control a week later: “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far.” (This was widely perceived as a tactical retreat, after Musk realized his fallout with the president could hurt his business interests.)

Between June 3 and June 5, Tesla stock erased 17% of its value, but began to recover after Musk expressed contrition on June 11.

The episode is a reminder that even a visionary enterprise is not immune to the cost of intemperance. Tesla’s performance is now as much a reflection of Washington’s shifting sentiment as it is of its technological prowess.

The lesson for business leaders is pretty straightforward: watch your mouth if that’s where your money goes.

Nvidia as a Counterexample

Contrast Tesla with Nvidia, another tech giant facing complex political and regulatory landscapes. Jensen Huang’s leadership remains Nvidia’s greatest asset. Under his prowess, Nvidia has navigated the U.S.-China trade tensions, and export restrictions, with pragmatism and restraint.

China has been a key market for Nvidia, representing $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened from 95% before 2022 to just 50% after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China over national security concerns. Instead of resisting policy constraints, Nvidia adjusted swiftly by introducing the H20, a watered-down version of its H100 GPU designed for U.S. compliance — demonstrating its agility in navigating complex regulations.

When the H20 was also effectively blocked, Huang described the ban as “deeply painful,” and his pragmatic leadership was on display repeatedly: He lobbied effectively to ease U.S. restrictions on H20 chip exports. Huang framed the discussion around America’s AI leadership, patiently persuading the administration that the modified H20 posed no national security risk and cautioning that U.S. dominance in AI could be compromised without a rethink of export rules.

He was quoted saying:

“We ought to go and give American companies the opportunity to compete in China, offset the trade deficit, generate tax income for the American people, build, hire jobs, create more jobs”

“The world is right now hungry, anxious to engage AI. Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now.”

“The Chinese market is large. They’ve got a billion users, and so it’s not a market that you could easily decide to walk away from if your ultimate goal is for America to win the AI race.”

“If America, the American tech stack, is 80% of the world, then we are doing a good job winning the AI race. If the United States is 20% of the world, then we’ve lost the AI race.”

Huang walked a fine line between appeasing policymakers and advancing Nvidia’s goal of selling in China. The Trump administration eventually relented after Huang’s disciplined, behind-the-scenes engagement. Nvidia regained limited access to the Chinese market, without theatrical social media outbursts. Huang even agreed to give 15% of H20 sales to the U.S. government without batting an eyelid.

After having crossed the U.S. roadblocks, Huang accepted China’s subsequent rejection of Nvidia’s H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips with composure. Chinese regulators have reportedly directed companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to cancel orders for Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D processors - another tailor-made chip for China. Huang admitted he was “disappointed” with China sidelining its AI chips, but struck a pragmatic tone by saying Washington and Beijing “have larger agendas to work out… we’re supportive of both governments as they sort through these geopolitical policies.”

Instead of dwelling on the setback, Nvidia shifted strategy – assuming a “China zero” baseline in financial guidance and treating any China-related sales as potential upside rather than expectation.

The recent U.S. approval to sell AI chips to the UAE drove Nvidia stock to new highs. Tesla shares are up just 7% year-to-date vs. Nvidia’s nearly 40% rally. Tesla has a market cap of 1.4 Trillion, less than a third of Nvidia’s $4.5 trillion.

The difference is clear: where Musk’s volatility creates a “headline risk” that affects Tesla’s market perception, Huang’s composure builds strategic leverage. The market has clearly shown that leadership today is as much about managing relationships and tone as it is about innovation and execution.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/62fe40baadccff017f1dbcbd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-27 08:58:58.231947

A report by Alex Bigazzi, a researcher in transportation engineering, found that the program cut travel-related pollution by 17% annually and increased physical activity by 13%. In Denver, an e-bike voucher program has eliminated 170,000 vehicle miles traveled each week.

Yet challenges remain. Infrastructure in many cities is still built for cars, leaving cyclists and e-bike riders exposed to safety risks.

Greg Rybarczyk at the University of Michigan-Flint told Grist that city infrastructures must be refitted for more adoption.

Indeed, while e-bikes are growing in popularity, cities are still set on maintaining infrastructure that supports the use of cars. Detroit is one example of a place where e-bikes are picking up speed, but residents still believe the bike lanes are unsafe and not well-maintained, making it difficult to use the sustainable option for most travel, according to Grist.

Grist reports that cities are now facing a choice. Both rely on uplifting sustainability through e-bikes or EVs. They can either ""invest in relatively cheap improvements to make cycling safer, thus encouraging people to cycle more, or double down on car infrastructure to accommodate EVs, thus encouraging people to drive more and endanger pedestrians and cyclists.""

Experts believe e-bikes are not only a solution to cutting pollution from travel pollution, but also improving public health among residents. While both EVs and e-bikes are great options to reduce pollution, EVs still release their own form of pollution, like tires that produce more microplastics.

""So the cost of cycling infrastructure — even high-quality, protected infrastructure — is really relatively cheap, in terms of providing mobility in cities,"" Bigazzi emphasized.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (also known as the 25C tax credit) can help offset the expense of updating or upgrading major home systems while also lowering energy consumption.

Understanding the 25C Tax Credit

Homeowners in the United States may be eligible when they install qualifying energy-efficient equipment in their primary residence such as all-climate electric heat pumps, insulation, windows and other improvements. The credit is subject to some limitations; for example, a homeowner can only claim up to $2,000 per year for a heat pump. The installation must be an addition or improvement to an existing home, not a new home, and can be used in combination with other tax credits or incentives such as local, utility and federal incentives and IRA programs.

The current version of this tax credit was implemented Jan. 1, 2023, and expires Dec. 31, 2025. In addition, rising energy costs and potential regulatory changes in 2026, such as updated guidelines on refrigerant, make late 2025 a strategic time to upgrade systems.

Smart Ways to Use the Tax Credit

Generally, energy-saving upgrades are some of the most common home improvement projects because they enhance the home’s overall function while increasing the potential for cost savings on energy bills.

Some qualifying upgrades do double-duty by enhancing the home’s curb appeal while reducing energy requirements. Common examples include windows, skylights and exterior doors.

Insulation and air sealing materials such as caulk and weatherstripping are also common choices, especially in older homes where insulation may be below current standards and settling has created gaps for air leaks.

Another common selection for homeowners looking to take advantage of the 25C tax credit is climate control systems, and an increasing number are turning to all-climate, all-electric heat pumps. One major reason is their high performance when it comes to energy efficiency. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, today’s heat pumps can reduce electricity use for heating by 65% compared to electric resistance heating. In fact, Mitsubishi Electric all-climate, all-electric heat pumps have an efficiency rating at 260-490% compared to traditional systems at or below 100%.

In addition to their proven track record, contrary to a popular misconception that all-climate heat pumps are only for milder regions, the systems can operate quite effectively in both high heat and extreme cold. As a result, they provide homeowners with greater comfort and control of their indoor climate.

Take Steps to Beat the Deadline

If you’re a homeowner planning to make upgrades and claim 25C tax credits, now is the ideal time to get your project underway.

Choose qualifying equipment. While some brands’ complete product lines meet the qualification criteria, others do not. Do your homework to ensure the model you’re installing is eligible for the credit. Your salesperson may be able to provide information, or you can visit the manufacturer website or contact the manufacturer directly for details.

Work with a certified contractor. Many reputable brands, including Mitsubishi Electric, offer a contractor network with highly skilled, knowledgeable and reputable installers.

Save your receipts to file. When you prepare your 2025 tax forms, you’ll need to complete IRS Form 5695. Specifically, you will need to provide the manufacturer’s pin number and other details about your purchase, including proof of purchase.

It’s important to note that EV sales were abnormally high in the summer and into September as consumers rushed to beat the tax credit expiration.

In September, EVs accounted for 12.9% of new-vehicle retail sales, the highest ever, and well above the 8.5% recorded a year earlier, according to a report by J.D. Power released late last week.

But once the tax credits disappeared the freefall began.

“In October, EVs represent just 5.2% of new-vehicle retail sales,” wrote Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power. “On a volume basis, EVs account for 1.0 million of the 1.2 million-unit decline in the industry sales pace compared with a month ago.”

An analysis of EV sales between October 3--14 by auto sales and research site CarGurus.com concluded “early indicators show an approximately 68% decline in new EV sales compared to the same timeframe in early Sept. To put this in context even further, new EV sales have decreased by almost 43% compared to the same time a year ago.”

While the conventional thinking is EV sales began their nosedive solely because federal tax credits were no longer available, the top analyst at CarGurus says it’s not that clear cut.

“It looks like demand is kind of dropping, but what we don't know right now is how much of that demand is dropping due to the loss of the tax credit, versus did we just see a huge pull- ahead of October sales volumes into July, August, September, and then that's why we're seeing that significant a drop,” said Kevin Roberts, CarGurus director of industry analytics, in an interview.

That significant drop, however, is from months where EV buyers rushed to beat the end of the federal tax credits, creating some tough comparisons.

But not every EV or EV buyer qualified for those tax credits. Indeed, for those buyers who missed the deadline or didn’t qualify there are other deals to be found.

“One of the things I was saying going into it was if you did not actually qualify for that tax credit, you might be better off waiting until October, because you might actually get a better deal, as certain automakers might push better deals out into the marketplace in a post tax credit environment,” noted Roberts

Indeed, Scott Kunes, COO of the Kunes Auto & RV Group, with 31 stores in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Minnesota, notes that General Motors Co, in particular, has come up with a way to offset the loss of the $7,500 federal EV tax credits.

“They stepped up on the residual values, working with GM Financial to kind of make up for that $7,500 tax credit that really we saw the strongest in demand, in lease performance,” said Kunes, in an interview. “Most of the EV vehicles, especially in September, were leased, so they're continuing that. They have a plan going forward as well to hopefully support those up until June of next year, and then even a plan further on from that.”

Indeed, if anything is going to soften the EV sales freefall it’s improving their affordability, asserts Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

The average transaction price for a new EV in September was $58,124, representing a $9,070 premium over what’s known as an ICE+ vehicle, or mild hybrid, according to a Cox Automotive report released on October 16, authored by Streaty.

The average listing price for a used EV last month was $34,575, down .3% from August and 6.5% from September, 2024, according to the report. That represented only a $679 premium over used ICE+ vehicles.

“I think that's the biggest challenge. There's not a lot of, not enough, affordable options for consumers,” said Streaty, in an interview. “You look at the most popular cars, you have Rav4 or the Honda CRV and the Camry, actually in September, I think was number three. So it just points out that consumers, if you have a good product at a good price, it'll sell.”

While EV mix of industry is down, discounts on EVs have increased to $13,161, up $2,211 from October 2024 and up $2,047 from September 2025, as manufacturers step in to replace some portion of the expired tax credit, noted Streaty.

Discounts on non-EVs were $2,423 in October, down $282 from a year ago.

As a dealer, Scott Kunes is counting on automakers reassessing their EV product lines by adding more affordable models, such as the upcoming return of the Chevrolet Bolt, noting, “putting more of an emphasis on that and trying to grow EV demand naturally, I think, is key to success here.”

Price isn’t the only reason for eschewing an EV purchase for many consumers. For many, it’s concern over driving range and a basic change in the familiar routine of quick fill-ups at a gas station.

For that reason, sales of hybrids, which offer the combination of fuel economy without having to change old habits, are taking off.

Kunes notes a sharp increase in plug-in hybrids at his group’s dealerships and is excited about the planned introduction of a hybrid version of the Jeep Wagoneer.

It’s a trend Roberts attributes to consumers looking for improved fuel economy, regardless of powertrain, but at an affordable price.

“We're seeing a lot of demand in hybrids in 2024 and in 2025 so I think the narrative that Americans just want gas guzzlers is over,” observed Roberts. “American consumers are totally fine with a fuel-efficient vehicle if the price is right and that's what you've seen with hybrids.”

Kunes is hoping, however, automakers will continue to reassess their EV product lines, producing more affordable vehicles in body styles consumers desire, asserting, “We had to invest quite a bit of money in order to get us ready for this, this EV future. I don't think anybody wants to abandon it completely.”

That’s not about to happen according to Roberts who predicts, “I think there definitely is a market, and I think that market will grow over time, particularly as you get the price points in the right segments, I think you'll see a lot more EV adoption out there.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68fe6e6f5565d9bd5b0457c7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-27 06:58:44.775141

This advanced system transforms how the industry approaches end-of-life battery processing, moving beyond traditional recycling limitations to achieve unprecedented material recovery rates.

Understanding the Revolutionary Approach to Battery Material Recovery

CATL directional recycling technology fundamentally differs from conventional recycling approaches by employing precision-engineered processes that target specific materials within battery structures. Traditional recycling methods often result in material degradation and significant losses during processing, whereas Brunp's Directional Recycling Technology (DRT) maintains material integrity throughout extraction.

The technology centres on three core principles: selective material targeting, minimal thermal degradation, and closed-loop processing integration. Unlike pyrometallurgical approaches that rely on high-temperature smelting, this advanced system preserves the molecular structure of valuable materials, enabling their direct reintegration into new battery production cycles.

Founded in 2005 and acquired by CATL in 2015, Brunp Recycling has evolved from a specialised lithium battery recycler into one of the world's largest battery recycling operations. The company's headquarters in Foshan, Guangdong province, serves as the technological hub for developing and refining these advanced recovery processes.

The Three-Stage DRT Process Breakdown

The CATL directional recycling technology operates through a sophisticated three-stage methodology that maximises material recovery whilst minimising environmental impact. Each stage builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive system for battery material extraction and purification.

Stage 1: Intelligent Dismantling Protocols

The initial phase involves automated disassembly systems that carefully separate battery components without damaging recoverable materials. This intelligent dismantling process differs significantly from mechanical shredding methods used in conventional recycling, which can contaminate materials and reduce recovery efficiency.

Stage 2: Hydrometallurgical Processing

Unlike high-temperature pyrometallurgical processes that typically operate between 1,000-1,400°C, hydrometallurgical processing uses chemical leaching at controlled temperatures. This approach enables selective material extraction whilst preserving material quality and achieving higher recovery rates across multiple elements.

Stage 3: Advanced Material Recovery and Refinement

The final stage focuses on purifying extracted materials to battery-grade specifications. This refinement process ensures that recovered materials meet the same quality standards as virgin materials, enabling their direct use in new battery manufacturing without performance compromise.

How Effective Is CATL's Material Recovery Performance?

CATL directional recycling technology demonstrates remarkable efficiency in material recovery, achieving industry-leading extraction rates that surpass conventional recycling methods by significant margins. Brunp Recycling's latest performance data reveals exceptional recovery capabilities across critical battery materials.

Critical Metal Recovery Rates Analysis

The effectiveness of this advanced system becomes evident through its material recovery performance metrics. In 2024, Brunp Recycling processed over 120,000 tonnes of used batteries whilst achieving unprecedented recovery rates across multiple critical materials.

Material Type Recovery Percentage Annual Volume Processed Industry Significance Nickel 99.6% Part of 120,000+ tonnes Critical for cathode production Cobalt 99.6% battery waste processing High-value strategic material Manganese 99.6% through DRT technology Essential for battery stability Lithium 96.5% 17,100 tonnes salts produced Key electrolyte component

These recovery rates represent substantial improvements over traditional recycling methods. Conventional pyrometallurgical processes typically achieve nickel and cobalt recovery rates around 95%, whilst lithium recovery through traditional methods often remains limited to 25-30% due to material losses in slag formation.

Comparative Analysis Against Global Recycling Standards

CATL directional recycling technology significantly exceeds emerging regulatory requirements for battery material recovery. The European Union's Battery Regulation, adopted in July 2023, mandates recovery rates of 95% for cobalt, copper, and nickel, and 70% for lithium by 2030.

Brunp's achievement of 99.6% recovery rates for nickel, cobalt, and manganese, combined with 96.5% lithium recovery, positions the technology well ahead of these regulatory thresholds. This performance advantage provides CATL with competitive positioning in markets where recycling compliance becomes increasingly stringent.

The cost-effectiveness of this advanced high‑voltage battery recycling emerges from its ability to produce battery-grade materials that compete directly with primary mining extraction costs. Furthermore, the high recovery rates suggest favourable unit economics compared to traditional recycling methods that require additional refining steps.

What Are the Economic and Environmental Benefits?

CATL directional recycling technology offers substantial economic and environmental advantages that extend beyond simple material recovery. The technology addresses multiple challenges facing the battery industry, including supply chain resilience, cost management, and environmental sustainability.

Brand new Center for American Progress and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) analysis finds that upward of 107 million electricity customers (65 percent of all U.S. electric utility customers) and more than 46 million natural gas customers (59 percent of all U.S. natural gas utility customers) across 49 states and Washington, D.C., will face increased—or proposals for increased—utility rates by 2027. At least 210 U.S. gas and electric utilities have either already raised rates or proposed higher rates to go into effect within the next two years.* For some residents of Massachusetts, Missouri, Connecticut, New York, and Oklahoma, utility bills could increase by at least $35 per month—in one case, up to $60. Collectively, the in-effect and proposed rate increases would raise customers’ electricity and natural gas bills by $71.2 billion and $18.7 billion, respectively, by 2028.1

FIGURE 1

After closely mirroring inflation from 2013 to 2023, electricity prices have risen at double the rate of inflation over this past year.2 The trend of rapidly increasing electricity prices is a departure from the prior decade: More than 70 percent of states saw electricity prices decline in real terms between 2013 and 2023.3 What has changed? A multipronged storm of high natural gas costs, extreme weather, and increasing demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers is colliding with an aging electricity grid and a policy assault on new clean electricity deployment from the Trump administration—driving electricity prices higher.

Instead of addressing rising utility costs, the Trump administration has canceled projects for new energy supply, issued massive new tariffs that worsen supply chain concerns, and increased consumer costs by forcing expensive coal plants to run past their scheduled retirements.4 President Trump’s giveaways for the fossil fuel industry and attack on clean energy, coupled with the effects of rolling back clean energy tax credits via the Big Beautiful Bill, means that American households could spend upward of $430 more per year on their energy bills within the next decade.5 Millions more individuals and families across the country will face even higher utility bills as a direct result of the federal government’s actions over the past few months—actions that are likely to continue in the months to come.

Why energy prices are increasing

Americans are seeing higher energy bills due to a confluence of factors, including investment in outdated infrastructure, higher natural gas prices, and increasing energy demand. Some of the associated costs leading to increasing utility bills are necessary to build a modernized electric grid, while others will continue to inflict more costs on Americans due to natural gas price volatility or unchecked data center growth. Policymakers should prioritize the protection of ratepayers and invest in solutions to lower costs for households and businesses.

Grid resiliency and modernization

The U.S. electric grid is aging, with much of the system built in the 1960s and 1970s, and will not be able to meet expected energy and climate demands without undergoing significant upgrades and expansion.6 For example, transmission lines have a lifespan of 50 to 80 years, and 70 percent of current transmission lines are more than 25 years old.7 Likewise, more than half of distribution transformers in the United States are more than 33 years old, which means they are approaching their end of life.8 The aging domestic grid is vulnerable to risks that threaten energy access and affordability, which leaves Americans susceptible to power outages, increased costs from inefficient transmission and distribution, and cybersecurity risks.9

Climate-driven extreme weather is on the rise and showcases the vulnerability of the aging grid.10 Extreme weather is a leading cause of electric power outages: One study found that more than 70 percent of U.S. counties analyzed from 2018 to 2020 experienced at least eight hours of power outages during severe weather.11 As climate change continues to worsen, it will cost both utilities and consumers billions of dollars, including costs from power outage recovery and building a more resilient grid to avoid power outages.12

The United States must invest in upgrading and modernizing the electric grid. Indeed, modernizing and building a more resilient grid will require parts such as poles, electrical conductors, and finished wires that are made up of steel, aluminum, and copper.13 The Trump administration’s 25 percent to 50 percent tariffs are significantly driving up the costs of these commodities, as about 20 percent of steel, 70 percent of primary aluminum, and 40 percent of refined copper are sourced from other countries.14 In addition, ongoing legal challenges and the risk of new and changing tariffs create uncertainty, making it hard for domestic manufacturers and developers to make sourcing decisions to obtain the materials they need for grid modernization projects.15

All these factors combine to increase the costs for utilities to make necessary upgrades or replacements to the grid. The Trump administration has pursued policies that not only counter climate action but also take away support for grid resilience. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has terminated more than $7 billion in grants, some specifically for grid deployment and mineral development for domestic manufacturing and energy supply chains.16 At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to rescind the endangerment finding, the basis for the federal government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act; it has cited the DOE’s climate report—which was written by climate skeptics and utilizes cherry-picked data—in support of this rollback.17 The administration’s reversal on climate progress will slow greenhouse gas emission reductions—increasing emissions by an estimated 470 million tons in 2035, which is more than the emissions from every diesel car and truck on U.S. roads today and will likely increase the threat of extreme weather events in an ever-warmer world.18

Higher natural gas prices

Another reason that Americans’ energy bills are going up is the recent increase in U.S. wholesale electricity prices, which have risen by around 40 percent since the beginning of 2025.19 This increase is a direct result of rising natural gas prices. Natural gas generation currently provides about 42 percent of all electricity consumed in the United States—the highest it has ever been—and is often the fuel source setting the price for electricity in the market.20 With so much of the electricity market supplied and set by natural gas, U.S. electricity prices are now highly susceptible to changes in natural gas markets.21 In recent years, the gas market has been highly volatile, with massive swings and price spikes due to global forces, both man made and natural, and geopolitics.22

The jump in natural gas prices was so large that Oklahoma utility customers will now be making monthly payments for the next 25 years to pay off the gas bill from one week in 2021. Oklahoma Corporation Commission, “OCC Reports Finalized Uri Securitization Cost” (2024).

These high, volatile prices ultimately are passed on to electricity consumers. For example, during Winter Storm Uri in 2021, Oklahoma gas prices spiked 400-fold (from $3 to $1,200 per 1,000 cubic feet). The jump in natural gas prices was so large that Oklahoma utility customers will now be making monthly payments for the next 25 years to pay off the gas bill from one week in 2021.23 In 2022, Dominion spent an additional $1 billion on fuel costs due to the spiking of fossil fuel prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which paired with other COVID-19 and inflationary forces.24 These excess fuel costs were charged to and recovered from Dominion’s Virginia customers over the next three years to avoid the “rate shock” that would have occurred if Dominion had attempted to recover the costs over a single year, as normally done.25

Although natural gas prices fell and saw less volatility in 2024, gas prices are again on the rise.26 The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects natural gas prices to increase by more than 75 percent in the United States between 2024 and 2026.27 This increase in natural gas prices is largely attributable to rising U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, which increase demand for U.S. natural gas and link the domestic natural gas market to the global market.28 LNG exports are projected to increase by more than 36 percent from 2024 to 2026, outpacing expected growth in U.S. gas supplies and leading to tightening domestic supplies and higher prices for U.S. consumers.29 The Trump administration has expanded U.S. LNG exports, including approving numerous export projects and brokering a deal with Japan on a joint venture for Alaskan LNG.30

Energy demand increases from data centers and AI

For the first time in a decade, U.S. electricity demand is on the rise,31 and it could grow by 25 percent by 2030, driven by data centers that provide AI, cloud-based, and crypto services.32 Without policy interventions, such as requiring data centers to pay their fair share of the generation and infrastructure costs necessary to connect them to the grid, data centers could potentially increase costs at alarming rates for American households and businesses if utilities do not have proper cost allocation approaches for new and large commercial and industrial customers.33

A new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists found that in 2024 alone, utilities in seven states covered by regional transmission organization PJM passed on more than $4 billion in additional costs to customers due to local transmission upgrades to provide transmission-level service directly to data centers.34 For areas located near large data centers, a Bloomberg News analysis found that each month, electricity costs rose 267 percent above where they were just five years earlier.35 Rising electricity demand, spiking due to data center use, could be responsible for increased electricity rates of 15 percent to up to 40 percent for all U.S. households in the next five years alone.36

Fair solutions that address affordability would require that data center customers, at a minimum, cover the full costs incurred by utilities to provide them with electricity and that guardrails are put in place to ensure those costs are never passed on to other customers, such as small businesses and households that are already facing an affordability crisis. Utilities must ensure that cost distribution of service and contribution of total system costs reflect each different class of customer accordingly and fairly—from residential to large industrial—especially with new and increasing data center demand. Unfortunately, the Trump administration’s “AI Action Plan” that emphasizes deregulation, including guidance to skirt environmental protections to spur the rapid development of data centers, offers inadequate solutions to address affordability and does nothing to address the distribution of costs for households.37 The plan recommends embracing new energy generation such as geothermal and nuclear fission but fails to prioritize renewables, such as wind and solar, that are low cost and quick to deploy compared with conventional generation sources such as fossil fuels.38 Rushing data centers online without cheaper and new generation sources likely will increase consumer prices and risk rolling blackouts.39

The need to modernize the grid, coupled with Trump administration actions and rising natural gas prices, means the surge in energy demand will continue to increase costs for Americans.

Trump administration actions that could increase utility bills for Americans in the next few years

The administration’s actions over the past 10 months, including signing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, have exacerbated rising rates.40 Notably, the administration has consistently blocked and attacked clean energy, particularly on large wind and solar projects,41 that would make utilities less dependent on volatile and costly fossil fuels.42 A Princeton analysis found that the average U.S. household could spend more than $430 more per year on its energy bills within the next decade due to the Trump administration’s attack on clean energy, giveaways for the fossil fuel industry, and elimination of pollution standards.43

In August, the DOE extended an emergency stay-open order to delay the retirement of the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan until mid-November.44 The Campbell coal plant was slated to close in May 2025; continuing to extend retirement is estimated to cost ratepayers nearly $140 million per year.45 The DOE also announced more than $600 million in investment to bail out the coal industry.46 Propping up the coal industry will drive up costs for consumers, as 99 percent of coal plants are more expensive to run compared with replacement by new solar or wind.47 Moreover, some coal-related efforts will not provide any domestic benefits, as the United States is a net exporter of coal, especially to Asia.48 The Big Beautiful Bill’s production tax credit for metallurgical coal, an ingredient in steel and other metals, gives a subsidy to nations that will benefit from producing more steel than the United States does.49

All these actions are increasing electricity costs for American consumers and exacerbating the rising energy affordability crisis that the United States is already facing.50

Conclusion

As millions of Americans face increasing utility bills, the Trump administration continues to prop up the fossil fuel industry while blocking projects and investments that would make it easier for utilities to deploy reliable and affordable energy.

Methodology

The electric and natural gas utilities listed in the tracker, and the associated increases in rates, were identified through online filings by utilities and records of decisions in state public utilities commission (PUC) dockets. The list includes rate increases that went into effect or were proposed to go into effect from January 2025 onward. The list is not comprehensive and will be periodically updated with additional rate increases from across the country in subsequent iterations of this report.

Each state’s PUC has different requirements for reporting data related to rate increases, bill impacts, distributional impacts, and monthly increases. The number of customers—including residential, commercial, and industrial—affected by rate increases, column E, primarily used Energy Information Administration (EIA) and S&P Global data for electricity and natural gas, respectively. Authors used 2024 EIA 861 data, as well as aggregated customer data, from three files: 1) Sales_Ult_Cust_2024: Aggregated total number of customers across customer classes by “Utility Number” and “State” for “Bundled” and “Delivery” service types, and for Parts A, B, C, and D; removed state level “Adjustments”; removed “Ownership” types of “Behind the Meter,” “Community Choice Aggregation,” and “Retail Power Marketer”; 2) Short_Form_2024: Aggregated total number of customers by “Utility Number” and “State”; and 3) Delivery_Companies_2024: Aggregated total number of customers by “Utility Number” and “State.” For S&P data, authors aggregated total customers by “Company Name” and “State.”

EIA and S&P data did not report the number of customers for some utilities, in which case the data were collected directly from utilities’ websites, investor presentations, or press releases. In some instances, rate increases affected only a portion of the customer base in a utility’s service territory and were reported by the utility through press releases or in the docket filings. The authors aggregated the total number of natural gas customers across sectors using EIA data to calculate the percentage of natural gas utility customers affected by the rate increases.

The time periods for revenue increases, column F, were collected using utilities’ press releases, webpages, and docket filings from PUCs. The time periods for increases fell into three categories: 1) increase in annual revenues, in which utilities did not specify a time period for the rate increase and instead requested or were approved to increase their annual revenue requirements until the next time they file and are approved for additional revenues; 2) specific time periods, in which single-year, part-year, and multiyear periods were explicitly mentioned in filing documents, press releases, or utility webpages; or 3) calendar years, such as 2025 or 2026. Some utilities did not specify whether the rate increase was annual or for a specific time period. The authors used the best available information from the utility to assign a time period when relevant.

The effective date and status for rate increases, columns J and K, respectively, were also collected using utility press releases, utility and PUC webpages, and docket filings. In most cases, authors were able to identify a specific date, month, or year from which a rate increase would be effective. In some instances, the request for a rate increase was ongoing and did not specify an effective date, with PUCs often suspending effective dates for 6 to 12 months. The authors made a conservative estimate based on available information, including expected decision dates or expected effective dates, such as “early 2026” or “second half of 2026,” to adopt an effective date.

The total revenue increase in column G was calculated based on revenue increases reported by utility websites or press releases, in news articles that included a direct quote from a utility spokesperson, or from docket filings. The total revenue numbers include additional revenues to be recovered from all customer classes, including residential, commercial, and industrial. Not all utilities reported an increase in revenue as a result of increased utility prices, and not all utilities reported monthly average bill impacts even when there was an increase in revenue and/or rate of return.

Since the time periods for revenue increases were not aligned across utilities, the authors calculated an estimated total additional revenue generated starting in January 2025 through the end of 2028, assuming that rates remained steady after the covered period. This methodology likely results in an underestimate of revenues for the time period because utilities often file for additional rate recovery to begin in the next cycle after the covered period, thus increasing utilities’ revenues beyond what authors estimated. Revenue estimates were calculated using the additional revenues reported by the utilities, the time period for increase (column F), and effective date for increase (column J). The time period for implementation of most revenue increases is before December 31, 2028, and the authors assumed that revenue increases during the effective time period for an increase continued until the end of 2028. Revenue increases prior to 2025 were not included in the totals. In cases where the implementation period stopped before December 31, 2028, revenues were prorated for the remainder of the four-year time period in order to standardize the data. Further, some utilities either requested or collected interim revenues before final approval from PUCs, which were included in the calculation below for the relevant amount of time. Authors assumed the revenue increase was evenly split across all days of the year and calculated prorated revenues using the remaining number of days until December 31, 2028. For example, Ameren Missouri was approved for additional annual revenues of $355 million starting in June 2025. To estimate its total revenue through the end of 2028, the authors assumed an annual increase of $355 million for each year from June 2025 through June 2028 and then calculated partial revenues for the remaining 214 days (four months) in 2028 at the rate of $355 million per year.

The monthly percentage increase (column I) and the dollar amount increase (column H) to the average residential bill were collected through utility webpages, press releases, news articles that included a direct quote from a utility spokesperson, or docket filings. In the case of multiyear increases, when utilities reported multiple increases to residential bills through the time period, the authors reported the total increase in monthly bills, when available. When percentage increases were not reported but the appropriate data were available, authors calculated a percentage increase across the relevant time periods. In instances where utilities had implemented an interim rate increase resulting in an interim increase in monthly bills, authors reported the interim increase and included footnotes with the final expected increase pending PUC approval. In instances where utilities reported multiple values for a monthly and percentage increase, either based on geography or type of customer, the authors reported the lowest reported estimate and included footnotes indicating other relevant increases.

The authors prioritized using primary sources for the revenue increases, monthly increases, time periods, and effective dates. In some instances, these values were not publicly reported by the utility or the PUC so are labeled as “N/A.” The authors note that this does not necessarily mean that there is no associated increase in revenues or customer bills; instead, it represents a lack of public data from the utility or PUC.

To calculate the total number of utilities increasing rates, the authors counted each individual subsidiary that filed for an increase with the respective state regulators as a unique utility. For example, CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. filed for rate increases in both Minnesota and Texas. However, the company filed the requests doing business as two separate subsidiaries—CenterPoint Energy Minnesota Gas and CenterPoint Energy Entex—and were counted as two unique utilities.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GettyImages-2153308785.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 11:22:02.688331

On July 21, 2025, Jones and his maintenance foreman, who was with Jones when the first log was sawn, sawed the last board, bringing to an end an almost 40-year legacy of Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill.","Tucked away in Roper, North Carolina, is Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill, the largest private employer in Washington County, until recently. Wilson Jones, the owner and operator of the sawmill, came to the difficult decision to shut down operations, due to the repercussions of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration.

Not only did it result in the laying off of all 50 of Jones’ employees, but it also ended an almost 40-year legacy. Wilson Jones and his brother are sixth-generation lumbermen, carrying on the legacy that their great-great-grandfather, William Sawyer Jones, began. He received his first order for sawn lumber on July 26, 1884. He continued to operate the sawmill with his brothers and children over the following decades.

“Our business goes back to 1882,” Jones told the Carolina Journal. “My dad took over our Elizabeth City plant in 1960. In 1986, I was out of college, and my brother was about to graduate from college, and he decided that we would horizontally integrate because we had a mill in Elizabeth City that was cutting primarily yellow pine. There was a big demand at that time for the hardwoods.”

Wilson and his brother Stephen own and operate two small sawmills in North Carolina, which employed 130 individuals in northeast North Carolina. Their operation in Elizabeth City is still in operation. However, Wilson says that due to the tariffs, Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill, the operation in Roper, which employed 50 individuals, was forced to shut down.

In late 1986, Wilson came to Roper with his industry colleagues and bought the entire mill, piece by piece, at auction. By the end of the day, they had a sawmill. A year later, in 1987, the mill was fully operational.

They expanded over time. They rebuilt the old mill once, and then, from 1995 through 2002, they modernized it into the state it’s in today — a very modern hardwood sawmill, according to Jones.

During those years, they also witnessed a significant shift in the industry: Furniture manufacturing moved out of North Carolina and, eventually, out of the United States altogether. Like most hardwood mills, they adapted by exporting products to manufacturing regions in southern China (like Shanghai) and Vietnam.

Wilson told the Carolina Journal that about 80% of their product was exported to Asia.

We’re in this unique situation where we’re getting hit going and coming,” said Jones.

On “Liberation Day,” President Trump announced additional tariffs on Chinese goods starting at about 20%. The tariffs escalated until they reached about 150% on Chinese goods. China retaliated with a 120% tariff on American hardwood products, Jones told Carolina Journal.

At the time, Jones’s company already had about $350,000–$400,000 worth of lumber on ships bound for China. Bringing it back wasn’t an option — freight costs from China were about eight times higher in reverse. Jones tried rerouting through Vietnam. He found buyers, but the problem was that Vietnam typically uses lower-quality wood than the premium-grade lumber shipped to China. Jones had to take price concessions for quality and volume, ultimately facing a 40% loss.

Jones said Liberation Day “liberated” him from his business and personal investments made to it.

“I’m not talking about money, because I can think any independent lumberman would tell you that they are not in this industry to make money. They’re in it because they love it,” said Jones. “It’s taken 38 years of my time, effort, and life inside and outside from me. It’s taken a business that I enjoyed — and I do love the industry — from me.”

Of the 50 employees who worked with Jones at Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill, Jones said that more than 40 of them were there at least 10 years. Jones said that his maintenance foreman, whom he ran the last board through with, was there for the first cutting.

“They’re guys that are cold in the wintertime and sweaty and dusty in the summertime. They worked and worked every day, and they took care of their families, paid their taxes, and did all that stuff.”

Wilson Jones, owner of Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill

When Jones told his employees he had to shut down the mill, he offered them jobs at the Elizabeth City plant. About a dozen of those men are now employed there, but driving 60 miles to work isn’t feasible for many.

“I can’t express to you how good these guys were,” said Jones.

Jones continued, saying, “Supporters of tariffs argue that business owners should absorb the cost of the tariffs without passing it on to consumers by absorbing the cost through price increases or layoffs. They don’t seem to understand that it doesn’t matter whether it’s Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill or Dot’s Button Shop — the point is, we’re in business to make money.”

And Jones said that if the business can’t make money, it can’t absorb costs. If raw material costs suddenly rise, with current expenses up 30%, and revenues are cut by 30–40%, the business simply loses money. Jones said that expecting a business to continue operating under these conditions is just not realistic, whether it’s his sawmill or a giant like Procter & Gamble doesn’t matter.

While many of his customers will likely be able to find alternative US sources, his contact in China, as well as with two of his largest suppliers, said they are having difficulty filling the niche or supply gap that Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill previously covered, since Jones supplied a specific thickness.

The Carolina Journal asked Jones what he would like President Trump to know about how the tariffs have impacted him, his company, and his employees. Jones said that he would ask Trump to come down to his mill and take a real look at the situation.

“I mean, at least when he went out in western North Carolina, it looked like he genuinely cared,” said Jones. “Come down here and look, and don’t just make blanket edicts because that’s the edict of the day.”

Of the final shipments that Jones was preparing to send out, he told the Carolina Journal that, due to the new tariffs on furniture and cabinetry, he now has about 15-20 truckloads that were to be sent to his customers in Asia, which will not be purchased as a result.

Jones emphasized that policy issues, such as tariffs, are nuanced and that there are opposing viewpoints on solutions. But he said addressing problems effectively involves engaging in conversations with individuals who have different perspectives and working together to find solutions.

On July 21, 2025, Jones and his maintenance foreman, who was with Jones when the first log was sawn, sawed the last board, bringing to an end an almost 40-year legacy of Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1989-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 03:58:48.804086

The New Mexico State chapter of Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) will host a virtual presentation open to the public Nov. 5 featuring author and hunger eradication activist Sam Daley-Harris. According to Sam, “agonizing, protesting, and turning off the news” aren’t our only options for making a difference on the issues we care about. There’s another way—what Daley-Harris calls transformational advocacy, a form of advocacy where you work to change an issue, and you are changed in the process. It’s not the only solution needed, but it is one essential missing piece: citizens awakening to their power.

Here are two examples.

Maxine Thomas said that she had a heart for service but was clueless about advocacy, especially political advocacy. After being trained and meeting with her Indiana members of Congress, Maxine said, “I was euphoric. I was on this high and felt I was part of something revolutionary.

Ellie Sparks said she was experiencing what she called “climate trauma”. She would read Bill McKibben’s book Earth and weep at home and weep at work. After being trained and meeting with 20 Congressional offices over four days, Ellie called the experience “sacred and profound.” From “I was clueless” to “I was euphoric”; from “climate trauma” to “sacred and profound”, that is transformational advocacy.

Stories like this are part of the completely revised and updated edition of Daley-Harris’ book, Reclaiming Our Democracy: Every Citizens’ Guide to Transformational Advocacy (Rivertowns Books 2025, paperback).

Feeling fed up with what’s going on in the world isn’t a flaw—it’s fuel, and Sam Daley-Harris wants to show you how to use it. All members of the public are welcome to join the presentation followed by Q&A on Wednesday, Nov. 5 from 6:30-7:30pm MST (Logon via Zoom, Meeting ID: 343 696 4851, Passcode: 696696).

“Sam was one of the original mentors to Citizens’ Climate Lobby’s founding members,” said Sara Ann Mason, resident of Los Alamos, State Coordinator for Citizens’ Climate Lobby in New Mexico, and a volunteer with the organization since 2021.

“He focused on eradicating hunger, and then by working with other organizations like CCL, he’s shown that his methods are applicable to a wide range of issues. We’re excited to learn from him so we can be most effective with what we care about most: building political will for bipartisan federal action to support the climate and energy infrastructure we need, not just in New Mexico but in the whole country,” Mason said.

In addition to hosting events like these, the New Mexico State chapter of Citizens’ Climate Lobby regularly meets with the offices of Sen. Heinrich, Sen. Lujan, Rep. Stansbury, Rep. Vasquez, and Rep. Leger-Fernandez to urge them to support effective climate and energy policy.

China has now become a key engine of battery innovation worldwide.","A complete analysis of the role of innovation in curbing or diversifying battery mineral demand and supply can be found in Chapter 7 of The State of Energy Innovation report published by the IEA earlier this year. This excerpted version – updated with the latest data, and informed by the forthcoming Energy Technology Perspectives Special Report on the Global Car Industry and the Energy Technology Perspectives report – will frame a dedicated discussion on the topic at the IEA Energy Innovation Forum 2025, which will take place in Toronto, Canada, on 29 October 2025 ahead of the G7 Energy and Environment Ministers’ Meeting.

Battery demand surged more than forty-fold between 2010 and 2024, while average battery prices dropped by more than 90%. In 2024, the global battery market was worth about USD 130 billion – greater than the net oil imports of Germany, France and Italy combined. This rapid transformation has reshaped the battery market: portable electronics, once the dominant application, now represent just 5% of demand. In contrast, electric vehicles (EVs) account for around 75% of demand; battery energy storage systems (BESS) cover 15%, while other uses – such as electric bikes and drones – make up the remainder. This shift has been driven by sustained innovation in battery design, chemistry and manufacturing, alongside economies of scale and improved production efficiency.

The global EV battery market is currently split between lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NMC) chemistries, each accounting for roughly half of total demand. LFP is the fastest-growing segment, already dominating energy storage deployment due to its lower cost and longer cycle life. However, supply chains for both chemistries remain geographically concentrated, raising concerns over the security of supply.

There are opportunities to tackle this concentration and thereby improve supply chain resilience. Innovation is a key one, with research ongoing into established and new technologies. Among technologies that have already been commercialised, improvements continue to bring down costs while boosting performance. At the same time, research into new technologies could reshape battery supply chains and enhance competitiveness over the medium and long term.

For new entrants in any mature technology sector, competing with established producers is very difficult, even with substantial financial backing. Innovation in next-generation battery technologies is sometimes seen as a way for newcomers to leapfrog incumbents. However, relying on potential disruptive breakthroughs is a precarious foundation for business success, and especially for broader industrial strategy. In the absence of an efficient, competitive battery manufacturing ecosystem, even promising advances may struggle to reach commercial scale quickly enough to deliver real benefits.

Several innovative battery approaches currently stand out. Sodium-ion batteries – which are similar to lithium-ion batteries in design, but substitute lithium with the more-abundant sodium – gained significant attention after lithium prices spiked in 2022. Thanks to timely investment and existing technological maturity, sodium-ion batteries have moved quickly towards commercialisation. In China, EVs with sodium-ion batteries entered the market in late 2023 and large stationary sodium-ion storage batteries were connected to the power grid in 2024. However, sodium-ion batteries can only compete with LFP batteries on cost in the context of high lithium prices or significant energy density improvements. In addition, with China projected to hold 95% of global sodium-ion production capacity by 2030, the technology is unlikely to provide a competitive opening for new entrants, although it could offer advantages in terms of technology diversification, especially when lithium prices are high.

Meanwhile, solid-state batteries have attracted attention and investment thanks to their promise of longer driving ranges and enhanced safety, although these have yet to be demonstrated in real-world applications. The term “solid-state batteries” covers a wide range of technologies; the most frequently mentioned advantages come from designs that are currently in the prototype stage.

While solid-state battery cells are already being produced, their integration into EV battery packs remains challenging. Among the most advanced, Chinese firm BYD plans to sell its first EV using all-solid-state batteries from 2027, with mass production following in 2030. Japan’s Toyota and Korea’s Samsung have set similar timelines.

Early costs will be high, reflecting immature manufacturing processes and supply chains, but premium markets – where customers value range and performance – could support early adoption, providing margins for manufacturers to navigate scale-up challenges and work towards lower production costs. Nevertheless, this implies that it will take time for solid-state batteries to make a dent in the mass market for EVs, and they will likely remain limited to premium segments until the first half of the 2030s.

Lithium-sulphur batteries are less mature technologically but are also receiving considerable attention, especially in the United States. Their appeal lies in storing more energy per kilogram, enabling lighter battery designs. However, they also require more space for the same amount of energy compared with today’s battery technologies, which limits their attractiveness for mainstream EV applications. The defence sector may prove an early adopter if production is scaled up at sufficient volumes and technical obstacles, such as safety concerns, can be addressed.

A similar approach – focusing on niche but already sizeable or growing markets – is being pursued by developers of several other innovative battery technologies, such as redox-flow and metal-air batteries, both of which target longer-duration storage.

Innovation takes time, and while researchers continue to develop potentially disruptive battery technologies, existing technologies keep advancing, driven by incremental improvements.

Since global EV sales began to rise exponentially after 2020, lithium-ion batteries have advanced rapidly across all metrics – a trend that has accelerated since 2023. Global prices for lithium-ion batteries fell by about 30% between 2020 and 2024 thanks to economies of scale and innovations in battery cell and pack manufacturing and design. At the same time, battery pack energy density rose by over 50% for NMC batteries and about 65% for LFP batteries, without compromising safety or longevity – on the contrary, safety standards have improved substantially, and EV battery lifetimes are exceeding expectations. Fast-charging capabilities have also surpassed any previous record. In early 2025, BYD and CATL released batteries that enable 400-500 kilometres of additional range to be added in just five minutes – a timeframe comparable to refuelling conventional cars.

For new technologies to gain market share and reshape the battery industry, their viability alone is insufficient; the critical point is industrial scale-up, which ultimately determines the transformation of markets.

Viewed through this lens, established battery technologies retain a clear advantage. Manufacturing capacity for solid-state batteries that is already installed, under construction or has reached a final investment decision represents just 1% of the total battery manufacturing capacity, and 80% of these projects are in China; for sodium-ion batteries, this share is 4% (and this capacity is almost exclusively in China). The remaining 95% of capacity has been planned to produce lithium-ion batteries. While actual market shares may differ due to excess production capacity, the limited manufacturing base – coupled with higher initial costs and lower technological, supply chain and market readiness – is set to constrain the near-term potential of emerging chemistries.

Given this, new technologies are expected to capture a relatively small share of the 2030 market. Even so, a small share of a fast-growing market can still represent a major opportunity, with battery demand projected to expand more than threefold from 2024 to 2030 and fivefold to 2035 based on today’s policy settings.

Still, competition is fierce. China has now become a key engine of battery innovation worldwide. The same incumbents that dominate lithium-ion production are investing heavily in innovation – CATL alone invested over USD 2.5 billion in research and development and employed more than 20 000 researchers in 2024.

Tomorrow’s leaders in next-generation batteries will be those that pair technical breakthroughs with manufacturing efficiency, strong supply chains and a skilled workforce, much as today’s lithium-ion batteries industry has done. Skills, suppliers and operational know-how must transfer smoothly across technologies if innovation is to translate into competitiveness.

Even disruptive energy technologies often require time to gain a foothold in global markets, particularly one as large and fast-growing as the battery sector. While current project pipelines suggest that established lithium-ion technologies will continue to dominate until at least the mid-2030s, emerging technologies developed today may secure critical niches and help position producers for long-term competitiveness. Specialised segments, such as premium applications, can allow producers to build experience, generate profit and eventually move towards the mass adoption of new technologies.

Looking ahead, innovation will remain at the core of the battery industry, underpinning continued improvements in performance and cost, enabling access to new applications and markets, and reinforcing the central role of batteries in energy systems.

As batteries become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century, the IEA will continue to monitor these trends in order to provide timely analysis and policy advice.",https://iea.imgix.net/a036c0c9-1029-486a-842c-6f76a18b2f1e/shutterstock_746286796-Howcaninnovationhelptosecurefuturebatterymark.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=min&h=600&q=80&rect=30%2C132%2C761%2C381&w=1200,N,,2025-10-27 02:18:34.929787

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (also known as the 25C tax credit) can help offset the expense of updating or upgrading major home systems while also lowering energy consumption.

Understanding the 25C Tax Credit

Homeowners in the United States may be eligible when they install qualifying energy-efficient equipment in their primary residence such as all-climate electric heat pumps, insulation, windows and other improvements. The credit is subject to some limitations; for example, a homeowner can only claim up to $2,000 per year for a heat pump. The installation must be an addition or improvement to an existing home, not a new home, and can be used in combination with other tax credits or incentives such as local, utility and federal incentives and IRA programs.

The current version of this tax credit was implemented Jan. 1, 2023, and expires Dec. 31, 2025. In addition, rising energy costs and potential regulatory changes in 2026, such as updated guidelines on refrigerant, make late 2025 a strategic time to upgrade systems.

Smart Ways to Use the Tax Credit

Generally, energy-saving upgrades are some of the most common home improvement projects because they enhance the home's overall function while increasing the potential for cost savings on energy bills.

Some qualifying upgrades do double-duty by enhancing the home's curb appeal while reducing energy requirements. Common examples include windows, skylights and exterior doors.

Insulation and air sealing materials such as caulk and weatherstripping are also common choices, especially in older homes where insulation may be below current standards and settling has created gaps for air leaks.

Another common selection for homeowners looking to take advantage of the 25C tax credit is climate control systems, and an increasing number are turning to all-climate, all-electric heat pumps. One major reason is their high performance when it comes to energy efficiency. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, today's heat pumps can reduce electricity use for heating by 65% compared to electric resistance heating. In fact, Mitsubishi Electric all-climate, all-electric heat pumps have an efficiency rating at 260-490% compared to traditional systems at or below 100%.

In addition to their proven track record, contrary to a popular misconception that all-climate heat pumps are only for milder regions, the systems can operate quite effectively in both high heat and extreme cold. As a result, they provide homeowners with greater comfort and control of their indoor climate.

Take Steps to Beat the Deadline

If you're a homeowner planning to make upgrades and claim 25C tax credits, now is the ideal time to get your project underway.

Choose qualifying equipment. While some brands' complete product lines meet the qualification criteria, others do not. Do your homework to ensure the model you're installing is eligible for the credit. Your salesperson may be able to provide information, or you can visit the manufacturer website or contact the manufacturer directly for details.

Work with a certified contractor. Many reputable brands, including Mitsubishi Electric, offer a contractor network with highly skilled, knowledgeable and reputable installers.

Save your receipts to file. When you prepare your 2025 tax forms, you'll need to complete IRS Form 5695. Specifically, you will need to provide the manufacturer's pin number and other details about your purchase, including proof of purchase.

How climate policy rose to the top Until recently, climate protection dominated public discourse, around the world and particularly in Europe.
Thus, climate protection became a business and climate change offered endless opportunities to spend, regulate, and posture, with limited accountability for results.
But the politics of climate change — often marked by apocalyptic rhetoric, moral posturing, and costly symbolism — appears to have peaked.","Australia has long been a proving ground for climate policy. Governments have announced ambitious targets, introduced complex regulatory schemes, and committed substantial subsidies to renewable energy. Outcomes, however, are mixed. Australia remains one of the world’s largest coal exporters. Although coal-fired generation is declining, the pace of the transition to wind, solar, and storage has been slower than anticipated, and the rollout of electricity generation transmission infrastructure is struggling to meet the 2030 target.

Debates intensified with the release of the National Climate Risk Assessment in 2025, presented as a sober appraisal of future risks. However, critics argued that the report relies on implausible scenarios of runaway coal use and global population growth, citing disaster cost projections attributed to climate change, even though an underlying review links rising losses primarily to increased population and property exposure rather than Australian CO₂ emissions. Such framing may generate headlines but risks undermining credibility and the international collaboration that effective climate policy would require.

Climate protection is the textbook case of a global public good: non-rivalry and non-excludability create strong incentives to free ride, leading to suboptimal collective outcomes. Unilateral Australian policies and actions have negligible direct effects on global temperatures; their value rests largely on demonstration, technology development, and diplomatic leverage rather than on measurable climate impacts per se. Countries and individuals who cut emissions bear the costs themselves, while the benefits are distributed worldwide. The incentives for any one country to act independently and substantially are therefore weak. Citizens care less about the global average temperature than about the local consequences — what they experience in their own environment.

Although international agreements could, in theory, solve this dilemma, in practice, they have dismally failed. Many signatory states are authoritarian, uninterested in constitutional principles and in the well-being of their own and other citizens. It was never credible that they would implement costly climate treaties for the sake of humanity’s future. Even more democratic countries retreat when the domestic costs bite, as the United States did when it exited the Paris Agreement under President Trump.

Behavioural and political economy considerations

There is evidence that “peak climate policy” may already have passed in many jurisdictions, and Australia may not be an exception. A behavioural economics and political economy lens helps explain why enthusiasm is cooling after years of moralised rhetoric about existential risk. Governments and voters now confront high fiscal costs, limited near-term climate benefits, and costly economic distortions created by complex policy instruments. As competing priorities — defence, pensions, infrastructure — press on limited budgets, grand narratives are giving way to more modest, pragmatic debate. Two questions follow: how climate policy rose to public prominence, and why doubts are now growing.

How climate policy rose to the top

Until recently, climate protection dominated public discourse, around the world and particularly in Europe. National politicians and representatives of the United Nations warned of an “existential threat” and “the greatest challenge in human history”. Yet, despite all the warnings and massive climate protests, fossil fuel use, global greenhouse gas emissions, and average temperatures continue to rise. By contrast, climate protests have dwindled if not fully disappeared; only media attention to “climate catastrophes” has not yet waned. In the 1990s, it seemed unlikely that climate protection would become a guiding political theme. Reducing CO₂ emissions and other greenhouse gases imposes immediate costs, while the benefits are very distant and uncertain. Politics and society generally prefer the opposite: benefits first, costs later. Despite these obstacles, climate protection became a dominant political cause, influencing elections and mobilising the streets. Modern politics, in combination with behavioural economics, helps explain why: the harder a problem is to solve and the longer it persists, the more it lends itself to being a political and moral topic. Thus, climate protection became a business and climate change offered endless opportunities to spend, regulate, and posture, with limited accountability for results. Six mechanisms were central.

1. Expressive behaviour. Because one nation’s contribution to emissions hardly matters for climate change, the effectiveness of its emissions reduction policies is almost irrelevant. Public discourse thus revolved not around efficiency but around climate change as a moral issue. Governments pledged long-term “net zero” targets decades away, while the true costs would fall on future administrations. Symbolism, not substance, dominated. In Australia, period ratcheting of targets fits this pattern, which is typical for Western democracies. The latest goal — cutting emissions by 62%-70% below 2005 levels by 2035 — may prove overly ambitious. Emissions are currently about 28% below 2005 levels, with only modest progress in recent years (a decline of roughly 1.4% over the past year, and little change relative to three years ago). Unsurprisingly, critical assessments have followed. Hussein Dia, professor of transport technology and sustainability, argues that meeting the national target would require rapid, economy-wide transformation. He emphasises transport — Australia’s third-largest and fastest-growing source of emissions — as pivotal and persistently hard to decarbonise. Australia’s track record on carbon capture remains weak, and shifting heavy road freight to hydrogen appears inefficient relative to battery-electric options given current technologies and energy-efficiency differentials. Even where technologies are viable, the political economy is contested: prospective winners and losers shape the terrain.

2. Beneficiaries in politics. Politicians who championed climate policy early gained moral authority and media dominance. Criticism was often dismissed as immoral or “anti-science”, even though it was clear from the start that climate protection could only work globally, not merely nationally. At the same time, subsidies and levies expanded government revenue and offered room for patronage. Climate protection became a platform for redistribution and client politics.

3. New sources of money. Early climate measures and promises created immediate business opportunities. It is estimated that the electricity sector would require an estimated A$142 billion in capital investment to cover the essential electricity infrastructure by 2050. Subsidies for wind and solar, along with government contracts, fuelled new industries that profited from the money. Other companies thrived on selling “sustainable” products, consulting and certification services. Australia’s multibillion-dollar renewable energy subsidies have produced fortunes for a few, while leaving ordinary households with constantly mounting bills.

4. Bureaucracy loves regulation. Each new climate initiative generated tasks for departments, agencies, and regulators. As mandates and compliance regimes multiplied, Australia’s dual layers of Commonwealth and state authority made duplication and jurisdictional overlap more likely, driving up administrative complexity and costs.

5. Scapegoating. Climate change provided a convenient excuse for national policy failures. In developing nations, poverty could be blamed on global warming rather than corruption or poor governance. In industrialised countries, infrastructure shortcomings and poor preparation for natural disasters were often justified as consequences of a changing climate. Following floods or bushfires, leaders often face pressure to “do something,” a classic action bias in behavioural economics, and the attribution question — “was this climate change?” — can crowd out harder discussions about planning, land use and hazard management. In Australia, national leaders also faced backlash during the 2019 bushfire crisis for declining to engage substantively with climate questions. Globally, climate change can function as an easy scapegoat precisely because the systemic challenges in planning, land use and risk management are less visible, harder to narrate and slower to fix.

6. Passing on costs. Climate-related regulations introduced over time raised costs for companies, but because their competitors nationally and in several Western countries faced the same or similar regulations, those costs were passed on to consumers. In some cases, firms even profited. Europe’s emissions trading system, with free allocations of permits, allowed certain industries to earn windfalls. In Australia, the Safeguard Mechanism (from 2016) and renewable obligations can produce analogous dynamics, where consumers shoulder the costs and industries find ways to profit.

The turn: Why climate policy is losing steam

Now, however, the underlying economic logic is reasserting itself: genuine climate protection to reduce global warming would require effective global cooperation. But, this global cooperation has failed to materialise in practice, even though many climate treaties have been signed and numerous climate conferences have been held. After years of political grandstanding, ambitious policy targets, and vast amounts of subsidies, the climate issue is now losing its appeal. Six developments explain why “peak climate policy” has likely already passed.

1. The return to cost-benefit realism. More than 30 years after the Kyoto Protocol, the politically set climate targets are drawing nearer, and the costs of compliance are rising rapidly. Moralising slogans are giving way to more sober cost-benefit analysis. Many citizens are noticing how inefficient and expensive past strategies have been and how little they have contributed to slowing climate change.

2. Competition from other pressing issues. As the climate discourse loses its “monopoly” in public discourse, other priorities take centre stage: aging populations, pension security, and defence spending in an unstable geopolitical world. The fact is: A dollar cannot be spent twice. In Australia, billions for renewable subsidies will compete with other funding, such as defence, in a shifting Indo-Pacific security environment. The war in Ukraine has quickly shifted political and public opinion to the view that defence is, in the short run, a larger priority than climate change. Worldwide, the climate-adaptation and mitigation policies have substantially dropped since 2023.

3. Everything is relative. Climate damages can look frightening in absolute terms. But relative to growing economic output, they are relatively modest. Sound economic policy that generates decent growth rates has the potential to offset much of the negative impact of climate change. Recent cross-country evidence (147 countries over more than two decades) published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (Nature portfolio) reports an environmental-Kuznets-type pattern: as incomes rise, environmental pressures tend to intensify initially and then diminish. This does not trivialise severe local impacts or distributional inequities; it underscores that growth, technological progress and strong institutions expand adaptive capacity, even as targeted support is needed for the most exposed communities.

4. A change of perspective. Knowledge about climate change and climate science has advanced. People recognise that the 1.5°C “target” of the Paris Agreement is unrealistic; in fact, it has always been unrealistic from a socio-economic perspective. Similarly, the reference point against which global warming is measured, namely pre-industrial temperatures, is more symbolic than practical. They also understand that today’s especially rich societies have far greater capacity to cope with change than in 1850.

5. Adaptation instead of prevention. Since large-scale global emissions cuts remain unlikely in the near future, adaptation is moving to the forefront of the debate. Unlike distant promises of prevention, adaptation delivers immediate, tangible benefits. Investments in infrastructure, cooling technologies, water management, and urban design are visible, practical, and often cost-effective. In Australia, measures such as risk-appropriate zoning, fuel management, and improved land use likely deliver greater near-term payoff than symbolic targets. Likewise, air conditioning — long treated as almost taboo in parts of Europe, such as Germany — is increasingly recognised as a straightforward way to reduce heat stress. Americans, of course, have understood this for decades.

6. Climate technologies. New approaches, such as carbon removal or geo-engineering (e.g., rock weathering), are drawing growing attention. Their complexity brings “known unknowns,” such as potential effects on the global water cycle and other Earth-system feedbacks, but support for model-based research and robust governance frameworks is increasing, and complex-systems modelling will improve over time. Politically, the prospect of technological breakthroughs can be attractive because it signals progress without immediate economy-wide sacrifices, which in turn can dampen appetite for conventional mitigation focused on emissions cuts. or Australia, with strong research capacity, these technologies may represent an opportunity — provided they are pursued with rigorous evaluation, transparent risk management and international coordination.

Toward rational policy

Thus, global climate protection, until recently cast as humanity’s defining task, is increasingly giving way to approaches that are more realistic, tangible, and enforceable. The key question is whether a better economic design is available.

The answer is yes: through efficient cost transparency. Every country could adopt a universal CO₂ price. Such a mechanism would create the right incentives for producers and consumers without relying on subsidies, mandates, or complex regulations. The revenues should be fully returned to citizens — for example, via tax reductions on labour or consumption. This approach would be more efficient and more socially acceptable. The burden of a universal carbon price would be far lower than today’s labyrinth of subsidies and levies. Internationally, a simple and universal mechanism offers the best chance for effective cooperation.

Yet a CO₂ price that displaces subsidies and regulations deprives politicians, bureaucrats, and favoured industries of their privileges. The welfare-enhancing path remains blocked — not by economic logic, but by political incentives.

A mature approach

Climate change is real. But the politics of climate change — often marked by apocalyptic rhetoric, moral posturing, and costly symbolism — appears to have peaked. The experiences show both zeal and flaws: contested projections, generous subsidies, and rising household costs. Around the world, voters are beginning to ask harder questions, weighing real trade-offs, and prioritising issues closer to home.

What lies ahead is not the end of climate policy, but its transformation: fewer exaggerations and grand promises, more emphasis on adaptation and proven technologies, and potentially a shift toward economic and behavioural rationality via transparent, economy-wide pricing of emissions. Welcoming this shift is not cynicism; it is policy maturity — the recognition that effective climate action is less about headlines and more about solving problems efficiently, transparently and fairly.",https://www.themandarin.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/Murray-Watt-1.jpg?quality=70&w=1024,N,,2025-10-27 01:58:14.977950

,EPA,2025-10-27 04:00:24+00:00,Coastal Review,Opponents urge EPA to uphold objection to Asheboro permit | Coastal Review,Trista Talton,,,,,https://coastalreview.org/2025/10/opponents-urge-epa-to-uphold-objection-to-asheboro-permit/,"“Frankly I’m embarrassed that Asheboro is polluting the drinking water of as many as 900,000 people who live downstream from us,” longtime Asheboro resident Susie Scott said.
“1,4-dioxane is a synthetic, highly mobile compound that resists natural degradation and conventional water treatment.
Once it enters our watershed, it is persistent and travels far downstream, all the way to our drinking water intakes.
Removing 1,4-dioxane from our drinking water requires advanced and very costly treatment technologies.
The EPA may reaffirm its objection to the permit, require that the state modify the permit, or withdraw its objection of the permit.","North Carolinians from cities, towns and communities throughout the Cape Fear River Basin urged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to uphold its objection to a municipal wastewater treatment plant’s proposed permit that excludes an effluent discharge limit for 1,4-dioxane into their drinking water sources.

One after another, speakers at a public hearing the EPA hosted last Wednesday night asked the agency to force the state to reissue a permit that will limit discharges of the likely human carcinogen into surface waters that flow into tributaries of the Haw and Deep rivers, which converge to form the Cape Fear River.

Residents from Wilmington northwest to Fayetteville, Sanford, Pittsboro, Siler City, and Asheboro joined representatives of environmental organizations and downstream public water utilities at the hearing at Randolph Community College in Asheboro, the very city that fought to get 1,4-dioxane limits removed from its permit.

“Frankly I’m embarrassed that Asheboro is polluting the drinking water of as many as 900,000 people who live downstream from us,” longtime Asheboro resident Susie Scott said. “The solution, to me, seems simple. Our city should hold the companies producing this pollution to account and insist that they clean up their waste before we accept it into our treatment plant. People living downstream from us deserve safe drinking water.”

In August 2023, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Water Resources issued Asheboro a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permit limiting the city water treatment plant’s release of 1,4-dioxane.

The city sued, challenging the state’s power to include a water quality standard for the clear, odorless chemical solvent used in manufacturing processes.

In September 2024, the Chief Administrative Law Judge for North Carolina at the time, Donald van der Vaart, ruled in the city’s favor and revoked permit limits of 1,4-dioxane.

In his ruling, van der Vaart said that DEQ officials did not follow the letter of the law written in state statutes when they calculated discharge limits and established an enforceable water quality standard for 1,4-dixoane. He also noted anticipated high costs associated with monitoring and treatment of the chemical compound.

DEQ’s appeal of that ruling is pending in Wake County Superior Court.

Costs to treat 1,4-dioxane will fall on the backs of downstream water utilities customers if the pollutant is not controlled at the source, Cape Fear Public Utility Authority Executive Director Kenneth Waldroup said.

“The presence of 1,4-dioxane in our source water is just the latest example of how gaps in regulation can lead downstream communities exposed to risk,” he said. “1,4-dioxane is a synthetic, highly mobile compound that resists natural degradation and conventional water treatment. Once it enters our watershed, it is persistent and travels far downstream, all the way to our drinking water intakes. Removing 1,4-dioxane from our drinking water requires advanced and very costly treatment technologies. We’re talking millions of dollars in systems and additional millions in operations costs over a period of time.”

Waldroup said DEQ “took appropriate action” when it included 1,4-dioxane limits in Asheboro’s NPDES permit, but that the state Office of Administrative Hearings “inappropriately and inaccurately invalidated that move.”

“EPA is obligated to assume permitting authority if the state fails to comply with federal permits, and EPA must require the state of North Carolina to address this pollutant and protect 900,000 downstream users,” he said.

Public water utilities, including CFPUA, and businesses downstream of Asheboro’s wastewater treatment plant were notified by DEQ last January that the plant had discharged substantially high concentrations of 1,4-dioxane into Hasketts Creek, which empties into the Deep River.

Misty Manning, Fayetteville Public Works Commission’s chief operations officer for water resources, recalled to EPA officials last week of the Jan. 24 sampling results reported by the state and Asheboro.

“Asheboro’s own sampling result from that day was 3,520 parts per billion. This is more than 10 times higher than EPA’s calculation of what Asheboro’s discharge should be to protect public health at 22 parts per billion. Without enforceable limits, the city of Asheboro’s pretreatment program has yet to be successful in limiting 1,4-dioxane discharges to levels that meet water quality goals for a pollutant with a reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above state water quality standards,” Manning said.

She was one of several speakers at the hearing to point out that other municipalities in the state have successfully reduced 1,4-dioxane discharges through industrial pretreatment processes without bearing economic hardship.

“And Asheboro has the responsibility to do likewise, using its permitted authority over their local industrial users,” Manning said. “Downstream communities should not bear the financial burden of treating and removing pollutants introduced by unchecked upstream discharges.”

Last June, the Southern Environmental Law Center filed a lawsuit on behalf of Cape Fear River Watch and Haw River Assembly against Asheboro and the city’s industrial customer StarPet Inc., to stop their discharges of 1,4-dioxane into the Cape Fear River basin.

“As part of its antiregulatory fight, Asheboro has raised the absurd argument that it should not be the one that has to pay to control the cancer-causing pollution that it dumps upstream of drinking water supplies,” SELC attorney Hannah Nelson said. “I want to be clear. Asheboro could stop this pollution today by requiring its industries to treat for 1,4-dioxane, but it has chosen not to. In making that choice, Asheboro forces us, the families, the drinking water utilities, the local businesses, the schools, all of those who live downstream of the city, choose us to have to pay for their pollution.”

Stephen Bell, an attorney with Cranfill Sumer law firm’s Wilmington office and outside counsel for Asheboro, said that the city he represents believes steps DEQ took in implementing the August 2023 permit “set dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications.”

“Asheboro is not asking for no water regulation. They’re asking for regulation in accordance with the state law. As it stands today, based upon the court’s ruling, there is no water quality standard for 1,4-dioxane. The courts, our environmental rulemaking agency, they’re currently addressing this issue of limits for 1,4-dioxane and the EPA should respect that state-level process,” he said.

Once everyone at the hearing who signed up to speak addressed EPA officials, a member of the audience asked when the agency expects to make a final determination on the permit. The EPA may reaffirm its objection to the permit, require that the state modify the permit, or withdraw its objection of the permit.

Paul Schwartz, associate regional counsel in the Water Law Office at EPA’s Atlanta region office, said there is no statutory or regulatory timeline in which the agency must decide.

“In terms of specifying a date, certain that it would be done by, I don’t think we can do that,” he said. “And it doesn’t make it any easier that we’re operating during a period of government shutdown. But I think we want to give it immediate attention and focus on it so it doesn’t drag on too long.”

If the EPA decides to reaffirm its objection or require the permit to be modified, DEQ will have 30 days to submit a revised draft permit to the agency. If DEQ does not do that, the EPA will become the permitting authority.

Outcomes of Recent Multilateral Meetings Relevant for the Environment

Last week, multilateralism was revived with key outcomes achieved at various intergovernmental decision-making meetings held in Geneva:

The Extraordinary Session of the World Meteorological Congress was held to accelerate and expand the global Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative, along with other urgent strategic priorities that cannot wait until the next regular Congress in 2027. At the session:

WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo launched a Call to Action on Accelerating the Implementation of the Early Warnings for All Initiative and a new report Early Warnings for All in Focus: Hazard Monitoring and Forecasting, tracking global progress and gaps in the detection, monitoring, forecasting and warning across the hydrometeorological value chain, including for hazards such as tropical storms, floods, sand and dust storms and extreme heat. → WMO Press Release

WMO, together with the Global Water Partnership (GWP), officially launched the Community of Practice (CoP) on Flood Forecasting , a collaborative space for professionals working on flood forecasting, warning, and early action. It strengthens flood early warning systems and helps deliver timely, actionable information to people at risk. → Join the CoP

WMO adopted the first WMO Youth Action Plan, marking a structured approach to integrating youth perspectives into its work and empowering the next generation of leaders. Immediate priorities include establishing a WMO Youth Network, expanding training opportunities and mentorships, and amplifying youth-led storytelling and communication initiatives.

The World Meteorological Congress endorsed actions to promote Artificial Intelligence for forecasts and warnings. Congress approved a new set of technical regulations concerning early warning services and issued a “call to all stakeholders” to collaborate on the development of AI/machine learning environmental monitoring and prediction technologies, tools and applications.

WMO’s Executive Council, held back-to-back to the Congress, confirmed a total budget of 138.7 million for the biennium 2026/2027 and agreed to the terms of reference and composition of the task force, which will identify proposals for realignment of WMO’s Strategic and Operating Plans during the 2026–2027 biennium.

The 16th United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD16) gathered 170 delegations from member states, including 80 ministers and vice ministers of trade and economy, leading voices from the private sector and strong participation from developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing states – alongside major economies and key trade actors. It “reaffirmed the centrality of a rules-based, open, transparent and equitable multilateral trading system”, as stated by UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan in her closing remarks. Key outcomes of the conference include:

How microplastic pollution is boosting antimicrobial resistance | GAVI | 17 October 2025

Plastics could play a role in driving the development and transmission of AMR throughout their entire life-cycle, a new report warns. During the extraction of raw materials for the fossil fuel industry – including crude oil, natural gas and coal – biocides are used to prevent bacteria from colonising pipelines and equipment carrying oil or mining fluids. These chemicals may be inadvertently released into the environment, fuelling AMR in spill-affected areas. Exposure of microbes to sub-lethal concentrations of biocides can trigger the emergence of resistance and the sharing of resistance genes within biofilm communities.

UN experts urge binding accountability for agribusiness to safeguard peasants’ rights and global food security | OHCHR | 16 October

The Environmental Protection Agency established comprehensive air quality standards in May 2024, creating stringent requirements for copper smelting operations nationwide. These regulations targeted hazardous emissions that posed significant health risks to surrounding communities, mandating substantial reductions in toxic pollutants including lead, arsenic, mercury, benzene, and dioxins.

Industry analysts projected implementation costs ranging from $200-500 million per facility, depending on existing infrastructure and required technological upgrades. The original framework provided a three-year compliance window, with smelters required to install advanced emission control systems by 2027.

Key Pollutants Targeted by the Original Standards

The 2024 rule addressed five primary hazardous air pollutants with documented links to severe health complications:

• Lead exposure – Associated with neurological damage and developmental delays in children

• Arsenic emissions – Linked to increased cancer risk and cardiovascular disease

• Mercury releases – Causes brain and nervous system damage

• Benzene compounds – Connected to leukemia and blood disorders

• Dioxin contamination – Associated with cancer and reproductive system issues

The regulation represented an update to National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants under Clean Air Act Section 112 authority, specifically targeting the limited domestic copper processing infrastructure.

Implementation Timeline and Compliance Expectations

The original regulatory framework established clear milestones for industry compliance:

2024-2025: Initial assessment and planning phase

2025-2026: Technology procurement and installation preparation

2026-2027: Full system deployment and testing

2027: Complete compliance achievement

Furthermore, specific reduction percentages for each pollutant were established in official EPA documentation from May 2024, providing clear targets for industry compliance.

What Prompted Trump's Executive Reversal Decision?

President Trump announced the Trump copper smelter emissions rule reversal on October 24, 2025, citing national security concerns and industrial competitiveness as primary justifications. The Trump executive order granted a two-year compliance exemption, arguing that stringent environmental standards threatened America's already constrained domestic copper processing capacity.

National Security Implications of Copper Production

The proclamation emphasised copper's designation as a critical material essential for multiple strategic sectors:

• Defence infrastructure and military equipment manufacturing

• Electric vehicle production and battery technology

• Renewable energy systems including solar panels and wind turbines

• Advanced telecommunications networks and data infrastructure

• Grid modernisation for distributed energy resources

According to the White House statement, imposing environmental requirements on such limited domestic industry risked accelerating facility closures, weakening the nation's industrial base, undermining mineral independence, and increasing reliance on foreign-controlled processing capacity.

Economic Justifications for Regulatory Relief

The Trump administration highlighted several economic factors supporting the regulatory exemption:

Limited Domestic Capacity: Only two operational copper smelters remain in the United States, representing the entirety of primary copper processing capability.

Technology Availability Concerns: Required emission control systems were characterised as lacking commercial viability within the original timeline.

Compliance Cost Burden: Implementation expenses could potentially force facility closures, eliminating domestic processing capacity entirely.

Foreign Dependency Risks: Increased reliance on Chinese-controlled processing capacity posed strategic vulnerabilities.

Industrial Base Protection: Preserving critical manufacturing capabilities took precedence over environmental timeline adherence.

Section 232 Investigation Connection

The copper smelter exemption built upon earlier Section 232 trade actions implemented in 2025. Following a national security investigation, the administration imposed Trump tariffs on copper stocks including a 50% tariff on certain imported copper products and mandated increasing percentages of high-quality scrap copper produced domestically be sold within US markets.

These coordinated policies demonstrated a comprehensive approach to reshoring copper processing capacity through both trade measures and regulatory relief. Moreover, the Trump tariffs economic impact extends beyond copper to influence broader industrial strategy.

Which Copper Facilities Are Affected by This Policy Change?

The regulatory exemption directly impacts America's remaining copper smelting infrastructure, representing critical industrial assets for domestic mineral processing.

Freeport-McMoRan's Arizona Operations

Freeport-McMoRan operates the nation's largest copper smelter in Miami, Arizona, processing approximately 400,000 tonnes of copper annually. The Phoenix-based company directly benefits from the two-year compliance exemption, providing operational certainty during regulatory uncertainty.

Company representatives expressed gratitude for the exemption, stating it acknowledges operational realities facing domestic copper smelting and provides needed time to assess and plan for appropriate regulatory reconsideration of the Copper Rule and future implementation.

Rio Tinto's Utah Kennecott Smelter

Rio Tinto's Kennecott operation in Utah processes roughly 300,000 tonnes annually but remains unaffected by the original 2024 regulations due to previous environmental investments. The company invested significantly in emission capture technology, achieving compliance ahead of the original timeline.

Rio Tinto emphasised their long-standing commitment to reducing environmental footprint through innovation and investment, highlighting equipment that captures emissions as the basis for regulatory compliance.

Facility Owner Location Annual Capacity Exemption Status Miami Smelter Freeport-McMoRan Arizona 400,000 tonnes Exempt Kennecott Smelter Rio Tinto Utah 300,000 tonnes Compliant

Combined US Processing Capacity

These two facilities represent approximately 700,000 tonnes of annual domestic copper processing capacity, highlighting the strategic importance of maintaining operational continuity in this limited industrial base.

How Does This Impact America's Copper Supply Chain Security?

The regulatory reversal reflects broader concerns about mineral independence and supply chain resilience, particularly given China's dominance in global copper processing markets and projected demand increases from clean energy transitions.

Global Copper Smelting Landscape

China controls approximately 50% of worldwide copper smelting capacity, creating strategic vulnerabilities for nations dependent on copper imports. The United States processes less than 5% of global copper despite significant domestic mining operations.

The US produces approximately 1.2 million tonnes of copper concentrate annually but can only process 700,000 tonnes domestically, requiring exports to foreign smelters for final processing of roughly 500,000 tonnes or 41% of domestic production.

Strategic Implications for Clean Energy Transition

Copper price insights indicate a 70% increase in demand by 2030 due to electrification trends and renewable energy deployment. This surge reflects multiple technological shifts:

• Electric Vehicle Manufacturing: Each EV requires 180-400 pounds of copper compared to 50 pounds in traditional vehicles

• Renewable Energy Infrastructure: Solar panels, wind turbines, and grid modernisation require substantial copper inputs

• Charging Infrastructure: EV charging networks demand extensive copper wiring and components

• Grid Integration: Distributed energy resources require upgraded transmission and distribution systems

Supply Chain Vulnerability Assessment

The structural deficit in domestic processing capacity creates several strategic risks:

Processing Dependency: 41% of US copper concentrate requires foreign processing

Geographic Concentration: China's 50% market share creates single-point-of-failure risks

Technology Transfer: Foreign processing potentially involves intellectual property exposure

Price Volatility: Limited domestic capacity reduces negotiating leverage in global markets

Security of Supply: Geopolitical tensions could disrupt processing access

What Are the Environmental and Health Consequences?

Environmental advocates express significant concern that the Trump copper smelter emissions rule reversal delays critical public health protections, particularly for communities surrounding copper smelting facilities where residents face continued exposure to hazardous emissions.

Air Quality Impact Assessment

The two-year compliance exemption maintains current emission levels rather than implementing the substantial reductions mandated under the original rule:

• Continued Carcinogenic Emissions: Lead, arsenic, and benzene releases persist at current levels

• Delayed Technology Implementation: Advanced emission control systems remain uninstalled

• Extended Community Exposure: Residential areas near smelters continue experiencing current pollution levels

• Postponed Air Quality Improvements: Regional atmospheric conditions show no immediate improvement

Community Health Considerations

Historical data indicates elevated rates of respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, and developmental disorders in areas surrounding copper smelters. The exemption extends these exposure patterns for an additional 24 months beyond the original compliance timeline.

Affected Population Areas:

• Miami, Arizona: Communities surrounding the Freeport-McMoRan facility

• Utah Region: Areas near the Rio Tinto Kennecott smelter (though this facility achieved compliance)

Health Impact Valuation

According to Reuters reporting, the exemption period maintains exposure to substances with documented health effects, including neurological damage from lead exposure, cancer risks from arsenic and benzene, and reproductive system impacts from dioxin contamination.

Specific epidemiological studies and health outcome data for these communities require verification through CDC, EPA, or state health department publications to provide accurate baseline health metrics and projected impacts of the compliance delay.

How Do Industry Stakeholders View This Regulatory Change?

The copper industry generally welcomed the exemption while environmental groups criticised the prioritisation of economic concerns over public health protections, creating distinct perspectives on the regulatory balance.

Mining Industry Perspective

Industry representatives argue the original three-year timeline was unrealistic given technological limitations and capital requirements. Key industry positions include:

Technology Feasibility Concerns: Available emission control systems lacked commercial viability within the proposed timeframe.

Capital Investment Constraints: Implementation costs ranging from $200-500 million per facility posed significant financial burdens.

Closure Risk Assessment: Regulatory compliance costs could force facility shutdowns, eliminating domestic processing capacity entirely.

Strategic Security Arguments: Complete reliance on foreign operations would compromise national security interests.

Company-Specific Responses

Freeport-McMoRan thanked the Trump administration, characterising the exemption as acknowledging operational realities facing domestic copper smelting while providing needed time for regulatory reconsideration and future implementation planning.

Rio Tinto emphasised their commitment to reducing environmental footprint through innovation and investment, noting their Utah operation's compliance due to previous emission capture equipment investments.

Environmental Group Response

Environmental organisations contend the reversal undermines EPA authority and delays necessary health protections. Their primary arguments include:

• Regulatory Authority Erosion: Presidential exemptions weaken environmental agency effectiveness

• Public Health Prioritisation: Economic considerations should not supersede community health protections

• Technology Availability: Emission control solutions exist but require regulatory pressure for implementation

• Environmental Justice: Communities near smelters disproportionately bear health risks

What Happens During the Two-Year Exemption Period?

The exemption provides breathing room for industry and regulators to develop feasible compliance pathways while maintaining domestic smelting operations, creating opportunities for technological innovation and regulatory reassessment.

Technology Development Timeline

Expected developments during the 2025-2027 exemption period include:

Q1 2026: Formation of industry-EPA working groups to assess technological feasibility and alternative compliance pathways.

Q2 2026: Comprehensive technology feasibility assessments examining available emission control systems and their commercial viability.

Q3 2026: Implementation of pilot programmes testing emission reduction technologies at operational scales.

Q4 2026: Updated cost-benefit analyses incorporating technological developments and economic impacts.

2027: Proposal of revised regulatory framework balancing environmental protection with industrial competitiveness.

Investment and Innovation Opportunities

The delay period may encourage private sector investment in emission control technologies, potentially creating more cost-effective solutions than those available during original rule development. In addition, copper investment strategies may evolve to account for regulatory changes.

Technology Innovation Areas:

• Advanced filtration systems for particulate matter control

• Chemical scrubbing technologies for gaseous pollutant removal

• Process modification techniques reducing emission generation

• Monitoring and control systems for real-time emission management

• Energy recovery systems offsetting compliance costs

Regulatory Reassessment Process

The exemption period allows comprehensive evaluation of:

Technical Feasibility: Actual availability and performance of emission control technologies

Economic Impact: Precise compliance costs and their effect on facility viability

Alternative Approaches: Graduated compliance timelines or performance-based standards

International Best Practices: Emission control strategies employed by other copper-producing nations

Technology Development: Emerging solutions that may reduce compliance costs or improve effectiveness

What Are the Broader Implications for Mining Regulation?

This regulatory reversal signals a shift toward balancing environmental protection with industrial competitiveness, potentially influencing future mining and processing regulations across critical mineral supply chains.

Precedent for Critical Mineral Industries

The copper smelter exemption establishes a framework for addressing regulatory challenges across critical mineral supply chains, particularly where domestic processing capacity is limited and national security implications exist.

Potential Applications:

• Lithium Processing: Domestic battery-grade lithium production faces similar capacity constraints

• Rare Earth Element Refining: Limited US rare earth processing creates foreign dependency

• Battery Metal Processing: Nickel, cobalt, and manganese processing capacity remains underdeveloped domestically

• Uranium Enrichment: Nuclear fuel processing involves both environmental and security considerations

Future Regulatory Approach

The Trump administration's approach suggests prioritising domestic production capacity preservation while seeking technological solutions that balance environmental and economic objectives.

Key Regulatory Principles:

National Security Integration: Environmental regulations evaluated through security impact assessments.

Industrial Base Protection: Regulatory timelines adjusted to prevent facility closures in critical sectors.

Technology Development Support: Exemption periods used to advance emission control innovation.

Graduated Implementation: Phased compliance timelines based on technological and economic feasibility.

International Competitiveness: Regulatory costs balanced against global market positioning.

Legislative and Regulatory Implications

This precedent may influence Congressional approaches to environmental regulation, particularly regarding critical minerals designated under various strategic initiatives. Future legislation might incorporate explicit national security exemptions or alternative compliance pathways for strategically important industries.

Potential Policy Developments:

• Critical Minerals List Updates: Expanded designation of materials subject to security-based regulatory relief

• Alternative Compliance Mechanisms: Performance-based standards rather than technology-specific requirements

• Technology Development Incentives: Federal support for emission control innovation in strategic sectors

• International Coordination: Cooperative approaches with allies to maintain environmental standards while preserving strategic capabilities

Conclusion: Balancing Security and Environmental Protection

Trump's copper smelter emissions rule reversal reflects complex tradeoffs between immediate environmental benefits and long-term strategic security considerations. The two-year exemption creates opportunity for stakeholders to develop solutions protecting both public health and domestic industrial capacity.

The decision highlights fundamental tensions between environmental protection and national security priorities, particularly in sectors with limited domestic capacity and high strategic importance. The outcome will likely establish precedents for regulating critical mineral industries, balancing environmental standards with competitive positioning in global supply chains.

Key Considerations Moving Forward:

The success of this approach depends on whether the exemption period generates meaningful technological innovations and regulatory solutions. Environmental advocates will monitor health outcomes in affected communities, while industry stakeholders will assess technological feasibility and economic viability of eventual compliance requirements.

The broader implications extend beyond copper processing to encompass America's entire critical minerals strategy, influencing how policymakers balance environmental protection with strategic industrial capacity preservation in an increasingly complex geopolitical environment.

Disclaimer: This analysis reflects policy developments as of October 2025. Future regulatory changes, technological developments, or geopolitical shifts may alter the strategic calculations underlying these decisions. Environmental and health impact assessments should be verified through official EPA, CDC, and state regulatory agency publications.

,Texas Environment,2025-10-27 03:36:51+00:00,The Daily Texan,Living 9-to-5 - The Daily Texan,Luke Stark,,,,,https://thedailytexan.com/2025/10/26/living-9-to-5/,"Due to the current economic struggles and social fragmentation, many in our generation are struggling to achieve this goal, experiencing loneliness and isolation.
However, the traditional 9-to-5 work schedule still provides the opportunity to find essential social connections.
While forming personal connections through work helps combat isolation, employees must still maintain and strengthen those connections.
Young adults’ daily experience in the workplace should be seen as an opportunity to establish new social connections.
The 9-to-5 work schedule has long been seen as a producer of boredom, but with the right mindset, living 9-to-5 can be an adventure.","What does it mean to live a normal life? Coming out of college, the traditional goal for many was to get a well-paying job, live in a nice place and socialize with people their age. Due to the current economic struggles and social fragmentation, many in our generation are struggling to achieve this goal, experiencing loneliness and isolation. However, the traditional 9-to-5 work schedule still provides the opportunity to find essential social connections.

It is important to understand the current difficulties that young adults are facing. Chris Beevers, director of the Institute for Mental Health Research, explained the paradoxical dichotomy of modern connection.

“Young adults are more connected to other people via online methods, but at the same time report higher levels of loneliness than ever,” Beever said. “What we’re finding is that for a lot of adolescents, just having a lot of contact with friends online is not sufficient.”

Therefore, a traditional in-person work environment may be more optimal for socialization because working virtually does not provide the same personal experience.

Chemistry freshman Jesse Bridwell expressed his concerns with a fully virtual employment.

“If you’re in your home 24/7, you can box yourself in and get in a little depressive episode,” Bridwell said. “I can’t imagine it’d be too good.”

However, the workplace is not a straightforward solution to loneliness. Although the workplace does undeniably create opportunities for in-person connections, much of that is dependent on the workplace culture.

“If the culture is basically everybody goes off, works in their office, eats lunch by themselves and then they go home at the end of the day, that doesn’t really do a lot for increasing interaction,” Beevers said.

Thus, it takes an active effort to create connections amongst coworkers. Another way to establish personal connections is through shared interests.

“If you have that common interest, it’s almost like an automatic entry into a conversation,” Beevers said.

While forming personal connections through work helps combat isolation, employees must still maintain and strengthen those connections. Beevers’ research found that spontaneity may be the key to fighting off feelings of loneliness.

“We collected Bluetooth signatures, which helped us understand when they were spending time with people versus without people,” Beevers said.

With this data, Beevers’ team determined that performing a variety of activities was beneficial for one’s mental health.

“The people who reported being the least lonely were the ones spending time with the same people, but having some variety in their day-to-day living,” Beevers said.

Therefore, the solution to our current crisis of loneliness requires both routine and spontaneity. Young adults’ daily experience in the workplace should be seen as an opportunity to establish new social connections. However, to strengthen these connections, individuals should embrace novel experiences, taking chances on new activities. The 9-to-5 work schedule has long been seen as a producer of boredom, but with the right mindset, living 9-to-5 can be an adventure.",https://thedailytexan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101325_AnujaManjrekar_9-5_WEB.png.png,N,,2025-10-26 23:57:39.508908

When we talk about Henry Hub, we’re really talking about Sabine Pipe Line (SPL) — a small, 150-mile, 235-MMcf/d interstate system in Southern Louisiana — and the 11 pipelines that connect to it in Vermillion Parish, LA.
These include: Acadian, Columbia Gulf (CGT), Gulf South, Jefferson Island, Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL), Sea Robin, Southern Natural (SONAT), Texas Gas, Transcontinental Gas Pipeline (Transco), Trunkline, and Bridgeline, an intrastate sister pipeline to Sabine.

Since 1990, it’s also served as the delivery mechanism for the third-largest commodity futures trading instrument in the world — the CME/NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures contract (behind only WTI and Brent crude). We delved into the formation, evolution and rationale for the benchmark trading location in our Henry the Hub, I Am I Am blog series, and we highly recommend you revisit those blogs if you want to learn how the hub really works.

As shown in Figure 1 below, most of these interconnects are bidirectional, and all but four (Acadian, Bridgeline, Jefferson Island and Sea Robin) are large-diameter, long-haul interstate pipelines. Depending on the combination of receipt and delivery points, these interconnects total as much as 3 Bcf/d of receipt capacity inside the hub and as much as 2.6 Bcf/d of delivery capacity. (For more on pipeline flows, see RBN’s Arrow Model, which breaks Louisiana and Texas into 11 regions and creates predictions for flows based on internal supply-and-demand fundamentals and the available pipeline capacity from one region to another.)

“Evolution” was written by Sheryl Crow and appears as the first song on side two of her 12th studio album of the same name. Released as a single in January 2024, it went to #12 on the Billboard Adult Alternatives chart and #33 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Singles chart. Crow said the song is about “leaving a better world for my children and a healthier planet.” Personnel in the record were: Sheryl Crow (lead, backing vocals), Mike Elizondo (keyboards, bass, drum programming, acoustic guitar), Fred Ettringham (drums, percussion), Rob Moose (viola, violin) and Tom Morello (Digi Tech Whammy WH-1 pedal guitar solo).

The album Evolution was recorded at Phantom Studios and Old Green Barn in Nashville, as well as Multiview Studios in Los Angeles, with Mike Elizondo, Sheryl Crow and John Shanks serving as producers. Released in March 2024, it went to # 42 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart. Four singles were released from the LP.

Sheryl Crow is an American singer, songwriter, musician and actress. When singing in bands on the weekend while teaching school during the week in rural Missouri, Crow met St. Louis musician and record producer Jay Oliver. Oliver used Crow for jingles for McDonald's and Toyota. Crow relocated to Los Angeles, where she did session vocals and hooked up as a backing vocalist on Michael Jackson's Bad World Tour from 1987 to 1989. Her debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club, was released in 1993. She has released 12 studio albums, four live albums, seven compilation albums, two EPs and 56 singles.

The details announced fall short of creating a fully independent EPA. A better model than the one announced by Minister Watt would be one in which the Environment Minister makes nature protection rules, and the EPA assesses and approves projects and enforces the rules based on strong National Environmental Standards.

“For decades, ministers have been able to be influenced and pressured by developers. Tragically, this has resulted in millions of hectares of valuable bushland and habitat being razed by bulldozers, and Australia’s natural wealth significantly degraded,” said ACF Acting CEO Paul Sinclair.

“We remain strongly of the view that independent, expert decision making by the EPA on assessments and approvals is the best way to the deliver the consistency and certainty that is needed under our national nature protection laws. Arm’s length decision making is better for nature and better for business.

Write to Maddison Elliott at Mining.com.au Images: IMARC, Silica Resources Australia & Pilbara Ports","State governments emphasised Australia’s reach in the critical minerals sector after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese met with US President Donald Trump last week to produce a secure supply amid export bans from China.

At the International Mining and Resources Conference (IMARC) in Sydney from 21-23 October, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns made an appearance to highlight the state’s clear focus on aiding the clean energy transition.

“Not only do we have experienced companies, the trained workforce, the stable democracy, the rule of law, we’ve also got the critical minerals sitting there to make a big difference: 21 of 31 on the critical minerals list, four out of five on the strategic minerals list, significant deposits of rare earths,” Minns says.

“We’ve got critical minerals and high-tech metal projects that are ready to go.”

Minns believes New South Wales projects are likely to rake in billions for the state economy, while also making a “major difference to the global economy”, so long as investors start buying in.

The Premier described the event as a sales pitch for investors, where companies can showcase their assets and appeal to market demand.

“Without mining, we can’t transition our energy system. We can’t expand renewable power. We can’t drive the economy of the future,” Minns adds.

The conference welcomed more than 11,000 mining executives, operational staff, investors, government officials, diplomats and METS companies over the three day event, reaching new heights.

Mining.com.au was in attendance at the event this year, with Executive Producer Shae Russell on the floor.

Queensland captures investors

A state north of IMARC, Queensland jumped onboard the country-wide focus on critical minerals, investing $30 million into silica mining jobs in Far North Queensland.

The investment will create 180 new jobs south of Innisfail, where public, unlisted, critical minerals company Silica Resources Australia’s Mourilyan Silica Sands Project is focused on ramping up production efforts.

The project was recently awarded a $30 million grant from the Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC) to produce over 360,000 tonnes in the next year, and over 750,000 tonnes in the next five years.

Also attending IMARC, Queensland Minister for Finance, Trade, Employment and Training Ros Bates describes the investment as an initiative to deliver better outcomes and stronger returns to become a “significant local employer”.

“Silica flour is an essential precursor for silicon, a key component in advanced technologies like semiconductors and solar panels,” Bates says.

“Demand in countries like Japan, Korea and Taiwan is growing rapidly, and we are taking strong action to make sure Queensland is essential in the global supply chain.

“Our investment through QIC has delivered the plant, equipment, and land acquisitions for SRA to get on with creating jobs and mining the more than 50 million tonnes of silica sand on the project site.”

Utilising this grant, Silica Resources Managing Director Rob Tindall says the company intends to develop common user infrastructure at Mourilyan.

“This investment and our existing mining lease has allowed us to start extracting from a silica deposit requiring only shallow, low-cost extraction methods,” Tindall says.

“Demand driven by solar and clean energy technologies is anticipated to grow the global silica sand market to more than $36 billion by 2032, and this project allows North Queensland to secure a stake in that market while creating local employment and trade opportunities.”

Meanwhile, Queensland-based Graphinex has secured a US$860 million ($1.32 billion) Letter of Interest from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) to fund a proposed graphite mine and processing plant in North Queensland.

The site is predicted to create over 200 jobs at the mine site near Croydon and the plant in Townsville.

“Over the past decade, exports were transactional, relationships were an afterthought, Queensland’s export potential sat idle, and investment opportunities were missed,” Bates adds.

“By taking our international partnerships seriously, we are delivering a fresh start with new jobs and new investment, so Queenslanders can get on with building the lifestyle they deserve.”

Minister for Natural Resources and Mines Dale Last describes the support from the US as a “vote of confidence” for Queensland’s resources.

“This Letter of Interest follows close engagement between the Crisafulli Government and EXIM, as part of our plan to restore Queensland’s international reputation and deliver a better lifestyle for Queenslanders through a stronger economy,” Last says.

“Queensland is home to world-class graphite reserves in the world, and Graphinex’s plan to mine, process and manufacture ultra-high performance anodes right here in Queensland shows we are ready to lead the next wave of critical minerals investment.”

Graphinex Managing Director Art Malone says the US has sent a strong signal regarding its graphite demand.

“This is a pivotal moment for Graphinex and a strong signal from Washington DC that graphite matters,” Malone says.

“The US has made it clear that secure supply chains for critical minerals are essential to advanced manufacturing and defence capability.

“This financing milestone provides the momentum needed to accelerate development, lock in downstream partnerships, and create a secure and scalable pathway for high-quality and reliable graphite supply into the US market.”

WA conference opens

Over in Western Australia, the Pilbara Ports Safe Ships Safe Ports Forum welcomed 700 delegates including Australian and international industry leaders from the marine, resources and logistics sector.

Ports Minister Stephen Dawson described the Pilbara region as the “engine room of the Australian economy”.

“Pilbara Ports Safe Ships Safe Ports Forum is an outstanding example of collaboration across industry to strengthen maritime safety and operational excellence,” Dawson says.

“Confirming the feasibility of ship-to-ship ammonia refuelling at the Port of Port Hedland marks a major step towards establishing the Pilbara as a global hub for clean fuel bunkering and decarbonised shipping.”

The forum is regarded as one of the country’s largest maritime conferences, first established in 2016.

The 2025 program ran from 21-22 October, focusing on the Pilbara Ports Clean Fuel Bunkering Strategy to support a ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering trial at the Port of Port Hedland in 2026.

At its meeting on Oct. 8, city council gave approval — known as municipal support confirmation (MSC) — to two solar energy projects in Kanata North and two more in West Carleton-March.
That comes after the city hit pause on new renewable energy facilities over the summer.
""With falling costs and improving capabilities of renewable energy and battery energy storage systems, renewable resources such as solar energy should be competitive in our supplies,"" the agency said.
Solar technology has been improving, agreed both Hinzer and John Kirkwood, president of the Ottawa Renewable Energy Co-operative (OREC).","Four solar panel projects in Ottawa have received the go-ahead from city council, and experts and advocates believe more could soon follow.

""Nothing is more important right now than energy. We talk about how energy is the new gold,"" said Kanata North Coun. Cathy Curry, whose ward could house two of the new projects.

At its meeting on Oct. 8, city council gave approval — known as municipal support confirmation (MSC) — to two solar energy projects in Kanata North and two more in West Carleton-March.

That comes after the city hit pause on new renewable energy facilities over the summer.

The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), the organization that manages Ontario's electricity system, requires developers to have MSCs before submitting a provincial procurement proposal.

The four projects which got an MSC from council on Oct. 8 were:

The Dunrobin Solar Project, located on Dunrobin Road and on two properties without addresses.

The Carp Airport Solar Project at 1500 Thomas Argue Rd.

Kanata Solar I at 375 March Valley Rd. and 940 Klondike Rd.

Kanata Solar II at 915 Klondike Rd.

They all still need to be approved at the provincial level before they become a reality.

But they're needed, Curry said, to meet a growing demand for electricity in a changing world, adding that she anticipates many more renewable energy projects will get greenlit across Ontario.

Electricity demand

According to Curry, whose ward is known for its tech park, reliable energy is essential to attract and support businesses.

""It used to be that companies would come in and put all their furniture in and then ask [Hydro Ottawa], 'Oh, can you hook us up to electricity?'"" Curry said.

""It's a totally different world now. [Businesses] won't even relocate, they won't expand unless they know they can be guaranteed that power.""

Curry added that it's important for the energy to be green so that companies from foreign countries with stricter regulations can still meet their requirements if they relocate to Kanata or open an office there.

'Population explosion'

In addition to businesses, ordinary Ontarians will increasingly need power, said Karin Hinzer, an electrical engineering professor at the University of Ottawa, in a French-language interview.

There's been a ""population explosion"" across Ontario — including Ottawa — that ""was not planned for 20 years ago,"" Hinzer said.

In a French-language statement to Radio-Canada, the IESO wrote that electricity demand in Ontario is expected to increase significantly and it wants to ""maintain the reliability of the provincial grid at the lowest cost.""

As of May 14, 2025, only 2.2 per cent of Ontario's electricity was being generated by solar power, according to data from the Ontario Energy Board.

But that could change, the IESO said.

""With falling costs and improving capabilities of renewable energy and battery energy storage systems, renewable resources such as solar energy should be competitive in our supplies,"" the agency said.

Solar technology has been improving, agreed both Hinzer and John Kirkwood, president of the Ottawa Renewable Energy Co-operative (OREC).

OREC partnered with the Canada Science and Technology Museum in 2019 to install solar panels on its roof, and this summer installed even more, Kirkwood said.

The newer solar panels are double-sided, he said, so they can generate more electricity than the old ones of the same size.

""We've got close to a megawatt operating on this rooftop,"" he said.

Kirkwood also expects there will be more demand for solar energy in the coming years and said he's ""really optimistic about the direction the [provincial] government is taking.""

""We're looking forward to absolutely more renewable energy. And it's not just because it feels good or it's nice,"" Kirkwood said.

""We believe it's literally cheaper than nuclear, than natural gas, and it's obviously better for the environment. So we think it's a benefit in many respects.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/92ce7ecb-6349-42ab-bcbd-1d38032996f9,1761321086433/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C1197%2C673%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-10-26 18:58:16.960965

Formerly of Los Alamos

While visiting with my sister and her husband this week, we enjoyed getting out and exploring the Hill Country of Texas. One of our stops was Wimberley Glassworks.

The company often allows patrons the opportunity to see the glass-blowing process. The “Hot Shop” is where the magical process takes place. Seating for several visitors is arranged for spectators, but there were only about six visitors there the day we were at the shop.

The Hot Shop has earned the designation because it is very warm, not HOT due to the furnace and torches used in the glassblowing process. We watched glassblowers Wes Sweetser and Nick Noble as they made glass vases.

Glassblowing is a fascinating process to watch. Clear glass is melted into a liquid form in the furnace, which is heated to temperatures above 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The glassblower collects the liquid glass with a blowpipe, which is a long steel tube that allows the operator to collect the glass and then blows through the pipe to form the basic bubble.

The marver is a large steel surface that allows the glass blower to shape the glass bubble and also creates symmetry. The artists continually reheat the glass and repeat the process. Glassblowers use a variety of tools to continue shaping and fine-tuning the glass into the desired shape.

A torch is also used periodically to heat specific areas of the glass and to create details. The glass must be heated continually to so the artists can make changes and prevent the glass from hardening too quickly. The heating process allows more time for the artists to refine the process.

After the piece is completed, it must be put in an annealer, a specialized kiln that allows the piece to cool slowly and evenly. If not put in the annealer, the glass would cool unevenly and crack.

We watched the glass blowers for over an hour while two vases were created. Glassblowing can be learned in a reasonable timeframe, but it is obvious that refining and perfecting the process takes years. We found that the process was fascinating.

Wimberley Glassworks was started by Tim de Jong. De Jong opened the business in 1992. His first shop was just south of the town of Wimberley, Texas, and has been operating from the current studio on Ranch Road 12 since 2006. In addition to the shop, there is a beautiful gallery of their work for sale.

In addition, Ekiyor says connecting small business owners with their peers is key to creating a viable support network.

Another step, Ekiyor says, is to continue engaging and connecting small businesses in the area with the many high-profile sporting and cultural events that take place each year. From creating pop-up shops in the convention center to retail activations in cultural districts, Ekiyor says he wants to see small businesses play a bigger role during these events. “How do our small businesses win?”

Ultimately, Ekiyor wants to see the small business community connected around a larger goal. Now that the city has created an environment that supports the growth of small businesses, he wants to see everyone aligned around the same goal: a thriving small-business community.",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/26/TWIB.png,N,,2025-10-26 18:02:29.509225

This bilateral agreement encompasses $8.5 billion in planned investments designed to accelerate critical mineral development across multiple project phases, building upon Australia's emerging critical minerals strategy.

President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have each pledged $1 billion within six months to unlock this comprehensive pipeline of strategic mineral projects. The framework addresses immediate national security concerns while positioning both countries as leaders in energy transition security away from Chinese-dominated supply chains.

Strategic Investment Breakdown:

Investment Phase Amount Timeline Focus Area Initial Commitment $2 billion combined 6 months Project acceleration Total Pipeline $8.5 billion 2025-2030 Full development Priority Minerals Varies by project Ongoing Rare earths, lithium

The partnership extends beyond simple financial commitments to include coordinated infrastructure development, streamlined regulatory approvals, and guaranteed purchase agreements that reduce investment risks for mining companies.

Why Did Australia and the US Form This Critical Minerals Partnership?

Addressing Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

China's dominance in critical mineral processing creates significant strategic vulnerabilities for Western democracies seeking technological independence. Current Chinese control over various stages of critical mineral refining ranges from 60% to over 90% depending on the specific material, forcing allied nations to develop alternative supply networks.

The partnership directly confronts these dependencies by establishing processing capabilities outside Chinese influence. Both governments now classify critical minerals as national security assets rather than traditional commodities, fundamentally altering how these materials are managed and traded internationally.

Furthermore, the Defence-Critical Minerals Supply Chain initiative recognises the strategic importance of securing reliable access to materials essential for military applications and national defence infrastructure.

Economic and Defense Imperatives

Modern military systems depend heavily on rare earth elements for precision-guided munitions, advanced radar systems, and communications equipment. Similarly, the clean energy transition requires substantial quantities of lithium, cobalt, and other critical materials for battery storage and renewable energy infrastructure.

Critical Applications by Sector:

Defense Systems: Missile guidance, electronic warfare, satellite communications

Clean Energy: Battery storage, wind turbine magnets, solar components

Technology Manufacturing: Semiconductors, advanced electronics, 5G infrastructure

Supply disruptions in any of these areas could severely impact both military readiness and economic competitiveness in emerging technology sectors, making supply chain diversification a strategic imperative.

How Will the Deal Impact Australia's Mining Sector?

Accelerating Development Timelines

Traditional mining projects face extraordinarily long development periods that often discourage investment and delay market entry. Andrew Napier from Multicom Resources notes that projects typically require 13 to 17 years from inception to commercial operations, while copper mining projects average over 22 years globally according to University of Queensland research.

The US partnership aims to compress these timelines through guaranteed financing, streamlined approvals, and coordinated infrastructure development. Early-stage financing represents the biggest hurdle for junior mining companies, and access to government-backed funding significantly reduces investment risks.

In addition, the framework supports Australian minerals investment initiatives that could accelerate project development across multiple commodity sectors.

Regional Development in North West Queensland

North West Queensland contains approximately 75% of the state's base metal capabilities and nearly 30% of global vanadium deposits across a 380,000-square-kilometer region. Despite this mineral wealth, the area currently hosts 14 critical mineral projects with none yet achieving commercial production.

Queensland's Strategic Assets:

Mineral Type Regional Significance Project Status Commercial Timeline Vanadium 30% of world deposits 5 active projects 3+ years to export Base Metals 75% of state capability 14 total projects Development phase Rare Earths Emerging deposits Early exploration Assessment stage

The Saint Elmo vanadium project near Julia Creek exemplifies these challenges, requiring over a decade of development with three additional years before commercial export despite being closest to operational status.

Financial and Logistical Challenges

Mining executives emphasise that geographic remoteness creates substantial logistical challenges for North West Queensland projects. Transportation distances to customers and export facilities significantly impact project economics, particularly for lower-value bulk materials.

Scott Winter from Critical Minerals Group explains that initial investment support is critical for getting projects operational, particularly given the urgency of establishing supply chains before other countries fill market demand. The partnership's guaranteed offtake agreements from US customers or government stockpiling programs could provide the revenue certainty needed for project financing.

Which Australian Projects Are Prioritised Under the Agreement?

Initial Priority Selections

The framework has identified two strategically significant projects for immediate development support, though notably none are located in North West Queensland despite the region's exceptional mineral wealth.

Western Australia Focus:

Alcoa-Sojitz Joint Venture: Large-scale alumina refining with integrated rare earth extraction capabilities

Advanced Processing: Sophisticated separation and purification facilities for defence-grade materials

Northern Territory Development:

Arafura's Nolans Project: Comprehensive rare earth mining and processing operation

Strategic Positioning: Central Australian location for both domestic supply and export markets

Queensland's Future Opportunities

While North West Queensland has not received direct initial funding allocation, industry experts anticipate significant future investment given the region's mineral endowments. The area's vanadium deposits alone represent nearly one-third of global reserves, while base metal capabilities span multiple strategic materials.

Regional Project Pipeline:

Saint Elmo Vanadium Project: Closest to commercial operation, targeting steel alloy and battery storage markets

Lindfield Project: Includes proposed manufacturing capability for vanadium electrolyte production

Multiple Exploration Projects: Early-stage development across rare earth and base metal deposits

The prioritisation of Western Australia and Northern Territory projects suggests the partnership initially favours operations closer to commercial viability and existing infrastructure networks.

What Challenges Must the Partnership Overcome?

Infrastructure and Processing Gaps

Australia currently lacks commercial-scale processing capabilities for many critical minerals, requiring sophisticated separation and purification technologies. Building domestic processing capacity represents both a technical and financial challenge requiring specialised expertise and equipment investment.

Rick Valenta from the University of Queensland's Sustainable Minerals Institute identifies supply chain development as one of the biggest challenges, noting that even established industries like copper mining face extended development timelines and infrastructure requirements.

Processing Infrastructure Requirements:

Rare Earth Separation: Complex chemical processes requiring specialised facilities and skilled technicians

Quality Standards: Meeting specifications for defence and advanced technology applications

Environmental Compliance: Managing processing waste streams and environmental impact mitigation

Workforce Development: Training programmes for advanced processing operations and equipment maintenance

Geographic and Logistical Constraints

The scale of North West Queensland's mineral region, spanning nearly 400,000 square kilometers, creates substantial logistical challenges for resource extraction and transportation. Moving materials from remote mining sites to processing facilities and export terminals requires significant infrastructure investment.

Transportation costs can substantially impact project economics, particularly when competing against lower-cost producing countries with established supply chains. The partnership must address these fundamental infrastructure gaps to ensure long-term commercial viability.

Timeline and Market Pressures

Scott Winter emphasises the urgency of project development, noting that delays in establishing Australian supply chains could allow other countries to capture market share and establish competing networks. This creates pressure to accelerate traditional development timelines while maintaining safety and environmental standards.

The partnership faces the challenge of balancing rapid deployment with thorough project evaluation and risk management, particularly given the substantial financial commitments involved.

How Does This Compare to Global Critical Minerals Strategies?

Scale and Integration Differences

China's approach involves massive state-directed investment across entire supply chains, from equity stakes in global mining operations to domestic processing and manufacturing capabilities. Chinese companies have secured long-term supply agreements and vertical integration that creates comprehensive control over material flows.

The critical minerals deal between United States and Australia represents a more targeted approach focusing on specific strategic materials and key processing capabilities. Rather than attempting to replicate China's comprehensive integration, the alliance prioritises alternative supply chains for the most critical defence and technology applications.

However, Trump's Critical Minerals Order demonstrates the US commitment to establishing domestic capabilities and reducing foreign dependencies across multiple mineral categories.

Competitive Positioning

Chris Vernon from CSIRO notes that the critical minerals industry now operates in direct competition with China's established dominance across multiple materials and processing stages. This competitive dynamic requires Western alternatives to demonstrate both technical capability and economic viability.

Strategic Comparison Factors:

Chinese Advantages: Established infrastructure, integrated supply chains, cost efficiencies, global market presence

Western Strengths: Technological innovation, quality control standards, political stability, allied nation coordination

Market Dynamics: Growing demand from democratic nations seeking supply diversification and strategic independence

The partnership's success will depend on its ability to create economically competitive alternatives while maintaining higher environmental and labour standards than typical Chinese operations.

What Are the Long-Term Implications for Global Supply Chains?

Reshaping International Trade Patterns

The partnership signals a fundamental shift toward friend-shoring in critical materials, where allied nations prioritise trade relationships based on shared values and strategic interests rather than purely economic considerations. This approach may result in higher short-term costs but provides greater supply security and reduces geopolitical vulnerabilities.

According to analysis by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, ""The agreement represents a significant step toward establishing alternative supply chains that reduce reliance on potentially hostile nations while maintaining competitive market dynamics.""

Other democratic nations are likely to develop similar partnerships, creating alternative supply networks that bypass Chinese-controlled infrastructure. This could lead to a bifurcation of global critical mineral markets along geopolitical lines.

Technology and Innovation Acceleration

Guaranteed demand from US government stockpiling and defence contracts provides mining companies with revenue certainty that enables greater research and development investment. This could accelerate innovations in extraction techniques, processing efficiency, and recycling technologies.

Innovation Opportunity Areas:

Advanced Extraction: Environmentally sustainable mining techniques with reduced land disturbance

Processing Automation: Reducing labour costs while improving consistency and quality control

Recycling Technologies: Recovering critical materials from electronic waste and end-of-life products

Material Substitution: Developing alternatives for the most scarce or geopolitically sensitive materials

The partnership's emphasis on domestic processing capabilities could drive technological advancement in separation and purification processes, potentially creating exportable expertise and equipment.

Market Structure Evolution

The agreement represents a shift from purely market-based resource allocation toward strategic resource management involving government coordination and guaranteed demand. This hybrid approach combines private sector efficiency with public sector strategic planning.

Future critical mineral markets may increasingly feature long-term bilateral agreements between allied nations rather than spot market trading, fundamentally altering price discovery mechanisms and investment decision-making processes.

Addressing Implementation Challenges

Regulatory Streamlining

The partnership must balance accelerated project approvals with maintaining environmental and safety standards. Streamlined regulatory processes could significantly reduce development timelines, but require coordination between multiple government agencies and jurisdictions.

Both countries have committed to maintaining high environmental standards while reducing bureaucratic delays. Advanced monitoring technologies and risk assessment frameworks may enable faster approvals without compromising oversight quality.

Private Investment Coordination

Government commitments are designed to de-risk private investment through guaranteed offtake agreements and infrastructure support. The majority of actual mining and processing operations will require private capital, making public-private coordination essential for success.

Venture capital and institutional investors are increasingly interested in critical minerals projects given government support and long-term demand visibility. The partnership's structure could serve as a model for similar resource development initiatives in other strategic sectors.

Future Market Dynamics

Demand Growth Projections

Global critical mineral demand continues expanding rapidly driven by electric vehicle adoption, renewable energy deployment, and advanced technology manufacturing. The Australian Government's framework agreement acknowledges ""substantial increases in lithium, cobalt, and rare earth element demand over the next decade.""

The critical minerals deal between United States and Australia positions both nations to capture value from this demand growth while reducing dependence on potentially unreliable suppliers. Strategic stockpiling capabilities also provide buffer capacity during market disruptions.

Technology Evolution Impact

Advances in battery chemistry, renewable energy systems, and defence technologies continue evolving critical mineral requirements. The partnership's flexibility to adapt to changing material demands will determine its long-term strategic value.

Research and development investments supported by the framework could accelerate breakthrough technologies that reduce critical mineral requirements or enable more efficient utilisation of available resources.

Furthermore, the deal demonstrates how allied nations are responding to supply chain vulnerabilities through coordinated investment and strategic planning, setting a precedent for future resource security initiatives.

The critical minerals deal between United States and Australia represents a comprehensive response to supply chain vulnerabilities that have emerged as major national security concerns. While initial project prioritisation may not immediately benefit all mineral-rich regions, the framework establishes mechanisms for expanded investment based on strategic priorities and commercial viability.

Success will ultimately depend on the partnership's ability to compress traditional development timelines while maintaining quality and environmental standards, creating economically competitive alternatives to existing supply chains, and adapting to evolving technology requirements across defence and clean energy applications.

She believes free-market forces are increasingly backing the case for clean energy.
“You don’t have to love climate policy to love cheaper energy and American jobs.
For communities pursuing ambitious climate goals, the lesson is clear: Engage people where they are, identify shared priorities and focus on solutions that deliver economic and lifestyle benefits.","Heather Reams, the president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES), stepped onto the stage at Breckenridge’s Mountain Towns 2030 summit — a room full of progressives accustomed to negotiating with Republicans on climate policy. She faced an audience from Idaho, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado — areas that often depend on Republican-controlled legislatures to achieve local sustainability goals.

Reams suggested that the instinct of these communities shouldn’t be to lecture or shame. It should be to listen and find common ground. “Democrats can’t do it alone,” she said. “Republicans care deeply about their land. They hunt, they fish, they ski. They love the outdoors as much as anyone. So, of course, they care about clean air and water. The question is: How do we talk about it?”

A lifelong Republican, Reams has made it her mission to answer that question. CRES collaborates with GOP lawmakers to promote clean energy, arguing that the conservative case for renewables is grounded in innovation, competitiveness and energy independence — not ideology.

At the conference, she stressed that the key to climate progress isn’t confrontation, but compromise. One side might favor solar projects while the other insists on traditional fuel sources. By recognizing shared interests — for example, expanding solar energy while permitting additional natural gas pipelines or transmission lines — both sides can advance without ideological conflict. It’s not about surrender; it’s practical problem-solving.

Reams highlighted Sen. John Curtis of Utah, founder of the Conservative Climate Caucus, as a conservative champion of the environment. He has argued that the GOP should help shape, not resist, climate policy, emphasizing that sound stewardship and strong markets go hand in hand. Not all conservatives are on board. Reams wryly notes Utah’s other senator, Mike Lee, who, as she puts it, “just pats me on the head” when renewables come up.

Polls suggest that finding common ground reflects more than strategy — it meets voter demand. Pew Research Center data from 2024 show that 72% of Americans — including 56% of Republicans under 40 years old — support expanding solar and wind energy. A Yale Climate Communications poll reinforces this enthusiasm, showing that clean energy incentives can generate local jobs and economic growth.

Beyond politics, Reams emphasized the economic benefits of renewables. Solar, wind, battery storage, advanced nuclear and geothermal are increasingly cost-competitive. Emerging energy industries can create high-paying local jobs, keeping residents in their hometowns rather than forcing talent to cities. She believes free-market forces are increasingly backing the case for clean energy.

That resonates with Republican leaders, who tend to prioritize economic and local issues and often find that sustained dialogue is more effective than public confrontation. “Renewables are winning on price,” Reams said. “You don’t have to love climate policy to love cheaper energy and American jobs. We can win this on free-market principles.”

Geography and lifestyle naturally align. Western Republicans often share goals with progressives for preserving air, water and open space — and honoring the outdoorsy lifestyle. Coastal communities have similar motivations, whether it’s a clean Chesapeake Bay or a healthy Tampa Bay. For Americans who hunt, ski or hike, the outdoors can be a shared starting point — even across party lines.

For communities pursuing ambitious climate goals, the lesson is clear: Engage people where they are, identify shared priorities and focus on solutions that deliver economic and lifestyle benefits. Extreme views will always exist, but the broad middle can drive policy forward. Pragmatic collaboration, not ideological purity, is the path to progress.

By turning shared values into practical policies — whether through permitting reform or renewable energy initiatives — communities can make net-zero goals achievable. The enemy isn’t political disagreement; it’s obstinacy. When both sides operate from common interests, compromise becomes not just possible but also the most effective way forward.

A $1.6 billion loan from the federal government will modernize 5,000 miles of transmission lines and, in conjunction with stronger wires, potentially change how Midwest electricity is delivered, reduce costs, reduce outages, and advance renewable energy. But can the grid live up to the promise?

How the backbone of the Midwest electricity is strengthened by the Ambitious Power Overhaul (APO)

American Electric Transmission has received a loan guarantee of $1.6 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy to replace transmission lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, with a capacity to meet greater energy demand.

For many years, sections of the Midwest electricity grid have been defended on infrastructure constructed during the mid-20th century. Although formerly strong, these older lines are now under pressure from growing electrical demand and increasingly severe weather.

AEP’s effort to modernize supports improved reliability, keeps customers from experiencing weather-induced power interruptions, and sets the conditions for the power grid to serve today’s demand and needs into the future. This isn’t just engineering; it is a fundamental investment in the region’s economic and technological future.

Powering the future while meeting the Midwest’s surging energy demand

Due to the current rise in electricity use in the Midwest, electricity dependency on data centers and artificial intelligence has increased recently. People use data centers for many purposes, especially for professional needs. A power interruption is always a problem due to its reliance on power. The $1.6 billion investment eliminates the concern of power interruptions.

That being said, we should mention that high-tech sectors are not the only ones to benefit from this upgrade. Residents and commercial road users will enjoy the grid as well because they’ll experience power outages less often, preventing certain situations, just like this groundbreaking innovation, powering America’s grid. Overall, this upgrade is intended to provide secure electricity throughout the Midwest.

How the Midwest electricity project brings jobs, savings, and benefits to communities

A brief look at the impact this Midwest electricity project has on the community, it would bring several local economic benefits; one being: It will create approximately 1,100 construction jobs that will add income and provide further opportunities to the local communities. The modernization of the transmission lines has guaranteed an opportunity for customers to save a gross of $275 million in financial costs over the full term of the loan.

For the Midwest communities, these jobs and savings serve as tangible evidence that investments in infrastructure are a vital catalyst for growth. The project provides committed power while developing an opportunity to save costs. The $1.6 billion upgrade is a technical upgrade and economic lifeline for the Campbell County region.

Diving into a controversial choice that puts fossil fuels at the core

Although the Midwest electricity project has made massive improvements, mostly needed in this region, it is still reliant on fossil fuel electricity that must be transmitted through upgraded lines. This, of course, has sparked major controversies among several factions in the province, with critics clamouring for the need to add more clean power establishments, saying it will be more aligned with long-term sustainability goals.

On the other hand, supporters have based their allegiance on the need for a reliable, high-capacity grid. They believe that powering Midwest homes sustainably requires a transition to fossil fuels. This implies the dilemma faced before implementation can take effect.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1001411193.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 17:17:59.694797

The move is coming months after a federal court order restored $76.5 million in frozen federal funding.

The Arizona Department of Transportation submitted an updated expansion plan to federal authorities in September after completing a public input period that closed Sept. 8. The agency had finalized contracts for 18 stations in August 2024, but was forced to put the project on hold when federal funding was suspended in February.

The agency expects to launch a second solicitation this fall for 34 additional stations along state highways, said Garin Groff, an ADOT spokesman.

ADOT’s current plan, now under federal review, proposes a third phase adding approximately 21 stations on nine new corridor segments, including Arizona 77 from Tucson north to the Pima County line.

The Federal Highway Administration has not specified a timeline for completing its review. If federal approval comes through and Phase 2 solicitation proceeds this fall as planned, the full network could be operational by 2028, establishing reliable fast-charging access along Arizona’s major travel corridors for the first time.

Groff said the federal funding cancellation caused about a seven- to eight-month delay.

Arizona was among 17 states and jurisdictions that challenged the freeze in federal court, arguing the administration lacked authority to withhold funds already appropriated by Congress. U.S. District Judge Tana Lin agreed in June, ruling that the funding suspension exceeded executive authority. The court restored funding to 14 states, including Arizona.

With funding restored, ADOT is moving ahead with a three-phase buildout designed to close gaps in charging access along major interstate and state highway corridors. The network aims to address range anxiety that has limited EV adoption in Arizona, where major cities can be separated by 100 miles or more of highway.

Reliable highway charging infrastructure is critical for addressing those barriers, said Diane Brown, executive director of the Arizona Public Interest Research Group Education Fund. The nonprofit advocates for consumer protection issues.

“Implementation of ADOT’s plan will ensure EV charging is available on interstates and alternative fuel corridors,” Brown said. “The plan calls for EV charging to be available on highways every 50 miles, which enables EV drivers to know they won’t get stranded.”

The first phase covers 18 interstate locations to be constructed by Tesla, Francis Energy, Love’s Travel Stops, Pilot, Red E Charge and EV Gateway. Construction on those stations is expected to begin this year, with the locations operational by 2026, according to ADOT.

For Tucson drivers, the nearest new station will be Tesla’s seven-port facility at Rudy’s Country Store and Bar-B-Q, 2130 E. Ajo Way, off Interstate 10.

The charging network will serve drivers across Arizona’s diverse regions. Phase 1 stations are planned along Interstate 10, stretching from the California border near Yuma through Phoenix and Tucson to New Mexico, as well as along Interstate 8 connecting Yuma to Casa Grande.

Northern Arizona will see coverage along Interstate 40, spanning from Kingman through Flagstaff to Holbrook; and Interstate 17 connecting Phoenix to the Verde Valley and Flagstaff.

The year’s proposed plan adds Arizona 77 from Show Low to Holbrook in eastern Arizona, according to ADOT planning maps.

Under federal program requirements, stations will be privately owned and operated, with developers contributing 20% of project costs and handling long-term maintenance. Each location must offer at least four high-speed chargers capable of 150-kilowatt charging, available around the clock.

ADOT will oversee the stations for five years after opening, monitoring performance through data collection and reporting. After that period, private developers assume full responsibility for operations, which include technical support, electrical and IT services, routine maintenance, software updates and cybersecurity.

Utilities like Tucson Electric Power and Arizona Public Service determine whether electrical capacity exists to support charging infrastructure at specific locations, Groff said. While ADOT does not track job creation for the privately built stations, developers will need construction, installation, technical, electrical and IT workers throughout the buildout and ongoing operations.

The charging network’s expansion comes amid shifting federal policy. Federal tax credits for new and used electric vehicles expired Sept. 30, but Brown said projections for EV adoption in Arizona remain strong as vehicle prices drop and charging infrastructure expands.

Beyond infrastructure, continued EV adoption will require emphasizing the financial and health benefits of electric vehicles, Brown added.

“The facts on consumer savings when driving an EV versus an internal combustion engine along with the air quality in public health benefits, will need to be front and center,” she said, adding that these factors will help drive adoption, “at a rate that will help our economy as well as our air quality and public health.”

“Arizona is known for a cradle-to-grave EV sector,” Brown said, noting the charging stations complement clean energy work already underway in local governments across the state.""

Opposition leader Sussan Ley wrote to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday to raise ""serious concerns"" about elements of Labor's rewrite of Australia's environmental laws.

She suggested that the bill be carved into two so the first part, focused exclusively on ""practical measures to streamline approvals"", could sail through parliament when it is introduced this week.

Under her proposal, the more contentious environmental changes would be dealt with later.

""While the streamlining reforms still require detailed amendment to ensure they function effectively, separating them from the broader, more contentious environmental elements of the legislation would allow parliament to make immediate progress on areas that can genuinely help unlock investment and growth,"" the letter read.

Environment Minister Murray Watt rejected the proposition, declaring that splitting the bill in this way ""would weaken environmental protections and it would remove the certainty that business is looking for"".

""It would mean more habitat destruction, more species threatened, no independent regulator and slower approval times,"" he said.

There had initially been optimism in talks between the government and Coalition that an agreement to finally reform the laws could be reached, but that soured after details of the bill emerged last week.

Labor open to working with Coalition or Greens

Mr Watt is open to dealing with either the Coalition or the Greens to successfully rework the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act), almost five years after a review found the laws were not fit for purpose.

The government has said the changes will deliver stronger environmental protection but also quicker approvals for all kinds of projects, including housing and mines.

The legislation will also include the establishment of a National Environmental Protection Agency, with the environment minister retaining the final say on approving or rejecting major projects.

Until now, the minister personally considers only a small number of significant applications — such as Woodside's North West Shelf extension — with departmental officials signing off on more than 90 per cent of decisions.

The new regime will operate in a similar fashion; however, officials in the new agency will deal with the bulk of approvals instead of the department.

On Sunday, Mr Watt urged both parties to come to the negotiating table as he vowed that this iteration of the laws would finally pass parliament after two earlier attempts failed.

Parts of the draft laws have been shared with environmental and business groups, but both the Coalition and the Greens are yet to see the bill in full.

Last week, the minister confirmed that a so-called ""climate trigger"" that could be used to block coal and gas projects — which had been one of the Greens' key demands — would not feature in the proposed legislation.

But on Sunday, Greens environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young indicated that the absence of a trigger was not a red line for the minor party, telling reporters that she was open to negotiations.

""I will work and talk with the government about how to make sure climate is protected,"" she said.

""If we're going to negotiate, the government is going to have to come up with what they are prepared to do to protect the climate and to protect our forest.""

If the Coalition rejects the legislation, it could become a key test of how the Greens will act in this term of parliament, after Labor accused the minor party of acting as blockers in the Senate.

Mr Watt said there does not have to be a choice between productivity and the environment.

""We can improve both, and that is what our bill is designed to do,"" he said.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/66b14998d84a9c1e89ccb1ba6824d250?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=4954&cropW=8808&xPos=0&yPos=459&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-10-26 15:58:13.765270

Solid-state batteries, made of a cathode, an anode, and a solid electrolyte, have been promoted as offering higher output, longer driving range, quicker charging times, and extended battery life.
Solid-state batteries are also touted as being smaller and therefore lighter than liquid-based batteries, with a greatly reduced risk of EV fires, which is a hard battle firefighters face.
Idemitsu is building a factory capable of producing 1,000 metric tons of lithium sulfide, an essential solid-state battery component, each year.

What else should you know about Toyota's solid-state batteries for EVs?

This joint effort by Toyota and Sumitomo is more than just a technology development. It is an attempt by Japanese manufacturers to get back some of the EV momentum that has been lost to China. China is now the world's leading manufacturer of electric vehicles and has announced its plans to produce semi-solid-state batteries, which use less liquid electrolyte but are not pure solid-state batteries. South Korea has also built up a lead over Japan in the race to produce EVs that are accepted by the world market.

Toyota and the other Japanese manufacturers now realize that the home country must build a supply chain that can provide solid-state batteries for the next generation of EVs, whether they will be produced in Japan or in other Japanese-owned factories around the world. The total amount of Japanese investment in this domestic supply chain, by Toyota and other companies, is $7 billion.

Toyota has also announced an alliance with Idemitsu, a large Japanese oil company. Idemitsu is building a factory capable of producing 1,000 metric tons of lithium sulfide, an essential solid-state battery component, each year. Interestingly, the Idemitsu lithium sulfide plant also plans to manufacture solid-state batteries in 2027. While these developments are promising by themselves, there are still many obstacles to be overcome as manufacturers rush to embrace solid-state batteries for their EVs, including the complexities of making them, expensive production costs, and where the solid-state battery materials will come from.

In its latest report, SolarPower Europe’s Global Markets Workstream provided an extensive overview of solar investment opportunities in five priority countries in Latin America, namely Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.

The report explores several substantial investment prospects in Latin America through a comprehensive analysis of the countries’ market dynamics and regulatory frameworks, while also providing recommendations to accelerate solar deployment in the Latin American countries.

“With established markets and a robust pipeline, Latin America stands out in the global solar landscape. Our report equips investors with the intelligence, trends, and data to navigate one of the world’s most promising renewable energy regions.” – Máté Heisz, Chief Operating Officer at SolarPower Europe

The Latin American energy sector’s transition to renewable energy is close to reaching its goal

As the world aims to decarbonize the energy sector, solar power has emerged as the most pragmatic solution to the global energy needs. Latin America is committed to its renewable energy capacity expansion.

The region aims to have at least 70% of its electricity generated from renewable energy by the end of the decade, which would align perfectly with the 2019 Renewable Energy for Latin America and the Caribbean (RELAC) Initiative. As the solar sector gains momentum around the world as the go-to renewable energy resource, Latin American nations are aiming not to be left behind.

“Investment is the key to transforming Latin America’s solar promise into progress. By unlocking capital through blended finance, risk-mitigation tools, and clearer market structures, we can scale solar where it’s needed most. A better and prosperous future for countries across Latin America is not just possible with solar – it’s powered by it.” – Sonia Dunlop, CEO of the Global Solar Council

The solar power sector has seen substantial and consistent growth over the past few years, and SolarPower Europe’s leadership could not be happier.

“Latin America’s strong solar resources can be an engine for regional growth. This report focuses on several major solar markets in the region, providing clear guidelines to investors alongside concrete recommendations for policymakers looking to tap into Latin America’s potential.” – Katherine Poseidon, Head of Strategy, Analytics & Process, Europe, Africa & International, Voltalia, and Chair of SolarPower Europe’s Global Markets Workstream

Hassan Dawudi on the Tesla Model Y Owners Facebook page says,

""I just sold my 2026 model Y to a dealer in Houston for what I paid for it in July (tax liability credit made it possible). If this car isn't for you, you may consider this. No trade or anything. I wrote them a check, and they wrote me a check for the same amount 3 months later.""

""Tesla makes other cars feel dumb, but I needed a more utilitarian/rugged vehicle. It didn't have the utility I needed. I’m keeping my Toyota 4Runner for when it matters; it's more my style.""

High-Tech vs. High-Utility: Why One Owner Sold His Tesla Model Y Preferring His 4Runner and Walked Away Clean

The appeal of a Tesla is undeniable. Their vehicles offer blistering performance, industry-leading charging infrastructure, and a connected user experience that leaves rival brands feeling decades behind. Yet a recent social media post from a Model Y owner reveals a critical difference between a groundbreaking electric crossover and everyday utility needs.

I'll break down this owner's experience: Tesla's unique market position and the persistent need for traditional, rugged capability.

Zero-Sum Depreciation

The first part of Hassan Dawudi's story is exceptional and offers a savvy financial decision. He reported selling his ""2026 Model Y"" for exactly what he paid just three months prior, attributing the feasibility to the federal tax liability credit.

The Model Y is not magically depreciation-proof.

This zero-sum loss is a direct result of understanding the impact of federal tax credits on short-term vehicle valuations. If a buyer is eligible for a $7,500 point-of-sale credit (as many new EV buyers are) and they transfer that credit to the dealer, their effective purchase price is immediately reduced.

If demand for the car remains strong—especially ahead of anticipated incentive changes—the owner can trade it in at the full sticker price, thereby using the credit to fully offset the immediate depreciation hit. It shows that it's possible to time your sale with eligibility changes, and it can be highly lucrative.

When 'Dumb' is Smart

The second part of Hassan's quote is far more critical for the average buyer. While he acknowledged that ""Tesla makes other cars feel dumb,"" he concluded: ""I needed a more utilitarian/rugged vehicle. It didn't have the utility I needed. I drove my 4Runner when it mattered; it's more my style.""

This highlights the difference between crossover SUVs and true rugged utility vehicles. The Model Y is a crossover built on a unibody chassis—designed for on-road handling, efficiency, and speed. The Toyota 4Runner is body-on-frame; it's heavy and gas-thirsty, but it offers qualities like ground clearance, suspension travel, and a four-wheel-drive system designed for off-road performance.

Hassan quickly learned why the Tesla Model Y doesn't satisfy actual off-road and towing requirements.

The Model Y's battery sits low in the chassis, optimizing handling but sacrificing ground clearance. Its smooth, aerodynamic lines and sophisticated electronics are useless when navigating a muddy access road or hauling a heavy trailer off-pavement. When the job requires getting dirty, the body-on-frame architecture of the 4Runner is superior in every measure of ruggedness.

Recommendations for Utility Seekers

If you're reading this and your primary use case involves heavy towing, frequent off-road use, or encountering severe weather, the Model Y and most current electric crossovers are not the right tools for the job.

Key Takeaways:

If You Must Go EV: Look at vehicles specifically built with utility in mind. I'm talking about the dedicated future electric truck alternatives for rugged utility seekers like the Rivian R1T or the Tesla Cybertruck. These are built on different, more robust platforms designed to handle payload and punishment, not just 0-60mph times.

The Hybrid Bridge: If you need that daily ruggedness now and cannot accept the current price or wait for a true EV utility vehicle, stick to proven hybrids like the Toyota Tundra Hybrid or the new Tacoma Hybrid, which offer excellent torque and maintain that necessary body-on-frame strength.

Know the Mission: The Model Y excels at efficiency, tech integration, and being a superb commuter. But when you need capability, you need capability. Don't confuse advanced technology with utility.

What the Community is Saying

The sentiment is clear that the Model Y is an incredible piece of technology, but it's not a replacement for specialized tools. However, Hassan took some hard hits.

Steve Clabaugh - Nice! Now you get to join the world of waiting at Jiffy Lube, gas stations, and dealerships for vehicle maintenance.

Mike Miller - Why would you spend $50k on the wrong car or assume a Tesla would be rugged or for anything other than pavement?

GrayShark Dave - Why? You want an outdated, slow, non-intelligent ICE car? Why not a horse and buggy? At least the horse thinks.

The Market Perspective

As I've reported before, the Model Y is a revolution in personal transportation, as seen in stories like the owner who traded a Scat Pack for a Model Y and was ""in awe"" of the performance (""Tesla Model Y Owner Says, 'It Feels Good to Finally Get My First EV...'""). However, the market is maturing, and consumers are beginning to consider specialized needs.

We are seeing a clear delineation in the EV landscape, a trend I cover constantly in my reporting. While cars like the Model Y are fantastic for improving daily life, as one owner noted after adding ceramic tint—""I Put On A Full Ceramic Tint On My Tesla Model Y...""), they are useful for cargo capacity and efficiency, not rugged durability.

The takeaway? The resale success Hassan achieved was an anomaly dependent on tax timing. However, you should buy the vehicle that matches your needs, not the latest technology hits.

A Question For You

Hassan Dawudi ultimately decided the Tesla Model Y didn't have the utility he needed, preferring his 4Runner for rugged use. For Model Y owners, how have you managed the vehicle's utility and off-road/towing limitations, or has it ever led you to consider a different vehicle for specific needs?

Officials from the state transport department said the rates will vary based on the vehicle type -- Rs 80 for small passenger vehicles, Rs 250 for small goods carriers, Rs 140 for buses, and Rs 120-Rs700 for trucks, depending on load capacity. The initiative aims to curb vehicular pollution, protect the fragile Himalayan ecosystem and promote cleanliness across the state. State additional transport commissioner Sanat Kumar Singh told mediapersons on Saturday that the system will rely on Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras installed at border checkpoints to record registration numbers of incoming vehicles. Sixteen ANPR cameras have been installed so far at the state's entry points, and the number is being increased to 37. To streamline the process, the transport department has engaged a private vendor to manage tax collection. Data captured by the cameras will be automatically sent to the vendor's software, which will filter out vehicles registered in Uttarakhand, govt vehicles, electric and CNG vehicles, ambulances, fire brigade trucks and two-wheelers. The filtered information will then be transmitted to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) database. Once verified, the applicable amount will be deducted automatically from the vehicle owner's payment wallet and credited to the transport department's account. Vehicles re-entering the state within 24 hours will not be charged again. Officials said the move is part of govt's broader strategy to encourage environmentally responsible travel in Uttarakhand, where increasing tourist and commercial traffic has worsened pollution in recent years. The green tax is also expected to create a dedicated revenue stream for environmental protection and sustainable transport infrastructure in the hill state.

It's using that money to pay for its lucrative distribution and expand its operations.

The MLP is pursuing several additional expansion projects to further enhance its growth prospects.

10 stocks we like better than Energy Transfer ›

Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) is one of the largest energy midstream companies in the country. It has a nearly nationwide footprint of 144,000 miles of pipelines, extensive storage and export terminal capacity, and other energy infrastructure assets that support the flow of oil, natural gas, and other energy products from wells to end users.

Building on its established presence, the Dallas, Texas-based company is investing heavily to expand its footprint and deliver healthy earnings growth. That could give it the fuel to produce high-octane total returns for energy investors in the coming years.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

Built on a strong foundation

Energy Transfer's extensive midstream operations generate stable cash flow. Fee-based revenue frameworks, such as long-term, fixed-rate contracts and government-regulated rate structures, provide about 90% of its earnings.

During the first half of 2025, the master limited partnership (MLP) produced nearly $4.3 billion in distributable cash flow. It distributed almost $2.3 billion to investors and retained the rest. That comfortable payout ratio puts the MLP's 7.8%-yielding distribution on a very solid foundation.

Energy Transfer also has a strong balance sheet. Its leverage ratio is currently in the lower half of its 4.0-4.5 times target range. That puts it in the strongest financial position in its history, further supporting its high-yielding payout.

Texas-sized growth through the end of the decade

Energy Transfer's stable cash flow and bond-like income stream are only part of its story. The midstream giant has a lot of growth on the horizon. It's investing $5 billion into growth capital projects this year, which will fuel accelerating earnings growth as they come online over the next year. Most of those projects will expand its extensive infrastructure in its home state.

For example, one notable expansion project is the Hugh Brinson Pipeline. The 400-mile gas pipeline will extend from Waha in the western part of the state to Maypearl, Texas, just south of Dallas. Phase I of the $2.7 billion project should come online at the end of 2026, followed by Phase II in early 2027.

Energy Transfer is also expanding its natural gas liquids (NGL) capacity at its terminal in Nederland, TX, building another NGL fractionator in Mont Belvieu, TX, constructing two more gas processing plants in the Permian Basin, and building out eight gas-fired power plants to support its operations in Texas. Those projects should enter commercial service through 2026.

Meanwhile, the company's largest project is the recently approved Desert Southwest Pipeline project. The $5.3 billion, 516-mile pipeline will move gas from Waha to Phoenix, Arizona, when it comes online at the end of 2029. This project gives Energy Transfer visible earnings growth through the end of the decade.

More growth coming down the pipeline

The midstream giant is pursuing several additional expansion projects. The biggest is the long-delayed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in Lake Charles, Louisiana. The company has been working to secure the customers needed to support the project and partners to help fund its construction. The MLP is hoping to finally make a positive final investment decision (FID) on Lake Charles LNG early next year.

Meanwhile, the company is pursuing several projects to supply natural gas to AI data centers. Earlier this year, it signed a deal to provide gas to CloudBurst's Next-Gen Data Center campus near San Marcos, TX, which could be operational next year, assuming CloudBurst makes an FID this year. The company recently signed a deal to supply Fermi America with gas for its HyperGrid project in Amarillo, TX. At 18 million square feet spread across 5,200 acres, HyperGrid is one of the largest planned data centers in the country. Those are just two of the roughly 200 data centers it could supply gas to in the future. The company is also pursuing opportunities to supply gas to more than 60 power plants, many of which are also aiming to support the AI data center power boom.

Securing these and other potential projects would give Energy Transfer more fuel to grow its earnings and distribution in the future. The MLP conservatively plans to increase its payout by 3% to 5% annually over the coming years, allowing it to grow its distribution to investors while retaining more cash to fund its robust expansion opportunity set.

High-octane total return potential

Energy Transfer generates stable and steadily rising cash flows to support its high-yielding distribution. That payout provides a nice base return, which should steadily increase in the future. Additionally, the MLP's large and growing backlog of expansion projects should fuel meaningful earnings growth in the coming years, significantly boosting its total return potential. That high return potential makes Energy Transfer a strong buy for energy investors who are comfortable receiving the Schedule K-1 Federal Tax Form the MLP sends each year.

The $5.3 billion, 516-mile pipeline will move gas from Waha to Phoenix, Arizona, when it comes online at the end of 2029. This project gives Energy Transfer visible earnings growth through the end of the decade.

More growth coming down the pipeline

The midstream giant is pursuing several additional expansion projects. The biggest is the long-delayed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in Lake Charles, Louisiana. The company has been working to secure the customers needed to support the project and partners to help fund its construction. The MLP is hoping to finally make a positive final investment decision (FID) on Lake Charles LNG early next year.

Meanwhile, the company is pursuing several projects to supply natural gas to AI data centers. Earlier this year, it signed a deal to provide gas to CloudBurst's Next-Gen Data Center campus near San Marcos, TX, which could be operational next year, assuming CloudBurst makes an FID this year. The company recently signed a deal to supply Fermi America with gas for its HyperGrid project in Amarillo, TX. At 18 million square feet spread across 5,200 acres, HyperGrid is one of the largest planned data centers in the country. Those are just two of the roughly 200 data centers it could supply gas to in the future. The company is also pursuing opportunities to supply gas to more than 60 power plants, many of which are also aiming to support the AI data center power boom.

Securing these and other potential projects would give Energy Transfer more fuel to grow its earnings and distribution in the future. The MLP conservatively plans to increase its payout by 3% to 5% annually over the coming years, allowing it to grow its distribution to investors while retaining more cash to fund its robust expansion opportunity set.

High-octane total return potential

Energy Transfer generates stable and steadily rising cash flows to support its high-yielding distribution. That payout provides a nice base return, which should steadily increase in the future. Additionally, the MLP's large and growing backlog of expansion projects should fuel meaningful earnings growth in the coming years, significantly boosting its total return potential. That high return potential makes Energy Transfer a strong buy for energy investors who are comfortable receiving the Schedule K-1 Federal Tax Form the MLP sends each year.

More recently, in May 2025, China also reached a major milestone, with over one million electric cars sold in a single month, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).

While China unsurprisingly dominates the global market in terms of sales volume, some European countries still lead the way in terms of adoption (looking at the share of BEVs in new car sales).

As Statista's Tristan Gaudiaut details below, for several years now, Norway has been a notable exception at the top of the list: in the first half of 2025, according to data compiled by PwC, more than 90 percent of newly registered passenger cars in that country were electric, a record.

Reflecting the rapid adoption of electric mobility in Northern Europe, Denmark and the Netherlands also have some of the highest market shares: 63.6 percent and 35.0 percent, respectively (between one and two out of every three new vehicles sold). Outside Europe, China leads the way in terms of adoption, with a BEV share of 29.8 percent in the first half of the year (including commercial vehicles). In comparison, the United States lags with a BEV share of just 7.3 percent.

While Norway’s policy measures (such as tax exemptions, toll exemptions, and other incentives) did prove highly effective in promoting electric cars, the Norwegian model cannot be easily transferred to other countries.

First and foremost, this country imposes hefty vehicle import duties and car registration taxes, making cars significantly more expensive than, say, in the United States. By waiving these duties for electric vehicles, Norway is effectively subsidizing EV purchases at a level that a larger country such as the U.S. couldn’t afford.

Secondly, Norway is a very wealthy country (ironically, thanks to its oil reserves) with a high level of income.

According to Norway's national statistical institute, the country’s median household income after taxes was around $64,000 in 2025, which is roughly level with the United States but significantly higher than the EU average.

Not only can its revolutionary process help cut energy production costs, but it can also help reduce planet-heating carbon emissions.

In a press release, Factor2 Energy announced that it has secured over $9 million in seed funding to continue developing its geothermal power generation system that uses carbon dioxide. Based in Germany, the company is aiming to build a ""pilot power plant to demonstrate scalability.""

According to Factor2 Energy, its technology can unlock geothermal power at shallower depths and lower temperatures than conventional methods, making more sites viable for energy harvesting.

The company's method utilizes CO2 as the ""primary working fluid in the geothermal cycle, replacing water or brine,"" making the process more economically feasible. By using CO2, Factor2 Energy asserts that it can eliminate the need for subsurface pumps, reducing energy consumption.

The method also has the potential to eventually turn carbon capture and storage sites into energy-generating power plants. As noted by Kendra Rauschenberger, general partner at Siemens Energy Ventures, the $9.1 million in funding can further enhance the development of a more planet-friendly energy production source.

""I am pleased to see this technology progressing toward commercialization, following its development within Siemens Energy Ventures,"" Rauschenberger said in a statement. ""Geothermal energy is a reliable and renewable power source, and we will work with Factor2 Energy to tailor our turbines to meet the specific needs of this emerging market.""

Geothermal energy is capable of becoming a relatively stable renewable energy source with minimal environmental impact and lower carbon emissions than traditional power plants. Geothermal energy can also lead to cheaper energy in the long run, thanks to its low operating costs and efficient energy production process.

""Our approach enables emission-free, efficient, and baseload-capable electricity production, which is ideal for traditional oil and gas companies looking to diversify their operating assets,"" said Factor2 Energy CEO and co-founder Felix Boehmer. ""And in fact, the entire system leverages proven technologies from the oil and gas sector, with its long history of drilling and geologic expertise.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Factor2-Energyimage-recvzI6ddC5Sc0DfL-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 13:59:12.554852

Built on a strong foundation

Energy Transfer's extensive midstream operations generate stable cash flow. Fee-based revenue frameworks, such as long-term, fixed-rate contracts and government-regulated rate structures, provide about 90% of its earnings.

During the first half of 2025, the master limited partnership (MLP) produced nearly $4.3 billion in distributable cash flow. It distributed almost $2.3 billion to investors and retained the rest. That comfortable payout ratio puts the MLP's 7.8%-yielding distribution on a very solid foundation.

Texas-sized growth through the end of the decade

Energy Transfer's stable cash flow and bond-like income stream are only part of its story. The midstream giant has a lot of growth on the horizon. It's investing $5 billion into growth capital projects this year, which will fuel accelerating earnings growth as they come online over the next year. Most of those projects will expand its extensive infrastructure in its home state.

For example, one notable expansion project is the Hugh Brinson Pipeline. The 400-mile gas pipeline will extend from Waha in the western part of the state to Maypearl, Texas, just south of Dallas. Phase I of the $2.7 billion project should come online at the end of 2026, followed by Phase II in early 2027.

Energy Transfer is also expanding its natural gas liquids (NGL) capacity at its terminal in Nederland, TX, building another NGL fractionator in Mont Belvieu, TX, constructing two more gas processing plants in the Permian Basin, and building out eight gas-fired power plants to support its operations in Texas. Those projects should enter commercial service through 2026.

As more EVs have entered the market and some at better prices, Tesla’s Model Y has been put up against some very attractive options.

This is especially prudent in Europe and China, where domestic car companies have been offering attractive and cheap EVs as Tesla alternatives.

However, in September, the Model Y was able to battle back and take over the top sales spot for EVs in Europe.

In September, it had 25,938 sales, and although it was an 8.6 percent decrease compared to the same month in 2024, it was enough to be labeled the best-selling car in the European market, Automotive News reported.

500-mile test proves why Tesla Model Y still humiliates rivals in Europe

There are four vehicles that have been atop the European EV sales rankings for any given month this year: the Renault Clio, which has three titles, the Dacia Sandero, which has won four monthly sales titles, and the Volkswagen T-Roc, which was the best-selling car in the market in August.

The Clio captured the number-two spot in September with 20,146 sales.

Despite a strong September showing for the Model Y, which was its first monthly sales crown of the year, the vehicle has not been a top-three EV in Europe this year. That is still led by the Sandero, Clio, and T-Roc.

Despite that, Tesla’s Model Y is still likely to be one of the best-selling vehicles in the world, if not the best, for the year.

In the United States, it has dominated EV sales charts and has been one of the most popular cars in the region. The same goes for China, where the Model Y has more competition than in Europe, but is so attractive because of its premium look and feel, as well as its tech offerings.

The Model Y has been the best-selling car globally for the past two years, outpacing widely popular gas and EV models from around the world.

Tesla also just finished up its best three-month sales period in its history, delivering just shy of half a million vehicles from July to September.

SpaceX has reached an incredible milestone with its Starlink program, officially surpassing 10,000 satellites launched into low Earth orbit since starting the program back in 2019.

Last Sunday, October 19, SpaceX launched its 131st and 132nd Falcon 9 missions of 2025, one from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the other from Vandenberg, California.

The 10,000th Starlink satellite was aboard the launch from California, which was Starlink 11-19, and held 28 v2 mini optimized satellites.

The achievement was marked by a satellite tracker developed by Jonathan McDowell.

The first Starlink launch was all the way back on May 23, 2019, as SpaceX launched its first 60 satellites from Cape Canaveral using a Falcon 9 rocket.

Of the over 10,000 satellites in orbit, the tracker says 8,608 are operational, as some are intentionally de-orbited after becoming faulty and destroyed in the atmosphere.

SpaceX has truly done some really incredible things during its development of the Starlink program, including launch coverage in a global setting, bringing along millions of active subscribers that use the service for personal and business use, locking up commercial partnerships, and more.

Starlink currently operates in around 150 countries, territories, and markets and is available at least somewhere on all seven continents.

Additionally, Starlink has over 5 million subscribers worldwide, and 2.7 million have joined the program over the past year. It has revolutionized internet access on commercial aircraft as well, as several high-profile airlines like Qatar and United, among many others, have already installed Starlink on some of their planes to deliver more stable connectivity for passengers and crew.

SpaceX has the approval to launch 12,000 Starlink satellites from the FAA, but it plans to bring over 30,000 to its constellation, giving anyone the ability to have access to high-speed internet.

Tesla Full Self-Driving (Supervised) v14 has been out for several weeks now, and there are a tremendous number of improvements, as we have now reached the fourth iteration of the semi-autonomous software.

Tesla began the v14.1.4 launch last night, which included minor improvements and addressed brake-stabbing issues many owners have reported. In my personal experience, the stabbing has been awful on v14.1.3, and is a major concern.

However, many things have improved, and only a couple of minor issues have been recurring. Many of the issues v13 addressed are no longer an issue, so Tesla has made significant progress.

Here are some of the most notable improvements Tesla made with v14 from v13:

Better Lane Switching on Highways

One of my biggest complaints with v13 was that the “Hurry” Speed Profile would often stay in the left lane, even when there were no passing cars. The legality of cruising in the left lane fluctuates by jurisdiction, but my personal preference is to drive in the right lane and pass on the left.

Advertisement

That said, Tesla has improved FSD’s performance with more courteous lane behavior. It no longer camps in the left lane and routinely gets back in the right lane after passing slower cars.

More Awareness for Merging Traffic and Makes Courteous Moves

There have been times when FSD has been more aware of merging traffic, and even cross traffic, than most human beings.

Here are a few examples –

Full Self-Driving lets a car out of cross traffic during a busy time of day. This road tends to get very congested, especially during rush hour, so the car that was let in by FSD would have been sitting there for likely a minute longer if my Tesla had not let him in:

Advertisement

A busy, four-lane expressway with a quick exit on the far side of the highway for this merging vehicle. I’ve seen some drivers be extremely inattentive and travel at the same speed as merging cars, making their entry onto the expressway less seamless. FSD doesn’t do that; it makes way for merging cars:

More Confident Driving Around Mail Trucks…and Amish

I encounter a lot of Amish in my area of Pennsylvania, and they commonly use both shoulders and the road, so traffic can get congested at times.

In the past, I’ve taken over when encountering Amish buggies, mail trucks, or other vehicles that are moving slowly or making frequent stops. I have felt it is more logical to just take over in these situations.

I decided not to yesterday on a long drive through Lancaster, PA, and the FSD did a wonderful job of confidently overtaking these vehicles:

Advertisement

This was really impressive and fun to see. There was a slight stutter during one of the three instances, but overall, I didn’t have any concerns.

Object Avoidance

On v13, I almost let the car drive into a fallen branch in the middle of the road. A mile later, the car swerved out of the way for horse droppings. It was a beautiful, clear morning, and the fact that the car did not try to avoid the branch, but did steer away from poop, was concerning.

Advertisement

Tesla has obviously done a great job at refining FSD’s ability to navigate around these road hazards. Last night, it swerved around a dead animal carcass in the middle of the highway. I didn’t see it until we were already going around it:

It was awesome to see this and never feel alarmed by the sharp movement. The maneuver was smooth and really well done.

Better Speed Consistency

With v13, I felt I had to constantly adjust the Speed Profile, as well as the Max Speed setting, when using FSD. With V14, I don’t feel like I am making as many adjustments.

Tesla axed the Max Speed setting altogether with v14, which was a good move, in my opinion. Choosing the Speed Profile is now more intuitive by using the right scroll wheel. If the car is traveling too fast or too slow, just change the profile.

Three things Tesla needs to improve with Full Self-Driving v14 release

V13 had some issues with local roads, and I felt it would travel at strange speeds. In a 45 MPH zone, it would sometimes take a long time to reach 40 MPH, then hover between 43 MPH and 47 MPH. It would then fluctuate between those two speeds, frustrating drivers behind me, understandably.

V14 gets up to speed much better and travels at speeds I’m much more comfortable with on both local roads and highways.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-tesla-model-y-winter-logo-1000x600.jpeg,N,,2025-10-26 13:59:31.772955

Supporters say the development could bring jobs and much-needed tax revenue to the rural area. Concerns about water usage, environmental impact and potential tax increases have dominated local conversations.

“We’re lacking water all over this country,” a Young County resident said. “The environmental impact this will have on southwest Young County is just going to be devastating.”

On October 9, a “concerned citizens” meeting turned tense as residents questioned those involved with the project. Locals like John Paclik voiced fears about long-term damage to the area’s natural resources.

“The land here is mainly rangeland, productive for livestock and wildlife,” Paclik said. “What’s going to happen when they take all the trees off and remove all the grass?”

Ryan Mote, who hosted another community gathering on his family’s property overlooking the proposed site, said the public deserves transparency and open discussion.

“I’m a big fan of free speech — either side is welcome to come and see the property,” Mote said. “Officials talk about jobs and the economics of the deal, but the commitments we’ve seen from past projects haven’t matched what was promised. So we’re skeptical.”

Young County Judge Win Graham acknowledged both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the data center proposal. He said county officials are continuing to review the project before making a final decision.

A petition opposing the data center has already gathered more than 900 signatures in just one week, reflecting the intensity of local opposition.

Supporters of the project argue that the data center could boost the county’s long-term economic prospects by expanding infrastructure and increasing tax revenue. Opponents, however, remain unconvinced.

For now, the future of the data center — and the direction of Young County’s development — remains undecided.

Minister for the Ecological Transition Monique Barbut stated that France’s energy model must be based on a combination of civil nuclear power and renewable energy sources, rejecting accusations of hostility towards nuclear. Speaking during a hearing at the National Assembly, she explained that energy supply security cannot be guaranteed by relying on a single technology.

“I believe that our energy system needs both legs to walk: renewables and nuclear,” she declared before the Sustainable Development Committee. She was responding to criticism from deputy Sébastien Humbert of the Rassemblement National, who cited her former leadership at WWF France to accuse her of anti-nuclear positions.

An expanded approach to energy production

Monique Barbut defended the idea of a diversified system, citing wind, solar, hydropower and geothermal energy as essential components of the energy mix. “It is impossible to rely on a single energy source if we want to maintain our energy sovereignty,” she said, calling for all options to be developed.

Appointed on October 13 as Minister for the Ecological Transition, Biodiversity and International Climate and Nature Negotiations, she holds her first government position after a career in the French and international civil service. At 69, she identifies as a member of civil society motivated by conviction.

Budgetary pressures and political trade-offs

The 2026 draft finance bill, criticised by several left-wing deputies for what they see as insufficient funding, was also discussed. The minister acknowledged that the proposed budget had not been drawn up by her team, but described it as a “black-and-white dream” in light of the current economic climate. She called on MPs to turn it “into colour”.

She also emphasised the structural role of the State in the energy transition, stating that the government is not a direct funder but a regulator responsible for setting the rules that guide private and public investment towards appropriate energy pathways.

Government positioning and political message

Monique Barbut recalled that her participation in the government is rooted in a desire to act for a “concrete and accessible” environmental policy, without opposing ecological goals to social priorities. She cited extreme weather events and accelerating glacier melt as urgent signals, while refraining from using these observations as activist rhetoric.

“There is a path to a practical, everyday ecology that is accessible to the French,” she affirmed, reiterating her commitment to aligning energy efficiency, social equity and industrial coherence.

The Trump administration has said this year that it is investigating whether offshore wind farms pose a national security threat.
At least half a dozen Cabinet members, including Burgum, are probing the impacts of offshore wind on their departments.
Despite efforts to stop the wind projects in New York and Rhode Island, both are going forward.","When Donald Trump warned that wind farms were 'eagle graveyards' he was mocked by liberals, but now a cabinet secretary is warning that as well as harming wildlife, they threaten America's troops.

In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum warned that the towers — which dwarf the Statue of Liberty — can interfere with critical military radars.

Burgum said the Department of Defense is investigating the potential threat, while the FAA fears they could disrupt systems at commercial airports along the East Coast, particularly in the densely populated northeast.

The man in charge of America's 2.5 billion acres of offshore land also chided Democrats for turning a blind eye to the ecological concerns posed by renewable energy sources while sprinting away from fossil fuels.

'The Biden administration bypassed serious biological opinions that were putting out warnings about these offshore wind towers,' Burgum shared.

'Offshore wind is some of the highest cost electricity we can produce. Now it's becoming quite clear that there's enormous damage to marine fisheries, to marine mammals like whales.'

The secretary in charge of US federal lands, natural resources and cultural preservation stressed how the projects need to be re-examined due to threats to marine animal welfare and the efficacy of offshore energy.

'When you're pounding into the ocean floor to build a pillar for one of these gigantic wind towers, many of them taller than the Seattle Space Needle, when you're doing that, it can produce decibels up to 220 decibels,' the secretary explained.

'That would just destroy your hearing if you were at a concert. I mean, 100 decibels higher than what would even be the loudest cheering you'd see at a sports event.'

Despite this, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has said it has found no links to offshore wind farms and whale deaths, though it admits that studying 'acoustic trauma, which could result from close exposure to loud human-produced sounds, is very challenging to assess.'

The Trump administration has said this year that it is investigating whether offshore wind farms pose a national security threat.

Trump has long hated windmills, believing they are an eyesore that threaten some of America's most beloved wildlife, including the bald eagle.

'You want to see a bird graveyard? You just go. Take a look. Go under a windmill someday. You'll see more birds than you've ever seen in your life... In California, they were killing the bald eagle. If you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for 10 years. A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true,' the president told a Turning Point USA summit in 2019.

He was mocked by leftists after a news conference in January when he warned that the windmills are 'driving the whales crazy'.

Trump cited a series of beached whales in Massachusetts where he claimed the confused mammals had been driven ashore by wind farm noise pollution.

At least half a dozen Cabinet members, including Burgum, are probing the impacts of offshore wind on their departments.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Environmental Protection Agency boss Lee Zeldin and Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy are also involved, the New York Times reports.

Their effort makes good on an executive order signed by Trump on his first day in office to review the many offshore wind projects approved by Joe Biden.

In total, at least 11 different offshore wind leasing projects with over 1,000 turbines were approved to be built along US coastlines under Biden.

The projects, some of which have been canceled or paused amid the Trump administration's review of the impacts of offshore wind, were estimated to bring in enough power for millions of homes.

Under the Democrat, permits were approved for projects in Alaska, California, North Carolina, South Carolina, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia and more.

Trump and Burgum are now trying to reverse many of those green energy deals.

'Since day one, President Trump has reversed Joe Biden's Green New Scam to restore America's energy dominance,' White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told the Daily Mail in a statement.

Though Trump has attempted to halt offshore wind projects, many of which have already been approved with construction underway, some of his attempts have not been successful.

Despite efforts to stop the wind projects in New York and Rhode Island, both are going forward.

But it's not just the damage to animals or the ugly appearance of turbines in coastal waters that are worrying the administration officials.

'There's a lot of reasons beyond just the aesthetics to be very concerned about offshore wind, but the number one for U.S. taxpayers is we were subsidizing with taxpayer dollars, massively, a source of electricity that is completely intermittent and weather-dependent,' Burgum warned.

'We've got to get back in the game now of having baseload power that's affordable and reliable.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/24/23/103301019-0-image-m-23_1761345564867.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 13:59:43.941804

This milestone, as detailed in a recent report from the Los Angeles Times, underscores a profound transformation driven by massive investments in battery storage technology. No longer are rolling blackouts a looming threat during scorching afternoons; instead, grid operators are leaning on vast arrays of lithium-ion batteries to smooth out supply fluctuations.

These batteries, often paired with solar and wind farms, store excess renewable energy generated during the day and discharge it during evening peaks when demand surges. Industry experts point to this as a game-changer, with the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) noting in its 2025 Summer Assessment that sufficient resources now mitigate risks even under extreme conditions. The absence of Flex Alerts this year builds on progress from 2024, reflecting years of strategic planning after the chaotic blackouts of 2020-2022.

The Rise of Battery Dominance

Battery capacity in California has exploded, reaching over 10 gigawatts by mid-2025, enough to power millions of homes for hours. According to the California Energy Commission, this surge has bolstered reliability, allowing the grid to handle heat waves without dipping into emergency reserves. Insiders attribute much of this to policy incentives like tax credits and streamlined permitting, which have attracted billions in private investment from companies such as Tesla and NextEra Energy.

Yet, this isn’t just about hardware; it’s a sophisticated orchestration of demand response and real-time data analytics. CAISO’s media resources highlight how batteries integrate with advanced forecasting tools to preempt shortages, a far cry from the reactive Flex Alerts of the past, which relied on public pleas to unplug appliances.

Overcoming Historical Vulnerabilities

Historically, California’s grid strained under the weight of climate-driven extremes, from wildfires disrupting transmission lines to hydroelectric shortfalls during droughts. The California ISO has long warned of these risks, but 2025’s summer proved resilient, with no alerts issued despite temperatures soaring above 100 degrees in key regions. Energy leaders, as reported in the Los Angeles Times, credit this to a diversified portfolio that includes not only batteries but also expanded clean energy imports from neighboring states.

Critics, however, caution that complacency could undermine gains. While batteries have “completely taken off,” per the same Los Angeles Times analysis, challenges like supply chain vulnerabilities for rare minerals and the need for even larger-scale storage loom. Industry forums, including those hosted by Energy Upgrade California, emphasize ongoing vigilance, urging continued innovation in grid management.

Future Implications for Energy Policy

Looking ahead, California’s model is drawing global attention, influencing utilities from Texas to Europe as they grapple with renewable integration. The Flex Alert program’s own data shows conservation calls have plummeted, signaling a maturing system where technology supplants behavioral nudges. For insiders, this evolution raises questions about pricing dynamics—will abundant storage lower wholesale rates, or create new monopolies?

Ultimately, as CAISO’s updates suggest, the state’s energy strategy is pivoting toward proactive resilience. By embedding batteries deeply into operations, California isn’t just avoiding crises; it’s redefining how modern grids function in an era of climate uncertainty, setting a benchmark for sustainable power management worldwide.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-8d30915c-0ff8-48af-ab86-3e29ec703722.jpeg,N,,2025-10-26 11:58:58.180923

With 2026 models of new and returning electric vehicles officially out on the streets, a new generation of EVs is finally here. These EVs such as the Lucid Gravity, Rivian R1S and R1T and Hyundai Ioniq 5 are all natively built with Tesla’s charging connector that allows a seamless connection to its Supercharger network.

But we can’t escape adapters.

The transition to Tesla’s NACS, or North American Charging Standard, now means that every plug at public charging stations like those from ChargePoint, Electrify America, EVgo and others outside the Supercharger network now require an adapter. Even home chargers will need an extra piece of plastic to work on new EVs. Like with the “courage” Apple summoned with its transition to Bluetooth connection from wired headphones, the next few years will require endurance—because it’s getting messy.

Until now, only Tesla EVs (the Model S, 3, X and Y and Cybertruck) needed an adapter to work at every charging station outside the Supercharger network, but now a growing portion of the 4 million EVs in America (as of 2024) are barreling into dongle overload.

A Hyundai spokesperson confirmed, “the vehicles come with two adapters,” as will Lucid’s new Gravity SUV for AC and DC charging. Rivian’s 2026 models will include a J1772 adapter for Level 2 charging for its Dual, Tri and Quad vehicles and its Quad Launch Editions will have a CCS Combo 1 DC fast adapter. In a word: messy.

General Motors, Cadillac’s parent company, put out a summer blog post saying exactly that about the upcoming adapter situation, “That creates a little complication: there will be cars on the road with both standards, as well as chargers of both varieties in public and private settings.” The 2026 Cadillac Optiq will be the first GM EV to transition to NACS.

While Tesla’s Supercharger network is thriving and growing (7,753 stations housing 73,817 individual connectors, up 16% from last year), home chargers and older network plugs won’t be compatible with the newest EVs. An Electrify America spokesperson wrote in an email, “Electrify America remains committed to supporting the future of the [NACS] connector.” She went on to explain that the company is testing NACS charging at stations in Florida and Connecticut “to gain insights into the customer experience and data on the hardware.”

ChargePoint has taken more aggressive steps to escape dongle hell. Rob Newton, the network’s senior director of marketing, acknowledged in a call that in the past the “experience has been really clunky” when different charging systems are involved. ChargePoint has never provided adapters.

Instead of relying on carmakers or individual EV owners to keep up with the latest dongles, ChargePoint is changing the source. Enter the Omni Port. Introduced this summer, the newest ChargePoint stations will have the adapter built into the station itself and drivers can select what type of EV they are charging. “You want to be able to pull up to a station and have confidence it works,” Newton said.

New stations will come standard with an Omni Port, but older stations need to retrofit old connectors with a conversion kit from the company. Newton called it “future-proofing,” but it’s more about ensuring new EV owners can continue to use (and pay for kilowatt-hours from) non-Tesla charging stations.

Nearly every automaker with an electrified model announced in the past few years that it was making the inevitable shift to the Tesla charging system. And now it’s happening — dongles and all.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/10/ev-charger-knot-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:17:51.305277

Engineers in a familiar continent are looking to transform what would have been called a dead zone into a clean-energy utopia with the help of 20 million solar panels. In this article, we will examine why this move is not only important locally but globally as well.

Transition unveiled: Examining the timeline from desert to photovoltaic utopia

It is important to fully understand the topography and features of the “desert” in question before we cover the near impossible engineering feat connecting over 20 million solar panels that is looking to revolutionize energy generation from the ground up.

The desert in question was selected for a wide range of reasons, including:

Solar radiance: Solar radiance, particularly in this context, refers to the amount of solar energy that hits a particular area over a period of time. It is inevitably easy now to see why irradiation is a vital factor when engineers and researchers were making their pick.

Accessibility: This refers to how close the location of the set infrastructure or export routes can determine the viability of the project.

Ability to connect to existing infrastructure: The ability to connect the incoming energy stored and ready to use with existing grid infrastructure is also quite important to conduct thorough research on before settling on the desert location.

How the impossible came to life: logistics and technicalities exposed

Western Australia is the location of the desert that was picked. And the scale looks something like 20 million panels with a broad panel structure. This is not the first time the desert will host a technological marvel, although smaller and similar. The Merredin Solar Farm also finds its roots solidly put in place here, which spans 460 hectares and uses over 350,000 panels.

Implications of the project, particularly on Australia’s future

The possibilities that will arise from the project are immense. Residential homes, for one, will be at the greater receiving end as they are on pace to receive enough electricity that can power hundreds of thousands of homes, just like this U.S state’s powerful innovation transforming deserts. The reduction in Australia’s overall greenhouse emissions is also a huge bonus.

Internationally, Australia is going to be able to cement itself as a world leader when it comes to the topic of photovoltaic energy generation through desert incorporation. This adds it to the list of continents/countries that have started adopting green energy from the ground up.

Bottlenecks and hurdles are plaguing the road ahead

A gargantuan project such as this will most likely come chock-full of roadblocks that may range from environmental concerns to logistics. Within these issues, energy storage facilities, adequate financing, and innovative blocks might prove to later in the years when the infrastructure has been built to be insurmountable.

But it is not all doom and gloom because this project might just be the key that Western Australia has been looking for to offset its heavy dependence on fossil fuels. This goes to show that this is just not a fluke but an entire movement with one objective in mind: Revolutionize photovoltaic energy generation.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Image-26.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:03:34.991736

A simulation tool developed by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory is helping to optimize the efficiency and speed of our power grid, according to a release.

The platform uses mathematical tools, automation, and analysis to help officials understand and predict the grid's behavior. It achieves this with less computing time and at a cheaper cost than the current approach.

Because of the vast size of North America, the complex power grid system is split into multiple sections. It doesn't fully sync up, and it's not singularly managed by the federal government, so it's difficult to fully prepare the power supply during natural disasters and extreme weather events when the grid can be vulnerable.

Today, the speed and demand of the grid are evolving faster than its infrastructure can handle. The new tool will allow for grid management methods to be analyzed quickly and accurately without risking equipment, electrical service, or worker safety.

It could also help expand the capacity of the grid to generate and move electricity in different ways. Ultimately, this will help operators prevent blackouts and unsafe operating conditions and could better support the huge power requirements of AI and crypto data centers.

""We are trying to understand electronics and systems in a way that mimics their real behavior with higher fidelity,"" said Phani Marthi, a researcher at Oak Ridge.

""Analysis with the RE-INTEGRATE tool can give us new insights into how to consistently prevent or stop cascading blackouts and brownouts.""

A more efficient power grid could lower the cost of electricity for consumers, saving you money on utility bills every month. These improvements will also reduce energy pollution and protect the power supply during severe weather.

Hyper-scale data centers are classified as those with over 100,000 square feet and consuming 100 megawatts.
“A Facebook, an Amazon — the big data centers will want direct fiber connectivity.” A map published last week by the Wall Street Journal using Department of Energy information showed data centers across the United States.
Some data centers do have flexibility in their need for electricity, while others must respond immediately to needs of their consumers.","Data centers in Colorado have been almost exclusively located along the Front Range, more narrowly yet between Colorado Springs and Boulder County.

In other words, they have arrived at exactly those places within the state that have prosperous economies, jurisdictions even struggling with the challenges imposed by growth.

Might data centers make their way to rural areas of Colorado?

Leaders of several electrical cooperatives offer mixed responses. Some report getting interest already, others not.

Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Colorado’s second largest electrical provider, hopes to prime the pump. It has filed a proposal with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a tariff that it believes will interest developers. It’s called HILT, which stands for high-impact load tariff. It is designed for demands of 45 megawatts or more.

Meanwhile, several state legislators continue to hone bills they expect to introduce into the next legislative session. In the last legislative session, one bill proposed incentives for data center development in some locations. Others thought that the state needed guardrails to ensure other that customers — as well as land and especially water resources — are not imperiled. (Look for a deeper story on that in coming days in Big Pivots).

“Absolutely,” said Duane Highley, the chief executive of Tri-State, in an interview with Big Pivots on Oct. 7 when asked about potential for data centers in places like Craig or Fort Morgan. “Our members have actually had quite a bit of interest across our entire footprint. So definitely not just the urban areas.”

The Westminster-based cooperative provides wholesale power to 40 electrical cooperatives and public power districts in Colorado and three adjoining states.

“Some of our high-elevation members get a lot of interest because of the cool air and less need for cooling a data center,” he said. This, he added, is particularly true in Wyoming, where Tri-State has 10 member cooperatives. It supplies electricity to 16 cooperatives in Colorado.

Tri-State does not deliver electricity to Craig and Hayden, although it does operate three coal-burning units at Craig. It plans a gas-fired power plant there after the coal units get retired. The first unit is scheduled to retire later this year and the final two before the end of 2028.

At 6,200 feet in elevation, Craig is consistently cooler than the Front Range. It is often below zero during winter nights, sometimes far below.

“I guess Craig would be an excellent spot,” said Highley. He cited the existence of a “really big substation” as well as transmission.

“So if anybody wants to start a conversation around Craig, we will have the tariff in place to allow that to happen. ”

Highley reported that Tri-State has had four gigawatts of requests on its system from data centers. Tri-State has a generating capacity of 2.5 gigawatts from Wyoming to Arizona. Not all that demand will materialize, Highley hastened to add. “A lot of them are just shopping, but I have to think that some part of that is real.”

A spot check by Big Pivots of electrical cooperatives in Colorado reveals little of substance — yet.

“We really haven’t had any inquiries about data centers in the Mountain Parks service territory to date,” said Virginia Harman, the chief executive of Granby-based Mountain Parks Electric. “That doesn’t mean they won’t happen.”

In Buena Vista, Jon Beyer, the general manager of Sangre de Cristo Electric, has the same report. “We are not getting any inquiries anywhere in the Arkansas Valley. Land prices are pretty expensive, and electrical infrastructure is probably not robust enough for stuff of that size. Finding employees is a challenge as well,” he said.

“Coops along the Front Range — Poudre Valley, United Power, Mountain View, maybe even San Isabel, I would guess they have all received inquiries, folks kicking the tires.”

In western Colorado, Delta-Montrose Association has at least heard a little bit of interest via upstream electrical providers but “nothing to take to the bank,” said Kent Blackwell, the chief administrative officer. “The fact that we have even heard any out there is shocking to me, this far removed from urban centers.”

Different sizes

Data centers do come in different sizes and flavors. Micro data centers generally are those in places of 5,000 square feet or less. Small comes in at 20,000 square feet. Hyper-scale data centers are classified as those with over 100,000 square feet and consuming 100 megawatts.

QTS, Colorado’s most high-profile data center, seems not to have divulged its square footage but has a 67-acre campus in Aurora, near the intersection of I-70 and E-470, and a demand of 117 megawatts. However, it still ramping up, with a 10-year expansion.

Many data centers are even larger. Meta (Facebook) has a data center in Oregon that covers 4.6 million square feet. A data center in Inner Mongolia covers 10.7 million square feet.

These definitions and other information, by the way, come in part from Google AI reports (which makes those of us who are actual providers of diminished relevance — or at least uncompensated.) They could be wrong — as AI often is. Of course, newspapers were never wrong, were they?

Tri-State’s Highley said he has talked with developers covered by non-disclosure agreements. “I can’t share who they are, but I’ll just say I’m inspired by them,” he said. “They have a lot of money, and they do have the ability to execute. I also believe they’re shopping multiple locations at once, and so it’s a little bit of competition.”

Will this new HILT tariff from Tri-State — assuming it is approved by FERC — become a model for others? Highley said he got a call from a White House office in late September. The individual had lots of questions about Tri-State’s FERC filing. The individual had read Tri-State’s FERC filing in detail.

“Why do you care so much? Why are you calling me?” Highley asked. ” And he said, ‘Because I think this tariff that you filed could set a precedent for the industry nation-wide.”

Highley said he has not noticed another large-load tariff approved at FERC, although he has seen two that were rejected. “I don’t think we have it perfect, but we think we’re moving down a good path. We had input from developers and from our own co-op members to design this.”

Stranded assets?

Will this interfere with Tri-State’s plans to decarbonize? It expects to be at 50% carbon free electricity by year’s end and 70% by 2030. No, said Highley. Tri-State can meet new demand with solar, wind and battery storage. It also plans another natural gas plant near Craig, pending approval by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission.

Tri-State and its members would also allow data center developers to produce part of their own generation. That tariff is called bring-your-own-resource, or BYOR. A developer might have better access to supply chains, Highley said. “Again, some of these hyper-scalers have such a big checkbook they can buy their way to the front of the line. ”

HIghley said the Tri-State’s tariff will ensure that it has the capacity to back up the data center developer while getting properly compensated, so no other members subsidize the project.

A September presentation by Matt Fitzgibbon, Tri-State’s vice president of planning and analytics, tells a slightly nuanced story. A slide deck reported “limited potential” for stranded assets resulting in financial risk to Tri-State and its members while enabling “economic development across our members’ systems at an unprecedented level and pace.”

This gets at the heart of one concern about data centers, as illustrated in the Xcel filing with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission last year. How much of the prospective demand from data centers is real? And if it is not real, who will be left holding the bag if a utility spends gobs of money building new generating capacity? How much risk will be put on ratepayers, in the case of Xcel, or in the case of cooperatives, members?

In Durango, Chris Hansen, the chief executive of La Plata Electric since November, foresees data centers arriving in more rural parts of Colorado.

“We have had significant discussions with three different data center operators who are interested in southwest Colorado,” he reported. “We are making sure that we are open for business and communicating our opportunities in the near term, in the next 24 months, and those requiring more lead time of three, four or five years.”

Data centers, he said, “are most focused on low cost of power and availability of water for cooling. Those are very high on their list.”

And Colorado’s sales tax policy will not make it a higher cost for developers when they are buying hundreds of millions of dollars for chips. “That is something that is relevant for them as they make their decisions.”

Hansen said he believes that data center demand can be met in ways that are highly beneficial to existing customers and the electrical system more broadly.

Some rural places could be limited by lack of sufficient fiber connectivity to more urban areas. Hansen acknowledges that but points out that data centers can have different needs. As for southwest Colorado, it is well connected.

Delta-Montrose’s Blackwell sees his cooperative being in a good position to interest data center developers. It has fiber connectivity to Denver, Salt Lake City and Albuquerque. “A Facebook, an Amazon — the big data centers will want direct fiber connectivity.”

A map published last week by the Wall Street Journal using Department of Energy information showed data centers across the United States. Texas has, well, Texas-sized dots and maybe bigger. Virginia, with its data center alley, is well represented. But you see almost no dots of any size in the Rocky Mountain states beyond the urban areas with the exception of Cheyenne.

Hansen said he believes electrical cooperatives are positioned to meet demand that investor-owned utilities in urban areas cannot.

“Larger investor-owned utilities around the country are not in great position to meet demand. That is the trend I am seeing. Rural co-ops can move fast, as they don’t have to necessarily go through PUCs. Those things help make rural areas more attractive.”

Lots of shopping, little commitment

In Southwest Colorado, the data developers have been looking to get started at 50 to 100 megawatts. If things go well, they might want to grow to data centers of a gigawatt or more.

Data centers come in different flavors, said Hansen. Some data centers do have flexibility in their need for electricity, while others must respond immediately to needs of their consumers.

Then there is the bring-your-own power approach. The Wall Street Journal article on Oct. 15, “AI Data Centers, Desperate for Electricity, Are Building Their Own Power Plants,” noted the problems of building transmission and other infrastructure.

“Tech companies in the AI race need power, and lots of it. They aren’t waiting around for the archaic U.S. power grid to catch up,” reports Jennifer Hlller.

Data centers long took power for granted, a consultant told the Journal. “But that’s no longer possible given the city-sized amounts of electricity needed to train AI models. One data center can devour as much electricity as 1,000 Walmart stores, and an AI search can use 10 times the amount of energy as a Google search,” Hiller said.

Hence, they have taken to building their own power generating sources, often gas plants.

The downside to that, as Hansen pointed out, is that the data center developers could still need the reliability of the broader grid. “It’s a balancing act,” he said.

While Hansen in Durango has just started getting inquiries from data center developers, Mark Gabriel, chief executive of Brighton-based United Power, has been fielding inquires for two or three years.

The electrical cooperative covers 900-plus square miles from the foothills of the Rockies to the oil and gas territory of the Wattenberg Field. But it also serves land near DIA as well as along the fast-developing I-76 and I-25 corridors.

As such, United has been getting lots of “tire kickers.” Now, says Gabriel, United actually expects something to come of the talk. Two operators with large load demands have committed to the $650,000 up-front fees, two more are in active negotiations, and several others are talking with United.

“We anticipate at least one to come to fruition,” said Gabriel.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3507d39/2147483647/strip/true/crop/740x389+0+52/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F72%2Fc4%2F8b1e1a2a45bf83c4ff2be50edb97%2Fimg.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:03:16.868140

In part, that’s because the roughly 64,000 federal military and civilian employees in Louisiana make up only about 3% of the state’s total workforce.
Also insulating the broader economy from the effects of the shutdown is the fact that the largest federal programs, Medicare and Social Security, have not been touched.","In his day job as president of Woodward Interests, Bill Hoffman hasn’t much noticed the federal government shutdown. His New Orleans real estate development firm is still planning projects, like the redevelopment of the former Lindy Boggs Medical Center in Mid-City, and operating as usual with no disruptions to supply chains or services.

As a volunteer for Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans and Acadiana, however, Hoffman has seen the effects up close. He's worked with the nonprofit organization's leadership to identify new funding sources at a time when more people around New Orleans need food assistance and federal support is drying up.

He fears it’s about to get a lot worse.

Thousands of federal workers in the state have been furloughed or are working without a paycheck. Loans and other federal funding sources are no longer flowing. And beginning Nov. 1, food stamps benefits — which help put food on the table for nearly 19% of Louisianans and more than 1 in 5 people in New Orleans — are set to run out.

The severity of that potential loss in food support prompted Gov. Jeff Landry on Friday to issue an emergency order aimed at helping him replace that federal funding with state dollars. But Second Harvest worries that food banks and other service agencies, still reeling from federal budget cuts earlier this year, will continue to see a strain.

“We’re already seeing more federal workers coming to us, and that number is going to grow,” said Hoffman, who also serves as Second Harvest board chair. “We will start to see this ripple out into the broader economy and will all start to feel it.”

Until now, the federal government shutdown, which enters its fifth week Wednesday, has mostly been a problem for the nation’s millions of federal employees, who have been furloughed or, in the case of air traffic controllers and other essential employees, forced to work without pay. States like Virginia or Maryland, which have high numbers of federal workers, feel it acutely.

In Louisiana, the impact has been more muted because the federal workforce is relatively small — a little under 20,000 civilian workers — and President Donald Trump’s administration has selectively shifted funds to ensure that some employees, like active duty troops, continue to get paid. At least for now.

But economists and public policy groups say a quiet storm is brewing. Louisiana is already one of the poorest states in the nation, with a higher percentage of residents on federal assistance than almost any other. The longer the shutdown drags on, the greater the impact will be across the state, as furloughed workers and those who rely on federal assistance tighten their belts and brace for potentially unprecedented times.

“The dominoes are about to start falling,” said economist Stephen Barnes, executive director of the Blanco Public Policy Center at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. “Once they do, it’s going to be very challenging for families across the state.”

Stopgaps in place

Experts say it’s not surprising that many across Louisiana in the private sector haven’t felt the effects of the shutdown yet. In part, that’s because the roughly 64,000 federal military and civilian employees in Louisiana make up only about 3% of the state’s total workforce.

Some are still collecting paychecks, or were until last week.

Others have been helped by institutions like Keesler Federal Credit Union, based in Biloxi, Mississippi, which is offering paycheck protection relief to the mostly federal government employees that make up its membership. So far, about 1,535 members have enrolled in the plan, which will cover them for 90 days, according to Keesler spokesperson T. Bradley Keith.

Also insulating the broader economy from the effects of the shutdown is the fact that the largest federal programs, Medicare and Social Security, have not been touched. Neither has Medicaid, though the extension of tax credits to help low-income patients afford health insurance is at the heart of the dispute between Democrats and Republicans in Congress that led to the shutdown.

“The two big programs and Medicaid are safe for now,” said Jan Moeller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, a think tank that advocates for inclusive economic policies. “So, in a state like Louisiana, which has a huge amount of federal money but not a huge number of employees, it is going to be hard to see the effects of the shutdown in most communities.”

Just because the effects of the shutdown are not widely visible, however, doesn’t mean they’re not being felt in various pockets of the economy, Moeller said.

The National Flood Insurance Program is shuttered, which means new homeowners are unable to buy into the program, and the state’s existing 400,000 policyholders aren't able to increase their coverage.

Louisiana’s 25,000 farmers have been unable to get a loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, apply for a conservation program or receive a market report, hampering their ability to plan for the upcoming planting season.

And the state’s nearly half a million small businesses have been unable to access loans through the Small Business Administration, though data released by the SBA last week showed that only 12 loan applications totaling about $7.2 million in Louisiana went unprocessed last week because the agency was closed.

Stretched thin

If federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, runs out, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture has warned, the shutdown will become real for a lot more people across Louisiana.

More than 800,000 people in Louisiana receive SNAP benefits. That’s more, as a percentage of the population, than almost any other state in the nation

On Wednesday, Landry, a Republican, said the state would shut the program down next month, blaming Democrats in Congress for the stalemate that has led to the current funding crisis.

On Friday at the Harry Tompson Center, a day shelter in New Orleans, Marcus, a New Orleans East resident and licensed practical nurse by training who declined to give his last name, said the political finger-pointing among elected officials is frustrating.

The monthly SNAP benefits he has received for the past two years since he lost his job barely puts food on the table now. If he loses them, the 64-year-old says his cellphone is about the only “luxury” item he could trim from his monthly expenses.

“I don’t know how much more I can stretch,” he said. “I guess I’ll be shopping more at Dollar Tree and coming more to the food pantry.”

Food pantries, however, are already hard-pressed. At an event at Second Harvest last week, Chief Strategy Officer John Sillars said the food bank will receive about 5.8 million fewer pounds of food from the federal government this year than it did last due to federal funding cuts since Trump took office.

As a result, Second Harvest will provide about 5 million fewer meals to a food-insecure population that had grown by 30,000 even before the shutdown.

U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, who visited Second Harvest last week to call attention to the growing crisis, said he’s worried about “the avalanche effect” that will happen if the shutdown persists.

“It impacts our families but also the grocer, the person who is stocking the shelves, the person who is selling the milk, the cereal, the eggs, the bread,” Carter said.

Landry's announcement Friday that the state would work to continue SNAP benefits for the time being was a welcome development that will mitigate the worst outcomes for the state's neediest residents, policy experts said. But more pain is on the way if the shutdown doesn't end soon.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/ca/1ca0cea8-5e4f-5d91-9b31-58b7d15657be/68f92888886a7.image.jpg?crop=1752%2C920%2C0%2C131&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-26 11:19:42.664700

Heat domes are high-pressure systems that act like lids trapping hot air over a region. According to NOAA’s National Weather Service, they can raise surface temperatures for days or even weeks.

During the summer of 2025, the United States set new records for power demand under a persistent dome. In July, demand in the United States topped 750 gigawatts on some record-breaking afternoons, with power providers scrambling to meet peak loads while infrastructure came under strain.

When energy systems are overstretched, the risk of brownouts or blackouts increases. In addition to the human health toll of extreme heat, an overtaxed grid poses significant business and economic risks by driving up costs, limiting output, and damaging critical infrastructure.

Heat domes and the climate connection

Heat domes are becoming stronger and lasting longer. According to entities such as the World Meteorological Organization, climate change makes certain extreme heat events at least twice as likely.

One study of the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome found it was 86% stronger than it would likely have been without human-driven climate change.

Heat increases energy demand

When heat domes roll in, the grid starts sweating right along with the rest of us. Air conditioners, commercial coolers, refrigerators, and fans all crank up, slurping electricity like marathon runners gulping water. During the 2025 heat wave, U.S. power demand set records from coast to coast.

Peak demand shifts depending on the time of day and where you are. In the Mid-Atlantic, transformer banks hum under the strain in late afternoons. In California, it’s the early evening AC surge that pushes the grid into ""brace yourself"" mode, sometimes triggering conservation alerts or rolling blackouts.

These spikes aren’t just abstract numbers — they come with a price tag. Utilities shell out extra generation costs and pay hefty premiums in capacity markets. For businesses, unmanaged peaks can mean skyrocketing energy bills, interrupted production lines, and even data centers throttling performance to keep the servers from cooking.

How heat impacts grid infrastructure

National lab studies funded by the U.S. Department of Energy consistently flag heat as a key stressor on electric grid infrastructure. Heat affects generation equipment and transmission lines, creating multiple points of vulnerability.

Impact on power plants

Thermal plants — power plants that generate electricity by heating water into steam to drive turbines — lose efficiency during extreme heat

Turbines and generators overheat, producing less power when the inlet air is hotter

Impact on solar panels

Output declines with rising temperatures — each degree over 25°C (77°F) reduces efficiency

Above 40°C (104°F), reductions intensify, especially with dust buildup or poor airflow

Impact on transmission lines and equipment

Hot lines sag more, increasing the risk of faults

Transformers and switchgear run hotter, risking breakdowns and accelerating wear

Cooling systems may struggle to keep up, further stressing components

The overall effect is that these pressures increase the likelihood of operational failures, including brownouts or full blackouts.

Vulnerabilities in the U.S. power grid

Aging infrastructure

The U.S. grid is uneven in age and robustness. Many regions rely on decades-old wiring and transformers, with some components well past their intended lifespan. Others, like the Southwest and Midwest, are especially hard-hit during heat due to slower infrastructure upgrades and sprawling service areas that complicate maintenance.

Regional weak spots and interconnection issues

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) oversees grid reliability standards and has repeatedly warned about regional weak spots and poor interconnection.

Weak tie lines (power lines that connect different regions of the grid to share electricity) in the Midwest limit the ability to move excess generation from other states during heat spikes. Sunbelt states sometimes lack capacity margins when demand surges, forcing utilities to issue conservation alerts.

A combination of heat, aging equipment, and limited investment

As NERC alerts show, outdated infrastructure can’t always adapt quickly to heat domes. This vulnerability is compounded by limited investment in grid hardening and modern control systems. That weakness creates risk for widespread outages when high demand, aging equipment, and extreme weather events collide, potentially leaving millions without power.

Cybersecurity vulnerabilities

Adding to these physical weaknesses, the grid's increasing digitalization and reliance on connected control systems have made it a prime target for cyberattacks. According to NERC, the number of vulnerable points in the grid's software and hardware grew by roughly 60 per day, reaching between 23,000 and 24,000 annually — significantly expanding the potential attack surface for state-sponsored or criminal actors.

What’s being done about heat domes?

Grid operators and regulators are using both short-term and long-term strategies to limit vulnerabilities and plan for the future.

Short-term: Approaches include demand response programs that pay businesses to cut usage at peak hours. Public heat alerts urge consumers to shift usage to cooler times. Utilities also balance loads through real-time coordination and distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar and local batteries.Long-term: Federal funds are under review to finance grid modernization. Batteries and storage are being added to smooth peaks. Legislation such as the BIG WIRES Act aims to strengthen transmission across regions. Regional grid operators, including CAISO in California, PJM in the Mid-Atlantic, and MISO in the Midwest, have launched heat wave prep plans and capacity-upgrade roadmaps.

Economic effects of heat domes

Heat domes drive higher costs for utilities and consumers. As peak electricity prices jump, bills go up. Utilities may pass those expenses on through rate increases, sometimes prompting public backlash.

Manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare industries also feel the squeeze. Hospitals and data centers need reliable cooling. Crop irrigation systems and automated greenhouses rely on grid power. Amid extreme heat, some facilities face rationing or must run expensive backup generators.

Energy price spikes often coincide with heat waves. Market data show wholesale prices doubling or tripling in some regions during peak events. That volatility can affect broader economic activities, especially in heat-sensitive sectors.

Ley’s attempt to turn the tables on the government after weeks of opposition infighting came as the government confirmed the environment minister would be able to overrule the new regulator, to be known as the National Environment Protection Agency, on major project approvals.

Flagging an intense period of negotiations during the remaining weeks of the parliamentary year, Environment Minister Murray Watt declared the nation’s environment laws were “broken”.

“Of course we’re open to amendments being put forward and I expect that we’ll see some in the coming weeks, but people should be under no illusions that we will be passing these laws through the parliament,” Watt told Sky News on Sunday.

“The only question is how quickly we do it and who we do it with. We’ve said all along that we are open to passing this legislation with either the Coalition or the Greens.”

Watt is expected to reveal more details on Monday and to introduce legislation to the House of Representatives on Thursday.

He quickly shot down the idea of carving up the bill, saying: “Splitting the bill would weaken environmental protections and would remove the certainty that business is looking for.

“It would mean more habitat destruction, more species threatened, no independent regulator and slower approval times.”

The government shelved plans to create a new environmental protection agency before the May election, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese replaced Tanya Plibersek with Watt to revive the reform process.

In a letter sent to Albanese on Sunday, Ley and opposition environment spokeswoman Angie Bell say the proposed reforms “risk adding further complexity and uncertainty, creating a handbrake on investment without delivering commensurate environmental gains”.

“In the interests of delivering on improved environmental laws and the urgent need for clearer and more consistent approvals, I propose that the government split the bill into two parts,” Ley and Bell wrote.

“The Coalition stands ready to achieve meaningful reform that protects the environment while removing unnecessary duplication and delay.”

Ley said the first tranche of legislation should focus on practical measures to streamline approvals, separating this part of the bill “from the broader, more contentious environmental elements of the legislation would allow parliament to make immediate progress on areas that can genuinely help unlock investment and growth”.

Ley was environment minister when former competition watchdog Graeme Samuel issued a review calling for an overhaul of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.

Coalition divisions over the environment are set to flare up again when Nationals senator Matt Canavan presents details of his and colleague Ross Cadell’s report into net zero to the party on Monday.

Canavan, a passionate supporter of coal mining, said it was clear Australians were not “getting a good deal from net zero” but he said he had not commissioned any economic modelling to inform his report.

“The lived reality of net zero is clear. It is not working for the Australian people,” he told the ABC’s Insiders program.

Resources Minister Madeleine King has said a failure to pass the bill could delay the approval of rare earths mines, undermining a landmark critical minerals agreement signed by Albanese and US President Donald Trump last week.

On Sunday, the Business Council of Australia called for changes to environmental laws to prevent a “damaging investment cliff” caused by a downturn in infrastructure investment.

“Whether it’s housing, renewable energy, health and care services or technology infrastructure, the [environmental protection] system is delaying investment into projects we need for the future,” BCA chief executive Bran Black said.

Greens environment spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said: “From what we have seen thus far, these changes have been written by the minister to satisfy big business, the miners and the logging companies.

“There’s nothing in this package that protects native forests or protects our climate.”

Hanson-Young said the Greens were open to negotiations on the legislation, but she said: “I’ve said right from the beginning: we need to protect our forests and to protect our climate and any piece of legislation that doesn’t do those things is not worth the paper it’s written on.”

The government also said it would begin consulting on possible updates to Australia’s copyright laws to ensure Australian writers and artists are fairly compensated if artificial intelligence companies use their work to inform their models.

Attorney-General Michelle Rowland said any reforms would not include a so-called “text and data mining exception” proposed by the Productivity Commission and fiercely opposed by the Australian creative sector.

In Illinois, the Chicago Teachers Union won a contract with the city’s schools to add solar panels on some buildings and clean energy career pathways for students, among other actions. In Minnesota, the Minneapolis Federation of Educators demanded that the district create a task force on environmental issues and provide free metro passes for students. And in California, the Los Angeles teachers union’s demands include electrifying the district’s bus fleet and providing electric vehicle charging stations at all schools.

Those are among the examples in a new report on how unionized teachers are pushing their school districts to take action on the climate crisis, which is damaging school buildings and disrupting learning. The report — produced by the nonprofit Building Power Resource Center, which supports local governments and leaders, and the Labor Network for Sustainability, a nonprofit that seeks to unite labor and climate groups — describes how educators can raise demands for climate action when they negotiate labor contracts with their districts. By emphasizing the financial case for switching to renewable energy, educators can simultaneously act on climate change, improve conditions in schools and save districts money, it says.

As federal support and financial incentives for climate action wither, this sort of local action is becoming more difficult — but also more urgent, advocates say. Chicago Public Schools has relied on funding for electric buses that has been sunsetted by the Trump administration, said Jackson Potter, vice president of the Chicago Teachers Union. But the district is also seeking other local and state funding and nonprofit support.

Bradley Marianno, an associate professor in the College of Education at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said that educator unions embracing climate action is part of a move started about 15 years ago in which more progressive unions — like those in Chicago, Los Angeles and elsewhere — focus on “collective good bargaining,” or advocating for changes that are good for their members but also the broader community. But this approach is unlikely to catch on everywhere: “The risk lies in members feeling that core issues like wages and working conditions are being overlooked in favor of more global causes,” he wrote in an email.

I recently caught up with Potter, the CTU vice president, about the report and his union’s approach to bargaining for climate action. Collaborating with local environmental and community groups, the Chicago Teachers Union ultimately succeeded in winning a contract that calls for identifying schools for solar panels and electrification, expanding indoor air quality monitoring, helping educators integrate climate change into their curriculum, and establishing training for students in clean energy jobs, among other steps.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

The report talks about contract negotiations being an underused — and effective — lever for demanding climate action. Why do you see that process as such an opportunity for climate action?

On the local level, our schools are 84, 83 years old on average. There is lead paint, lead pipes, mold, asbestos, PCBs, all kinds of contamination in the HVAC system and the walls that require upgrades. By our estimate, the district needs $30 billion worth of upgrades, and right now I think they spend $500 million a year to just do patch-up work. We’re at a point where it’s a system fail of epic proportions if we can’t figure out a way to transition and make things healthier. And so if you’re going to do a roof repair, put solar on it, have independence from fossil fuels, clean air in areas that have faced environmental racism and contamination.

We’re also dealing with a legacy of discrimination and harm, and that is true of the nation. So how do we get out of this and also save the planet and also prevent greater climate events that further destabilize vulnerable communities and put people at risk? It made sense for us to use our contract as a path to do both things — deal with this local crisis that was screaming for new solutions and ideas, in a moment when the climate is on fire, literally.

How challenging was it to get educators to view climate issues as a priority? There are so many other things, around pay and other issues, on the table.

When we started, it almost felt like people in the membership, in the community, viewed it as a niche issue. Like, ‘Oh, isn’t that cute, you care about green technology.’ As we figured out how to think about it and talk about it and probe where people were having issues in their schools, it became really obvious that when you started talking about asbestos, lead and mold remediation — and helping communities that have been hit the hardest with cumulative impacts and carcinogens and how those things are present in schools — that became much more tangible. Or even quality food and lunch and breakfast for students who are low-income. It went from bottom of the list to top of the list, instantaneously.

Your contract calls for a number of climate-related actions, including green pathways for students and agreements with building trade unions to create good jobs for students. Tell me about that.

We’re trying to use the transformation of our facilities as another opportunity for families and students in these communities that have been harmed the most to get the greatest benefit from the transformation. So if we can install solar, we want our students to be part of that project on the ground in their schools, gaining the skills and apprenticeship credentials to become the electricians of the future. And using that as a project labor agreement [which establishes the terms of work on a certain project] with the trades to open doors and opportunities. The same goes for all the other improvements — whether it’s heat pumps, HVAC systems, geothermal. And for EV — we have outdated auto shop programming that’s exclusively based on the combustible engine reliant on fossil fuels, whereas in [the nearby city of] Belvidere they are building electric cars per the United Auto Workers’ new contract. Could we gain a career path on electric vehicles that allows students to gain that mechanical knowledge and insight and prepares them for the vehicles of the future?

The report talks about the Batesville School District in Arkansas that was able to increase teacher salaries because of savings from solar. Have you tried to make the case for higher teacher salaries because of these climate steps?

The $500 million our district allocates for facility upgrades annually comes out of the general fund, so we haven’t at all thought about it in terms of salary. We’ve thought about it in terms of having a school nurse, social worker, mental health interventions at a moment when there is so much trauma. We see this as a win-win: The fewer dollars the district has to spend on facility needs means the more dollars they can spend on instructional and social-emotional needs for students. In terms of the Arkansas model, it’s pretty basic. If you get off the fossil fuel pipelines and electric lines and you become self-sufficient, essentially, powering your own electric and heat, there is going to be a boon, particularly if there are up-front subsidies.

Math and climate change

When temperatures rise in classrooms, students have more trouble concentrating and their learning suffers — in math, in particular. That’s according to a new report from NWEA, an education research and testing company.

The report, part of a growing body of evidence of the harms of extreme heat on student performance, found that math scores declined when outdoor temperatures on test days rose above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Students in high-poverty schools, which are less likely to have air conditioning, saw declines up to twice as large as those in wealthier schools.

The learning losses grew as temperatures rose. Students who took tests on 101-degree days scored roughly 0.06 standard deviations below students who tested when temperatures were 60 degrees, the equivalent of about 10 percent of the learning a fifth grader typically gains in a school year.

It’s not entirely clear why student math scores suffer more than reading when temperatures rise. But Sofia Postell, an NWEA research analyst, said that on math tests, students must problem-solve and rely on their memories, and that kind of thinking is particularly difficult when students are hot and tired. Anxiety could be a factor too, she wrote in an email: “Research has also shown that heat increases anxiety, and some students may experience more testing anxiety around math exams.”

The study was based on data from roughly 3 million scores on NWEA’s signature MAP Growth test for third to eighth graders in six states.

The report urged school, district and state officials to take several steps to reduce the effects of high heat on student learning and testing. Ideally, tests would be scheduled during times of the year when it wasn’t so hot, it said, and also during mornings, when temperatures are cooler. Leaders also need to invest in updating HVAC systems to keep kids cool.

“Extreme heat has already detrimentally impacted student learning and these effects will only intensify without action,” wrote Postell.

Mea culpa: A quick note to say I got two things wrong in my last newsletter — the name of the Natural Resources Defense Council was incorrect, as was the number of hours of learning California students have missed so far this year. It’s more than 54,000.

A college aims to start training 200 new students in the coming months, to develop skilled workers needed in the transition to clean energy.

Those studying at Pembrokeshire College could then fill some of the 15,000 new jobs ministers hope will be created in Wales.

But senior Welsh government advisor David Clubb says UK ministers plan to spend billions on ""unproven technology"" such as carbon capture, when the initial focus should be on home insulation to help bring down bills for the public.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he stands by his pledge to reduce energy bills.

National Infrastructure Commission chairman Mr Clubb believes the initial focus should be Wales' ""oldest housing stock in western Europe"" which he believes leaves many in fuel poverty.

""For Wales, probably the first thing we should be doing is looking at a programme of insulation, and UK government should be putting money into that,"" Mr Clubb said.

Ministers have talked about a £20 billion investment in carbon capture and storage, which he said is ""likely not going to make a big impact on our ambitions for net zero by 2050"".

Mr Clubb, a green energy technology expert, said it was far better to invest first in making homes warmer and easier to heat ""than to be spending huge sums of money, which will create jobs, yes, but in a very localised area"".

One of the areas to benefit from clean energy investments is Pembrokeshire College, in Haverfordwest.

Its hoping to start training 200 new students in the coming months in trades from plumbing to engineering.

It is part of a pilot scheme to develop skilled workers needed in the transition to clean energy that ministers say will bring 15,000 new jobs to Wales.

Theo Butland-Smith, 17, from Monkton said he believes there will be a ""lot of money"" in the new green jobs.

""[There is] a lot of opportunity so I thought I might as well pursue it, and I've enjoyed it ever since,"" he said.

Welding student Bethany Price, also 17, from Haverfordwest, is hoping to end up in a clean energy job.

""It's amazing how far they've come with everything,"" she said.

""I'm just excited to be part of that new whole thing going on.""

Mr Clubb welcomes the jobs, but questioned whether large scale green projects will benefit Wales.

""For me, and the Infrastructure Commission... we're disappointed that ownership of these projects is not being considered,"" he said.

Most projects are owned outside of the country, he said, with only a few developed by the the community energy sector and small companies in Wales.

""We would like to see a renewable energy bill that gave the opportunity for local organisations and people to buy into projects,"" he said.

Sam Kurtz, the Conservatives' economy and energy spokesperson and Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MS, also welcomed the new investment but raised concerns about the implications for oil and gas.

""We need to look at this in the wider context of where energy bills have got to after Labour have come to power, and that promise of cutting £300 off energy bills,"" he said.

""Energy bills are now nearly £200 more expensive in the 12 months since the General Election, so the promise of jobs is welcome, but the alienation of our traditional oil and gas industries as well, is driving up the cost of people's bills.""

The Welsh government welcomed the clean energy jobs, saying they are ""central"" to the its vision for Wales .

A spokesperson said: ""The impact of high energy prices in recent years shows that it is essential for us to improve our energy security and reduce our dependence on imported energy.

""With our abundance of natural resources, Wales is in an ideal position to accelerate our renewable energy contribution and at the same time address climate change challenges.

By Ambali Abdulkabeer

As the largest economy and most populous nation in Africa, Nigeria stands at a critical energy crossroads. For decades, the country has been shackled by a heavy reliance on imported petrol and diesel, a dependency that drains vital foreign exchange, pollutes the environment, and constrains economic growth. In response, the government is championing a strategic pivot towards Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)—a cleaner, cheaper gaseous fuel. This transition represents more than a mere policy shift; it is a vital national imperative with the potential to redefine Nigeria’s energy landscape. However, the path to a CNG-powered future is fraught with challenges that demand urgent and strategic action.

The case for CNG is compelling, anchored in a triad of economic, environmental, and operational benefits. Economically, CNG offers a much-needed respite. With estimates suggesting cost savings of 20-30% compared to petrol and 30-40% compared to diesel, its adoption could significantly reduce the financial strain on both individual households and the national treasury. This is a crucial buffer against the inflationary pressures exacerbated by the removal of the fuel subsidy, putting money back into the pockets of Nigerians and freeing up billions in foreign exchange currently spent on fuel imports.

Environmentally, the shift is a step in the right direction. As a cleaner-burning fuel, CNG produces markedly fewer emissions than its liquid counterparts. The government’s claim that it could mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% points to a tangible opportunity to improve urban air quality and align with global sustainability goals. Furthermore, for vehicle owners, CNG offers practical advantages: it leads to less engine wear and tear, reduces maintenance costs, and extends engine life, presenting a more efficient and reliable alternative for the transportation sector.

Initiatives like the Presidential Compressed Natural Gas Initiative (PCNGi) and partnerships with private firms to develop infrastructure and financing for vehicle conversions signal a welcome commitment. Yet, despite this political will and the evident benefits, the widespread adoption of CNG faces formidable barriers.

The most immediate obstacle is the stark lack of infrastructure. Nigeria currently has only a handful of CNG refueling stations, concentrated largely in urban centers. This sparse and uneven distribution creates a “chicken and egg” dilemma: consumers are hesitant to convert their vehicles without a reliable network of stations, and investors are reluctant to build stations without a critical mass of CNG vehicles. This infrastructure gap effectively sidelines a vast portion of the population, particularly those in rural areas, from the transition.

Compounding this is the prohibitive upfront cost of conversion. With prices ranging from N300,000 to N600,000 per vehicle, switching to CNG remains a distant dream for the average Nigerian. Without substantial financial incentives, this barrier will keep CNG as a luxury for the few rather than a viable option for the many. This challenge underscores a fundamental truth: possessing substantial natural gas reserves is not enough; it requires intentional investment and sound policy to translate this resource into tangible economic relief.

Furthermore, a significant information deficit and lingering safety concerns threaten to derail public acceptance. Many Nigerians are simply unaware of CNG’s benefits or are skeptical due to a lack of targeted education. This skepticism is often compounded by legitimate fears about safety, given CNG’s flammability. Recent CNG-related accidents have heightened these concerns, highlighting the non-negotiable need for stringent safety protocols, certified technicians, and public awareness campaigns to build trust in the technology.

For Nigeria’s CNG revolution to move from policy paper to palpable reality, a coordinated, multi-stakeholder approach is essential. The government must take the lead by deepening investment in core infrastructure. This means accelerating the rollout of refueling stations along major highways and in urban centers, while incentivizing private sector participation to ensure nationwide coverage.

Simultaneously, making conversion affordable is paramount. The government should introduce a robust package of incentives, including tax breaks, subsidies, and low-interest loans, to bring the cost of conversion within reach of the average motorist and commercial transport operators.

Finally, building public trust through education and safety enforcement is critical. A sustained nationwide awareness campaign is needed to clearly articulate the economic and environmental advantages of CNG. This must be coupled with the strict enforcement of safety standards for kits, installations, and refueling stations, ensuring that the transition is not only popular but also safe.

The journey to a CNG-powered Nigeria is a marathon, not a sprint. It demands more than just political announcements; it requires relentless execution, significant capital investment, and a steadfast commitment to public engagement. By tackling the infrastructure deficit, alleviating the financial burden on citizens, and prioritizing safety and awareness, Nigeria can unlock the immense potential of CNG. Success in this endeavor would mean more than just cheaper fuel; it would signal a decisive break from a burdensome past, fueling a more sustainable, self-reliant, and prosperous future for all Nigerians.

How much has renewable energy grown, and why?","Does anyone still remember the Cheney energy report? Early in the George W. Bush administration a task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney released a big report offering recommendations for energy policy. There was a lot of controversy at the time — you might even call it a scandal — over Cheney’s secretiveness, his refusal to reveal how much role corporate interests played in writing the report, whose conclusions might be summarized as “drill, baby, drill.”

Those were innocent days. These days we have much bigger scandals multiple times a week.

But politics aside, what’s notable about that 2001 report, put together by men who regarded themselves as hard-headed realists, is that it envisaged an energy future reliant almost entirely on fossil fuels plus a bit of nuclear energy. The report grudgingly admitted that technological progress had reduced the costs of renewable energy, but still saw solar and wind as trivial for our energy future:

By 2020, non-hydropower renewable energy is expected to account for 2.8 percent of total electricity generation.

Here’s what actually happened:

Today’s primer will be devoted to the rise of renewable energy. This is, of course, a deeply politicized subject: Donald Trump and his officials hate, just hate wind and solar power, and there are many people who still refuse to believe that renewables can be practical even as renewables keep growing around the world, in fact accounting for the bulk of growth in electricity generation. But I’ll leave detailed discussion of where those attitudes come from for the next primer.

For today I want, instead, to focus on the economics of renewable energy. How did energy sources that a generation ago were widely dismissed as hippie fantasies become a major source of electricity? What are these sources’ future prospects, and how will their growth be affected by policy?

Beyond the paywall I’ll address the following:

1. How much has renewable energy grown, and why?

2. Why did the cost of renewables fall so much, so fast?

3. What role has policy played in the rise of renewables?

Today’s primer is intended as the first part of a two-part series. Next week I’ll ask, among other things, why there’s still so much U.S. political opposition to green energy; whether that opposition can stall the energy transition in America, and how this will affect geopolitics as China races ahead. I’ll also need to talk about whether renewables are driving up electricity prices and how we will (or won’t) cope with the extraordinary energy demands of generative AI; and more.

Many California lawmakers — including Kiley, one of the few GOP lawmakers to openly criticize him — have been dismayed by the deadlock.
The Republicans’ plan would have paid active-duty members of the military and some federal workers during the shutdown.
“I will not support a shutdown deal that strips healthcare from tens of thousands of my constituents,” she said.","Twenty-two days into the government shutdown, California Rep. Kevin Kiley spent an hour of his morning in Washington guiding a group of middle school students from Grass Valley through the empty corridors of the U.S. Capitol.

Normally, one of his staff members would have led the tour. But the Capitol is closed to all tours during the shutdown, unless the elected member is present. So the schoolchildren from Lyman Gilmore Middle School ended up with Kiley, a Republican from Rocklin, as their personal tour guide.

“I would have visited with these kids anyway,” Kiley said in his office after the event. “But I actually got to go on the whole tour of the Capitol with them as well.”

Kiley’s impromptu tour is an example of how members of California’s congressional delegation are improvising their routines as the shutdown drags on and most of Washington remains at a standstill.

Some are in Washington in case negotiations resume, others are back at home in their districts meeting with federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay, giving interviews or visiting community health centers that rely on tax credits central to the budget negotiations. One member attended the groundbreaking of a flood control project in their district. Others are traveling back and forth.

“I’ve had to fly back to Washington for caucus meetings, while the opposition, the Republicans, don’t even convene and meet,” Rep. Maxine Waters, a longtime Los Angeles Democrat, said in an interview. “We will meet anytime, anyplace, anywhere, with [House Speaker Mike] Johnson, with the president, with the Senate, to do everything that we can to open up the government. We are absolutely unified on that.”

The shutdown is being felt across California, which has the most federal workers outside the District of Columbia. Food assistance benefits for millions of low-income Californians could soon be delayed. And millions of Californians could see their healthcare premiums rise sharply if Affordable Care Act subsidies are allowed to expire.

For the California delegation, the fallout at home has become impossible to ignore. Yet the shutdown is in its fourth week with no end in sight.

In the House, Johnson has refused to call members back into session and prevented them from doing legislative work. Many California lawmakers — including Kiley, one of the few GOP lawmakers to openly criticize him — have been dismayed by the deadlock.

“I have certainly emphasized the point that the House needs to be in session, and that canceling a month’s worth of session is not a good thing for the House or the country,” Kiley said, noting that he had privately met with Johnson.

Kiley, who represented parts of the Sacramento suburbs and Lake Tahoe, is facing political uncertainty as California voters weigh whether to approve Proposition 50 on Nov. 4. The measure would redraw the state’s congressional districts to better favor Democrats, leaving Kiley at risk, even though the Republican says he believes he could still win if his right-leaning district is redrawn.

The Senate has been more active, holding a series of votes on the floor and congressional hearings with Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The chamber, however, has been unable to reach a deal to reopen the government. On Thursday, the 23rd day of the shutdown, the Senate failed to advance competing measures that would have paid federal employees who have been working without compensation.

The Republicans’ plan would have paid active-duty members of the military and some federal workers during the shutdown. Democrats backed a bill that would have paid all federal workers and barred the Trump administration from laying off any more federal employees.

“California has one of the largest federal workforces in the country, and no federal worker or service member should miss their paychecks because Donald Trump and Republicans refused to come to the table to protect Americans’ health care,” Sen. Alex Padilla said in a statement.

Working conditions get harder

The strain on federal employees — including those who work for California’s 54 delegation members — are starting to become more apparent.

Dozens of them have been working full time without pay. Their jobs include answering phone calls and requests from constituents, setting the schedules for elected officials, writing policy memos and handling messaging for their offices.

At the end of October, House staffers — who are paid on a monthly basis — are expected to miss their first paycheck.

Some have been quietly told to consider borrowing money from the U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union, which is offering a “government shutdown relief loan program” that includes a no-interest loan of up to $5,000 to be repaid in full after 90 days.

The mundane has also been disrupted. Some of the cafeterias and coffee carts that are usually open to staffers are closed. The lines to enter office buildings are long because fewer entrances are open.

The hallways leading to the offices of California’s elected officials are quiet, except for the faint sound of occasional elevator dings. Many of their doors are adorned with signs that show who they blame for the government shutdown.

“Trump and Republicans shut down the government,” reads a sign posted on the door that leads into Rep. Norma Torres’ (D-Pomona) office. “Our office is OPEN — WORKING for the American people.”

Rep. Ted Lieu, a Democrat from Torrance, posted a similar sign outside his office.

Rep. Vince Fong, a Republican who represents the Central Valley, has been traveling between Washington and his district. Two weeks into the shutdown, he met with veterans from the Central Valley Honor Flight and Kern County Honor Flight to make sure that their planned tour of the Capitol was not disrupted by the shutdown. Like Kiley’s tour with the schoolchildren, an elected member needed to be present for the tour to go on.

“His presence ensured the tour could continue as planned,” Fong’s office said.

During the tour, veterans were able to see Johnson as well, his office said.

Shutdown highlights deep divisions

California’s congressional delegation mirrors the broader stalemate in Washington, where entrenched positions have kept both parties at a negotiation impasse.

Democrats are steadfast in their position that they will not agree to a deal unless Republicans extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits expiring at the end of the year, while Republicans are accusing Democrats of failing to reopen the government for political gain.

Kiley is one of the few Republicans who has called on Johnson to negotiate with Democrats on healthcare. Kiley said he thinks there is a “a lot of room to negotiate” because there is concern on both sides of the aisle if the tax credits expire.

“If people see a massive increase in their premiums ... that’s not a good thing,” he said. “Especially in California, where the cost of living is already so high, and you’re suddenly having to pay a lot more for healthcare.”

Rep. Robert Garcia, the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, in a press event Wednesday with five other California Democrats talked about the need to fight for the healthcare credits.

Garcia, of Long Beach, said he recently visited a healthcare center in San Bernardino County that serves seniors with disabilities. He said the cuts would be “devastating” and would prompt the center to close.

“That’s why we are doing everything in our power to negotiate a deal that reopens the federal government and saves healthcare,” he said.

As the shutdown continues, many Democrats are digging their heels on the issue.

At an Oct. 3 event outside of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, for instance, Rep. Laura Friedman held a news conference with nurses and hospital staff and said she would not vote for a bill to reopen the government unless there is a deal on healthcare.

Last week, the Glendale Democrat said her position hasn’t changed.

Tabi says that they are already in “advanced discussions with partners in Southern, Central, and East Africa to identify suitable hydropower reservoirs and inland water bodies for similar floating solar installations.","JOHANNESBURG - Granville Energy, a pan-African renewable-energy company, has signed a US$1.1 billion Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Mainstream Energy Solutions Limited.

The deal will see Granville Energy develop Africa’s first 1 GW floating solar power plant at Kainji Dam, Nigeria — one of the continent’s largest and most ambitious renewable projects to date.

Under the agreement, Granville Energy will serve as developer and constructor of the project, while Mainstream Energy Solutions will act as the power off-taker, responsible for purchasing and distributing the generated electricity.

The project begins with a 100 MW pilot phase (US$110 million) and will expand to 1 GW, making it the largest floating solar facility in Sub-Saharan Africa and among the biggest globally. It aims to strengthen regional energy security, drive industrialization, and create thousands of jobs through local manufacturing of solar components.

The initiative directly supports Africa’s decarbonization targets and advances the African Union’s Agenda 2063 goals for sustainable, inclusive growth.

Floating solar technology is an alternative method of generating electricity that uses panels installed on infrastructure that is located on bodies of water like dams and reservoirs. It has the benefit of generating clean electricity through the solar panels, while the water beneath them serves to cool them. This helps to improve the efficiency of the solar panels and can even contribute to improving water quality.

Tabi T. Tabi, CEO of Granville Energy, explains why this is agreement is such a game-changer for Africa. “For Africa, this is a game-changer because it makes use of existing water infrastructure like dams and reservoirs, without competing for land that’s needed for agriculture or housing. It’s smart, space-efficient, and perfectly suited to our climate and development needs. It also helps reduce evaporation losses from the dam and improves the long-term sustainability of the water resource — so it’s a win for both energy and the environment.”

Given recent conversations about the scale of Africa's energy sector and how that can serve to improve local economies and generate jobs, Tabi has expressed a commitment to the local manufacturing of solar panels and to strengthening the African continental ecosystem.

According to him, the project represents more than electricity generation, but the opportunity to create jobs, both directly and indirectly. It also represents an opportunity for more African countries to move away from an import-model of the skills and technologies used in the African energy sector.

This is part of his and his company’s vision of a “solar value chain” across Africa. When asked about this vision, Tabi says that “The Kainji project is our blueprint for that vision. By integrating design, manufacturing, construction, and operation all within Africa, we’re proving that the full value chain can exist here. Ultimately, we want to see African countries trading clean-energy components with each other — building regional resilience and reducing dependency on imports.”

The first phase of the project, which is expected to generate up to 100 MW of clean energy, will begin once the agreement is finalised and will be looking at generating energy within the next two years. This will be the pilot phase and will provide the first wave of new jobs, skills, and more reliable energy to the people of West Africa.

Once in place, Granville will be scaling up to 1 GW generation capacity, and each phase will introduce with it a new wave of jobs and skills to the continent.

But this is just the beginning. Tabi says that they are already in “advanced discussions with partners in Southern, Central, and East Africa to identify suitable hydropower reservoirs and inland water bodies for similar floating solar installations. Our goal is to create a network of hybrid solar-hydro systems across the continent — scalable, sustainable, and led by Africans. This isn’t a one-off success story; it’s the start of Africa’s clean-energy industrialisation journey.”

Technology diversification and regional focus The composition of the sustainable fuel portfolio is set to evolve.","An influential report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) provides a detailed analysis of the global landscape for sustainable fuels.

The assessment prepared to support COP30 suggests that the utilisation of sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels could quadruple by 2035.

This growth is contingent on the complete implementation of existing and newly announced policies alongside substantial investment and innovation.

According to the IEA's analysis under the leadership of Executive Director Fatih Birol, the IEA is advocating for sustainable fuels to become a critical component of the future global energy mix.

The report examines the necessary pathways to accelerate the production and use of biofuels, biogas and hydrogen-based fuels across key sectors like transport, heavy industry and power generation.

Sustainable fuel production and policy

Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3% of the world's total energy consumption, with liquid biofuels comprising nearly 80% of this figure.

In 2024, these fuels contributed to a reduction in global oil demand by approximately 2.5 million barrels per day and decreased the reliance on imported transport fuels for some nations by 5-15%.

The report notes that ""Between 2010 and 2024, global demand for sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels doubled"".

However, the current trajectory points towards gradual progress rather than the rapid acceleration needed to meet climate targets.

The IEA presents an accelerated case scenario where planned policies are fully legislated, market barriers are dismantled and production capacity is expanded. Under these conditions, sustainable fuel use could nearly double to 13 exajoules by 2030 and increase to 28 exajoules by 2035.

The transport sector would continue to be the main source of demand, making up half of sustainable fuel consumption in 2035.

This would cover 10% of road transport demand, 15% of aviation and 35% of shipping needs.

The private sector also recognises the importance of government backing.

Alice Henry, Co-Founder and CEO of RegenRate, says: ""We need policy on our side.

""We need rules that reward farmers for doing the right thing and certification that’s fast, fair and rooted in reality"".

Cost challenges and investment needs

A major hurdle is that sustainable fuels are currently more expensive than their fossil fuel counterparts.

For instance, electrolytic hydrogen is about 3.8 times more costly and biomethanol is 3.7 times the price of conventional fuels.

Despite these higher costs, the impact on consumer prices is expected to be modest. A 15% blend of sustainable aviation fuel could raise ticket prices by 5-7% while steel produced with low-emissions hydrogen would add less than 1% to the price of an electric vehicle.

The report stresses that ""policies that address only one dimension risk leaving critical gaps,"" calling for integrated frameworks that combine long-term demand signals and support for new technologies.

To achieve this accelerated deployment, cumulative investments from 2024 to 2035 could reach US$1.5tn. This investment would also fuel job growth, with direct employment projected to almost triple to around two million jobs by 2035.

Liquid and gaseous biofuels would account for two-thirds of this increase. Data shows investment in sustainable fuels grew by 20% between 2023 and 2024, spurred by policies in the United States and Brazil for liquid biofuels and the European Union's REPowerEU Plan for biogas.

Technology diversification and regional focus

The composition of the sustainable fuel portfolio is set to evolve. While liquid and gaseous biofuels are expected to retain a two-thirds share in 2035, low-emissions hydrogen and its derivatives are projected to grow from just 1% today to one-third of total use.

This change highlights a substantial increase in funding for hydrogen-based solutions.

""With US$1.5tn in sustainable fuel investments expected through 2035 and hydrogen-based fuels accounting for nearly half, renewable methanol is positioned as a vital solution for shipping chemicals and beyond,"" explains Antonio Villaluenga, Vice President of US Project Development at Carbon Recycling International.

It is important to recognise that investment strategies will differ based on geography and resource availability. The report suggests that ""National shares, mixes and volumes would still vary widely depending on regional conditions"".

The IEA concludes that no single fuel or feedstock can satisfy global demand alone. Instead, a unified effort is required to drive progress across multiple fronts, including expanding established markets, developing new ones and commercialising emerging technologies.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/20a60b309b2e6e25407d4ef95a2ac226:8ff0d98b8b27817b39e8695b1dc6c686/graphics-for-work-61.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 06:18:22.475849

Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe.
The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors.
For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.
And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period.","Connecticut, along with the rest of New England, has long recognized that its energy future lies in cleaning up the electricity sources in its power grid.

And since the 1990s, with the start of the effort to close the “sooty six” coal and oil plants, cleaning up the air for health and climate reasons has figured equally with saving money by using free renewable sources like sun and wind.

The Trump administration has now made that a lot harder, if not impossible, to do, leaving Connecticut and the entire region with the question: Now what?

Since his first day in office, Trump has set about eliminating future development of onshore and offshore wind on federal property, which effectively means all offshore wind, a form of renewable power Trump openly despises. So far, his administration has issued stop-work orders for two northeast offshore wind installations already under construction, including one for Connecticut. Each resumed construction after about a month, losing millions of dollars in the process.

Trump has also succeeded getting a law on the books to end the widely popular and effective federal tax credits for wind, solar and energy efficiency projects. The administration also threw its weight behind keeping old and dirty coal plants operating longer than previously planned, as well as subsidizing more coal mining. And it is ramping up oil and gas drilling, all in the name of an “energy emergency” that Trump claims exists, even though the country is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.

“Singling out and disfavoring renewable resources while many other resources continue to enjoy favorable tax treatment, including fossil resources — this is not leveling the playing field. This is definitely putting a finger on the scale to disadvantage clean renewable energy resources,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She called the end of the tax credit “really challenging,” noting the state had a pipeline of projects it had hoped to bring forward, and warned that power prices would likely increase.

“We are doing what we can within our state jurisdictional programs to try to fill in some of the gaps. Obviously, we can’t fill all the gaps,” Dykes said. The state is urging residents, businesses, governmental entities and energy developers to take advantage of the tax credits before many of them disappear at the end of the year. To that end, DEEP issued an expedited request for proposals for solar and onshore wind. Proposals were due Oct. 10. Energy efficiency, especially useful to lower income and environmental justice communities, may feel the impact most acutely.

But it is offshore wind and the massive amount of carbon-free power it can generate, that Connecticut, and really the entire Northeast, had been counting on.

DEEP must sort through all of this uncertainty as it devises its new Integrated Resource Plan, a 10-year look ahead at energy needs and how to meet them, in keeping with the energy and climate policies the state has in place.

But in addition to the federal government’s energy policies, DEEP now has to reckon with the administration’s tariffs, policies on imported critical minerals, supply chain concerns and environmental about-faces. And it risks the potential for retribution if the state defies Trump’s wishes on anything, not just climate policy.

“We are undertaking planning efforts that are intended to try to assess as best we can what some of the different future scenarios will look like in terms of electricity needs, but also climate planning, and to do our best to identify the types of investments that might make sense, on what time horizon, given the change in the federal landscape, but also demand growth and reliability needs and so on,” Dykes said.

Dan Dolan is also thinking about what to do now. He’s president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade organization that represents about 95% of the generating capacity in the region.

“Where we stand right now is this muddled middle period,” he said.

Demand isn’t rising quite as fast as anticipated due to the impacts of solar and energy efficiency on the grid. But there’s also uncertainty about whether that trend will continue without tax credits and whether planned large power source additions will come online on time or at all.

“In terms of new supply sources, I am not seeing meaningful, large-scale new developments happening anytime soon in the region,” Dolan said. “If demand continues to be more muted in its growth, we can handle that.“

But he said if demand does go up significantly, despite individual state commitments to transition from fossil fuel power sources to clean and renewable ones, the region might have to look at keeping older, dirtier power sources operating for longer than planned, and that might mean spending more than a little money to upgrade them.

“I’m seeing a lot of investors watching but staying on the sidelines for the moment,” Dolan said.

Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, is co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. He has been a member of the committee since entering the legislature in 2011, so he has seen the twists, turns and growing pains as the state endeavored to create and implement its first short- and long-term strategies toward renewable energy while addressing climate change, health of citizens and high energy rates.

“We had, in our procurement planning and our capacity analysis, obviously — in conjunction with (grid operator) ISO-New England — counted on the availability of renewable energy sources to meet our needs,” he said. With the federal government now undermining those supply plans, “That is now a crisis that might have been 10 years away. It is now moving closer and closer to being an actual, impending crisis.

“We’re really low on options, but renewables were a critical part of that picture going forward.”

After many years of delay, a transmission line for hydropower from Canada — the Northeast Clean Energy Connect, NECEC — is months from completion. The power is being purchased by Massachusetts, but it provides a relief valve for the entire New England grid. Breath-holding is underway that the Trump administration will not sabotage it, given the administration’s fraught relationship with Canada as well as the blue-state northeast.

If that and the two offshore wind projects under construction off New England are finished, Dykes said, it will add about 13% of supply.

But any offshore wind beyond that, including projects approved by the Biden administration? ‘Unlikely’ would be a generous assessment of its future.

How dead is offshore wind?

Offshore wind was the big prize. At the end of the Biden administration, 11 projects had been approved nationally that would have provided the power equivalent of nearly 10 Millstone power stations and gotten the U.S. about two-thirds of the way to the Biden goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.

Today, five are under construction. A sixth, South Fork Wind off the eastern tip of Long Island, is completed and began operating about a year ago. The remaining five have been stopped either at early stages or through efforts by the Trump administration to review or outright rescind already-issued federal permits. The administration ended all new lease-area designations and permits.

Of the two under construction that faced stop-work orders, one is Revolution Wind, a joint Connecticut and Rhode Island project that is already 80% complete. While it and the other project — New York’s Empire Wind — have restarted, it’s unclear what might happen to the other three. In the case of Revolution, a legal dispute is still underway.

“I think there’s no question that East Coast states, particularly from the mid-Atlantic up, have to continue to fight for offshore wind,” said Elizabeth Klein, who served as the final Biden administration director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, the entity within the Interior Department responsible for offshore wind.

“There’s no question that what the current administration is doing is damaging to the industry and causing a great deal of harm,” she said. “The looming question is whether or not these companies who are involved will be able to essentially wait it out and invest their time and resources in parts of developing offshore wind that aren’t directly about getting permits and approvals to move forward with new projects.”

Ørsted, the company developing Revolution Wind and other projects, declined to comment on the situation. Avangrid, the company developing Vineyard Wind 1, the only other New England project under construction, did not respond to inquiries.

Klein said the Trump administration claim that it was concerned about national security issues with Revolution Wind is “specious.” She said national security is reviewed in conjunction with several departments throughout every stage of the offshore wind process, beginning with the basic identification of offshore areas that might be suitable for leasing.

“All of those things are considered throughout the process, starting with where these sales first take place,” she said. “This is arbitrary and capricious decision-making. There’s no evidence that there’s something new or unusual or that had not been considered.”

Trump himself has circulated a host of falsehoods about offshore wind — that it causes cancer and kills an outsized number of birds and whales, and that it only runs some of the time. Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe. Onshore wind is far older.

A one-year assessment of South Fork Wind by its developer, Ørsted, showed the turbines operated every month of the year. The data, which came from U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration, EIA, showed some of South Fork’s highest outputs were during the winter, when the power is needed most, due to natural gas being used for heating as well electricity. The wind power can prevent electricity price spikes.

The company also found the turbine foundations were already operating as artificial reefs that supported marine life.

The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors. And since the region doesn’t have any fossil fuel resources, even with steep up-front costs, offshore wind is likely to quickly become cost effective, given the fuel is free.

A recent analysis by Politico of EIA data showed that adding wind and solar to the electricity mix tended to lower the cost of electricity, not increase it, as the Trump administration claims. The Politico analysis said: “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data.”

“Undermining viable sources of energy is inconsistent with the objective of addressing an energy ‘emergency’ and will instead exacerbate energy supply challenges in the Northeast,” said Peter Shattuck, a director at Power Advisory LLC., a joint Canada/U.S.-based energy consultant. Shattuck also is an energy and grid expert with long experience in New England.

He said that, in something of a tarnished silver lining, the Trump blockage will give long-term projects such as transmission extra time to plan. But trying to strategize through all the Trump executive orders, other policy changes and legal battles is bound to make projects more expensive.

“It will likely raise the risk profile and risk premiums that are included in projects,” he said.

“The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated. In our view, it’s holding back a huge source of power that is so desperately needed,” said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president of communications and external affairs for the educational nonprofit Oceantic, which supports marine renewable energy world-wide including offshore wind.

“The administration talks about an all-of-the-above energy strategy and unleashing American energy dominance. We advocate that offshore wind is a critical component to that strategy.” She said energy needs to be depoliticized so the market, not the government, can pick the winners and losers.

“They’re looking to take apart an entire industry that could support energy demand in the U.S., address national security issues actually, because there is nothing better from a national security perspective on energy supply than generating it yourself at home, here in the U.S.,” Klein said.

Those concerns are not lost on the region’s grid operator, ISO-New England, which released an uncharacteristically blunt warning a couple of days after work stopped on Revolution Wind.

“The ISO is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability. Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” the statement read. “Unpredictable risks and threats to resources —regardless of technology — that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” it continued.

The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast. The ISO has already said it expects demand to begin to increase after years of flat or even declining energy needs.

“I think in the short term we still expect to be OK, but it’s kind of in that longer-term and the uncertainty that’s brought into this that’s challenging from a grid planning standpoint,” said ISO spokesman Matt Kakley.

The ISO’s most recent estimates are that region’s annual electricity consumption will increase by about 11% over the next decade. On one hand, the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles and heat pumps could shrink that demand. On the other, their removal for solar systems and energy efficiency could increase it.

In addition to the offshore wind and the NECEC transmission line, the ISO is also expecting the six New England states to move ahead with their first joint development of transmission that, after more than a decade of delay, would finally get onshore wind from northern Maine onto the southern part of the New England grid.

Kakley said six proposals from four different developers were submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Now there is the concern that the need for any federal signoffs could mean further delay, or worse.

Kakley said the ISO always deals with uncertainty when predicting power needs in the face of the complexities of long-term power and transmission projects. “This is a different sort of uncertainty than what we’ve seen,” he said. “We’re really looking at what we can do to enhance our ability to forecast and synthesize all the different factors that are coming in – adding resources, taking resources out, and seeing what that does to the region’s risk profile.”

What about solar?

Solar’s outlook is a little squishier than offshore wind’s. Yes, the coveted 30% tax credits are slated to disappear — for purchased residential systems at the end of this year and in another year for leased and commercial ones.

But costs for solar have come down dramatically over time, making it one of the cheapest forms of power to purchase. It’s also the fastest to install. So it’s possible residential consumers and commercial investors will still consider it a cost effective option.

Another unknown factor is the effect of tariffs and other restrictions on imported components on that low price and availability, as well as to storage systems that can be paired with it.

New England has never been a hotbed for huge commercial installations the way the desert southwest and other parts of the country, with large sunny expanses, can be. But rooftop solar for homeowners and on municipal and commercial buildings still has huge potential in the region and can be extremely useful to grid reliability.

It is already more useful than the ISO ever imagined it would be. The ISO says it has prevented brownouts and worse on hot summer days with air conditioning cranked up around the region. It has sent spot market prices into negative territory, especially on sunny days when neither heat nor air conditioning is needed.

“I think there’s capital out there that’s willing to invest,” said DEEP Commissioner Dykes. “I think the question is, what’s the price of solar without federal support, and with tariffs, all these other things coming into play? How does that affect the cost benefit for investment, and how much can we bring those costs down?”

Dykes has a few ideas. One is to look into swapping out solar panels in older systems for new, more efficient panels as a means to increase power output. Another is to use — in her words — already disturbed sites, such as the site of a retired oil-fired generator, for grid-scale storage for excess solar power. Using a preexisting power site would mean there’s already connections to the distribution system.

The biggest open question for Connecticut is what might change in state policy to help make up for the lost tax credit. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority will be weighing that as part of its reconsideration of the rules for the solar program it established. That reconsideration was already planned and underway, with recommendations due in March.

Another policy aspect involves what the state might do legislatively. Unlike most of its neighbors, Connecticut has kept caps on the amount of solar allowed, only loosening some of them in the last few years.

It’s also an open question whether state money would be authorized to make up some of the tax credit shortfall, or whether the state might do as Canada already does and establish an infrastructure bank to leverage private and public money into the financing pipeline, or create a Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator like California recently enacted to access low-cost public financing for such projects as a way to save money overall. The northeast-based advocacy group Acadia Center is helping the six New England states explore financing models.

“My only priority for next session is to set the stage for some extension or enhancement of our solar incentives,” said energy co-chair Steinberg. “This is very important to me as the godfather of solar, as Katie Dykes once called me, and that will be very hard.

“Everybody says it’s over; federal government has killed solar, game over, there’s nothing Connecticut can do. I cannot accept that,” he said. “Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us. To abandon it and not offer any incentives, or to backtrack to the point where the incentives don’t stimulate actual implementation — shame on us.”

But there are other ways to indirectly reduce costs for solar; specifically by streamling permitting, the regulatory process and siting – soft costs, as they are sometimes called.

Massachusetts is already doing that.

“We’re going to have to throw everything we can at permitting, streamlining and reducing soft costs in order to support the affordability of more solar investment for grid-scale projects,” Dykes said.

Kat Burnham, senior principal at the consulting and policy group Advanced Energy United and the state lead for all three southern New England states, said Connecticut and other states need to step up and put some financial skin as well as policy in the game. She pointed to financial tools like the Green Bank.

“I think what’s important is to make sure that we’re looking at a range of different options and trying to find the right one that fits the particular need or situation,” she said. “What are the tools in our kit, and how do we use those so that we minimize our risk?”

She said there’s a cost to building things. And she said there’s “a cost to inaction … We can’t just sit on our hands and hope for the best.”

DEEP is also in the final throes of accepting bids for innovative energy efficiency and energy upgrade proposals designed to help lower energy bills.

In Massachusetts, for instance, all three major utilities — one of which is Eversource — have agreed to discount electric rates in the winter for people who use heat pumps. While they run on electricity, aside from being efficient, they free up other fuels like natural gas to run power plants. In Connecticut, DEEP is continuing with its focus of lowering the upfront installation costs for heat pumps.

Solutions

Barbara Kates-Garnick, a former Massachusetts energy official, now a professor of practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said the path forward she sees is bringing together utilities, regulators, policy makers, other stakeholders and system participants to explore some of the out-of-the-box solutions.

“The answers aren’t clear, but I think we have to look at how we regulate, what we regulate, and come to some conversations with the utilities so that we come to a bigger grand bargain,” she said.

She noted, however, the Biden idea of promoting clean energy by providing incentives, funding and jobs — especially in red states — “when push comes to shove, it didn’t work.”

Dykes is not ruling out increasing fossil fuel-run power as part of Connecticut’s solution to the Trump anti-renewables effort.

“It’s a possibility,” she said, noting that Lamont has talked about the need to be open to natural gas as part of a solution.

If the offshore wind and other projects do not come online, she said, “that will certainly put us into a very challenging place in terms of having an adequate reserve margin and ability to maintain reliability even under some normal weather conditions.

“In light of that, we have to consider what are the alternatives that make the most sense to ensure we can continue to have an affordable, reliable grid in the early 2030s, and natural gas is part of that. Retaining those oil units — is that a solution that we’ll have to rely on?” Dykes said.

Dolan of the Power Generators Association, while also advocating continued use of the region’s gas and oil fleet, doesn’t have specific facilities he’d like to see targeted for reinvestment.

“I think there needs to be a refocus around the meat and potatoes about what is operating today and making sure it continues to operate tomorrow. Now the replacement energy supplies are not coming or not coming anytime soon, and for these power plants to be able to continue operating and operating at higher capacity, reinvestment is going to be necessary,” Dolan said, taking a thinly-veiled swipe at Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which all plan to have net-zero grids in the next 20 to 25 years.

For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.

“The industry is going to weather this administration. Who knows what the next will bring,” she said. “But I think it won’t be the orderly advancement that it once could have been.”

Former BOEM Director Klein said she thinks it’s important for states to keep supporting the offshore wind projects that are underway.

“It’ll demonstrate to the project developers that there are important entities in the U.S. that are still supportive and want to find a path forward,” she said. “Folks aren’t building this for kicks, because it’s fun. This is about actual energy supply needs … and actually communities, when presented with alternatives, are likely to see that offshore wind is the best of the bunch.”

In the meantime, some of the wind focus may shift to Canada, where the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador are exploring the development of huge amounts of offshore and onshore wind. Whether New England will be able to access some of that is years and likely many diplomatic twists away.

The Trump administration’s pivot away from wind and solar in particular and back toward fossil fuels is already taking the U.S. globally out of step. Recent data from the European clean energy think tank, data and policy tracker Ember showed that worldwide, in the first six months of 2025, renewables overtook coal power for the first time. And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period. But while fossil fuel generation and its emissions dropped in China and India, the world’s most populated countries, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased in the U.S. Clean generation growth did not keep pace with demand growth in the U.S.

“For a bunch of largely economic reasons, we do still think that solar and wind are going to out-compete fossil fuels,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, though she admitted the Trump actions are slowing down their adoption.

But she wondered whether the industry would be able to pivot enough in the face of multiple challenges to keep investors confident enough to continue.

“That, I guess, is the big question mark,” she said.

Dykes sees the same challenge.

“Investors need to know that after a multiyear permitting process, when you have a project that’s 80% constructed, that you can bring it online, sell your power and get your money back,” she said. “And if we can’t guarantee that in the Northeast or in the U.S. anymore, I think that affects the investment climate for all types of resources at a time when we can least afford to increase investor perception of risk.”

The energy committee’s Steinberg added a warning. “That’s an excuse to be paralyzed. That’s an excuse to basically throw up our hands and say, ‘we just have to wait out the feds,’” he said. “That’s going to mean that the ramping up stage is going to be even more complicated on the other side, assuming there is another side.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wind-Turbine-Towers.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 06:02:08.463693

With support from industry giants like Meta, Nucor and Toyota Tsusho America, the company sets out to prove that clean iron can be scaled to meet demand from sectors such as automotive and data centre construction.

A lower-carbon path for data centre steel

As digital infrastructure continues to grow globally, data centres consume ever larger volumes of steel, a material responsible for around 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from coal-fuelled blast furnaces.

Electra proposes a cleaner route. Instead of using heat and coal, the company’s process, known as electrowinning, uses electricity from renewable sources to extract iron from ore.

This electrochemical method operates at a temperature roughly equal to that of a cup of coffee, avoiding the high heat and fossil fuels that drive emissions in conventional steelmaking.

The company plans to open a 130,000-square-foot demonstration plant in Jefferson County, Colorado, by mid-2026.

The facility will have the capacity to produce up to 500 metric tonnes of iron each year. Funding includes US$50m from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, US$186m in private investment and an US$8m tax credit through the Colorado Energy Office.

“We started Electra to fundamentally reinvent the way the world makes iron and tackle one of the biggest sources of industrial emissions, but we’ve always known we could not do it alone,” says Sandeep Nijhawan, Co-Founder and CEO of Electra.

Toyota Tsusho America, a trading company connected to the Toyota Group, will distribute the clean iron to steelmakers serving the automotive industry. Germany’s Interfer Edelstahl Group plans to use it in its speciality steel manufacturing.

Meta, meanwhile, approaches the partnership differently. Rather than buying the iron directly, the technology firm signs an agreement to acquire environmental attribute certificates from Electra. These certificates allow Meta to account for the emissions reductions from clean iron production in its sustainability reporting.

“Meta is excited to partner with Electra to drive the development of low-carbon iron and steel – essential materials for building data centres – manufactured right here in the US,” writes Devon Lake, Head of Net Zero Strategy at Meta.

This ability to use lower-quality ores that are typically uneconomical adds flexibility to the supply chain. It also enables the process to align with renewable energy availability, making it suitable for companies like Meta that operate on intermittent clean power.

Electra sources 100% of its electricity from renewable energy for its Boulder pilot facilities and plans to do the same for the new Jefferson County plant.

Founded in 2020 by Sandeep Nijhawan and Quoc Pham, Electra already runs two pilot sites and is now looking for a location for its first commercial-scale manufacturing plant, which it aims to bring online by 2029.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/247299b0eb8460ed7690c037395679b6:33b4c084c7fceaf657aa0c1ef39dc399/electra-electroplating-two-men-in-factory.webp.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 06:18:26.024938

That happens because this data is being transmitted through and from data centers.” Cloud computing took off, driving the demand for more expansive data centers.
That brings us to today, which analysts say is still the early stages of AI data center development.
Virginia’s transformation into the data center capital of the world could be regarded as a business success story when measured by the dollars invested.","ASHBURN, Va.—Driving up the six-lane Route 28 in Loudoun County, Virginia, there’s a dark blue one on the left. Further up the way in a small clearing of trees, there’s a gray one on the right. Across the landscape, metal cables criss-cross in every direction to connect power to the sprawling buildings.

They’re not big-box stores like Ikea or Target. They’re bigger. They’re data centers that house the computers processing the internet and artificial intelligence. And they’re all over these suburban counties outside of Washington, D.C.

Virginia, especially Northern Virginia, leads the world in development, far outpacing other top markets such as Beijing.

So how did it happen that this region came to dominate data centers, an industry whose growth now fuels debates about electricity bills, climate change and the role of technology in our lives? The answer is a combination of government support, the presence of infrastructure used by internet pioneers such as America Online, cheap electricity and the availability of land.

“There was all that land next to Dulles airport that was unused, and so it was cheap, available and large enough, and getting a major internet connection was easy,” said Shane Greenstein, a professor at Harvard Business School who has written about the economic geography of data centers.

Considering those factors, it’s “really not a surprise” that Virginia took the lead and maintained it, he said.

Now, with the rise of AI, the size of some recent and planned data centers exceeds even what could have been imagined a few years ago. The region and the state remain attractive locations for many of the same reasons that explained previous growth, but this is a new era in which rapid development is happening across the country.

For example, Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix have emerged as data center boom towns, although Virginia’s current infrastructure and slate of future projects are deep enough that no city or region will overtake it any time soon.

The state had 6,247 megawatts of data centers and 2,610 megawatts under construction as of June, according to a report from the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. Together, those 8,857 megawatts are nearly triple the operating and under-construction capacity of the next market, Columbus.

But the most striking figure for Virginia in the report is the 24,103 megawatts for planned data center capacity.

No market in the world comes anywhere close to this.

Behind those big numbers is a small one. Data centers don’t need many employees, and they had just 12,140 operational jobs in Virginia in 2023, according to figures from the Northern Virginia Technology Council, a trade group. For context, that’s slightly less than the number of school bus drivers in the state that year. If we zoom out to include all jobs that have direct or indirect ties to data centers in the state, the number rose to 78,140, including operations, construction and other roles.

Environmental advocates have argued that the costs of this development far exceed the benefits. The downsides are local, including vanishing farmland, and national, with electricity demand rising at a pace that is incompatible with the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Chris Miller, president of the Piedmont Environmental Council, points to a 2.2-million-square-foot proposal that would’ve needed 800 megawatts in Remington, Virginia, a rural town of about 600 people located just south of Loudoun County. The developers withdrew their pitch and expect to submit plans for a smaller data center less than half that size. But the initial proposal would’ve gobbled up nearly as much power as a rural state.

“There’s a lot of ways you can produce a gigawatt but at the end of the day, the impacts start to add up because of the scale of the amount of power that is,” Miller said. “The only way I can help people wrap their heads around how big it is, is that’s almost the entire peak load of the state of Vermont.”

Paving the Information Super Highway

The scale of this industry, measured in dollars, acres and gigawatts, has grown at a staggering pace. It’s unrecognizable when compared to its early days.

Virginia was well-positioned to be a hub for the early internet because of its proximity to the federal government in Washington, D.C., and the research institution now known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the 1960s, the agency led a project to develop ARPANET, a computer network that was a building block for the internet.

Various businesses with ties to the early internet were located in the D.C. area, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that one of them, America Online, broke through to become a giant. The company was based in Fairfax County and then moved a short distance to Loudoun County in 1996, helping to transform a mostly rural area.

A 1997 Time magazine cover demonstrates the prominence of America Online, with its chairman, Steve Case, smirking in a photo illustration with data cables attached to his body. The cover line was: “AOL’s Big Coup,” about the company’s recent purchase of CompuServe and its attempts to fend off competition from Microsoft.

America Online’s presence in Loudoun County attracted other internet businesses and contributed to investment in fiber-optic cables, enabling the easy movement of data.

In 1998, a start-up called Equinix built a data center in Northern Virginia to serve America Online and other companies. It was a novel concept, a building that would store data for other companies. The facility was likely the region’s first data center and Equinix remains a major player in its industry.

Following the dot-com bust in 2000 and the rise of internet activity, like shopping from a couch, Loudoun County began marketing vacant buildings, including some vacated because of the decline of America Online. The buyers included some of the first-generation internet giants, such as Amazon, which opened its first data center in the region in 2006.

Much of this activity was to support cloud computing.

“The world’s changed,” said Buddy Rizer, a Loudoun County economic development official, in a video posted in 2012. “Everyone wants whatever information they have right now from wherever they are and the only way you can do that is to store it in the cloud. Cloud computing is one of those terms that everybody seems so excited by or mystified by. It’s really pretty simple: All of your information is available to you anywhere, at any time. That happens because this data is being transmitted through and from data centers.”

Cloud computing took off, driving the demand for more expansive data centers.

Dominion Energy, Virginia’s biggest electric utility, played a role in attracting this new development by offering competitive electricity prices to big power users, which were lower than those in many competing markets.

In 2008, Virginia lawmakers approved legislation that established the state’s sales and use tax exemption on certain data center equipment. Companies that invested at least $75 million in a locality with an unemployment rate above 4.9 percent were eligible. This provided a financial incentive for companies to invest in the state and was one of several state and local government actions that helped to accelerate development.

Two years later, Microsoft announced a $500 million center in the bill’s sponsor district in Southside near the North Carolina border.

The projects that followed required more space than before, reflecting the rising demand for cloud computing and other data storage. Amazon, Facebook and Google spent billions of dollars to build data centers in Northern Virginia and elsewhere in the state.

Amazon’s investment was notable for its level of commitment, including an announcement in 2018 that it would spend $2.5 billion on a second headquarters in Arlington, a Northern Virginia city, to go along with its main headquarters in Seattle. The company followed it up with $35 billion in spending for data centers across the state.

The trend had become clear, with these gigantic boxes visible from main roads.

Regulatory filings show how this industry grew into a gigantic electricity consumer. In 29024, Virginia data centers served by Dominion had demand of 3,583 megawatts, which is nearly seven times more than in 2013.

The utility has said that data centers are the main reason it is projecting a drastic increase in demand to serve all of its Virginia customers, rising from 17,300 megawatts last year to 26,600 megawatts by 2039.

The scale of this growth is largely because of the emergence in the early 2020s of a new kind of data center that runs the computer models for artificial intelligence. Most new AI data centers are larger than those used for cloud computing and require much more electricity.

That brings us to today, which analysts say is still the early stages of AI data center development. The factors that helped Virginia secure its initial foothold have contributed to forecasts of its sustained momentum.

Was This Worth It?

Virginia’s transformation into the data center capital of the world could be regarded as a business success story when measured by the dollars invested.

Loudoun County officials point to data centers providing $1 billion in annual local tax revenue, funding about one-third of the county’s budget. Elected leaders have lowered the residential tax rate by 48 cents per $100 since 2012, saving the average Loudoun homeowner $3,000 to $4,000 per year.

But the state has reached a point where it’s a mainstream viewpoint to question whether the benefits of this development boom are enough to justify the costs of lost land, increased water consumption for cooling, rising carbon emissions, worsening climate disasters and the potential for surging electricity bills.

“The world’s largest data center market is facing increasing pushback from multiple directions,” according to the development report from Cushman & Wakefield.

Some of the most intense resistance is in Loudoun County, which has taken steps to increase regulatory scrutiny of new projects and give the public more opportunities to voice concerns about proposals. Development has become a campaign issue in local elections.

“People are overwhelmingly unhappy” about the pace of development and changes to the landscape, said Nan McCarry, who was born and raised in Loudoun County. She is now a volunteer for conservation organizations.

She remembers Ashburn as a tiny village when she was a child in the 1960s and has watched it transform into a magnet for property developers because of its proximity to Washington. She lives in western Loudoun County, which retains much of its rural charm, but also views the area as threatened by the encroachment of home construction and data centers.

One of the most ardent critics of the data center boom has been the Piedmont Environmental Council, an advocacy group for Virginia’s Piedmont region, which runs down the center of the state and includes Loudoun County.

Miller, the council’s president, acknowledges that data centers have helped the region in some ways.

“Loudoun County has benefited dramatically, no question,” he said. “What they’ve been able to do is pay for a lot of schools, and a lot of public services,” Miller said.

But he thinks the downsides could outweigh the benefits, especially when planning for continued development.

The downsides include increased electricity rates. Virginia’s utility regulator, the State Corporation Commission, is reviewing Dominion’s request to increase the typical household bill by about $21 per month by 2027 because of grid upgrades, inflation and supply chain issues, a 15 percent increase.

To meet this demand, Dominion is proposing a substantial ramp-up in power plant construction with solar and natural gas as its primary energy sources.

Another concern is damage to ecosystems and the rapid loss of rural land.

The state’s Joint Legislative and Audit Review Commission, a policy research arm of the legislature, studied the economic and environmental impacts of data centers. The report suggested that the industry could cause energy demands in Virginia to triple, while adding “74,000 jobs, $5.5 billion in labor income, and $9.1 billion in GDP to Virginia’s economy annually.”

But it stopped short of a forecast of land and water needs and potential air-quality impacts, Miller noted.

“We’re very worried,” Miller said of the lack of information about potential adverse effects. “It’s not that we can’t do a better job. It’s that we’re not even taking the first steps in that direction. … What I often say is, you gotta own the fact that you’re really having a transformational impact. Let’s do a full cost evaluation and make sure that the net benefit is what you think it is.”

The dilemma for Virginia is that becoming the data center capital of the world has come with inevitable consequences, such as environmental impacts, and still-undefined risks, including questions about whether these big boxes along the road make business sense.

The concentration of data centers resurfaced as a concern last week when Amazon Web Services outages disrupted services for a number of companies across the internet. The issue stemmed from Amazon’s data centers in its “US-EAST-1” zone, based in Northern Virginia.

“We urgently need diversification in cloud computing,” Corinne Cath-Speth, head of digital for Article 19, a free speech advocacy group, said in a statement.

Greenstein, the Harvard professor, said any discussion of the pluses and minuses of data centers needs to acknowledge that they are essentially self-operating. So while Virginia may be the national leader in data centers, the number of jobs is small compared to the enormity of land use and power use.

“My standing joke about data centers is they’re a very big building with a very small parking lot,” he said. “They just don’t employ a lot of people relative to their scale of size.”

So data centers can fill the landscape without having nearly as significant an effect on the number of customers at local restaurants or other benefits that usually come with business investment.

Greenstein also has questions about the viability of the gigantic new data centers cropping up around the country. This aligns with broader concerns among analysts about whether there is an AI investment bubble in which companies will be unable to make enough money to justify their costs and that current technologies may have short shelf lives.

“In 10 years, will we look back on this as foolish, because the output from these things arguably have limited lifespans?” Greenstein asked.

He doesn’t know the answer. Virginia may find out the hard way.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1247123383-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 06:02:33.961974

From lobbying Congress for liability protection to suing states over their climate liability laws and lawsuits, attempts to shield Big Oil from potential liability and to shut down climate accountability initiatives are advancing on multiple fronts.

“The effort has escalated dramatically in the past six or seven months,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, an organization that advocates for holding fossil fuel companies accountable for selling products they knew were dangerously warming the planet.

Pushback to liability initiatives from fossil fuel interests is not new. But the political landscape has shifted dramatically this year as the second Trump administration works to reward loyalists and campaign donors, including fossil fuel interests.

The oil and gas industry spent $445 million during the last election cycle to influence President Donald Trump and Congress, including $96 million on Trump’s re-election campaign, according to the progressive advocacy group Climate Power.

“What has changed is that there is a new administration,” said Lisa Graves, founder and executive director of True North Research, a national investigative watchdog group. And the Trump administration, she said, “is continuing to defend the fossil fuel industry and assail anyone who dares try to hold them accountable.”

Over the past eight years, communities across the country have filed tobacco-style lawsuits targeting ExxonMobil and major players in the fossil fuel industry, seeking to recover damages for localized climate impacts or to force companies to cease greenwashing and other misleading behavior.

More than 30 of these lawsuits brought by municipal, tribal and state governments are working their way through the courts, and several are now closer than ever to reaching trial.

At the same time, some states are enacting or considering so-called climate superfund legislation that would hold large fossil fuel companies strictly liable for climate damages and require them to help pay for a portion of climate change costs incurred by state governments. Vermont and New York both passed climate superfund laws last year, and similar legislation is pending in a handful of other states.

In response to these budding accountability efforts, the fossil fuel industry, the Trump administration, Republicans in Congress and GOP attorneys general are mounting what Wiles describes as a “massive orchestrated campaign” to try to stop climate liability laws and lawsuits in their tracks, and to push for legal immunity akin to what gun manufacturers received two decades ago. Trump’s Department of Justice has even filed highly unusual, if not unprecedented, lawsuits against Vermont and New York seeking to overturn their climate superfund statutes.

“It’s just this superbly choreographed effort on the part of the oil industry and its allies to get gun-industry-style legal immunity for all the damage that they’ve caused,” Wiles told Inside Climate News.

Oil Industry Is Lobbying Congress for a Liability Shield

Among the climate liability lawsuits inching closer to trial: a consumer protection case brought by Massachusetts against ExxonMobil, and suits seeking damages filed by Honolulu, Hawaii, and Boulder, Colorado.

As reported by The Wall Street Journal earlier this year and confirmed by The New York Times last month, industry representatives are lobbying Congress for a liability shield of some kind.

The details remain unclear. But the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, reports lobbying on “draft legislation related to state efforts to impose liability on the oil and gas industry,” while disclosures from ConocoPhillips show that the company has lobbied on the matter of “state superfund legislation,” including draft legislation in Congress addressing it.

Neither API nor ConocoPhillips responded to requests for comment.

Pat Parenteau, emeritus professor of law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, told Inside Climate News that he thinks immunity provisions for the fossil fuel industry are unlikely to pass the Senate.

But the fact that the fossil fuel industry is lobbying for legal protections suggests to Wiles that the industry realizes it could be facing serious legal jeopardy. “Let’s be clear. You don’t seek a [liability] waiver unless you know you’re guilty,” Wiles said.

Over the summer, language emerged in a draft House Appropriations Committee spending bill that specifically would prohibit the District of Columbia from using funds to enforce its consumer protection law “against oil and gas companies for environmental claims.” The bill that included this provision passed the committee but was not brought to the full House for a vote.

But climate accountability advocates say the provision was still alarming because it effectively would have shut down D.C.’s ongoing consumer protection lawsuit against Big Oil. That suit, filed in 2020, alleges that several major oil companies lied to consumers about the climate risks of their products and that they continue to mislead consumers through greenwashing campaigns. In April the D.C. Superior Court rejected the companies’ motions to dismiss the suit.

Anne Havemann, deputy director and general counsel at Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said the appropriations provision “is a threat to this ongoing lawsuit.”

“If [D.C.] can’t use any money to prosecute these cases and advance these cases, then it effectively can’t work on them,” she said.

Big Oil Lawyers Seek Supreme Court Intervention

A parallel effort to skirt accountability is playing out in the courts. Fossil fuel companies are vigorously defending themselves in climate liability lawsuits, and they have seen some success in recent months getting cases dismissed by state trial courts.

Now Boulder’s lawsuit is back before the nation’s highest court on a fresh petition from the oil company defendants, after Colorado courts, including the state Supreme Court, refused to dismiss the case. The question posed by the companies in their petition is whether federal law precludes such state law claims.

It is unclear whether the Supreme Court will take up the case this time.

In January the Supreme Court denied a similar petition from oil companies in a case brought by Honolulu. Courts in Hawaii have rejected the companies’ bids to have the case dismissed, and with the Supreme Court declining to intervene, Honolulu’s case is advancing toward a trial.

Parenteau said the prospect of facing a trial and a potential adverse verdict likely has the oil companies extremely worried. “They’re certainly frightened of a trial just from a reputational standpoint,” he said.

The new petition in the Boulder case now offers the Supreme Court another opportunity to step in. Should the justices decide to intervene, legal experts say that it could essentially shut down all climate liability attempts.

“If they do step in, that’s huge. That changes everything,” Parenteau said. “That is the end game.”

“In one fell swoop it could get rid of all of these cases,” said James May, a law professor at Washburn University.

On Oct. 9, over 100 Republican House members submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court backing oil companies ExxonMobil and Suncor in their petition to block Boulder’s lawsuit from moving forward. It is the first time that Republicans in Congress have called on the Supreme Court to intervene in this litigation and to shut down not just this one lawsuit but all others like it.

“In recent years, multiple state and local governments have launched a courtroom war against the American energy industry,” the brief asserts in its opening. “It must stop now.”

The 103 Republican House members who signed onto the brief argue that the municipal and state lawsuits against oil and gas companies are trying to “dictate national energy policy” and that only the federal government has the authority to regulate transboundary greenhouse gas emissions.

“They are arguing that it’s solely EPA’s role to regulate greenhouse gases, but the Trump administration is attempting to eliminate that role by revoking the Endangerment Finding. If that revocation goes through and survives in the courts, it will greatly weaken the oil companies’ preemption defense,” Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told Inside Climate News.

“This full-court press to block these lawsuits shows that the oil companies and their allies in Congress are really nervous about what would come out if any of these cases actually went to trial,” Gerrard added.

Trump Administration on the Offensive

The Trump administration, through its Department of Justice, is fully backing the fossil fuel industry in climate liability litigation, filing amicus briefs, for example, in cases now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court and the Maryland Supreme Court.

But its efforts to shield the industry from accountability extend beyond friend-of-the-court briefs.

Following a White House meeting where oil company executives raised concerns about state climate laws and lawsuits, Trump issued an executive order in April directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to try to put a stop to these legal initiatives.

In response, the DOJ then sued four states, including preemptive suits brought against Hawaii and Michigan before either state had filed such a lawsuit (Hawaii sued major oil companies the next day). The DOJ’s other lawsuits targeted Vermont and New York to try to strike down their climate superfund laws, which are based on the “polluter pays” logic of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program aimed at forcing polluting companies to remediate damage from toxic waste sites.

Advances in a field known as climate attribution science have made the “polluter pays” aspect of the superfund laws possible, enabling scientists to quantify the individual contributions of major fossil fuel producers to climate impacts such as sea level rise and heat waves.

The DOJ has now filed motions for summary judgment in both of these lawsuits, asking federal courts to permanently block the states’ climate superfund laws.

“Vermont’s flagrantly unconstitutional statute threatens to throttle energy production, despite this Administration’s efforts to unleash American energy. It’s high time for the courts to put a stop to this crippling state overreach,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said in a statement issued by the DOJ on Sept. 16.

Havemann, with the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, told Inside Climate News that the current Trump administration seems to be taking a more aggressive approach to protecting the fossil fuel industry and to fighting attempts to hold it accountable.

“The Trump administration has come in and used many different tools in its toolbox to go after these accountability lawsuits and the laws that also seek to hold the biggest polluters accountable for climate damages,” she said. “It’s very much on the radar of the Trump administration in a way that it has not been in the past.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Enter the Dragon”

With U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) holding the gavel, climate litigation came up as the subject of a Republican-led congressional hearing this summer before a Judiciary Committee subcommittee.

The hearing’s provocative title: “Enter the Dragon—China and the Left’s Lawfare Against American Energy Dominance.”

Cruz used the hearing to attack climate liability lawsuits and claim that they are a nefarious left-wing plot that is in part funded by, and that benefits, the Chinese Communist Party. “Both China and the Democrats want to bankrupt the American energy industry,” Cruz said during the hearing.

NPR’s Michael Copley reported last month that “Cruz’s office has not offered evidence that China or a China-linked nonprofit that Cruz identified by name has funded climate lawsuits in the United States.”

In response to that reporting, Cruz told Inside Climate News that “NPR deliberately ignored objective facts.”

“The Chinese Communist Party uses cut-outs and ‘nonprofits’ to shape U.S. energy policy, funding propaganda, advocacy, and litigation that harm American workers,” Cruz said in an emailed statement, which was also included in the NPR story after it was published. The “China-linked nonprofit” referenced in the NPR story, Energy Foundation China, does fund some climate initiatives, Cruz said in his statement.

“In January 2024, three House committee chairs opened an investigation into Chinese influence, citing EFC’s ties and funding of groups like [the Natural Resources Defense Council] and RMI,” he added.

A spokesperson for RMI, a nonprofit group working on the global energy transition, said that the organization “does not participate in litigation.” RMI’s “work supported by Energy Foundation China, which is a U.S. based charitable organization, is focused squarely on the energy transition inside of China,” the spokesperson added.

The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a nonprofit group that works to protect public health and the environment, does some “work in China for one reason: there’s not a single global environmental problem that can be fixed unless China is part of the solution,” NRDC spokesperson Josh Mogerman said. He added that the organization “does not fundraise in China” and that “money from China does not fund NRDC litigation in the United States, period.”

Cruz, who represents the country’s biggest oil and gas producing state, did not respond to Inside Climate News’ question about whether he supports immunizing oil companies from liability.

GOP Attorneys General Enter the Fray

During the Cruz-led hearing, the Republican attorney general for the state of Kansas, Kris Kobach, testified as one of the majority witnesses. He referenced the New York and Vermont climate superfund laws, claiming these statutes impose extraterritorial regulation on energy companies, and mentioned that his state and other Republican-led states are suing to try to overturn these state laws.

“We will continue these fights in court as state attorneys general. But we do need some help from Congress,” Kobach said. He suggested that Congress could legislate to expressly preempt state climate laws like the climate superfund laws.

Kobach and 15 other Republican state attorneys general also made this suggestion, along with several other recommendations for congressional action, in a letter addressed to Bondi, the U.S. attorney general.

The June 12 letter references Trump’s executive orders to “unleash” fossil fuels and protect the fossil fuel industry from “state overreach.” The letter says its purpose is to “suggest additional steps” the Department of Justice could take to effectuate these orders and assist in the “fight against anti-energy interests.”

Specifically, the Republican AGs suggest the DOJ could recommend legislation to reinforce federal preemption of state climate liability laws or lawsuits; restrict federal funding for states seeking to impose liability on energy companies; create a right of removal to federal district court for climate suits; and, among other items, stop “activist-funded climate lawsuits” with a liability shield, similar to the law that granted immunity for gun manufacturers.

Wiles, with the Center for Climate Integrity, said it is especially striking to see Republican attorneys general explicitly recommend a similar liability shield for fossil fuel companies. “The attorneys general actually called for Congress to enact a gun-style liability waiver for the oil industry,” he said. “We saw how that [gun industry immunity] ended up. It certainly was not helpful in curbing gun violence or in serving any public interest objective.”

The coordinated litigation strategies and actions of Republican state attorneys general in defense of fossil fuel and other industries stem from an organization called the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), which Graves said was created in the wake of the tobacco industry being held accountable through the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement.

The organization, which currently lists 29 Republican state attorneys general as members, has been funded through donations from conservative judicial activists like Leonard Leo as well as from corporate interests including those in the fossil fuel industry. The American Petroleum Institute gave over $125,000 to RAGA in 2024, and in the first six months of this year Chevron’s Policy, Government and Public Affairs division donated $25,000 to the organization, for example.

Graves describes RAGA as a “pay-to-play organization.”

“It has a pay sheet listing what kind of access you get to attorneys general based on how much you give,” she told Inside Climate News.

“These attorneys general use the prestige of their office and their power and the resources that their taxpayers are providing to serve the interests of industry, select industries that they are most tied to, and that certainly includes the fossil fuel industry,” Graves added.

The Republican Attorneys General Association did not respond to a request for comment.

“A Perilous Moment”

The intensifying backlash to climate accountability efforts coming from the fossil fuel industry and its political defenders is happening at a time when some political scholars warn that the U.S. is sliding into some form of authoritarianism, which advocates say magnifies the challenges of holding powerful interests to account writ large.

“It’s a perilous moment for democratic norms and institutions,” said Kathy Mulvey, accountability campaign director for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“Anybody who is pursuing policy change or litigation for accountability or enforcement is counting on the courts to be a real backstop for democratic institutions,” Mulvey told Inside Climate News.

Should the fossil fuel industry somehow succeed in securing legal immunity, Wiles said it “would be consistent with the erosion of the rule of law that we’re seeing.”

GOP gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli is right to call out the political establishment for closing plants and blocking new ones. Regardless of who wins the state’s governor election, the issue of rising energy costs won’t disappear — and this problem is not confined to the Garden State either.

BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUILD THE AI BOOM

California offers an even clearer cautionary tale. State leaders waged war on traditional energy, shutting down nuclear plants, choking off natural gas projects, and driving out refineries with red tape. The result? Californians now pay the second-highest electricity rates in the nation, just behind Hawaii — a direct consequence of letting ideology trump common sense.

These decisions have failed ratepayers. Everyone knows power demand is growing faster than supply. Forty years ago, households mainly powered lights, TVs, and refrigerators. Today, that same grid must handle smartphones, laptops, routers, security systems, electric cars, and a flood of AI-driven data centers that will multiply electricity demand exponentially. Yet, our leaders have allowed coal plants to close, nuclear facilities to be dismantled, and new pipelines to be blocked — even as the country’s appetite for power explodes.

The Southeast, however, has made better decisions. Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, Louisiana, and Alabama are proving that reliable, affordable, and abundant energy is still possible in America.

Mississippi has just broken ground on the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station — the state’s first new natural gas plant in 50 years — set to become operational in 2028. Gov. Tate Reeves (R-MS) is also charting the course toward the next generation of nuclear power because he understands that nuclear power is among the safest and most efficient sources of power in the world.

Florida, which has four commercial reactors in operation today, is building new gas-fired generation and looking ahead to small modular reactors to accommodate its increased population base and business. Georgia has gone a step further by adding a new nuclear unit in the past year — the first in a generation — and will do it again. That’s leadership.

This forward-looking approach is already paying dividends. By ensuring reliable power, Southeastern states are attracting new manufacturing, data centers, and high-tech investment that blue states can only dream of securing. A single hyperscale data center can generate hundreds of millions in annual economic activity and support thousands of local jobs. Georgia’s own study found that one new facility alone would generate $431 million in yearly output and nearly 2,000 jobs. It’s no wonder AVAIO Digital, a data center developer, just announced a $6 billion data center investment in Mississippi — because the state can actually power it.

These massive new industries need consistent baseload power that renewable energy alone can’t yet provide. They need real, dependable energy. To do so, they need to save current power plants, constructing new natural gas infrastructure, hastening new nuclear projects, and investing in a robust transmission network. States that act decisively to build capacity will win the jobs, the investment, and the future. Those that don’t will face decreased reliability and economic decline.

ENERGY ABUNDANCE, NOT NET ZERO, WILL LOWER ELECTRICITY PRICES

New Jersey and California show what happens when states ignore capacity constraints, while Mississippi and Georgia demonstrate the benefits of planning ahead. States that expand their generation capacity will attract investment, while states that block new projects will continue to see rising costs and slower growth.

Nevertheless, thanks to conservative leadership in the Southeast, America still has a region ready to power its future and remind the rest of the country what real energy leadership looks like. Now it’s time for the rest of the country to follow suit.

In a special meeting during the summit, 37 mountain town leaders signed a joint statement committing to working together to reduce emissions, transition to clean energy, and protect their communities’ natural environments that are on the front lines of climate change.
The joint statement emphasizes speed as a critical piece of climate action in order to combat the growing risks.
By sharing strategies, expertise, and data, the 37 leaders who signed the statement aim to ensure every community has the resources they need.
According to Berman, solving climate issues boils down to electrifying everything and ensuring that power comes from clean energy.","The Mountain Towns 2030 Climate Summit in Breckenridge this month saw Basalt Town Council Member and Aspen One Senior Sustainability and Philanthropy Manager Hannah Berman join Aspen Mayor Pro Tem John Doyle, Pitkin County Commissioner Francie Jacober, and 34 other elected leaders from mountain communities across the country to pledge to work together in the face of climate change.

Founded in 2019, the summit supports mountain, ski resort, and rural communities moving toward collective net-zero carbon emissions through collaboration, shared resources, and measurable action. The Oct. 8 summit hosted more than 600 leaders from 61 mountain communities and 37 ski resorts.

In a special meeting during the summit, 37 mountain town leaders signed a joint statement committing to working together to reduce emissions, transition to clean energy, and protect their communities’ natural environments that are on the front lines of climate change.

“Aspen has lost one month of winter since 1980 due to climate change — that’s a month hit to the sport that anchors our local economy and our way of life,” Berman told The Aspen Times in an email. “It’s also a financial issue because increasing wildfire risk has jacked up our home insurance premiums, not to mention the multi-million dollar cost of fighting wildfires.”

She remembered the 2018 Lake Christine Fire in Basalt that burned three homes, which included the home of a volunteer firefighter who was fighting the fire.

“Frankly, it’s not fair that our communities must shoulder the costs and impacts of increased wildfires and more erratic weather when the fossil fuel industry is responsible for causing that damage,” she said. “If a company dumped toxic waste into a river, they’d have to clean it up or pay into the superfund program. But thus far in Colorado, when climate change causes damage, that comes out of the pockets of local working families and government.”

The joint statement highlights shortened winters, vanishing snowpack, escalating wildfires, worsening drought, and flash floods as direct threats that “are no longer warnings of a distant future: they are here, they are now.” According to the statement, climate action is a necessity to support public health, local economies, and mountain landscapes.

The statement also underscores the need for local leaders to commit to climate action quickly as federal leaders “delay and deny.”

The statement continues, “Their inaction leaves us no choice but to lead … As elected leaders of mountain communities, we’re bonded by a deep love for our natural settings and an intense responsibility to protect them. Therefore, we pledge to work together to accelerate climate solutions at the local and regional level, building a nationwide subnational movement powerful enough to drive emissions to zero.”

For Berman, she noted that one of the reasons she ran for town council at 27 years old was because she felt the government wasn’t effectively addressing climate, an issue she stressed disproportionately impacts young people.

“So climate has always been a top priority for me, and it’s heartening to see local governments getting things done on building decarbonization, public transit, and clean energy,” she said.

The joint statement emphasizes speed as a critical piece of climate action in order to combat the growing risks. By sharing strategies, expertise, and data, the 37 leaders who signed the statement aim to ensure every community has the resources they need.

“Climate is a time sensitive issue, so unless we’re acting with urgency, we’re not solving the problem,” she said.

According to Berman, solving climate issues boils down to electrifying everything and ensuring that power comes from clean energy. She said that her biggest takeaway from the summit came from Holy Cross CEO Bryan Hannegan, who reinforced that Holy Cross is “racing” toward 100% clean energy and need local governments to make electrifying buildings and transit systems a priority.

“Buildings are two-thirds of our region’s carbon emissions and if new residential construction is all-electric, it will have no carbon impact by the time Holy Cross reaches 100% clean power,” Berman said. “That’s why I strongly support Basalt’s work to adopt an all-electric building code for new residential construction. Renovations are hard and expensive, which means we need to focus on building things right in the first place.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2025/10/25104627/20251007-Climate-Summit-KUS186-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 06:18:37.541115

The newly installed 1,200-panel rooftop solar system is expected to generate nearly 1 million kilowatt-hours of clean electricity annually—enough to power about 90 single-family homes in Florida. The system will meet roughly 75% of the total energy needs for the entire property, which includes both the bustling food truck park and the neighboring Visitors Flea Market.

“This investment in solar isn’t just about reducing our carbon footprint; it’s a commitment to long-term self-sustainability for our food truck owners and our customers,” said Nadeem Battla, owner of World Food Trucks. “By cutting power costs and gaining energy independence, we’re creating a smarter business model that benefits our vendors, our guests, and the entire community.”

Beyond energy savings, the new solar infrastructure will enhance resilience. In the event of a hurricane or other power outage, World Food Trucks will be able to continue operations safely using solar power, offering a vital gathering place for first responders and residents.

Restaurants typically consume up to ten times more energy per square foot than other commercial properties, but World Food Trucks’ large-scale renewable conversion demonstrates how solar energy can support even high-demand businesses without disrupting operations. The project is projected to reduce utility costs by approximately $19,600 annually, a substantial savings for a family-operated business that supports dozens of small, primarily minority-owned food trucks.

The project was made possible by a $601,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Energy for America Program, which funds renewable energy and efficiency projects for rural businesses. Additional support came from Climate First Bank and Duke Energy, which provided expertise and financing tools to bring the project to life.

PASADENA, CA, UNITED STATES, October 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Vicinia.io, a leader in digital twin and spatial intelligence solutions, announces the expansion of its platform with an enhanced Asset & People Intelligence Suite. This new release empowers organizations to achieve real-time asset tracking, people tracing, and operational visibility across campuses, workplaces, healthcare systems, and municipalities.

As modern facilities become more complex, organizations are demanding smarter ways to manage assets, understand people movement, and optimize building performance. Vicinia’s platform transforms static maps into interactive digital twins — dynamic, data-connected environments that reveal how assets and individuals move, interact, and shape operational outcomes.

Real-World Scenarios Driving Innovation

At a major university campus, facilities staff struggled to keep track of thousands of shared lab devices and classroom tools. Without a unified asset management system, misplaced equipment and redundant orders quietly increased annual costs. By using Vicinia’s digital twin platform, every item now appears on a real-time asset map — showing what’s in use, what’s idle, and even where maintenance is needed.

In a corporate innovation hub, safety teams needed a faster way to locate employees during building drills and equipment checks. Vicinia’s people tracing technology and IoT sensors provided immediate insight into occupancy and movement patterns — reducing search times and improving emergency response.

And in a city cultural complex, operators faced unpredictable visitor flow and congestion. Vicinia’s spatial intelligence dashboard visualized crowd movement, helping planners adjust signage and traffic paths on the fly to improve guest experience and accessibility.

These stories reveal a shared challenge across industries: the need for connected intelligence that unites people, places, and assets through live data.

By combining real-time asset intelligence with people movement analytics, Vicinia is helping organizations run safer, more efficient, and more connected operations.

Turning Data Into Action

The new suite integrates seamlessly with Vicinia’s wayfinding, tours, parking, and workspace solutions, creating a unified operational overview. Using IoT sensors, BLE tags, and predictive analytics, Vicinia enables teams to:

• Track assets and people in real time across multi-building or multi-site facilities.

Combining reasoning with 360-degree camera vision is what Musk believes will give Tesla’s autonomous vehicles a major edge in urban navigation.
Investor Spotlight on Musk’s Control and Pay Package Beyond autonomy, Tesla’s earnings call turned to another high-stakes topic: Musk’s pay and voting control.
That level of control, Musk argued, is necessary to protect the company’s vision—particularly in AI and robotics.","CEO Elon Musk confirmed the move during Tesla’s recent third-quarter earnings call, adding that steering wheels and pedals will be phased out entirely in 2026.

The robotaxi expansion will depend on regulatory green lights, but Musk has made it clear that Tesla is ready to scale. With plans to push into eight to ten more metro areas, including regions in Nevada, Florida, and Arizona, the company is steering straight into the competitive arena of autonomous mobility—with or without external pressure.

This announcement drops into an already complex landscape for Tesla. As regulatory scrutiny and public skepticism continue to shadow the rise of full self-driving (FSD) systems, Musk doubled down on safety, stating that Tesla would remain cautious even without being forced to. Still, the timeline he presented suggests a company eager to shed human intervention sooner rather than later.

Safety Drivers to Disappear, Controls to Follow

Musk was deliberate, if somewhat loose, with the timeline: safety drivers will exit Tesla’s Cybercabs in Austin “within a few months” or “by the end of the year,” depending on interpretation. According to Autoweek, Tesla is also waiting for regulatory approval to do the same in the San Francisco Bay Area, although there’s no rush to implement the change there.

In parallel, Tesla will begin assembling Cybercabs without steering wheels or pedals starting in 2026. Musk described this evolution as part of a broader vision to transition away from the “horseless carriage” mentality still shaping modern car design. That said, the automaker will continue building traditional Teslas with full controls for customers who still want to drive, emphasizing the divide between its consumer vehicles and the autonomous fleet.

Musk didn’t specify whether the Cybercabs will take the form of the two-door coupe prototype previously revealed or be stripped-down Model Ys. Either way, the transition represents a bold reshaping of how Tesla views transportation hardware—and who is supposed to control it.

Software Updates Bring Smoother Rides and “Reasoning”

As Tesla edges closer to full autonomy, software development remains central. Musk advised users to hold off on downloading Full Self Driving (FSD) version 14.0, recommending instead to wait for version 14.2, which he claims will offer smoother and more comfortable driving behavior. The improvement reportedly includes less jerky acceleration and overall better handling.

In an unusual claim, Musk said upcoming versions—14.3 or 14.4—will introduce “reasoning” capabilities to Tesla’s FSD. This, he explained, will allow the system to outperform humans in certain tasks, such as spotting empty parking spaces. Combining reasoning with 360-degree camera vision is what Musk believes will give Tesla’s autonomous vehicles a major edge in urban navigation.

These updates are framed as incremental improvements, yet they point toward a broader shift in how Tesla intends to scale its robotaxi service without human backup. While regulators have yet to weigh in on the latest FSD versions, Tesla appears to be preparing the foundation for a driverless future—one software release at a time.

Investor Spotlight on Musk’s Control and Pay Package

Beyond autonomy, Tesla’s earnings call turned to another high-stakes topic: Musk’s pay and voting control. Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja urged investors to support Musk’s leadership in two votes set for November 6. At the heart of this push is a compensation plan that would award Musk an additional 12% of Tesla stock, raising his total stake to 25%. That level of control, Musk argued, is necessary to protect the company’s vision—particularly in AI and robotics.

Musk said his aim was to have “enough voting control to give strong influence, but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.” He also fired back at Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, two index funds that recommended rejecting the proposal, and claimed the power would help prevent Tesla’s Optimus robots from falling into the wrong hands.

The call ended with a nod to Musk’s broader ambitions. He once again promoted Tesla’s AI chips, the Optimus project, and a new mission slogan: “sustainable abundance.” Despite a 9% dip in EBITDA to $4.23 billion, Tesla’s third-quarter gross revenues climbed to $28.1 billion, boosted by the final months of U.S. EV tax credits. Even as those incentives expire and the domestic EV market stalls, Musk expects global production to hit 3 million annually in under two years.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tesla-Cybercab-Laser-Headlights.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 07:18:00.070838

The environment minister, Murray Watt, set out on Sunday the powers of the environment protection agency, under a bill to rewrite the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act due in parliament this week.
Previously, the environment minister has made decisions on projects either directly or via an official acting under delegated powers.
The peak green group favoured a model in which the minister set nature protection rules and then EPA assessed projects against them.
The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the EPA would become “another branch of government bureaucracy” if it didn’t have strong laws to enforce.","The environment minister will still be responsible for approving projects under new federal nature laws, after Labor rebuffed calls for a completely independent watchdog with full decision-making powers.

The retention of ministerial decision-making powers satisfies a key demand from the Coalition and industry and is not opposed by the Greens.

But it has been criticised by environmentalists, who argue the model could allow developers to exert pressure on the minister.

The environment minister, Murray Watt, set out on Sunday the powers of the environment protection agency, under a bill to rewrite the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act due in parliament this week.

Watt’s hopes of passing the laws before Christmas were dealt a blow last week after the Coalition and Greens criticised separate aspects of the draft laws, denying Labor a clear path through the Senate and setting up a political fight in the final three sitting weeks of the year.

The Coalition argue the laws are anti-business, while the Greens claim the opposite, accusing Watt of drafting laws that have “big business and the mining companies’ fingerprints all over it”.

Speaking on Sky News on Sunday morning, Watt said the government was open to considering amendments but was adamant the revamp would not collapse for the second time in 12 months.

“People should be under no illusions … we will be passing these laws through the parliament,” Watt said. “The only question is how quickly we do it and who we do it with.”

One of the most contentious parts of the reforms has been the scope of the promised federal environment watchdog, with industry and environmentalists at odds over whether an independent agency – rather than the minister – should be responsible for approving projects.

Previously, the environment minister has made decisions on projects either directly or via an official acting under delegated powers.

In practice, the minister personally considers only a small number of significant applications, such as Woodside’s North-West shelf extension and the Robbins Island windfarm. Departmental officials sign off on more than 90% of decisions.

The new regime will be largely the same, except that rather than delegating decisions to a departmental bureaucrat, that responsibility will fall to officials in the new EPA.

The decisions that are taken by the minister will be based on advice from the EPA rather than department officials.

The new agency, to be officially known as the National Environment Protection Agency (NEPA), will have other functions that are independent of the minister, including policing nature laws and monitoring compliance with a project’s conditions.

“An independent NEPA will have strong compliance and enforcement oversight to better protect our precious environment and ensure those who seek to illegally destroy it pay a high price,” Watt said.

The Australian Conservation Foundation acting chief executive, Paul Sinclair, was disappointed the proposed EPA was not fully independent.

The peak green group favoured a model in which the minister set nature protection rules and then EPA assessed projects against them.

“Arm’s length decision making is better for nature and better for business,” he said.

The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the EPA would become “another branch of government bureaucracy” if it didn’t have strong laws to enforce.

With a “climate trigger” that could block or restrict fossil fuel projects officially off the table, Hanson-Young signalled the Greens were prepared to negotiate with Labor on other mechanisms to address climate impacts.

Under the new laws, proponents of heavy polluting projects would be required to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and how they intend to mitigate them as part of the application process.

But the laws would not force decision-makers to consider those potential climate impacts, meaning projects such as Woodside’s North-West Shelf extension could still be approved under the new regime.

“They’ve taken the climate trigger off the table because they’re doing the bidding of the fossil fuel companies,” Hanson-Young said.

“Now if we negotiate, the government’s going to have to come up with what they are prepared to do to protect the climate and to protect our forests.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e570dc85bd9efe9af6854270cd251075ce28ebd1/564_0_5641_4515/master/5641.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c10b16ae5399607aab9384c5d9642e8",N,,2025-10-26 02:58:02.568425

By Jonathan Eberle |

Arizona Public Service (APS) is seeking to raise electricity rates by 14% starting in 2026 — a move the Arizona Free Enterprise Club (AZFEC) argues would unfairly burden Arizona families while subsidizing costly “green energy” initiatives and the early closure of a key coal plant.

According to filings with the Arizona Corporation Commission, APS attributes the proposed rate increase largely to battery storage projects and the early retirement of the Cholla Power Plant. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club filed an official response criticizing APS for attempting to block the organization’s intervention in the case, while allowing environmental groups such as the Sierra Club to participate. “APS has no issue letting radical groups like the Sierra Club into their hearings, but they’re trying to block the one organization fighting for Arizona families,” said AZFEC President Scot Mussi.

Mussi contends APS’s “carbon free” and “carbon neutral” commitments over the past five years have shaped their energy plans — including their Integrated Resource Plans and large-scale renewable energy projects — resulting in higher costs for consumers. “For years, their voluntary commitments have very likely increased costs for Arizona ratepayers,” the organization said in its filing.

Two days after filing its response, the Arizona Free Enterprise Club announced it had been officially granted intervention in the APS case. This designation allows AZFEC to participate directly in proceedings, making it the only organization representing ratepayers who oppose the rate hike.

In the ruling, the Administrative Law Judge overseeing the case described the Club as “the lone proponent” of an energy approach emphasizing reliability, affordability, and independence — priorities the group says align with President Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” agenda.

“While others are lobbying to shut down Arizona’s coal plants and pour billions into unreliable Green New Scam projects, we’re standing up for the ratepayers who will be left to foot the bill,” Mussi said. “We’re proud to be the only organization in this case fighting to keep Arizona’s energy secure, affordable, and free from political interference.”

The Club’s participation ensures that Arizona ratepayers have a voice during the proceedings, according to Mussi and AZFEC Deputy Policy Director Greg Blackie. “This isn’t about politics — it’s about protecting Arizona families and ensuring that our state doesn’t fall victim to the same radical energy policies destroying affordability across the country,” said Blackie. “We intend to shine a light on the real costs, the real numbers, and the real consequences of this so-called green transition.”

The case before the Arizona Corporation Commission will determine whether APS can move forward with its proposed rate hike. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club says it plans to continue pressing for “transparency, accountability, and energy freedom,” ensuring that “ratepayers are not forced to fund reckless green energy policies.”",https://azfreenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cropped-favicon-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 08:58:02.539380

The project combines Coolsheet’s heat-exchange solar technology with Capral Aluminium’s Australian-made components, creating a system designed to generate both electricity and usable heat from a single rooftop array.

Located above Sydney Harbour, the redeveloped complex will use the system to capture the sun’s light and heat simultaneously. While conventional photovoltaic panels typically convert only about 25 per cent of sunlight into electricity, Coolsheet’s panels reclaim the remaining thermal energy using a lightweight aluminium water jacket mounted behind each PV module. The captured heat can then be stored in hot-water tanks or used to pre-heat water for heat pumps. Cooling the solar cells also increases electrical efficiency and extends panel life — enabling a dual-output energy platform that maximises solar potential.

At North Sydney Olympic Pool, the installation links Coolsheet’s heat exchangers to the rear of 206 solar modules rated at 550 W each, creating around 114 kWe of electrical capacity and producing two to three times that amount in thermal energy. The output will help maintain water temperatures for over three million litres across five pools, forming part of the site’s all-electric heating network.

The system aligns with North Sydney Council’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035, and the extra power from cooled panels is expected to offset the system’s own pump energy use.

“Coolsheet is proud to partner with North Sydney Council on this landmark project,” said Tom Hoole, Founder and CTO of Coolsheet. “It’s been a complex construction program but now, as the site nears completion, it’s clear this will be a world-class facility showcasing how renewable heat can be built into public infrastructure.”

Coolsheet, founded in Sydney, is Australia’s first PVT manufacturer and among only about 50 globally. Its patented system has undergone validation testing at UNSW Sydney, supporting local manufacturing and deployment of renewable heat technologies. “The opportunity for Australian industry is significant,” said Doug Smith, Chairman of Coolsheet. “By capturing more of the sun’s energy through both electricity and heat, we can help manufacturers improve efficiency, reduce energy costs, and strengthen energy resilience all while supporting local jobs and clean technology manufacturing.”

The system’s backbone relies on precision-engineered aluminium extrusions supplied by Capral, built for durability and corrosion resistance in outdoor environments. “As an Australian manufacturer with a national extrusion and distribution footprint, Capral is focused on enabling the country’s rapidly developing renewables sector,” said Tony Dragicevich, CEO of Capral. “Our role is to bring local expertise, consistent quality and responsive supply to projects like this — supporting innovators with the engineered aluminium solutions they need to deliver clean-energy outcomes at scale.”",http://www.alcircle.com/api/media/1761399167.81509_Coolsheet_0_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 03:17:34.366029

Under the redesigned legislation — expected to be introduced to Parliament on Thursday — Murray Watt will announce the creation of Australia’s first National Environmental Protection Agency.

Senator Watt on Sunday said the NEPA would oversee compliance and enforcement but, unlike the failed Nature Positive reforms proposed by predecessor Tanya Plibersek, the minister of the day would still be ultimately responsible for project approvals.

“An independent (National Environmental Protection Agency) will have strong compliance and enforcement oversight to better protect our precious environment and ensure those who seek to illegally destroy it pay a high price,” Senator Watt told Sky.

“But importantly, the minister of the day would still be ultimately responsible for approval decisions, a move that is backed by all sides of politics.”

The NEPA would also have the powers to issue stop-work orders, to act proactively in the case of unacceptable environmental risks.

“The thing about stop work orders — we currently don’t have the power under our national environmental law if we know that someone is about to go and bulldoze all sorts of trees with koalas or other threatened species,” Senator Watt explained.

“We don’t have the power to get in there before that destruction occurs.

“All we can do at the moment is actually fine someone after the event.

“Now, I think most Australians would agree that it’s probably a good idea that if someone is about to do the wrong thing by the environment, we should have the power to stop that from happening first, rather than coming in after the event.”

Senator Watt said the redesign of the outdated 1999 Act aimed to deliver “a balanced package” for faster approvals, stronger environmental protection, and greater accountability and transparency.

He also criticised the Coalition’s lack of support leading up to the coming sitting week after Opposition Leader Sussan Ley warned his amendments would be a “handbrake” on investment.

In her commentary, Ms Ley also raised concerns over the definition of “unacceptable impact” in the laws, and that the legislation was being rushed.

Shadow Environment spokeswoman Angie Bell accused Senator Watt of being “short on detail” and said without further transparency the laws didn’t appear balanced.

She told Sky on Sunday there had already been “grave concerns” from across the spectrum — from environmental groups to resource sector representatives.

“The Minister’s saying that it’s balanced. Well, the way we’re looking at it is — it’s not balanced at the moment. It’s short on detail,” she said.

Her Coalition colleague Susan MacDonald also expressed concern the proposed changes would undermine national prosperity and push Australian jobs offshore.

“Just because the minister says that these (laws) are going to be better for the environment does not make that true,” the Shadow Resources spokeswoman said.

“What we’re trying to caution the Government on is not to rush through legislation.”

Senator Watt labelled the criticism as beyond belief from a party that claims to stand up for the interests of Australian business.

“What we’re trying to do through these reforms is deliver a balanced package that actually delivers real improvements for our natural environment and real improvements for business,” he said.

“They say they’re a party of business. We know the part that business wants these reforms to be put in place to streamline approvals.

“I cannot believe some of the things that we’re hearing from the Coalition.”",https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20473571/3fbcec2ccd172347f5903e497567a1a967557aa8-16x9-x0y192w2048h1152.jpg?imwidth=1200,N,,2025-10-26 02:58:07.116493

CPS Energy customers should be disappointed with this very un-public move from their public utility.""
CPS Energy is on the verge of updating its generation plan—a process intended to determine which energy sources will power San Antonio in the years to come.
""Every megawatt of energy we save is a megawatt CPS Energy doesn’t have to buy.
The September purchase was not the first time CPS Energy made a major acquisition without public engagement.","As storms swept through San Antonio and South Texas on October 25, 2025, thousands of CPS Energy customers found themselves without power, highlighting both the challenges and controversies facing the nation’s largest municipal electric and gas utility. The outages, which at one point affected nearly 4,000 residents, arrived just weeks after CPS Energy’s surprise announcement of a $1.4 billion purchase of four methane gas power plants—an acquisition made without public input, according to multiple sources including Public Citizen and local news outlets.

For many San Antonians, the immediate concern was getting the lights back on. According to CPS Energy’s outage map, 43 active outages initially left 3,939 residents in the dark as the storms rolled in. By 10:15 a.m., the number of outages had climbed to 58, though the number of affected residents had dropped to 1,768 as crews worked to restore service. The hardest-hit areas included Leon Valley, with four active outages reported.

CPS Energy took to social media to reassure residents. ""Work crews will be responding to any reports of possible downed power lines and outages this morning. Delays in restoration may occur due to weather and road conditions, so please know that workers will also be prioritizing safety conditions during the morning storms,"" the utility stated. Residents were urged to report downed power lines by calling 210-353-HELP (4357), a reminder of the hazards that come with severe weather and aging infrastructure.

The National Weather Service had issued a flood watch from 7 p.m. on October 24 through 1 p.m. the next day, warning that rainfall totals could reach up to five inches in some spots, raising the risk of flooding in rivers, creeks, and low-lying areas. Road closures compounded the difficulties for residents and repair crews alike: Old Fredericksburg Road and Burshard Road were blocked off for ongoing construction, closures expected to last several more months.

While the storms and outages were the most immediate concern, a deeper debate was unfolding in San Antonio over the direction and transparency of CPS Energy’s long-term planning. The utility’s September announcement of a $1.4 billion purchase of four methane gas power plants in the Houston area surprised many—including clean energy advocates and everyday ratepayers—because the decision was made behind closed doors. DeeDee Belmares, a clean energy advocate with Public Citizen and former member of the CPS Energy Rate Advisory Committee, voiced the frustration felt by many: ""How did such a major decision happen behind closed doors? CPS Energy customers should be disappointed with this very un-public move from their public utility.""

CPS Energy leadership has defended the purchase, arguing that acquiring existing gas plants, rather than building new ones, could save customers $2 to $4 a month on their bills. These projected savings are based on cost comparisons with new construction, but critics question the reliability of such estimates. As Belmares pointed out, ""Gas prices are volatile and can be affected by geopolitical events, supply chain disruptions, and severe weather, as seen during the deadly winter storm of 2021 which resulted in billions of dollars in new charges to Texans."" The memory of that storm—when frozen methane gas supply chains left Texans with soaring bills that will linger for years—remains fresh for many in the region.

Beyond the question of cost, the lack of public input in such a consequential decision has raised alarms about transparency and accountability at the utility. The only formal avenue for community engagement is the CPS Energy Community Input Committee, but its meetings are not open to the public, and only summaries are made available online. ""This lack of transparency in a public utility should alarm ratepayers,"" Belmares wrote in a recent op-ed, echoing concerns voiced by other local advocates.

Compounding the frustration is the timing of the purchase. CPS Energy is on the verge of updating its generation plan—a process intended to determine which energy sources will power San Antonio in the years to come. But with $1.4 billion already committed to additional fossil fuel capacity, some stakeholders feel the outcome has been preempted. ""The update should have been the opportunity for stakeholders to engage with CPS Energy on any expensive fossil fuel expansion plans and the issues of sustainability, affordability and reliability of all power sources,"" Belmares argued.

San Antonio’s experience is not unique. Across Texas and the nation, utilities face mounting pressure to balance reliability, affordability, and sustainability. The Sustainable Tomorrow Energy Plan (STEP), already in place in San Antonio, offers incentives for energy efficiency upgrades—everything from insulation to new appliances—while the Casa Verde weatherization program provides free improvements to income-qualified customers. These programs, advocates say, not only help customers save money but also reduce demand on the grid, making the system more resilient to shocks like the 2021 winter storm.

""Every megawatt of energy we save is a megawatt CPS Energy doesn’t have to buy. It’s a win for everyone,"" Belmares noted. The savings from such programs are permanent, unlike the unpredictable costs of natural gas, which can spike due to global events or extreme weather.

The September purchase was not the first time CPS Energy made a major acquisition without public engagement. In May 2024, the utility purchased three gas plants from Talen Energy in Laredo and Corpus Christi for $785 million, again with little warning to the public. The pattern of sudden, high-stakes decisions has left some residents and advocates wary of what comes next.

As the city recovers from the latest round of storms and outages, the broader questions about CPS Energy’s future remain unresolved. Will the utility embrace a more transparent, participatory approach to decision-making? Can it balance the needs for reliability and affordability with the imperatives of climate action and public health? For now, San Antonio’s residents are left waiting—not only for the power to return, but for a voice in the decisions that will shape their energy future for decades to come.

The events of October 25 served as a stark reminder of the stakes involved. As climate-driven storms become more frequent and intense, and as energy markets grow more volatile, the choices made by public utilities like CPS Energy will have far-reaching consequences—for pocketbooks, for the environment, and for the very definition of what it means to serve the public interest.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/LSKeF8L2wcAOTskn8PIdVYLXSFA=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F219aacd8-ccfa-4402-b483-2fb19a07e017.jpeg,N,,2025-10-26 10:03:24.930079

There’s barely an Australian who hasn’t been affected by one extreme weather event or another, some badly. Some have lost their lives, their homes or both.

The seas around our country are suffering a marine heatwave. Just a few degrees above normal is causing these climate change-fuelled warmer oceans to put our weather on steroids, intensifying heat, rainfall and wind.

And that intense rainfall will lead to increased plant growth, so another record bushfire season is inevitable at some point.

But this is really only the beginning: global warming has reached an average of nearly 1.5C, and we’re set to see warming of at least 2.7C by the end of the century if we don’t take more action.

How this warming will affect Australia was set out very clearly in the National Climate Risk Assessment report released last month: everything and everyone will be affected. Many sectors assessed are already experiencing moderate to high risk and if global warming is allowed to reach 2C most sectors will face very high to severe risk. Health and social support and natural systems will be severely affected – coral reefs will be all but extinct at 2C of warming.

Australians have a clear and obvious interest in the world taking action to peak global warming as close as possible to the Paris agreement’s 1.5C limit.

Never has there been a stronger need for rapid global decarbonisation; never has there been a stronger need to rid ourselves of fossil fuels and undertake a global transition to clean, renewable energy.

It’s there, and it’s available. Renewables have now taken over coal in global electricity generation. China’s emissions (and therefore the globe’s) may have peaked this year. And the cost of renewables, battery storage and EVs, thanks to a massive uptake in China, is plummeting. It’s never been cheaper.

And all the economics point to the cost of a global energy transition costing exponentially less than the ongoing – and building – costs of dealing with devastating climate change impacts.

So what’s getting in the way of this energy revolution? The biggest barrier to the global energy transition is the fossil fuel industry and its relationship with governments.

When I say fossil fuels, it’s not just coal and oil but also fossil gas, which a number of governments – including ours – have allowed themselves to be convinced is needed for this global transition.

But it absolutely is not, and it’s getting in the way and risks locking the world into warming of 2.5C – or more. Gas is a fossil fuel and needs to be reduced rapidly now and effectively out of the energy system by 2050 and the power sector a decade earlier.

Yet Australia wants to continue selling more of this gas to Asian markets in the form of liquefied natural gas or LNG all the way through to 2070, having just approved Woodside’s North West Shelf project to carry out this work. And LNG is much more energy-intensive than conventional gas, because of the processing it undergoes to ready it for export.

So if Indonesia builds a new gas-fired power station that burns Australian LNG (on-sold to them by Japan), this will keep Indonesia hooked on fossil gas for the 40-year lifetime of that power plant, locking in carbon emissions – or closing it early, leaving furious investors out of pocket.

The alternative is renewable energy firmed by storage that’s cheaper and more effective and will be better for the Indonesian economy and better for the planet. But this now risks being locked out by LNG.

Across Asia, Australia and Japan are touting their fossil gas wares, trying to convince their potential customers that they can just adopt carbon capture and storage (CCS) to deal with the emissions. Indeed the promised deployment of CCS is being used as a justification for allowing new fossil gas development.

But we know – and they must know – that this technology is failing. It is costly, complex and unreliable. It doesn’t work to get emissions to real zero, where they need to be; the rate of emissions capture is usually much lower than industry claims; the cost is very high, compared with clean alternatives, and is unlikely to reduce in cost over time.

The costs of renewable energy and storage will continue to reduce substantially over time as this industry scales up. Why spend all this cash buying fossil fuels and trying to bury emissions when renewables are now so much cheaper, and the fuel is both infinite and free? Let’s not forget the fossil fuel industry needs governments to carry the liability for this storage for many centuries into the future.

Australia has the know-how and the opportunity to help lead the global energy transition to a clean energy future, we have abundant critical minerals, we could export green hydrogen, and we have an endless supply of sun and wind that could power this future.

But first we need to take our foot off the gas.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aeeea3628bd738ffca81aa8259ca9d79fba5bcf/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3763250e18db0caf696523b82fde585e",N,,2025-10-26 00:18:07.929586

Why are renters more exposed to climate risks than homeowners?

TG, via email

Climate change poses a growing threat to human civilization by rapidly altering our environment and increasing the frequency, intensity, and destructiveness of natural disasters. Our homes are at the forefront of these challenges, facing rising energy costs to regulate extreme temperatures and increased risks of property damage from storms and floods. Among the most vulnerable are the third of Americans who rent rather than own their homes. When disaster strikes, renters are often left unprotected, with limited options for relocation or recovery. Notably, the areas with the highest concentration of renters also tend to face the most severe climate-related risks. This trend is particularly evident in Florida and California, where 88 and 79 percent of rental units, respectively, are in high-risk areas. After a disaster, renters frequently endure further hardship through sudden rent increases or evictions, exacerbating their vulnerability.

Government agencies like FEMA, the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offer various forms of disaster relief for homeowners, including low-interest loans, nutrition assistance, short-term Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and rebuilding grants. However, renters receive little to no comparable aid. Beyond lacking direct assistance, renters have minimal control over post-disaster repairs, as landlords often opt for the fastest, cheapest fixes rather than investing in long-term, sustainable renovations.

To improve the safety and security of renters, disaster relief programs must incorporate targeted support and protections. In high-risk areas, expanding hazard-resistant building initiatives can ensure new construction and renovations prioritize climate resilience. Strengthening tenant protection laws can prevent post-disaster rent spikes and evictions, offering stability to those most affected. Also, lawmakers should require landlords to make climate-resilient upgrades, like using flood-resistant materials, improving insulation and modernizing energy systems. Expanding government relief programs to include rental assistance and temporary housing solutions can also help renters recover more effectively.

There are many ways individuals can contribute to renter protection: advocating for policy reforms; pushing for legislation that prioritizes renter protections; supporting tenant organizations; participating in community preparedness efforts. Also, raising awareness about available assistance programs, insurance options and renters' legal rights empowers individuals to make informed decisions and protect themselves. By taking these steps, individuals can help foster a more equitable and resilient housing system that ensures renters are not left behind in the face of climate change.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency approved a five-year permit allowing AquaBounty to install two mile-long pipelines near Pioneer. One would draw groundwater from a local aquifer, while the other would discharge wastewater into the east branch of the St. Joseph River.

According to the permit, it was officially granted on Sept. 12, with an effective date of Oct. 1. The permit remains valid through Sept. 30, 2030.

Residents who have followed the project closely say they were blindsided by the news. Members of the Williams County Alliance, an environmental advocacy group, said they were told they’d be notified when any new permits were issued. However, the approval was never announced publicly on the Ohio EPA’s website, AquaBounty’s website or the village of Pioneer’s page.

In a statement to WTOL 11, the Ohio EPA acknowledged that no public notice was issued and attributed the lapse to “an internal oversight.”

The EPA's statement:

""Ohio EPA, due to an internal oversight, did not issue a public notice regarding the issuance of AquaBounty’s permit.

It is our practice to release such notices, though not required by law, and we regret that this practice was not followed. We are continuing to look into this matter.

The permit holds the protection of human health and the environment as top priorities.""

Sherry Fleming, a leader with the Williams County Alliance, criticized the lack of transparency.

“This lack of a required simple notification to the public by the Ohio EPA illustrates how disconnected the state government is to the communities that will live with the impacts from this project every day,” said Fleming. “We deserve better.”

AquaBounty halted construction of its Pioneer facility in June 2023, citing financial challenges and rising construction costs. The company has not said if or when work on the site will resume.

On top of that, $25,000 is simply being moved from the General Fund to the Sustainability Fund, so there’s no actual net budget increase for that.
Board member Olin Wilson-Thomas suggested that the group recommend raising the wheel tax, at least on “large, polluting cars,” to add money to the Sustainability Fund.
Board members also debated if a wheel tax increase should be income-based to avoid penalizing low-income residents more likely to drive older cars.
Other board members didn’t raise any objections to that.","Evanston’s Environment Board agreed at its meeting Thursday night to ask the City Council to keep $100,000 in annual wheel tax revenue in the city’s Sustainability Fund instead of moving it to the General Fund, which officials have proposed to help balance the 2026 budget.

The city created the Sustainability Fund in 2022 to set aside money specifically for staff positions, programs and projects that advance the Climate Action and Resilience Plan (CARP) and other environmentally friendly initiatives. During its Oct. 23 meeting held at Morton City Hall, the Environment Board reviewed how the city’s proposed 2026 budget would impact that fund specifically. City Council is expected to discuss the budget on Monday evening as well.

In their 2026 proposal, the city is asking all departments to cut expenses by 3% in the face of budget uncertainty.

The Environment Board objected to this idea at Thursday’s meeting, with members saying they felt the move would set a bad precedent and hurt sustainability efforts, especially since the budget proposal shuffles some programs from the General Fund to the Sustainability Fund without providing additional revenue to pay for them.

Councilmember Jonathan Nieuwsma (4th Ward), who previously sat on the board and attended the meeting as a de facto liaison, suggested that members pass a resolution to send a message to the council.

While members agreed on what they objected to, they struggled over how specific they should get in their feedback and whether to suggest revenue solutions. The board ultimately voted for members James Cahan and Gennifer Geer, who drafted potential resolutions as the meeting went on, to send what they came up with to board co-chairs Katarina Topalov and Paula Scholl. The co-chairs would then “synthesize” these drafts into something to send to council in time for Monday’s meeting.

Sustainability Fund plans

Overall, the Sustainability Fund includes a projected $262,000 in revenue, not counting $730,450 transferred from other funds, and about $1.5 million in expenses. Cara Pratt, the city’s sustainability and resilience manager, said some changes in revenues and expenses reflect one-time grants being spread out over multiple years and errors that will be corrected in later drafts. On top of that, $25,000 is simply being moved from the General Fund to the Sustainability Fund, so there’s no actual net budget increase for that.

But other changes do reflect real funding gains and losses.

For example, the proposed budget assumes that a $250,000 U.S. Department of Energy grant to help implement the Healthy Buildings Ordinance isn’t coming — simply because, given the second Trump Administration’s priorities, it’s not something Evanston can count on.

“I don’t know if or when we’ll get it,” Pratt said Thursday.

Additionally, the budget also calls for shifting money around in a way that would result in a net reduction in Sustain Evanston grants.

The Sustainability Fund is also getting a $30,450 increase in transfers from Northwestern’s Good Neighbor Fund to keep up with inflation, and it would get a $15,000 increase in funding for seasonal employees to hire interns in the Transportation and Mobility Division.

But it was the proposal to keep $100,000 in the General Fund that dominated Thursday’s discussion. Topalov said she worried that this move could become an annual occurrence, which would hurt sustainability initiatives in the long term.

“There was a reason why we decided, you [City Council] decided, that there would be an earmarked pot of money that goes toward sustainability,” she said.

Nieuwsma replied that, if the board is against the move, it should let the council know.

“That feedback would be worth something,” he said.

Board member Olin Wilson-Thomas suggested that the group recommend raising the wheel tax, at least on “large, polluting cars,” to add money to the Sustainability Fund. Scholl said that might be worth discussing at a future meeting, and suggested that the board stick to the wheel tax funding issue for now.

This led to a long discussion over the statement to send to City Council, and if it would be more powerful to keep the comments simple or to offer a funding solution as well. Board members also debated if a wheel tax increase should be income-based to avoid penalizing low-income residents more likely to drive older cars.

Nieuwsma urged simplicity.

“The simple message the council will hear is don’t defund sustainability,” he said.

Deconstruction Ordinance

Earlier in the meeting, the board revisited an ongoing discussion on the city’s progress in meeting CARP goals, especially those items that were supposed to be completed this year.

One of those time-sensitive goals was for the city to propose, but not necessarily pass, a Preservation/Deconstruction Ordinance — in other words, an ordinance that would require buildings to be taken apart rather than demolished so that materials can be saved for reuse or recycled.

Nieuwsma wondered if that kind of ordinance is something the city should realistically pursue at the moment, given that the Rebuilding Exchange recently shut down after a $4 million U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant it was counting on ended up in limbo.

He said that working with the Rebuilding Exchange would’ve “offered some carrots for contractors,” but now, the city would be left with nothing but sticks.

Board member Gul Agha asked if the Rebuilding Exchange could come back.

“When the administration changes,” Topalov answered. “They lost $4 million in grants.”

Nieuwsma said that, with “such a local asset” out of commission, he wanted to get the board’s sense of “where we might get more bang for our buck.”

“Making sure the enforcement is there” for the Healthy Buildings Ordinance, Geer replied.

Other board members didn’t raise any objections to that.

“I’m inclined to put it on the shelf, for now,” Nieuwsma said.”[Implementing] HBO is going to take everybody’s time and energy.”",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9437-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 00:58:16.381987

I just finished the Kamala Harris memoir about the 2024 election, 107 Days. I come away from reading it even more unsettled than ever about the dystopian state of our democracy under President Donald J. Trump and his Project 2025 backers.

Private companies and US citizens are hesitant to practice free speech. Partisan politics are restricting the lives and livelihoods of federal workers — the three-week federal shutdown risks critical systems on which millions of people in the US depend. It could weaken government technology infrastructure for years to come.

MAHA’s fake science is in, researchers and scientists are out.

The Energy Department has published a report that pooh-poohed the severity of climate change. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has committed to rewriting past policy reports on climate science.

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy within Trump’s Department of Energy has a whole slew of words that are no longer allowed to be uttered during his reign. They include “climate change,” “green,” “decarbonization,”“energy transition,” “‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ energy,” “emissions,”“sustainability/ sustainable,” “carbon/CO2 ‘footprint’” and “tax breaks/tax credits/subsidies.”

Shoot. We here at CleanTechnica wouldn’t have much to write about if our editors implemented such word restrictions.

Meghan Pazik, senior policy advocate with Public Citizen’s Climate Program, disputes the Trump word bans. Pazik describes how they’re part of a larger agenda of the “administration’s suppression of science, weaponizing deliberate uncertainty, and reiterating once more its authoritarian agenda.” Word bans, she continues, “are conscious decisions that change public discourse and are “a direct, intentional attack on evidence-based science and independent thought which are essential tools for holding governments accountable.”

Democrats Must Speak Out Loudly about the Real Costs to US Citizens

The Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution (Article VI, clause 2) states that the Constitution, treaties, and federal law “shall be the supreme Law of the land.” Underpinning respect for the Constitution is the belief that democracy is worth defending. “But there’s a foundational requirement for it to function that we rarely talk about explicitly, perhaps because it seemed too obvious to require articulation,” deconstructs Chris Armitage, the founder of The Existentialist Republic. “We have to agree about what has actually happened in the world.”

In our post-truth era, agreement is quite hard to come by.

The Climate Action against Disinformation coalition, which comprises 90 climate and anti-disinformation organizations, argues that the digital information landscape is “dangerously polluted, obscuring the truth and delaying the urgent action we need to protect our future.” Rather than found on the fringes of public discourse, evidence suggests that dystopian narratives are becoming “even more mainstream, more violent, and more impactful through repetition.”

I call the originators of climate disinformation “climate entrepreneurs.” They’re online influencers who promote conflict around fossil fuel-driven pollution, and they do so for profit. They make a living from stirring up controversy about renewables and a net zero future. They bombard social media networks with culturally appealing narratives and incite confusion and anger in an effort to undermine common-sense climate governance.

One area that must be made transparent in the face of such subterfuge is how each current government agency closure has detrimental and domino effects on climate action. “This will not only affect research and policy directly, it will also affect what we see and don’t see, and what we say and don’t say,” Rakesh Bhandari, associate director of interdisciplinary studies at the University of California, Berkeley, reminds Politico.

Where does federal power end and state authority begin?

“The state has this power in virtue of its legitimate and cognitive authority,” Bhandari explains. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution was added by the founders in response to anti-Federalist anxieties about an overbearing central government. They added this language to emphasize that the government possessed only limited powers and everything else — including the broad “police power” to regulate health, safety, morals and general welfare — remained with the states. States are currently wallowing in the dirty waters flowing out of the federal government, though.

Some may argue that Democrats have alienated potential conservative voters by refusing to focus on centrist issues. Erica Payne, founder and president of Patriotic Millionaires, disagrees passionately.

“Democrats have absolutely, positively NOT moved too far left in terms of what people want for the economy. The complete opposite is true. People want a higher minimum wage. They want higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Their support for labor unions is at a 60-year high. They want something to be done about out-of-control CEO pay. Want a wildly popular agenda that cuts across party lines? Start there.”

Don’t Let ‘Em Forget about the Damage of Fossil Fuels

Trump has installed more than 100 fossil fuel insiders, renewable energy opponents, corporate lobbyists, and far-right think tank alumni across nine agencies during his second term. Dependence on fossil fuels both as feedstock and a source of energy and is at the heart of the intertwined global crises relating to plastics, climate, and toxic emissions.

Yet supporting Big Oil flies in the face of all evidence about how essential clean energy is to ensuring energy security, safeguarding communities, and protecting our planet’s health. Right-wing politicians, lobbyists, and fossil fuel influence groups behind anti-ESG bills are continuing to block companies from responding to climate risk, even as climate impacts accelerate and the costs become unavoidable for investors, pension holders, municipalities, and taxpayers.

“Democrats are pretty silent about what matters most to the GOP: the protection of fossil fuels,” UC Berkeley’s Bhandari adds. Oil, coal, and gas dump carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Fossil fuels come with a damaging and costly downside: they are warming our planet faster than anything we have seen in the geological record. They also cause other forms of pollution that severely harm human health.

It’s also noteworthy that today’s fossil energy system is incredibly inefficient: almost two-thirds of all primary energy is wasted in energy production, transportation, and use — that’s before fossil fuel has done any work or produced any benefit. Over $4.6 trillion per year, almost 5% of global GDP and 40% of what the world spends on energy, is wasted due to fossil fuel inefficiency.

Celebrate Solar & Battery Storage, Over & Over

Trump 2.0 is in the midst of a war on climate change research, which parallels goals of fossil fuel companies. Yet more US homes and businesses are getting their power from renewable sources than ever before — and in greater amounts.

At a time in which electrification of transport, industry reshoring, and surging data center growth are driving up both energy use and peak demand across North America and Europe, clean energy is now the least costly form of new generation to build. Technology like battery storage is helping to make solar and wind more practical. These are facts.

“Solar and storage are the cheapest, fastest ways to bring much-needed affordable power to communities, as electricity demand and costs surge,” says Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for clean energy at Environmental Defense Fund. Pulling the plug on projects without explanation won’t lower electricity bills for families and businesses, and restricting the supply of cheap electricity only makes the problem worse, Kelly explains. “Instead, the Trump administration is doubling down on costly fossil fuels like coal, opening up new federal lands for coal mining and handing out over $600 million in subsidies to keep polluting, aging coal plants on life support.”

With the Trump administration two-tiered approach to energy permitting, “Polluting, expensive fossil fuels get ‘concierge, white glove service,’” Kelly continues, “while cheap renewables and storage get freezes, delays, and cancellations.” The result? More asthma-causing pollution. Fewer clean energy investments that create jobs right now.

Renewable energy came to the rescue in the summer during New England heat waves. Solar panels on homes, schools, businesses, and larger arrays provided up to 22% of the region’s power. That amounted to nearly double the daily average. This reliable output stabilized the grid and saved customers tens of millions of dollars on some of the hottest days in memory. These are the types of climate facts that we need to be stating and restating, over and over again.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dystopian.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 21:57:55.435241

Henning, Gonzaga University",,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/city-one-hundreds-expecting-federal-140647415.html,"Scientists say it’s not a matter of if, but when, another deadly heat wave descends on the region.

Lessons from the 2021 heat dome The 2021 heat wave was a catalyzing event for the community.
A key lesson from the 2021 heat dome was that temporary, or pop-up, cooling centers don’t work well.","In June 2021, a deadly heat wave pushed temperatures to 109 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) in Spokane, Washington, a northern city near the Idaho border where many homes weren’t built with central air conditioning.

As the heat lingered for over a week, 19 people died in Spokane County and about 300 visited hospitals with signs of heat-related illnesses.

Scientists say it’s not a matter of if, but when, another deadly heat wave descends on the region. To help save lives, the city teamed up with my university, Gonzaga, to start preparing for a hotter future.

We were excited and relieved when the community was awarded a US$19.9 million grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to help it take concrete steps to adapt to climate change and boost the local economy in the process. The grant would help establish resilience hubs with microgrids and help residents without air conditioning install energy-efficient cooling systems. The city doesn’t have the means to make these improvements on its own, even if they would save lives and money in the long run.

Less than a year later, the Trump administration abruptly terminated the funding.

Spokane’s grant wasn’t the only one eliminated – about 350 similar grants that had been awarded to help communities across the country manage climate changes, from extreme heat and wildfire smoke to rising seas and flooding, were also terminated on the grounds that they don’t meet the White House’s priorities. Many other grants to help communities have also been terminated.

Many of the communities that lost funding are like Spokane: They can’t afford to do this kind of work on their own.

Why cities like Spokane need the help

Like many communities in the American West, Spokane was founded in the late 19th century on wealth from railroads and resource extraction, especially gold, silver and timber.

Today, it is a city of 230,000 in a metro area of a half-million people, the largest on the I-90 corridor between Minneapolis and Seattle. In many ways, Spokane could be on the cusp of a renaissance.

In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a $48 million grant to develop a tech hub that could put the Inland Northwest on a path to become a global leader in advanced aerospace materials. But then, in May, the Trump administration rescinded that grant as well.

The lost grants left the economy – and Spokane’s ability to adapt fast enough to keep up with climate changes – uncertain.

This is not a wealthy area. The median household income is nearly $30,000 less than the state average. More than 13 out of every 100 people in Spokane live in poverty, above the national average, and over 67% of the children are eligible for free or reduced lunch.

The city is a light blue island in a dark red sea, politically speaking, with a moderate mayor. Its congressional district has voted Republican by wide margins since 1995, the year that then-House Speaker Tom Foley lost his reelection bid.

Lessons from the 2021 heat dome

The 2021 heat wave was a catalyzing event for the community. The newly formed Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water and the Environment brought together a coalition of government and community partners to apply for the EPA’s Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grant Program. The grants, funded by Congress under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, were intended to help communities most affected by pollution and climate change build adaptive capacity and boost the safety of their residents.

A key lesson from the 2021 heat dome was that temporary, or pop-up, cooling centers don’t work well. People just weren’t showing up. Our research found that the best approach is to strengthen existing community facilities that people already turn to in moments of difficulty.

Half the $19.9 million award was for outfitting five resilience hubs in existing libraries and community centers with solar arrays and battery backup microgrids, allowing them to continue providing a safe, cool space during a heat wave if the power shuts down.

Another $8 million in grant funding was meant to provide 300 low- to moderate-income homeowners with new high-efficiency electric heat pump heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, providing more affordable utility bills while improving their ability to cool their homes and reducing fossil fuel emissions.

Communities are left with few options

Now, this and other work is at risk in Spokane and cities and towns like it around the country that also lost funding.

According to the Trump administration, the program – designed to help hundreds of communities around the country become safer – was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

A class action lawsuit was recently filed over the termination of the grants by a coalition that includes Earth Justice and the Southern Environmental Law Center. If the case is successful, Spokane could see its funding restored.

Meanwhile, the city and my team know we have to move fast, with whatever money and other resources we can find, to help Spokane prepare for worsening heat. We formed the Spokane Community Resilience Collaborative – a partnership between community organizations, health officials and the city – as one way to advance planning for and responding to climate hazards such as extreme heat and wildfire smoke.

As concentrations of heat-trapping gasses accumulate in the atmosphere, both the frequency and severity of heat waves increase. It is only a matter of time before another deadly heat dome arrives.

The EPA’s decision effectively halted plans to deploy 21 megawatts of solar generation and 55 megawatt-hours of battery storage across the Virgin Islands. The termination letter issued to VIEO included an immediate “Stop Work” order, forcing all related activities to cease.

Despite the setback, Energy Office Director Kyle Fleming said his agency remains committed to strengthening the territory’s energy resilience. “VIEO will yet be able to materially enhance electrical resilience in the territory,” Fleming said, pointing to other federally funded efforts such as the Community Electrical Innovations (CEI) program.

Even as large-scale funding was withdrawn, VIEO celebrated a milestone in residential renewable energy this year. The agency completed 12 home solar and battery installations through its Solar Plus Financing (SPF) Pilot Program, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

The SPF initiative offers 1 percent interest, zero-down loans in partnership with the Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority (VIEDA), allowing residents to finance rooftop solar systems and battery storage. On average, homeowners received about $28,000 to install 5.5 kW of solar panels with 14 kWh of storage.

Participants have already reported significant benefits. St. Thomas resident David Miles said the transition has not only lowered his WAPA bills but made outages virtually invisible. “My experience is that I am so grateful that I have these solar panels,” he said. “Because you don’t even know that the power is out. You can just feel a light flicker, and then I hear a generator start across the street and then I know the power is out.”

VIEO originally designed the SPF program as the first of several efforts to expand access to renewable energy and narrow the territory’s socioeconomic energy gap.

One of the agency’s remaining major initiatives is the Community Electrical Innovations (CEI) grant, a $10 million program administered through the Virgin Islands Housing Finance Authority (VIHFA). The program aims to strengthen the energy resilience of facilities that serve children, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups.

Following the July application deadline, 29 facilities were provisionally approved to receive solar and battery systems. The first phase will focus on Head Start centers and daycare facilities serving over 500 children territory-wide. Nine institutions on St. Thomas and St. Croix have already begun soliciting bids for design-build solar systems, with public tenders expected to open in November.

VIEO is also advancing efforts to improve territorial solar design and access. In early October, the agency selected DNV Energy as a consultant under RFP BD-25-270-2701-581, to assist with the development of community microgrids and rooftop solar financing models. The partnership will help design programs that ensure affordable access to renewable energy while positioning the Virgin Islands for future federal funding.

Additionally, the office finalized evaluations for RFP BD-25-270-2701-599, selecting Carib Sun Energy to build a microgrid system at WTJX’s Mountaintop broadcast tower on St. Thomas.

The project, funded by the Department of the Interior’s Energizing Insular Communities Grant, will feature a 70 kW solar array, 500 kWh battery system, and a microgrid controller integrated with the site’s existing diesel generator. Once completed—within roughly nine months of its official start—the system is expected to save the broadcaster $6,000 a month in electricity costs while ensuring uninterrupted transmission from one of the territory’s most critical communication points.

Despite the EPA grant withdrawal, Fleming said the Energy Office’s mission remains unchanged: to pursue affordable, resilient, and sustainable power for residents and essential community services.

“The VIEO continues to advance a diversified portfolio of solar and battery initiatives, leveraging alternative funding, strengthening public-private partnerships, and moving priority projects from planning to deployment,” Fleming stated.

With several projects underway and new federal partnerships emerging, VIEO says its focus will remain on “near-term, high-impact installations that deliver reliability, affordability, and resilience” to the Virgin Islands’ energy landscape.",https://viconsortium.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/Maria-Perez-solar-roof.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 21:18:08.612825

EVXL’s Take We’ve been tracking the slow-motion collapse of Chinese battery investments in America for months, and Gotion’s Michigan failure was entirely predictable.
That stockpiling now looks prescient—Gotion’s Michigan plant was supposed to supply the U.S. market, but it’ll never produce a single battery cell.","A Chinese battery giant’s plans to build a massive Michigan manufacturing plant have officially collapsed, with the state now demanding millions back after years of grassroots opposition, Chinese ownership controversies, and Trump administration policy shifts killed what was once touted as Northern Michigan’s largest economic project ever. Gotion Inc. abandoned its $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery materials plant near Big Rapids after Michigan officials declared the company in default and terminated all state incentives worth $175 million.

The failure marks the latest casualty in America’s troubled push for domestic battery manufacturing, coming just weeks after the September 30 expiration of federal EV tax credits that had promised to fuel the industry’s growth. For EV owners and enthusiasts watching the battery supply chain struggle to establish itself on American soil, Gotion’s collapse raises serious questions about whether Chinese technology and capital remain welcome in the U.S. market—or even necessary.

From $175 Million Promise To Complete Collapse

Michigan’s economic development agency announced Thursday it’s pursuing repayment of $23.6 million already spent on land purchases while suspending a separate $125 million grant that was never disbursed. The Michigan Economic Development Corporation sent Gotion a default notice in September after determining no construction or development activities had occurred on the 270-acre site for more than 120 consecutive days.

When Governor Gretchen Whitmer celebrated the October 2022 announcement, the project promised 2,350 factory jobs paying $62,000 annually—more than 50% above the local median income. The plant would have produced 150,000 tons of cathode materials and 100,000 tons of anode materials annually for EV batteries. But local opposition erupted almost immediately, focused on both environmental concerns and the company’s Chinese ownership structure.

The Michigan Strategic Fund’s September 17 letter to Gotion cited both the project abandonment and ongoing lawsuits as constituting “material adverse effect” violations of the grant agreement. The state gave Gotion 30 days to cure the defaults. That deadline passed October 17 with no resolution.

Local Rebellion Defeats State And Corporate Alliance

The Gotion saga became a case study in grassroots political power defeating entrenched interests. In November 2023, Green Charter Township voters recalled all five township board members who had supported the project, replacing them with officials openly opposed to the development. The new board subsequently rescinded support and, critically, voted to cut off access to water infrastructure essential for factory operations.

Marjorie Steele, founder of the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance that led the opposition, told reporters “What the MEDC tried to pull here in Big Rapids was just so egregious.” Residents organized protests, packed public meetings, and plastered the area with anti-Gotion yard signs, creating a political climate that made construction impossible.

Gotion fought back with a March 2024 breach of contract lawsuit against Green Charter Township. A federal judge granted Gotion an injunction in May 2024 requiring the township to honor the original agreement, but the township appealed. The legal battles stalled the project completely, with Gotion pausing environmental studies and state permitting applications.

In its October response to the state’s default notice, Gotion’s attorney Mark Heusel called the accusations “utterly false” and blamed “racist and ethnically charged stereotypes” for the township’s breach. He argued that ongoing legal expenses, property taxes, and site maintenance constituted “eligible activities” under the grant agreement, and requested a six-month suspension to negotiate an “open and candid discussion about the viability of the project.”

Political Opposition Centered On Chinese Communist Party Ties

The project became a flashpoint for growing U.S.-China tensions and skepticism about Chinese investment in critical industries. Congressman John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on China, emerged as the project’s most prominent opponent. Moolenaar introduced legislation blocking companies like Gotion from receiving EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act—a bill that President Trump signed into law earlier this year as part of the “Big Beautiful Bill”.

Critics pointed to Gotion’s corporate structure and Chinese government connections. While Germany’s Volkswagen owns approximately 30% of Gotion High-Tech’s parent company, U.S. lawmakers maintain that China retains “effective control” through multiple individual shareholders. The company’s ties to Chinese Communist Party activities, including employee visits to party memorials and executives attending political study sessions, fueled suspicions among opponents.

Moolenaar praised Thursday’s announcement, stating the people of Green Charter Township “can finally move on from Gotion’s lies and broken promises.” For supporters of domestic battery production, the congressman’s rhetoric highlighted the impossible political environment Chinese companies now face in the United States.

Illinois Plant Proceeds While Michigan Dreams Die

The stark contrast between Gotion’s Michigan failure and its Illinois success reveals how location and local politics determine project viability. Gotion’s $2 billion Manteno, Illinois plant began production in late 2024 and has hired approximately 150 employees toward a target of 2,600 workers. The facility converted a former Kmart distribution center into a battery assembly plant producing both EV battery packs and energy storage systems.

Benjamin Howes, Gotion’s head of corporate and public affairs, said the company “remains firmly committed to its mission of driving America’s clean energy future” including at the Illinois facility. The Illinois project received $536 million in state incentives, though it too faced local opposition, including anti-Gotion candidates winning April 2025 municipal elections in Manteno.

The key difference: Illinois officials maintained support through the political turbulence, and manufacturing started before opposition could build sufficient momentum. Michigan’s project never broke ground, allowing resistance to calcify and spread.

Part Of Broader Chinese Battery Retreat From America

Gotion’s Michigan collapse fits a troubling pattern for U.S. battery manufacturing ambitions. EVXL has documented multiple Chinese-backed battery projects failing or stalling in recent months. In June, another Chinese-owned manufacturer AESC halted work on a $2 billion Kentucky plant and paused construction on a separate $1.6 billion South Carolina facility originally designed to supply BMW.

The timing couldn’t be worse for the U.S. EV industry. Federal EV tax credits worth up to $7,500 expired September 30, 2025, eliminated under Trump’s tax reform legislation. The loss of both consumer incentives and manufacturing tax credits has triggered exactly the industry contraction many analysts predicted.

Ford’s Michigan battery plant using CATL technology survived only after months of political battles over Chinese licensing deals. Rivian recently laid off 600 workers—its third workforce reduction in four months—directly citing the expired tax credits and weakening EV demand.

For automakers like Ford and GM racing to build domestic battery capacity, the collapse of Chinese investments leaves a critical gap. Chinese companies including CATL, BYD, and Gotion possess the world’s most advanced battery manufacturing technology and lowest production costs. Without Chinese capital and expertise, American battery production faces both technical challenges and cost disadvantages that could take years to overcome.

EVXL’s Take

We’ve been tracking the slow-motion collapse of Chinese battery investments in America for months, and Gotion’s Michigan failure was entirely predictable. When we covered Ford’s battles over its CATL-licensed Michigan plant back in May, the political writing was already on the wall: Chinese battery technology might be essential to the EV revolution, but Chinese ownership has become politically radioactive.

Here’s what nobody wants to say out loud: America needs Chinese battery technology and manufacturing expertise to build a competitive EV industry, but American politics now make Chinese investment essentially impossible. That’s not a bug, it’s a feature—at least according to lawmakers like Moolenaar who view any Chinese involvement as a national security threat.

The Gotion collapse reveals a deeper problem than just one failed project. Michigan taxpayers are out $23.6 million. Big Rapids lost 2,350 promised jobs that won’t materialize. And the U.S. battery supply chain just lost a major planned supplier at exactly the moment when Trump’s elimination of EV tax credits has automakers scrambling to cut costs and scale back EV production.

This is the same pattern we documented with AESC’s failed Kentucky and South Carolina plants back in June, and with another South Carolina battery plant that halted construction amid policy uncertainty. Foreign battery manufacturers arrive promising jobs and investment, politicians lavish them with subsidies, local opposition erupts over Chinese ownership, federal policy shifts, and projects die. Rinse, repeat. Michigan just added another corpse to the pile.

The timing makes this worse. Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” eliminated the $7,500 EV tax credit effective September 30—just weeks before Michigan pulled the plug on Gotion. That’s not a coincidence. When we covered Rivian’s 600 layoffs earlier this week, we noted how the expired tax credits are forcing EV makers into crisis mode. Now we’re seeing the same policy shift kill battery supply before it even gets built.

Interestingly, back in May we reported on Rivian’s clever move to stockpile Gotion batteries before tariffs hit. That stockpiling now looks prescient—Gotion’s Michigan plant was supposed to supply the U.S. market, but it’ll never produce a single battery cell. Rivian saw this coming.

The Illinois plant’s survival offers a hint: projects that start production before opposition organizes can weather the political storm. But that’s cold comfort for the dozens of announced battery projects that haven’t broken ground yet. If Chinese companies are essentially banned and domestic companies lack the technology and cost structure to compete, who exactly is going to build America’s battery industry?

It’s an honour to be here in Reno, Nevada, speaking as New Zealand’s Minister for Resources and Minister for Regional Development – two closely intersecting portfolios in New Zealand.

I want to thank the organisers of the 2025 Indigenous Geothermal Symposium for the invitation to deliver this keynote address. I would also like to acknowledge the people of Reno-Sparks Indian Colony for undertaking the opening ceremony.

This is a special gathering. Unlike many audiences where geothermal energy must be explained from first principles, here I’m speaking to experts – engineers, researchers, technology providers, and advocates. That allows me to take a broader view: to reflect on geothermal’s past, its cultural significance, and its future potential.

New Zealand is proud to be the world’s fifth-largest producer of geothermal electricity. Our location on the boundary of the Indo-Australian and Pacific tectonic plates gives us access to a world-class geothermal resource.

But our connection to geothermal energy goes far deeper than geology. For Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, waiwhatu – geothermal water—is a taonga, a treasure. It is a place where the physical and spiritual worlds meet. Our tīpuna, or ancestors, used geothermal waters for cooking, healing, and warmth. These practices were not just practical – they were deeply spiritual, rooted in a worldview that sees the land, water, and energy as living entities.

The Pink and White Terraces, once a major attraction in the central North Island before the 1886 volcanic eruption of Mount Tarawera destroyed them, drew visitors from around the world to bathe in their restorative waters. These terraces were more than a tourist destination – they were a symbol of the natural harmony between geothermal energy and human wellbeing.

Rotorua’s spa culture, established in the 1870s, played a vital role in healing injured soldiers returning from war. The geothermal waters were seen as therapeutic, and the region became a centre for rehabilitation and recovery.

This legacy of geothermal use is woven into our national identity. It’s a story of innovation, resilience, and respect for the land.

Globally, geothermal electricity generation began over a century ago in Larderello, Italy. New Zealand engineers visited the site in 1944 and again in 1948, witnessing its rebirth after wartime destruction. Inspired, we began exploratory drilling at Wairākei in 1949, leading to the world’s second geothermal power station – and the first to harness wet steam.

That pioneering spirit continues today. We are a small country but in geothermal science, we have consistently led the way.

Today, geothermal energy is a cornerstone of the Māori economy, and Māori have a long-term vision to enhance their role in New Zealand’s energy sector. Māori have a rich cultural heritage and a deep connection to their land and natural resources. Their identity is rooted in a unique worldview that emphasises the importance of kaitiakitanga, guardianship, over the environment, demonstrated in their commitment to sustainability and community wellbeing.

Many Māori iwi (tribes) own land with significant geothermal potential, particularly in regions like the central North Island. As a result, they’ve become key players in geothermal energy projects, both as resource owners and partners in large-scale ventures.

Investment in geothermal energy supports iwi, hapū, and ahu whenua (land management) trusts, enabling innovation and investment in areas like geothermal aquaculture, horticulture, and tourism.

These ventures are not just economically significant – they are culturally affirming. They allow Māori communities to exercise rangatiratanga, or self-determination, over their resources. They create opportunities for intergenerational wealth, education, and environmental stewardship.

In this way, geothermal energy is helping to shape a future that is both prosperous and culturally grounded.

I’ve been following the statements of US Energy Secretary Chris Wright with great interest. His emphasis on ‘affordable, reliable, and secure energy’ as the foundation of national prosperity resonates deeply.

Globally, energy demand is projected to rise faster than we experienced during the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s. According to the International Energy Agency, electricity use has grown at twice the pace of overall energy demand over the last decade and is projected to rise even faster.

As AI and other technologies drive unprecedented electricity demand, the link between energy and economic strength becomes even more critical.

Secretary Wright’s concept of ‘energy dominance’ highlights the strategic importance of energy policy. I believe we are witnessing a global reset in how geothermal is positioned – especially in countries like the United States, Japan, and New Zealand.

While geothermal accounts for around 20 per cent of New Zealand’s electricity, it contributes less than 1 per cent in the US, despite the US being the largest producer by volume.

Just as the US is advancing its energy transition, New Zealand is developing a national geothermal strategy that aims to unlock the full potential of our geothermal resources to drive energy resilience and support regional and Māori economic development.

The draft strategy, released for public consultation in July, sets the goal of doubling geothermal energy use by 2040, positioning New Zealand as a global leader in sustainable geothermal innovation and supporting our transition to a low-emissions economy.

Let me now turn to supercritical geothermal – sometimes referred to as superdeep or superhot geothermal. In New Zealand, we are investing in proving its viability.

Our Central North Island, home to the Taupō Volcanic Zone, offers extraordinary advantages. Scientific research confirms that supercritical fluids lie just 5–6km, or around three miles, beneath the surface—shallower than in most other regions globally.

Supercritical geothermal has the potential to revolutionise energy generation. These fluids carry vastly more energy than conventional geothermal sources. If harnessed effectively, they could provide baseload renewable energy at a scale comparable to fossil fuels.

We know the risks. We expect challenges. But just as our engineers pioneered wet steam technology in the 1950s, we are backing ourselves to innovate again.

We’ve established a robust governance structure for this programme. Our Kiwi-based team includes top engineers, scientists, and strategic advisors.

Representatives from these groups are here in Reno and eager to connect with you.

We’ve also convened an International Review Panel.

Today I am delighted to announce that Professor Roland Horne of Stanford University has agreed to chair the panel.

As you will know, Professor Horne is one of the world’s foremost geothermal experts and is attending the Geothermal Rising Conference here in Reno. We are delighted he has agreed to lend his expertise and leadership to our project.

I’d also like to welcome the three other highly regarded members of the International Review Panel – Dr Omar Friðleifsson and Mr Kristinn Ingason both from the Iceland Deep Drilling Project. We also warmly welcome to the panel United States geochemist Dr Darrell Gallup of Thermochem Inc.

We are very pleased to have such outstanding engineering and scientific experts join us.

On that note, I would like to say we are inviting other international collaboration – particularly from US companies and researchers. We believe the Taupō Volcanic Zone can serve as a global laboratory for supercritical geothermal.

But this is not just about New Zealand. The information we gather will have global implications. They will inform policy, guide investment, and shape the future of clean energy. Globally, we’re in an energy crisis. We need more clean, renewable energy to support the electrification of transport, industry, and data infrastructure.

Supercritical geothermal offers untapped potential that would be a great step forward for clean, green, sustainable energy. New Zealand is ready to lead – offering decades of geothermal expertise, political stability, a robust regulatory framework, and strong partnerships which our indigenous Māori landowners and communities, for whom geothermal resources are deeply embedded in whakapapa (histories), wairuatanga (identity and spirituality), and tikanga (customs).

We are already seeing interest from Japan, Iceland, and other geothermal-rich nations. The opportunity to share technology, capital, and expertise is immense.

Let me be clear, we are not just drilling wells. We are building a global partnership for energy transformation.

The future of geothermal is bright. With advancing science and deeper collaboration, the opportunities before us are limitless.

We stand at a crossroads. One path leads to incremental change. The other leads to bold innovation, cultural empowerment, and global leadership.

New Zealand has chosen the latter. We invite you to walk it with us.

The event was widely seen as a wake-up call to the dangers of methane and underground natural gas storage.
Aliso Canyon was originally drilled as an oil field in the late 1930s before SoCalGas converted it to natural gas storage in the early 1970s.
Aliso Canyon is one of the largest natural gas storage facilities in the U.S.
Researchers now have a better understanding of what's in the gas that blew from Aliso Canyon and that continues to be stored in natural gas facilities around the country.","On an evening 10 years ago, Porter Ranch resident Matt Pakucko stepped out of his music studio and was walloped by the smell of gas—like sticking your head in an oven, he recalled.

Pakucko called the fire department. It turned out crews had already been up to the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility in the Santa Susana Mountains behind the neighborhood, responding to a report of a leak. Many of his neighbors were beginning to feel ill, reporting issues such as heart palpitations, vomiting, burning eyes and bloody noses.

""I swear I thought I was standing behind a 747 with its engines blowing—it was not just gas, it was an oil smell, it was a chemical smell that permeated,"" recalled Pakucko, who went on to co-found the advocacy group Save Porter Ranch. ""I couldn't stay out there for 30 seconds. It tasted like f— gasoline.""

Soon it was clear that this wasn't just a leak—it was a blowout. Over the course of 112 days, the Aliso Canyon facility would spew an estimated 120,000 tons of methane and toxic chemicals into the atmosphere. It was the worst natural-gas well blowout in U.S. history, and an environmental disaster whose effects will be unpacked for generations.

The event was widely seen as a wake-up call to the dangers of methane and underground natural gas storage. Methane, a planet-warming greenhouse gas, is about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about a quarter of all the human-caused climate change we are experiencing.

A study published by UCLA researchers in September found that women in their final trimester of pregnancy who were living within 6.2 miles downwind of the blowout in 2015 had a nearly 50% higher-than-expected chance of having a low birth-weight baby.

The blowout ushered in a wave of new regulations to strengthen the governance of natural gas storage facilities in California and the United States, as well as new tools and technology to monitor methane emissions.

But 10 years later, some Porter Ranch residents say the wounds still feel fresh, and too many promises have been broken. After the disaster, then-Gov. Jerry Brown called for the permanent closure of Aliso Canyon by 2027—a goal his successor, Gavin Newsom, called a top priority and vowed to meet even sooner.

Instead, Aliso Canyon remains open, with regulators voting in December to continue using the facility for years— probably into the 2030s—citing the need for natural gas to help maintain affordable energy rates and grid reliability in California.

The facility is a key asset for Southern California Gas. In an emailed statement, the company said the state would struggle to meet electricity demand without Aliso Canyon's storage. The site fuels 17 power plants and helps keep the lights on during the hours that can't yet be met by solar, wind and other renewable resources, the company said. Natural gas still represents about 40% of the state's electricity supply.

""There's a lot of work to do to get off natural gas and oil in California,"" said Adam Peltz, senior attorney with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. ""That work is underway, but it's not complete. If you've built an economy on fossil fuels, it takes awhile to get off of it.""

Aliso Canyon was originally drilled as an oil field in the late 1930s before SoCalGas converted it to natural gas storage in the early 1970s. Utilities often use played out crude oil fields as places to pump gas downward under pressure and hold it until it is needed.

Aliso Canyon is one of the largest natural gas storage facilities in the U.S.

In the lead-up to the blowout, SoCalGas was filling the site in preparation for the winter heating season. Crews were using tremendous force to pump gas down a well that was more than 60 years old. But a metal casing on well SS-25 had corroded, and gas began blowing out at very high volumes.

Methane is not visible to the naked eye, but aerial images captured with infrared cameras and released by the Environmental Defense Fund showed a geyser-like eruption of the flammable, climate-changing gas—making it clear to the whole world the magnitude of the disaster.

It took nearly four months for crews to stop the leak. By that time, damage was done. More than 8,000 households were temporarily displaced, businesses were shut down, and two schools were relocated for several months.

Researchers are still working to unpack the health outcomes of the event. SoCalGas, meanwhile, has paid about $2 billion in settlements and agreed to operate the facility at a lower maximum pressure.

Officials with the gas company said they have shored up the facility, including replacing the inner steel tubing on all operating wells and conducting continuous ambient methane monitoring. All wells at the site are subject to real-time pressure readings and visual inspections four times a day, among other protocols, SoCalGas said.

""Over the past 10 years, SoCalGas has conducted comprehensive safety reviews and implemented multiple safety layers that protect one of California's most important assets for energy reliability and affordability,"" the company said.

While the maximum allowable operating pressure at the site remains reduced—about 3,183 pounds per square inch compared with 3,600 pounds per square inch in 2015—state officials recently voted to let SoCalGas increase storage at the facility to 68.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 41 billion cubic feet, outraging many in the community.

But experts say there are silver linings to the disaster. California overhauled its underground natural gas storage regulations to make them the strongest in the nation and among the strongest in the world, according to Peltz, of the Environmental Defense Fund. The changes include more thoughtful rules for well construction, better monitoring and risk management, and improved planning and emergency response.

Congress reacted to the disaster by requiring its regulatory agency, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, to issue safety standards for natural gas storage nationwide. In 2016, it adopted best practices recommended by the American Petroleum Institute, which were strengthened at the beginning of this month.

Many states with natural gas storage previously had no regulations at all, Peltz said.

""On a national basis, the systems will be safer as a result of that change,"" he said.

There have been technological advancements too. The infrared aerial recording of the leak captured in 2015 was a relatively new technique at the time, but has now become commonplace. The California Air Resources Board conducted its first large-scale statewide aerial methane survey in 2016, identifying many of the largest methane sources in the state.

There have also been considerable advancements in the ability to observe methane super-emitters through satellites and remote sensors, according to Seth Shonkoff, executive director at the science research institute PSE Healthy Energy and an associate researcher at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.

""The rub is that we know more than we ever have, and we're perhaps controlling more than we would have if we didn't have the technology to see them, but we're still seeing more and more of these large-scale emission events all across the United States and all across the world,"" he said.

Methane concentrations in the atmosphere are still rising. It is streaming, often constantly, from facilities associated with the oil and gas industry, landfills and dairy farms, among other sources.

Methane isn't the only concern either. Researchers now have a better understanding of what's in the gas that blew from Aliso Canyon and that continues to be stored in natural gas facilities around the country. Although it is primarily composed of methane, roughly 99% of samples analyzed by Shonkoff and his team have contained hazardous air pollutants such as benzene, hexane and toluene, largely as a result of commingling with depleted oil and other subsurface materials.

Moving forward, he said, it will be critically important for gas companies to disclose to regulators and risk managers what their gas is composed of, so that if it leaks, responders can quickly determine the appropriate response.

""If we had had that with Aliso Canyon, we could have, within a matter of hours, understood whether people should get out of the way or stay inside, and we wouldn't have had as many people suffering from health symptoms,"" Shonkoff said.

In 2024, the Biden administration passed the first comprehensive rules to limit methane pollution by fining oil and gas developers for excessive emissions. But this year, the Trump administration revoked the rule, which it described as a tax.

At the same time, many natural gas storage facilities across the country are old and require retrofitting to meet current regulations, but such upgrades can be slow and expensive—often leaving ratepayers on the hook.

Residents near Aliso Canyon have also long feared an earthquake or wildfire in the area. The gas field sits along the Santa Susana fault and is in a high fire hazard severity zone. SoCalGas says it has numerous safety plans and procedures in place.

Perhaps the greatest tension remains between those who wish to see Aliso Canyon shuttered and the officials who say the facility is critically important to California's energy supply, which is increasingly trying to serve power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.

California has committed to reaching 100% carbon neutrality by 2045. But SoCalGas says it still needs Aliso Canyon.

""SoCalGas is aligned with the state of California in pursuing the technologies and infrastructure that supports California's climate plan, including clean renewable hydrogen and renewable natural gas, that could, over time with other renewable energy projects, deliver the reliability and affordability Aliso Canyon supports today,"" the utility said in a statement.

However, any decision to reduce or eliminate operations at Aliso Canyon must be based on genuine reduced demand that is permanent, the company said.

Pakucko, of Save Porter Ranch, noted that the facility was offline for two years after the blowout without an interruption in service.

""Two years!"" he said. ""And guess what? We managed without the facility.""

For others in the area, it feels like the latest in a string of broken promises.

Among SoCalGas's settlement agreements was a $120 million consent decree with the state of California requiring the utility to fund methane mitigation projects, air monitoring and other initiatives to address alleged harms caused by the blowout. About $25 million of that went toward a long-term health study on the effects of natural gas exposure, which is being conducted by researchers at UCLA. The results are eagerly awaited.

About $26 million went to a program for dairy digesters in the Central Valley, which capture methane from cow manure before it enters the atmosphere. Many had hoped those funds would be spent closer to home, including former L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, who at one point envisioned the mitigation money being used to transform Porter Ranch into a net-zero community.

""That would have been so great,"" said Patty Gleuck, a Porter Ranch resident who served on the community advisory group for the health study. Instead, ""that money went to this dairy digester program that does not benefit this area.""

Like Pakucko, Gleuck recalled suffering health effects during the blowout, including a tightness in her chest and a metallic taste in her mouth that dissipated when she left the area and resumed when she returned.

She still suffers from a chronic cough and uses an inhaler, she said, adding that ""a lot of inhalers were prescribed in the area.""

""A lot of people moved away, taking a loss on their homes because they were so sick, or their family members were sick,"" she said. ""I just don't think that there has been justice.""

Dana Investment Narrative Recap

Shareholders in Dana must believe in the company’s ability to convert operational efficiency and electric vehicle content growth into sustained profitability, despite its increased concentration in the North American light vehicle market. The recent decision to close the Detroit and Auburn Hills factories signals near-term turbulence for Dana’s electrification narrative, but the closures do not appear to materially change the most important short-term catalyst: executing on existing backlogs and maintaining cost discipline. The biggest risk remains revenue sensitivity to order reductions among Dana’s largest OEM customers, as recently highlighted by these plant closures.

With these operational headwinds in mind, Dana’s continued declaration of a regular US$0.10 per share quarterly dividend stands out. This consistency could signal management’s commitment to capital returns even as challenges in both the EV segment and OEM demand affect visibility into future earnings streams.

By contrast, investors should be especially aware that the concentration of sales among a smaller group of automaker customers leaves Dana exposed if...

Dana's outlook forecasts $8.1 billion in revenue and $249.2 million in earnings by 2028. This is based on analysts' assumptions of a 6.4% annual revenue decline and an earnings increase of $221.2 million from current earnings of $28.0 million.

, a 24% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Simply Wall St Community members have published two fair value estimates on Dana, ranging from US$15.03 to US$24.57 per share. This variety of views comes as Dana faces elevated risks linked to heavy reliance on a handful of OEM relationships, highlighting how performance assumptions can differ widely among market participants.

In its complaint, ExxonMobil says it has for years publicly disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related business risks, but it fundamentally disagrees with the state’s new reporting requirements.

The company would have to use “frameworks that place disproportionate blame on large companies like ExxonMobil” for the purpose of shaming such companies, the complaint states.

Under Senate Bill 253, large businesses will have to disclose a wide range of planet-warming emissions, including both direct and indirect emissions such as the costs of employee business travel and product transport.

ExxonMobil takes issue with the methodology required by the state, which would focus on a company’s emissions worldwide and therefore fault businesses just for being large as opposed to being efficient, the complaint states.

The second law, Senate Bill 261, requires companies making more than $500 million annually to disclose the financial risks that climate change poses to their businesses and how they plan to address them.

The company said in its complaint that the law would require it to speculate “about unknowable future developments” and post such speculations on its website.

A spokesperson for the office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in an email that it was “truly shocking that one of the biggest polluters on the planet would be opposed to transparency.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/68fd45f85749f8.83462006.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-25 19:03:02.351185

Headquartered in Riyadh, Nextracker Arabia will combine Abunayyan’s 75 years of leadership in water and energy infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the MENA region with U.S.-based Nextracker’s global market share leadership in solar power plant technologies, advanced solar trackers, and yield management and control systems.

Nextracker Arabia will build on the unique experience and expertise in clean energy and solar innovation these two organizations bring to the new joint venture. This combination will best enable the new entity to advance Saudi Arabia’s clean energy transition while helping achieve the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 to diversify the economy and strengthen local industrial capacity.

The joint venture includes sales, engineering, and operations, and will assume ownership of Nextracker’s existing manufacturing facility in the Kingdom. This initial plant will play a key role in the production and distribution of Nextracker’s integrated solar power plant technologies for major utility-scale and distributed generation projects in Saudi Arabia and across the MENA region. These technologies will include Nextracker’s advanced solar trackers, mechanical infrastructure, and yield management and control systems.

Turki Al-Amri, Abunayyan Holding CEO, said, “Nextracker has a proven track record of the highest performing solar power systems. Nextracker Arabia will represent a powerful new platform built on shared values of sustainability and responsibility as well as a commitment to maximizing the potential of solar energy to lead MENA’s clean energy future. Together, we can deliver highly efficient, cost-effective clean energy at scale to help drive long-term social and economic growth in Saudi Arabia and across the region.”

With this new joint venture and initial manufacturing facility, we will build a strong local supply chain that brings production closer to our customers, enhances self-reliance, and delivers the high performance and reliability that our customers value. We are proud to invest in the Kingdom’s clean energy future and Saudi Arabia’s leadership in the energy transition across the MENA region.”

By localizing the sales, engineering, manufacturing and distribution of its products in Saudi Arabia, Nextracker Arabia can most effectively contribute to increasing the important role solar energy will play in helping to achieve national and regional energy transition objectives. Saudi Arabia has a goal of deploying 130 gigawatts of clean energy by 2030, with solar playing a critical role in achieving this objective.

The MENA region is emerging as a global solar energy leader. With increasing cost competitiveness and government-backed clean energy strategies, the region is accelerating its renewable energy transition. According to the Middle East Solar Industry Association (MESIA) 2025 Solar Outlook Report, MENA’s solar capacity could exceed 180 GW by 2030. In 2024 alone, installed capacity reached 24 GWac, up 25% from the previous year, and is expected to surpass 30 GW by year-end.

Nextracker has a strong legacy of reliable performance in Saudi Arabia, starting with KSA’s first utility-scale installation, the 405 MW Sakaka Solar Park where the company’s system has demonstrated exemplary reliability. Partnering with developers in the Middle East and Africa, Nextracker has delivered more than 6 GW of solar projects across the region, including more than 3 GW in Saudi Arabia. Landmark projects with Nextracker systems include 1.17 GW of the Al Kahfah project, the 449 MW Tabarjal project, and 904 MW of the Sudair project.

Turki Al-Amri, Abunayyan Holding’s chief executive officer, is expected to serve as both chairman of the board and chief executive officer for the new joint venture. Rajeev Kashyap, senior vice president and general manager for Nextracker Middle East, India, and Africa (MEIA), is expected to serve as chief operating officer for Nextracker Arabia.

Hyundai's leadership team outlined its plans in New York, reaffirming a commitment to achieving 5.55 million global vehicle sales by 2030, with a large portion of these being electrified.

Speaking at the event, José Muñoz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hyundai Motor Company, detailed Hyundai’s transformation into a global mobility leader.

He said that electrified vehicles are expected to account for 60% of total sales, reaching 3.3 million units, with strong growth forecast in North America, Europe, and Korea. This move towards electrification is a central pillar of Hyundai’s forward-looking vision.

""In an industry facing major transformation, Hyundai is uniquely positioned to win through our unmatched combination of compelling products, manufacturing flexibility, technology leadership, outstanding dealer partners and global scale,” says José.

He adds: “We are delivering comprehensive electrified portfolios across all segments, localising production in key markets and leveraging breakthrough technologies from software-defined vehicles to next-generation batteries.”

Electrification and product portfolio

Hyundai’s strategy reinforces its target of 5.55 million global vehicle sales by 2030, with sustainability goals of EVs reaching 3.3 million units by that year. This includes the introduction of over 18 new hybrid models.

Hyundai also intends to enter one of the industry's largest segments with the launch of its first mid-size pickup truck within the next five years.

A key part of its electric vehicle expansion includes the introduction of Extended Range EV (EREV) models, scheduled for launch in 2027. Unlike conventional approaches, Hyundai’s EREVs will utilise in-house high-performance batteries.

This design could achieve full EV power performance with less than half the battery capacity of some competitors, providing full electrification over a range of more than 600 miles.

Commitment to sustainable manufacturing

These ambitions are aligned with Hyundai’s ‘Progress to Humanity’ vision.

Hyundai says this ""reflects our belief that advancing emissions-free mobility is not only sound business, but a shared responsibility to ensure cleaner air, stronger economies, and a better quality of life for future generations"".

In Hyundai's 2025 Sustainability Report, José discussed this commitment further: “Our commitment to achieving 100% renewable energy (RE100) across our businesses is taking shape through large-scale renewable energy purchase agreements in Korea, the US, and India. We’re also maximising water recycling and working towards our ultimate goal of carbon neutrality by 2045.”

This dedication extends to its manufacturing footprint. José outlined how the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA) is projected to reach a total production capacity of 500,000 units by 2028.

This expansion in Georgia, US, will involve a US$2.7bn investment over three years. Hyundai aims to produce more than 80% of vehicles sold in the US domestically by 2030, a move that will increase supply chain content from 60% to 80%.

Manufacturing improvements also include the implementation of software-defined factories, where software is central to controlling and optimising production processes for greater efficiency.

Luxury brand and financial strategy

Hyundai's luxury brand Genesis is celebrating its 10th anniversary and 1,000,000 cumulative sales. According to José, Genesis aims to reach 350,000 annual sales by 2030, expanding its presence in up to 20 European markets while strengthening US-based production and EREV launches.

Seung Jo (Scott) Lee, Hyundai’s Chief Financial Officer, detailed Hyundai’s financial strategy, which includes an increase in target revenue by 5-6%. Hyundai also adjusted its OPM target to 6-7%. A KRW 77.3tn investment is planned for research and development capital expenditure and strategic investment.

Looking ahead, José reiterated Hyundai's direction: “We’re not just adapting to change - we’re leading it. Through our commitment to electrification, our investment in software-defined vehicles, our focus on manufacturing excellence, and our dedication to treating every customer like an honoured guest, we’re building the mobility company of the future.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/2c87f83d2b1a2ea81dc18dd674d94479:fbc9afb53781f4807757d33c6620d155/mk01.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 19:18:06.445019

The older I get, the more I believe that in most instances, what we’ve often thought to be coincidences — or the referenced “blind porcine” variety — turned out to have been divinely appointed.

A few days ago, tools in hand, I was restoring a screw in the mortar at our front door. From it hangs a small sign for doorbell ringers who’d like to sell us something. The words “No Solicitors” cause some “peddlers” to pass on by. (Would that we could hang such a sign on the telephone to warn us that roofers “happen to be in the area” and inquiries if our home is for sale.) …

As I prepared to re-attach the sign, I noticed a jovial guy ringing doorbells in our cul-de-sac; there was obviously friendly banter during brief doorway conversations. As he approached our abode, I aimlessly asked a four-worded question: “What are you selling?”

He saw the sign, asking, “Do you really want to know? If you’re serious, I’m selling solar power.”

Over the past decade, I’ve had telephone solicitations from companies wanting to “set us up” with solar power, save us money, protect the environment and provide electricity when traditional delivery fails during overloads or damaged power lines. Usually, there was mention that systems would pay for themselves over two or three decades. At my age of 88, I always felt like the guy who was sentenced to 300 years in prison. Hearing the plaintiff confess that he didn’t know if he could live that long, the judge answered, “Just do the best you can.” …

“Our program conversion is provided without charge, saves you money and both delivers and stores electricity,” C. J. Pilling assured as I invited him inside. Despite my haunting too-good-to-be-true fears, he had the right answer to every question.

I called a knowledgeable friend who offered “go-for-it” advice. Sure enough, everything promised has been done on time or sooner, and our new “flat rate” monthly bill is down by 20%. We have all new electrical stuff, with solar panels on the sunny side of the roof. And, there’s more! The first three months of solar power are free.

Turns out that our panels are harnessing more power than we need; it goes back on the grid. With batteries now fully charged, we can withstand black-outs for days at a time. How smug we felt — one week after our new electrical delivery system was operative — when there was a four-hour power failure affecting a thousand homes in our part of the city. We remained “electrified.” …

And, there’s more!

The company maintains warranties and pays insurance on the system. Customers need not own any equipment to get solar and battery benefits.

I’m not used to so many upsides, and my hard-to-convince brother — far better able to detect downsides without sliding into them — is going solar himself.

He lives in Dallas, also near electrical grids vital to the solar program. Sadly, grids are not available in all states, or in all parts of Texas. …

There’s space to mention only a few advantages of solar energy, and I’m discovering more each week.

Further, I know that it’s awkward contacting someone whose job it is to reach you. Contact me if you want more information. This is kinda like bragging about gasoline mileage on an e-car, which, by the way, could be charged nightly at zero cost in my garage. But, I’m not currently fixated on buying a car that plugs in.

Near-Term Growth from Data Centers: Surging power demand from AI and data center customers is driving infrastructure spending and boosting AEP’s regulated rate base.","Overview

American Electric Power (AEP) is one of the biggest publicly traded electric utilities in the US, based out of Columbus, Ohio. Its bread and butter is regulated utility operations—think power generation, transmission, and making sure lights stay on across 11 states. That happens through subsidiaries including AEP Ohio, Indiana Michigan Power, Appalachian Power, and Southwestern Electric Power Company. AEP also runs a transmission division (AEP Transmission), which happens to control the country’s largest high-voltage grid, plus a retail energy branch (AEP Energy) for residential and business customers. Its AEP Renewables wing builds out wind, solar, and hydro projects in line with its aims to cut carbon. The US electric utility sector is known for steady cash flows, a lot of regulation, and big infrastructure spending. AEP competes with other industry heavyweights like NextEra Energy, Duke Energy, and Dominion Energy by leaning on its massive 40,000-mile transmission system and strong state-level ties. Its business model—centered on regulated rates and cost recovery—gives it a sturdy market position. surging energy demand from data centers and the broader electrification trend is creating more opportunities, but AEP still has to navigate regulatory hearings, approval processes, and shifting renewable energy rules.

Recent Performance

From October 2024 to October 2025, AEP shares delivered a 20.25% return, beating the S&P 500’s 16.53% gain. What fueled the outperformance? Strong fundamental results—commercial demand jumped 12.3%, and they exceeded first-quarter EPS targets. Toss in news of a ramped-up capital investment plan and a $1.6 billion Department of Energy loan guarantee for transmission upgrades, and investors clearly liked what they saw. The common thread: AEP’s consistent plan to benefit from soaring power usage, especially thanks to the data center and AI boom.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

AEP’s reported sales grew 6.38% in the past year, a solid showing, though still trailing the market average of 8.73%. Its five-year capital spending plan is being kicked up a notch—from $54 billion to $64 billion, with the possibility of going all the way to $70 billion under new proposals. That’s aimed at modernizing the grid, integrating renewables, and keeping up with the electricity appetite of data centers. Rate hikes tied to these projects—if regulators give the green light—should keep revenue and earnings trending up. On top of that, AEP’s geographic spread over 11 states and its growing fleet of wind and solar assets mean it has more levers for future growth.

Quality & Moat

AEP’s regulated model means reliable cash flows, reflected in its 25.67% operating margin—a notch above the market’s 18.32%. Its 6.84% return on invested capital isn’t high compared to the market average of 11.03%, but that’s typical for heavily regulated, infrastructure-heavy utilities. The management team’s got a reputation for disciplined cash spending, as seen in timely rate filings and cost recovery. Its net debt/EBITDA ratio is high at 5.25 (market average is just 1.41), thanks to big spending on new projects, but it can still comfortably cover its interest under current regulatory rules. Free cash flow has dipped negative (–3.52% yield) as spending accelerates, but AEP should be able to generate healthy cash again once all these upgrades finish and new rates kick in.

Valuation

At a forward P/E of 16.66x, AEP’s stock is priced below the market average (25.95x), offering a potential buffer for risk-averse investors. Its EV/Sales of 5.20x is a bit higher than the market’s 4.55x. That’s a nod to its high-quality regulated assets and predictable future cash flows. The lower-than-market earnings multiple makes sense given AEP’s current period of heavy spending and slow growth. Once these big investments move onto the regulated rate base, there’s a chance valuation could climb closer to industry peers.

Market Sentiment

Market mood is a bit of a mixed bag. AEP’s beta is just 0.17, which makes it one of the most defensive stocks out there with little correlation to the broader market. In the past couple of months, AEP shares have sat about 3.48% above their 50-day moving average, hinting at some gentle upward momentum. Annualized volatility at 15.48% is well below the market’s average of 25.65%, underlining AEP’s steady-as-she-goes profile. Short interest is around 4.1% of the float, with a 6.6-day cover ratio, but it’s actually falling (down 6.3% in the past month), suggesting bears are starting to back off. Institutional holders make up over 85% of the shares, showing broad support from professionals. Insiders own under 0.1%, so management’s interests are lined up with shareholders for the long run.

Key Risks

Regulatory Risk: AEP has to play by the rules in rate-regulated markets. Any unfavorable rulings from state Public Utility Commissions or federal regulators on allowed returns or how costs get passed to customers could hit revenues and profit margins.

Leverage and Interest Rates: AEP’s net debt/EBITDA of 5.25x is a lot higher than your typical company. If interest rates go up or AEP faces tough refinancing conditions, its cost of borrowing could rise and its free cash flow could tighten.

Execution of Capex Plan: Pumping $64–70 billion into new projects is no small feat. There’s always the chance of delays, higher costs than expected, or slow-moving approvals from regulators, all of which could weigh down returns.

Commodity and Operational Risks: Most of the business is shielded by regulation, but AEP still has exposure to swings in fuel costs for gas-powered plants, extreme weather disruptions, and risks linked to keeping the grid reliable.

Bull Case

Stable Regulated Cash Flows: With predictable revenue and earnings from its cost-plus rate structure, AEP protects margins and limits how much downturns can hurt.

Near-Term Growth from Data Centers: Surging power demand from AI and data center customers is driving infrastructure spending and boosting AEP’s regulated rate base.

Undemanding Valuation: A forward P/E of 16.7x gives AEP a valuation cushion compared to both its peers and the wider market.

Strong Transmission Network: Owning the nation’s largest high-voltage transmission system lets AEP benefit from FERC-approved returns—a durable competitive strength.

Defensive Profile: Low beta (0.17) and below-average volatility (15.5%) make this stock attractive for investors who want income and peace of mind.

Bear Case

Heavy Capital Expenditure: Spending heavily on new infrastructure in the near-term could keep free cash flow negative and leverage high, delaying any major credit improvements.

Regulatory Uncertainty: AEP’s ability to turn investment into profit depends on favorable rate cases. Rulings that cut allowed returns or refuse cost recovery could put a lid on earnings growth.

Modest Growth Prospects: Sales growth around 6.4% is solid for a utility, but it trails the broader market. That limits AEP’s prospects for getting awarded higher valuation multiples.

Low ROIC: Return on invested capital is below the market average, typical for utilities, but it does raise questions about how efficiently management is using shareholders’ money.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings Release: Expected around November 6, 2025. The big things to watch: updated EPS, new guidance on capex, and any updates on ongoing rate cases.

FERC Transmission Rate Case: A key decision on AEP Transmission’s cost-of-service filing is due in late 2025, which will set allowed returns on new and existing grid investments.

State Rate Cases: Pending decisions in Ohio and Texas about rate adjustments tied to grid upgrades. Expect outcomes in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Capital Plan Announcement: AEP will formally unveil its $64–$70 billion five-year capex plan in November 2025, with detailed timelines on what gets built when.

Investment Conclusion

For patient, income-focused investors, AEP offers a way to tap into steady, regulated cash flows, bolstered by its low volatility, defensive profile, and robust transmission network. Its shares look attractively priced relative to the broader market. That said, the utility is in a period of heavy investment, with leverage running high and a fair bit hanging on getting regulatory approvals right. Anyone thinking about adding AEP to their portfolio should weigh the reliability of its dividend income and growth against the risk that regulatory or execution hiccups could make free cash flow tight or slow down earnings progress.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-10-25 18:18:31.938291

“We have found that some of the suppliers were not aware that their neighbors or their suppliers are based in the region. Some within a few miles, some several miles away. They did not know,” Carrera explained. “It is a win-win because some of these companies were getting their raw materials from suppliers outside the state. So it's been a very positive outcome, one that we thought might happen.”

Carrera added: “We weren't doing this (the Binational Autocluster project) to get into the matchmaking business, but we're more than happy to help that process out.”

The RGG Business Journal secured an interview with Carrera at the end of a South Texas Manufacturers Association meeting that was held at the Harlingen Convention Center.

The executive director of STMA, Mike Willis, had asked Carrera if he had any updates to share with the audience. He did. He spoke about the early success of the Binational Autocluster project.

Willis then explained to the audience what COSTEP is and what the Binational Autocluster project is all about.

""For those of you who are not familiar, COSTEP is a regional economic development group. They go to trade shows all over the world. They try to attract companies to our region,"" Willis said.

""They are trying to map out information about all the companies on both sides of the river that are in the automotive business to help show that to foreign prospects to try to see what kind of supply chain they could have if they located to northern Tamaulipas or especially the Rio Grande Valley. So, that is what that is for.”

In his in-depth interview with the Business Journal, Carrera also spoke about his attendance of the 50th National INDEX Convention, held in Mexico City. He said it was an excellent convention. INDEX is the trade association of the maquiladora industry in Mexico.

Carrera also spoke about a site selector conference he will be attending soon in Orlando, Florida.

Here, below, is an audio recording of the interview. It includes an introduction by STMA’s Willis.

Memorandum of Understanding

Meanwhile, at the INDEX convention in Mexico City that Carrera was talking about, COSTEP signed a Memorandum of Understanding.

The agreement, with INDEX Nacional, seeks to enhance competitiveness, attract investment, and foster industrial development along the Rio South Texas–Tamaulipas corridor, or Rio South Texas, as COSTEP calls it.

Adam Gonzalez, COSTEP’s CEO, said the signing formalizes decades of cross-border collaboration between the maquiladora industry in northern Mexico and economic development organizations of South Texas. He said both institutions share a common vision: to promote sustainable industrial growth, technological innovation, and binational workforce development as drivers of regional prosperity.

“Our region has grown shoulder to shoulder with INDEX — not just through trade, but through projects, shared families, and a shared commitment to progress,” Gonzalez said. “This MOU represents our pledge to continue working together to attract investment, accelerate binational development, and strengthen the manufacturing ecosystem that sustains thousands of families on both sides of the border.”

Humberto Martínez is president of INDEX Nacional. He said the MOU highlighted reinforces a long-term strategy for competitiveness.

“The future of our region will not be built in isolation, but through collaboration,” Martínez. “This partnership with COSTEP ensures that our industry continues to expand, innovate, and generate opportunities in a global environment increasingly shaped by nearshoring.”",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/riogrande/original/20251025-164559-d0a-Rick_Carrera.JPG,N,,2025-10-25 20:03:57.742619

Hydropower contributed 27 percent of total U.S. utility-scale renewable electricity generation and 5.86 percent of total utility-scale electricity production in 2024. The U.S. first started developing its hydropower fleet in the late 1800s, long before other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.

Hydropower plants produce electricity using the elevation difference created by a dam or diversion structure. Water flows in one side and exits at a lower point, spinning a turbine, which runs a generator to produce electricity. However, of the more than 90,000 dams in the United States, fewer than 3 percent produce power, with the others being used for recreation, farm ponds, flood control, water supply, and irrigation.

While there is huge potential for hydropower in the United States, many of the existing facilities are getting older and more expensive to maintain. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was launched under the Biden administration provides $753.6 million to the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) for hydropower, but significantly more funding would be required to expand rather than solely maintain the country’s hydropower capacity.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects hydropower generation to rise by 7.5 percent in 2025, after falling by 241 billion kilowatt-hours (BkWh) in 2024, to its lowest generation since 2010. Generation is expected to reach 259.1 BkWh this year, to contribute around 6 percent of U.S. electricity production. Approximately half of the hydropower generating capacity in the U.S. is in the western states of Washington, Oregon, and California.

Energy experts suggest that now may be a make-or-break moment for hydropower, as several existing facilities require high quantities of funding to extend their lifespans. Almost 450 hydroelectric plants, which contribute over 16 GW of electricity in total, are due to be relicensed across the U.S. over the next 10 years. This accounts for around 40 percent of non-federal hydropower.

However, the introduction of stricter requirements will require millions of dollars to be spent on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit for existing facilities, which is forcing many companies to close operations. Many of these plants have been providing vast quantities of stable, clean electricity for decades. However, the falling costs associated with natural gas, wind, and solar power have made it increasingly difficult for hydropower to compete.

Most dams in the U.S. have an average age of 65 years, meaning they were built without the same consideration for the environment that is now expected for hydropower development. Upgrading old facilities to enable the unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife, as well as meeting other environmental standards, would be extremely expensive for operators. In addition, many of these facilities require significant investment to fix or replace turbines and other hardware that have atrophied over time.

Another barrier to relicensing is the lack of clear oversight for the sector. No single agency has full authority over hydropower. This can make the bureaucratic process for a new license extremely complex, as various agencies may have different standards and expectations for operators. At present, it takes an average of eight years to relicense an existing hydropower facility, which is far longer than for other energy sources.

In January, the Biden administration’s Treasury Department expanded a renewable energy rule to include hydropower, which treats facilities as new if operators reinvest a minimum of 80 percent of the facility’s market value into infrastructure upgrades, making them eligible for larger federal write-offs. Only one hydropower facility has used the federal investment tax credit to date, as, until recently, there was a lack of clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.

While President Trump has been highly critical of many renewable energy sources, hydropower is one of the few clean energies that Trump appears to support. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act preserves the sector’s access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years, which could help reassure investors.

There have been some positive signs for the hydropower sector in recent months, with the signing of a $3 billion hydropower deal between Google and Brookfield Asset Management in July. Google hopes the project will provide up to 3 GW of hydropower for its data centres. The move includes 20-year power purchase agreements for two hydropower facilities in Pennsylvania. The two sites are expected to be upgraded and relicensed as part of the arrangement, and Google aims to eventually expand the deal beyond the two initial sites to other parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, the company said.

“This collaboration with Brookfield is a significant step forward, ensuring clean energy supply in the PJM region where we operate,” Google’s head of data centre energy, Amanda Peterson Corio, said in a statement.

To enable hydropower plants to continue providing a significant proportion of the United States’ clean electricity, significant funding must be contributed to the sector to make facilities eligible for relicensing. Many plants require millions of dollars in upgrades, which most operators simply cannot afford. Meanwhile, the falling cost of gas, solar, and wind power has made hydropower less competitive in recent years, despite its long history in the U.S. and significant contribution to the country’s clean energy mix.

,EVs,2025-10-25 20:02:51+00:00,EVXL.co,Read Rivian CEO's Memo On 600+ Layoffs: What He Said—And What He Didn't,"Haye Kesteloo, www.facebook.com, haye.kesteloo",,,,,https://evxl.co/2025/10/25/read-rivian-ceos-memo-on-600-layoffs/,"Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe sent an internal memo to employees Thursday announcing the company’s third workforce reduction in four months, cutting roughly 600 jobs as the electric vehicle maker struggles with collapsed post-tax-credit demand.
The Memo: Corporate Speak Meets Crisis Management In the memo viewed by Business Insider, Scaringe framed the cuts as strategic positioning rather than desperate measures.
The memo outlined two primary organizational changes, both affecting customer-facing functions that generate no revenue during Rivian’s current production constraints.
Yet Scaringe’s memo reads like a routine organizational efficiency exercise, complete with org-chart minutiae about which VP reports to which interim executive.
The corporate euphemisms—“structural adjustments,” “changing operating backdrop,” “scaling our go-to-market functions”—carefully avoid the uncomfortable truth that Rivian is in crisis mode.","Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe sent an internal memo to employees Thursday announcing the company’s third workforce reduction in four months, cutting roughly 600 jobs as the electric vehicle maker struggles with collapsed post-tax-credit demand. The carefully worded message emphasized “structural adjustments” for the upcoming R2 launch while conspicuously avoiding the financial crisis threatening the company’s survival.

The layoffs—affecting approximately 4.5% of Rivian’s 15,000-person workforce—come just one day after Scaringe promoted the company’s ALSO e-bike spinoff to media, highlighting the jarring contrast between Rivian’s public optimism and private cost-cutting. The timing speaks volumes about the EV startup’s precarious position as it races to launch the $45,000 R2 SUV in early 2026 while burning through what remains of its once-massive cash reserves.

The Memo: Corporate Speak Meets Crisis Management

In the memo viewed by Business Insider, Scaringe framed the cuts as strategic positioning rather than desperate measures. “With the launch of R2 in front of us and the need to profitably scale our business, we have made the very difficult decision to make a number of structural adjustments to our teams,” he wrote. “These changes result in a reduction in the size of our team by roughly 4.5%.”

The CEO acknowledged the human cost with measured corporate language: “These are not changes that were made lightly. With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions. This news is challenging to hear, and the hard work and contributions of the team members who are leaving are greatly appreciated.”

But what’s most revealing isn’t what Scaringe said—it’s what he carefully avoided mentioning. The memo makes zero reference to the September 30 expiration of federal EV tax credits, which eliminated up to $7,500 in savings for new EV buyers under President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.” It doesn’t acknowledge this is the third layoff round since June. And it certainly doesn’t mention that Rivian has burned through more than $12 billion since its 2021 IPO, with less than $6 billion remaining and quarterly losses exceeding $1 billion.

Reorganization Details: Streamlining or Scrambling?

The memo outlined two primary organizational changes, both affecting customer-facing functions that generate no revenue during Rivian’s current production constraints.

Customer Operations Consolidation: Scaringe announced integrating Vehicle Operations into the Service organization “to create fewer customer handoffs and clearer ownership.” Delivery and Mobile Operations will fold into Sales “to ensure the purchase experience is as seamless as possible with a single touchpoint throughout the entire sales process and to delivery.”

Marketing Restructure: Perhaps most telling, Rivian is consolidating multiple marketing functions into a single organization while searching for its first Chief Marketing Officer. Until that hire, Scaringe will serve as interim CMO—adding another executive role to his plate while the company fights for survival. “While we recruit our first Chief Marketing Officer, I will be acting as Interim CMO,” he wrote.

The CEO specifically named two teams reporting directly to him during the transition: the Marketing Experiences team led by Denise Cherry and the Creative Studio team under Matt Soldan. This level of detail about org-chart reshuffling while cutting hundreds of jobs reads more like damage control than strategic vision.

What The Memo Conveniently Omits

The Wall Street Journal first reported the layoffs Thursday, noting they primarily target sales, marketing, and customer service departments—leaving manufacturing operations untouched as Rivian prepares for R2 production ramp-up at its Normal, Illinois facility.

What Scaringe’s memo doesn’t mention is the broader context EVXL readers already know well. We’ve been documenting Rivian’s mounting struggles for months:

These cuts follow a 10% workforce reduction in February 2024 and additional layoffs in June

Rivian reported a $1.115 billion net loss in Q2 2025 on just 10,661 deliveries

The company announced a $250 million IPO fraud settlement the same day as these layoffs

Third-quarter 2025 EV sales hit records as buyers rushed to claim tax credits before the September 30 deadline, but that temporary spike masked the coming demand cliff

The memo’s reference to a “changing operating backdrop” is corporate euphemism for “federal tax credits that propped up our industry just vanished, and we’re about to find out if anyone will pay $45,000 for an R2 without government subsidies.”

The R2 Gambit: All-In On Affordable EVs

Scaringe called the R2 “an inflection point for us to become a company of the scale we aspire to be, which is producing many millions of cars a year” during Wednesday’s ALSO unveiling event. That ambitious vision contrasts sharply with Thursday’s workforce cuts targeting the very departments needed to sell those millions of vehicles.

The R2 launches in the first half of 2026 with a targeted starting price of $45,000, positioning it against the Tesla Model Y and Ford Mustang Mach-E in the competitive compact electric SUV segment. Rivian delivered 13,200 vehicles in the third quarter—a 32% year-over-year increase—but narrowed its full-year guidance to 41,500-43,500 units amid post-tax-credit uncertainty.

The company maintains it has sufficient capital to reach R2 production, bolstered by Volkswagen’s $5 billion joint venture investment. But with quarterly losses exceeding $1 billion and production volumes still in the low tens of thousands, Rivian is betting everything on the R2 resonating with mainstream buyers who no longer receive thousands in federal incentives.

EVXL’s Take

Let’s decode what’s really happening here. Rivian just announced its third workforce reduction in four months—a 4.5% cut following previous rounds that already slashed more than 10% of staff. The company settled a $250 million fraud lawsuit the same morning it sent this memo. And it’s burning through its remaining $6 billion in cash at more than $1 billion per quarter while producing vehicles in the low five figures.

Yet Scaringe’s memo reads like a routine organizational efficiency exercise, complete with org-chart minutiae about which VP reports to which interim executive. The corporate euphemisms—“structural adjustments,” “changing operating backdrop,” “scaling our go-to-market functions”—carefully avoid the uncomfortable truth that Rivian is in crisis mode.

This isn’t restructuring. This is a company desperately trying to reach the R2 launch with enough cash and credibility intact to convince consumers they’ll be around to honor warranties. The fact that Scaringe is taking on the interim CMO role himself while searching for a permanent hire suggests either leadership churn or an inability to attract top talent to a sinking ship—or both.

We’ve seen this movie before with EV startups. Lordstown Motors collapsed. Fisker filed for bankruptcy. Lucid keeps cutting staff while surviving on Saudi money. The difference is Rivian actually builds compelling vehicles and has a legitimate manufacturing operation. But compelling vehicles don’t matter if you run out of money before reaching profitable scale.

The R2 at $45,000 without tax credits needs to be good enough to steal significant market share from Tesla, Ford, and Hyundai. That’s a massive ask for a company that’s never turned a profit, just cut hundreds of customer-facing employees, and is asking its CEO to moonlight as CMO while running product development and operations.

Read Scaringe’s memo carefully. Notice what he emphasizes—organizational efficiency, R2 preparation, streamlined customer journeys. Then notice what he doesn’t mention—the third layoff round in four months, the collapsed tax credit support, the $250 million fraud settlement announced the same day, or the very real possibility that Rivian might not survive to see the R2’s second model year.

The corporate messaging is masterful. The underlying reality is terrifying.

Water flows in one side and exits at a lower point, spinning a turbine, which runs a generator to produce electricity. However, of the more than 90,000 dams in the United States, fewer than 3 percent produce power, with the others being used for recreation, farm ponds, flood control, water supply, and irrigation.

While there is huge potential for hydropower in the United States, many of the existing facilities are getting older and more expensive to maintain. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was launched under the Biden administration provides $753.6 million to the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) for hydropower, but significantly more funding would be required to expand rather than solely maintain the country's hydropower capacity.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects hydropower generation to rise by 7.5 percent in 2025, after falling by 241 billion kilowatt-hours (BkWh) in 2024, to its lowest generation since 2010. Generation is expected to reach 259.1 BkWh this year, to contribute around 6 percent of U.S. electricity production. Approximately half of the hydropower generating capacity in the U.S. is in the western states of Washington, Oregon, and California.

Energy experts suggest that now may be a make-or-break moment for hydropower, as several existing facilities require high quantities of funding to extend their lifespans. Almost 450 hydroelectric plants, which contribute over 16 GW of electricity in total, are due to be relicensed across the U.S. over the next 10 years. This accounts for around 40 percent of non-federal hydropower.

However, the introduction of stricter requirements will require millions of dollars to be spent on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit for existing facilities, which is forcing many companies to close operations. Many of these plants have been providing vast quantities of stable, clean electricity for decades. However, the falling costs associated with natural gas, wind, and solar power have made it increasingly difficult for hydropower to compete.

Most dams in the U.S. have an average age of 65 years, meaning they were built without the same consideration for the environment that is now expected for hydropower development. Upgrading old facilities to enable the unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife, as well as meeting other environmental standards, would be extremely expensive for operators. In addition, many of these facilities require significant investment to fix or replace turbines and other hardware that have atrophied over time.

Another barrier to relicensing is the lack of clear oversight for the sector. No single agency has full authority over hydropower. This can make the bureaucratic process for a new license extremely complex, as various agencies may have different standards and expectations for operators. At present, it takes an average of eight years to relicense an existing hydropower facility, which is far longer than for other energy sources.

In January, the Biden administration's Treasury Department expanded a renewable energy rule to include hydropower, which treats facilities as new if operators reinvest a minimum of 80 percent of the facility's market value into infrastructure upgrades, making them eligible for larger federal write-offs. Only one hydropower facility has used the federal investment tax credit to date, as, until recently, there was a lack of clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.

While President Trump has been highly critical of many renewable energy sources, hydropower is one of the few clean energies that Trump appears to support. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act preserves the sector's access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years, which could help reassure investors.

There have been some positive signs for the hydropower sector in recent months, with the signing of a $3 billion hydropower deal between Google and Brookfield Asset Management in July. Google hopes the project will provide up to 3 GW of hydropower for its data centres. The move includes 20-year power purchase agreements for two hydropower facilities in Pennsylvania. The two sites are expected to be upgraded and relicensed as part of the arrangement, and Google aims to eventually expand the deal beyond the two initial sites to other parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, the company said.

""This collaboration with Brookfield is a significant step forward, ensuring clean energy supply in the PJM region where we operate,"" Google's head of data centre energy, Amanda Peterson Corio, said in a statement.

To enable hydropower plants to continue providing a significant proportion of the United States' clean electricity, significant funding must be contributed to the sector to make facilities eligible for relicensing. Many plants require millions of dollars in upgrades, which most operators simply cannot afford. Meanwhile, the falling cost of gas, solar, and wind power has made hydropower less competitive in recent years, despite its long history in the U.S. and significant contribution to the country's clean energy mix.

When construction begins, this project is set to transform global perceptions of solar energy. Abu Dhabi has launched the world’s first gigascale renewable energy facility capable of providing continuous, “24 hours a day, 365 days a year” electricity using only solar power paired with massive battery storage. The facility is designed to meet the surging, overwhelming demand for reliable power in the AI era and support the next industrial wave, ensuring uninterrupted electricity for advanced technologies, data centres, and the innovations shaping the future. H.H. Sheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Chairman of the Presidential Court for Development and Fallen Heroes’ Affairs, oversaw the groundbreaking of the facility, which combines 5.2 gigawatts (GW) of solar photovoltaic panels with a 19-gigawatt-hour (GWh) battery storage system, capable of generating a full 1 GW of continuous baseload power.

What makes this project a world first

The sheer size is only part of the story. Traditional renewable energy faces a simple but stubborn problem: intermittency. Solar panels only produce electricity when the sun shines, and wind turbines when the wind blows. Until now, that has limited renewables’ ability to provide stable baseload power, forcing grids to rely on fossil fuels. This Abu Dhabi project overcomes that limitation through a combination of technological innovations at scale:

Gigascale battery storage: The 19 GWh system stores solar energy produced during peak sunlight in the day and releases it consistently through night-time and cloudy periods.

Grid-forming and black start capability: The system can stabilise the grid independently and even restart it if the network fails, ensuring unparalleled reliability.

Virtual power plant operation: It functions as a coordinated network of distributed resources, optimising energy dispatch across the site in real time.

AI-driven forecasting and intelligent dispatch: Advanced algorithms predict solar output and energy demand, managing the battery automatically to maintain uninterrupted supply.

Together, these features allow renewable energy to function as a true replacement for conventional baseload power plants, rather than just a supplementary source.

Scale and impact

The project spans roughly 1.5 times the size of Manhattan, covering 90 square kilometres (34.75 square miles) in the desert of Abu Dhabi, with a capital investment exceeding AED 22 billion (USD 5.94 billion). Once operational in 2027, it is expected to:

Create over 10,000 jobs and establish new manufacturing facilities.

Avoid approximately 5.7 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually, equivalent to removing more than a million cars from circulation.

Deliver electricity at a globally competitive tariff, demonstrating that renewables can be both sustainable and economically viable.

This facility is not only a national milestone but also a blueprint for countries worldwide aiming to decarbonise while meeting the rising demand for digital and AI-driven technologies, which require a steady, uninterrupted power supply.

A blueprint for the future

Developed by Masdar in partnership with Emirates Water and Electricity Company (EWEC), the project builds on Masdar’s two decades of experience in renewable energy across more than 40 countries. By 2030, the company aims to achieve a 100 GW global clean energy portfolio. This Abu Dhabi project represents Masdar’s largest and most technologically ambitious initiative to date, proving that renewable energy can be scaled intelligently, reliably, and sustainably. In the words of the developers, the facility is more than a solar farm or a giant battery — it is a new standard for global energy innovation, capable of delivering consistent power for the information age and supporting the next generation of technological growth.

Every time the wind stops blowing, turbines stand still. For decades, this simple reality that renewable energy only works when nature cooperates has been the industry's most logically stubborn obstacle.

Abu Dhabi broke ground on what could be the solution. The emirate just launched construction on the world's first gigascale project capable of delivering round-the-clock baseload power from renewable sources alone. When operational in 2027, the Dh22-billion facility will produce one gigawatt of continuous clean electricity—enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes by pairing what will become the world's largest battery storage system.

The scale is staggering: The project spans an area comparable to Manhattan and features a 19-gigawatt-hour battery—large enough to store energy generated during peak sunlight and dispatch it seamlessly through the night and cloudy days. It's the energy equivalent of never letting the lights flicker, regardless of the weather.

""This project aligns with the UAE's leadership vision to decarbonise and innovate,"" Ibraheem Al Mansouri, Director of Engineering at Masdar, told Khaleej Times. ""This marks the start of a new era for renewable energy globally.""

Sheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Chairman of the Presidential Court for Development and Fallen Heroes' Affairs, witnessed the groundbreaking of the facility developed by Masdar and Emirates Water and Electricity Company.

The timing addresses a critical global challenge. Renewable energy intermittency has limited solar and wind adoption because the bulk power system requires continuous current to literally ""keep the lights on."" Traditional power plants burn coal or gas around the clock, providing stable baseload power. Solar and wind couldn’t do that until this project.

""Being part of Masdar's journey from the early days and continuing to deliver first-of-its-kind projects globally is inspiring,"" Al Mansouri told Khaleej Times. ""This project changes the mindset about renewable energy and proves what's possible.""

Development will create more than 10,000 jobs and establish new manufacturing facilities across the UAE. The project represents one of the largest capital investments in renewable infrastructure globally.

The breakthrough builds on Masdar's two-decade track record developing renewable projects across 40 countries. Founded in 2006, the company is targeting 100 gigawatts of clean energy capacity by 2030. This Abu Dhabi facility represents its largest and most ambitious project to date.

When operational in 2027, the project will avoid approximately 5.7 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually equivalent to removing over one million cars from roads while delivering electricity at globally competitive tariffs.

This summer, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, ending various tax credits a decade ahead of schedule. The credits could be used to buy electric vehicles and to install solar panels on homes.

The EV tax credit expired last month. Residential solar tax credits are still available until the end of the year. But Kathy Kuntz, director of Dane County’s Office of Energy and Climate Change, told WPR’s “Wisconsin Today” that it’s unlikely people will be able to qualify for the credits in time unless they’ve already started the process.

“There’s a difference between buying a car and getting solar on your roof,” she said. “You can go to a dealership and buy a car in a couple of hours. It takes more planning to have all of the pieces in place, the permits and everything, to install solar on your house.”

“If people haven’t started yet, it’s probably not realistic for them to take advantage of the solar tax credits at this point,” she added. “If an installer is telling you ‘no problem’ and that they can get this done by the end of the year, you need to be a smart consumer and ask a lot of questions.”

Kuntz said most solar companies her office talks with are saying they’re booked through the year.

Burke O’Neal is a managing partner for Full Spectrum Solar, a solar installation company based in Madison. He told “Wisconsin Today” that the cancellation of the solar energy tax credits is hurting his business.

“It’s certainly been a bit challenging to change course,” O’Neal said. “We were expecting the residential and commercial tax credits through 2032. We were planning additional vehicle and tool purchases and adding electrical and roof installation crews, and we’re still planning to grow but it’s going to be at a slower pace than we expected.”

O’Neal said his company is offering a 5 percent discount to people if they schedule solar installations next year instead of this year to “keep the momentum going.”

Even without solar tax credits, Kuntz said there’s still an economic incentive for installing solar panels. She said the cost of installing solar panels has dropped by 90 percent since the early 2000s. She also said it’s a similar case with EVs becoming more cost-competitive with gas-powered cars.

O’Neal is trying to stay optimistic. He said energy costs for residential homes are up 35 percent in the last four years but solar installation costs remain stable. And as massive data centers around the country continue to drive up the demand and cost for electricity, O’Neal expects solar installations will remain popular.

“Maybe we’re a lot more resilient than we first felt when we learned about these (tax credit) changes,” he said.

The installations will eventually supply approximately 152,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of clean energy per month. This will enable the bank to reduce its monthly carbon footprint by over 89,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO₂).

""This partnership reflects our mission to enable African businesses to access sustainable power through innovative financing,"" said Terje Osmundsen, CEO of Empower.

Empower is among several actors expanding Norway's presence in African renewable energy. The company has already participated in several projects in Nigeria, including electrifying the Justrite retail chain. Its model addresses the growing corporate demand for reliable power solutions amid unstable public grids and the high cost of running diesel generators.

The deal with UBA underscores the growing adoption of solar power in Africa's private sector and strengthens Empower's position in the Nigerian market.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/03b2e34ee32779eb65b4bf5945debfd6_S.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 17:18:09.920808

Speakers in Friday's symposium offered a similar prescription for addressing strain on water infrastructure: working with data center operators and developers to reduce water use, flatten out swings in demand, and reduce strain on infrastructure.","LOWER SAUCON TWP., Pa. — As a surge of data center construction strains power and water infrastructure, experts met at Lehigh University’s Mountaintop Campus on Friday to prepare for a once-in-a-generation strain on — and potentially transformation of — these critical systems.

Before Friday’s guest speakers began their lectures and panel discussions, university Provost Nathan Urban took a moment to set the stage.

Urban referenced the Mountaintop Campus building where the symposium took place. Now Iacocca Hall, it was once the Homer Research Laboratories Complex, home to Bethlehem Steel’s most cutting-edge research and development projects.

The campus and the innovation it incubated were a powerful engine of last century’s economy, Urban said, while the buildings housing the beating heart of the next era of U.S. economic might well be data centers.

Supplying these new powerhouses will take difficult-to-comprehend amounts of water and electricity, plus careful management and thoughtful development.

Making it work could shape Pennsylvania’s economic outlook for decades to come.

“It's a complex puzzle, but one that I believe we can solve,"" Urban said. ""The conversations we have today are about more than servers and algorithms and electricity generation.

""They are about shaping a sustainable and prosperous future for the commonwealth.”

And those data centers are hungry. Depending on how it is configured, a midsize data center can use as much power and water as a small city.

As developers and technology companies stand up new data centers to supply the computing power undergirding the explosion of artificial intelligence, power and water infrastructure are already under pressure, showing no signs of easing.

Power demands

One of the greatest challenges for the grid, panelists said, will be bringing on enough power generation to meet surging demand.

PJM Interconnection, the organization responsible for balancing energy supply and demand across 13 states including Pennsylvania, expects 32 gigawatts of new electricity demand across the network over the next five years.

About 30 gigawatts of that demand, PJM Senior Director of Applied Innovation and Analytics Emanuel Bernabeu said, comes from new data centers.

PPL Electric Utilities expects to more than triple its peak load over the next 10 years, from about 7.5 gigawatts to nearly 22 gigawatts.

By comparison, from 2007 to 2023, average electricity demand stayed flat as efficiency improvements roughly matched growth.

The U.S. electric grid is already struggling with enough generation capacity, leading to higher costs and more frequent emergency alerts declaring that all of the grid’s power plants are running at full capacity.

Companies that build and operate power plants selling electricity to the grid have not stepped in to fill the gap, several panelists said.

Building a new power plant is a slow and expensive process.

While it may only take a year and a half to two years to build a data center, a new power plant can take two to three times as long to bring online.

The queue for new power plants to join the PJM grid is full through 2030. Currently, the grid controller has signed off on projects adding about 50 gigawatts of generation capacity.

With no silver bullet to quickly add more power to the grid, officials responsible for managing electric infrastructure must look for ways to reduce or shift power consumption.

For example, different cooling technology may help reduce power consumption at the cost of greater water consumption.

Giant batteries can give data center operators a way to draw less power from the grid during periods of peak demand. If data centers plan ahead, they can shift non-essential work to parts of the day when they aren’t competing with, say, residential air conditioning for limited electricity.

To combat limited supply and get projects up and running faster, some data center operators opt to build their own generators, either to supplement a typical power connection or to replace it entirely.

Utility companies may not have the legal authority to force their customers to take power cuts or shift operations to times when electricity is less scarce. Instead, grid managers rely on market forces to influence behavior and keep the supply of electricity in line with demand.

When there is not enough energy to meet demand, power prices rise. As a result, electricity users try to shift or minimize use; power plants may adjust how many generators they have online.

Because the venture-capital-backed companies standing up these new data centers are so flush with cash, price-based incentives do not accomplish much, Bernabeu said, whether that's higher peak power prices or multi-million-dollar payments to secure a grid connection.

Instead, he said, these operators are more motivated by getting up and running as quickly as possible.

Utilities and grid operators will see more success building reliable energy infrastructure by working to connect customers faster if they take steps like coordinating onsite battery storage, contributing their own power generation or allowing power to be cut off in a supply crunch, Bernabeu said.

The same AI technology threatening to overwhelm the electric grid could also help protect it, as machine learning helps operators better predict demand, model the electric grid’s behavior and deal with heavy loads.

Water needs

Data centers can also strain water resources, as the facilities can use as much as three million gallons of water per day to cool its chips, said Tony Nokovich, vice president of engineering for Pennsylvania American Water.

Much of this water evaporates in the process, so large data centers must continuously replace water as it is lost.

However, a data center’s water use can vary widely depending on the temperature outside, dropping to as little as 800 gallons per day during the winter, Nokovich said.

Huge swings in water use can harm water quality, as customers draw too little water to keep pipes from stagnating, or draw too much and lower pressure in the system.

Speakers in Friday's symposium offered a similar prescription for addressing strain on water infrastructure: working with data center operators and developers to reduce water use, flatten out swings in demand, and reduce strain on infrastructure.

Pennsylvania’s water infrastructure faced a similar explosion of demand with the beginning of the shale fracking boom about a decade and a half ago.

The fracking process requires large amounts of water, typically in more remote areas with limited amounts available. Meeting that demand required the same sort of thinking water infrastructure managers will need to address data centers, like installing on-site storage tanks to spread out a driller’s water needs over time.",https://static.lehigh-v.lehigh-valley.production.k1.m1.brightspot.cloud/dims4/default/45a71ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3273x1718+0+61/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flehigh-valley-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2Fd2%2Fa504cf14444ba085b3e44d21fe85%2Fpxl-20251024-145959284-mp.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 14:58:17.509863

The truck that once sparked year-long waitlists is now drawing dealer sighs and auction floors more than showroom excitement.

Via email, Xie said: “Right now, (Kelley Blue Book) prices for the Cybertruck are still inflated, and the demand just isn’t there.
Because demand has cooled and values are falling, the question arises: Is now the perfect time to jump in and get a deal?","The Cybertruck was supposed to be the future. Now, one California dealership says it’s a future nobody wants to buy.

In a viral TikTok, Jason Xie, general manager of Alfa Romeo of San Jose (@alfa.romeo.of.san.jose) laments that even Founders Editions of the eye-catching Tesla are “piling up” and losing value fast, leaving some to wonder if the hype bubble has finally burst.

“It's nice quality, but it's too odd-looking. I'm not crazy about the look of these,” Xie said in the clip that’s been viewed more than 589,000 times. “It's definitely unique, but I think for the price point, I would take a Rivian over this.”

Xie’s comments underscore a palpable shift in the market for Tesla’s first electric pickup. The truck that once sparked year-long waitlists is now drawing dealer sighs and auction floors more than showroom excitement. Xie’s take: “They just keep piling up… about 150 days in stock at least.” That anecdote offers a peek behind the hood of what some observers are calling the Cybertruck’s rapid descent from “must-have” to “must-dump.”

Cybertruck’s Hard Resale Future

Behind the humor lies hard data. Multiple sources show the Cybertruck is depreciating at a rate that would be alarming for almost any vehicle, especially for a truck that cost six figures when new. According to an analysis by CarEdge, a Cybertruck that sold for roughly $96,985 could drop to a resale value of about $50,888 after five years, a decline of nearly 48%. More starkly, a study by iSeeCars found the five-year depreciation for a new Cybertruck at about 60%, versus around 38.8% for light-duty pickups in general.

In some trade-in examples shared by Electrek, Cybertrucks lost as much as 34-45% of their value in just the first year. By that math, an owner who paid roughly $100,000 would see a trade-in estimate of about $60,000 after under 20,000 miles.

OWNERSHIP STORIES

Viral stories from across the web

Our team of experts tracks what owners are saying about car-shopping, repairs, the daily driving experience and more on social media.

That kind of depreciation is almost unheard of for a new truck, especially one positioned as Tesla’s flagship. Xie’s observation that “no one buys ’em” echoes the broader trend: Dealers, knowing the market risk, are avoiding piling inventory of Cybertrucks. The result: supply builds, discount expectations rise, and buyers begin to suspect something’s off.

So what’s behind the slide? For starters, the design is polarizing. The angular stainless-steel body and futuristic profile that once generated viral acclaim now attract mockery: social-media commenters liken the truck to a “dumpster truck” or deride its aesthetics altogether.

Meanwhile, insurance and repair sources signal elevated costs for the model. With parts still scarce, repair times long and some insurers reluctant to cover the vehicle, ownership risk grows. Combined with a heavy curb weight and a premium price tag—the base Founders Edition launched near $100,000—the package is less suited to mainstream truck buyers than Tesla may have hoped.

Then there’s the macro-market context. Tesla’s used-EV values broadly are under pressure, and the Cybertruck appears especially vulnerable. With dramatic price cuts, fewer buyers willing to pay top dollar for EV trucks, and competition heating up from the likes of Rivian R1T and Ford F‑150 Lightning, resale sentiment is shifting. In effect, what was once a status symbol is becoming a cautionary tale.

Via email, Xie said: “Right now, (Kelley Blue Book) prices for the Cybertruck are still inflated, and the demand just isn’t there. There’s probably more price correction ahead before things level out.

“In contrast, we’re already seeing parity for EVs from other brands like Porsche, Lucid, and Rivian. A two- to three-year-old model that’s still under factory warranty can often be had for 40-50% off its original MSRP, which makes it much more accessible to the general market. Interestingly, a lot of those buyers are former Tesla owners.”

Built For Bold Buyers

But here’s where the narrative takes a twist. Because demand has cooled and values are falling, the question arises: Is now the perfect time to jump in and get a deal? For a buyer who is aware of the risks and intends to hold long-term, Xie’s admission that Cybertrucks are “piling up” may signal opportunity. A previously scarce vehicle, now discounted, might appeal to a niche buyer who values uniqueness over resale proof.

Still, the caveats are meaningful. The steep initial depreciation means the next buyer must expect a downward value curve, unlike traditional trucks, which hold value more robustly. The lingering social perception issues and ownership cost risks around insurer wariness, and repair complexity remain. For most buyers, that means the question isn’t simply if they can score a bargain but whether the bargain is worth the trade-offs.

Anyone intrigued by the Cybertruck’s boldness who is prepared for a longer-term hold and doesn’t mind the attention it brings may indeed find a deal emerging. But if resale value, mainstream appeal and predictable ownership dynamics matter most, you may want to hold off or consider alternatives with stronger resale tracks and broader market support.

In the end, the image of a cracked slab of asphalt Xie points to in the video may be the most accurate metaphor: a once-shiny future vehicle weighing too much to land softly. The question now is whether it’s that crack in the pavement or the value-gap beneath the truck that you’re really looking at.

When legislatures toss aside fair maps, they’re not just shifting lines on paper.
Until every state plays fair, California has a duty to recognize reality and respond.
50 isn’t about rewriting the rules forever.
We fight back, and we fight fair.","I served in the Navy, and when I raised my hand, I swore an oath to defend the Constitution. That oath wasn’t partisan, and it didn’t expire when I took off the uniform. It still guides me today. The values I lived by in uniform — honor, courage, commitment — aren’t just for battlefields. They’re for moments like this, when democracy is under attack and sitting on the sidelines is not an option.

This November, Proposition 50 is on the ballot. It doesn’t rewrite the rules forever. It doesn’t dismantle our independent redistricting commission. What it does is ensure that when others rig the system, Californians won’t sit quietly and accept it.

Prop. 50 allows a mid-cycle redraw of California’s congressional maps, but only because others already crossed that line. Texas, Missouri, and others have taken the extraordinary step of tearing up fair maps in the middle of a cycle, at the behest of the White House, with one goal: to cheat their way to power. That’s not democracy; that’s manipulation. California didn’t pick this fight. But we will not sit back and let ourselves be silenced by rigged maps drawn in Austin or Jefferson City.

And let’s be clear: this isn’t an isolated scheme. What we’re seeing isn’t limited to redistricting. This administration has made a habit of bending or breaking the rules to hold onto power. Whether it’s undermining the Justice Department, stacking the courts, or rewriting the rules of our immigration system, the through-line is the same: cheat where you can, and dare anyone to stop you. Some of those fights are out of California’s hands. But when it comes to elections, when it comes to our maps and our representation in Congress, we can do something about it, and Prop. 50 is how we do it.

Here’s the key: this isn’t permanent. It’s a mid-cycle correction, nothing more. Once the next regular redistricting process begins, the independent commission takes back the reins. Prop. 50 is a shield, not a weapon. It says California will meet fire with fire, just long enough to stop one-sided manipulation from deciding the balance of power in Washington.

We’ve already seen attempts to overturn the will of the people. In 2020, the effort to undermine our democracy didn’t happen in whispers behind closed doors, it happened in full public view and people died. And those same tactics are being repeated today. Pretending otherwise is an invitation for history to repeat itself.

When legislatures toss aside fair maps, they’re not just shifting lines on paper. They’re silencing entire communities. They’re deciding in advance who wins and who loses. That’s not politics-as-usual, it’s cheating. And it breaks faith with the very idea of elections.

These aren’t just lines on a map. They decide whether a farmworker in the Central Valley has a representative who listens to her, or whether a military family in San Diego gets a voice in Washington. Gerrymandering doesn’t just redraw boundaries, it redraws lives. Californians understand that when our voices are erased, our futures are too.

Every person who has ever raised their right hand and taken the oath to serve in the military, to uphold the law, or to take public office, swore allegiance not to a party, not to a politician, but to the Constitution. That oath is a reminder that loyalty belongs to the people and to the rule of law.

When state legislatures contort themselves to please a single leader, they violate that sacred trust. They reduce themselves to servitude, ignoring the people they swore to represent. Californians should not, and will not, tolerate that kind of cowardice.

Prop. 50 reflects the Navy values I lived by. Honor demands we call out injustice when we see it. Courage demands we take action even when it’s uncomfortable. Commitment demands we hold the line until fairness is restored.

Critics will sneer that this is gerrymandering by another name. They’re wrong. Gerrymandering is about permanently locking in unfair advantage. Prop. 50 is temporary, reluctant, and necessary. It is a corrective measure until the referees, the independent commissioners, are allowed to do their jobs again.

It’s breathtaking hypocrisy when Republican-led legislatures rip up maps mid-cycle to entrench minority rule and call it “strategy.” Yet when California acts to defend itself, suddenly they call it “unfair.” That double standard isn’t just insulting, it’s un-American. Until every state plays fair, California has a duty to recognize reality and respond.

Fairness isn’t partisan, it’s patriotic. Veterans like me fought for democracy abroad because we believed it was worth defending. Now the fight is here at home.

California has always set the pace for America. On civil rights. On clean air. On consumer protections. Now it’s time to lead again by making clear that election-rigging has no home here. This isn’t about punishing politicians. It’s about protecting people. It’s about living up to our values of honor, courage, and commitment. And it’s about showing the country that democracy still belongs to the people.

The choice before us is clear: either California accepts a tilted playing field written in someone else’s statehouse, or we stand up and fight for a democracy that works for everyone. We’ve never been a state that backs down from a fight, not on civil rights, not on clean air, not on consumer protections. And we shouldn’t start now.

On Nov. 4, Californians can send a message far beyond our borders: we will defend fair play, accountability, and democracy. Because without fair play, democracy fails. Without accountability, power corrupts. Prop. 50 isn’t about rewriting the rules forever. It’s about refusing to let un-American power grabs in Texas, Missouri, or anywhere else dictate our future.

This is a one-time, mid-cycle stand forced upon us by cheaters.

Californians don’t bow to cheaters.

We fight back, and we fight fair.

“Coal is complex — there’s no single right way to deal with it,” said Sidney Gathrid ’22, the study’s lead author.
“Instead of asking only why coal plants retire, we asked how we can make retirements happen faster — and in ways that are efficient and grounded in data,” Gathrid said.
“That’s a powerful approach to a geographically diverse and politically fragmented challenge.” Their analysis found that about 28% of coal plants without retirement plans are already highly vulnerable to closure — potential “quick wins” for policymakers and advocates.
“It’s flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.” Gathrid, now a co-founder of an AI and data start-up, Krv Analytics, based in Los Angeles, said the framework’s open-source design makes it especially valuable.","Even as coal power continues its steady decline in the United States, more than a hundred plants still have no retirement plans — a gap large enough to derail national climate goals. A new study led by UC Santa Barbara researchers offers a way forward, showing how targeted, data-driven approaches could help accelerate the transition.

Published in Nature Energy, the study tackles a critical question: if market forces have already driven many coal plants to close, why are so many still running? Despite years of decline, roughly 105 gigawatts of coal capacity — representing 114 plants — are still slated to operate through 2035, even though a complete phaseout by that date is widely considered essential for meeting U.S. net-zero emissions goals.

“Coal is complex — there’s no single right way to deal with it,” said Sidney Gathrid ’22, the study’s lead author. “Our goal was to build tools that reflect that complexity, so different actors can take on different facets of the problem. There’s no one straightforward path, and we wanted to do research that represented that reality.”

Working with Grace C. Wu, an assistant professor in the Environmental Studies Program and senior author on the paper, Gathrid and his team show that reaching those goals will require policymakers to move beyond age-based or one-size-fits-all approaches — and instead focus on the specific contexts that accelerate the retirement of certain coal plants.

To do that, the researchers — including Jeremy Wayland, Stuart Wayland ‘22, and Ranjit Deshmukh, an associate professor in the Environmental Studies Program and the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management — developed a new framework combining graph theory and topological data analysis to classify the entire U.S. coal fleet into eight distinct groups based on 68 technical, economic, environmental and socio-political factors. They also introduced a “contextual retirement vulnerability” score that measures how susceptible each plant is to early retirement by comparing it to facilities that have already announced closures.

The framework goes a step further by identifying “retirement archetypes” — patterns that explain why plants in each group are retiring. These range from regulatory and health-based drivers to unfavorable economics or political pressure, offering a clear set of levers that can be applied to similar facilities elsewhere.

“Instead of asking only why coal plants retire, we asked how we can make retirements happen faster — and in ways that are efficient and grounded in data,” Gathrid said. “Our framework helps policymakers and advocates identify where they can have the biggest impact.”

The study began as Gathrid’s senior thesis in UCSB’s Environmental Studies Program, supported by the campus’s Manalis Leadership Fellowship, sponsored by Howard and Lisa Wenger, and evolved into a years-long collaboration. Wu said the project’s scope and impact are rare for undergraduate research.

“This is Ph.D.-level work,” Wu said. “It’s extremely unusual for a project that started as a senior thesis to reach this level of sophistication and impact. What’s exciting is that this framework doesn’t just describe which plants might retire — it shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.”

Using their model, the team grouped 198 active U.S. coal plants into clusters such as High Health Impacts Plants, Expensive Plants, and Plants in Anti-Coal Regions, each linked to specific vulnerabilities that can be targeted with policy or advocacy. For example, plants associated with high asthma rates and poor air quality could be prioritized through public-health campaigns and environmental enforcement, while those struggling financially might respond more effectively to economic incentives or market-based mechanisms.

One striking example is Belews Creek in North Carolina — a nearly 50-year-old, 2.49-gigawatt coal plant that the study categorizes as both highly vulnerable to retirement and part of Group 0: Fuel Blend Plants. The facility can burn up to 50% natural gas, yet remains one of the nation’s top particulate polluters, ranking 26th out of 198 for fine particle emissions. Financially, it’s among the most unprofitable plants in the country, carrying roughly $46 million in debt as of 2020.

Belews Creek is also located in a state seeing rapid growth in solar development and the implementation of coal debt securitization policies designed to help utilities transition away from uneconomic fossil assets. “Given the drivers for retirements in this group,” the authors noted, “advocates can leverage state and utility clean energy targets.” There were even preliminary discussions about replacing Belews Creek with a small modular nuclear reactor, but the plant’s owner, Duke Energy, has since postponed its retirement — underscoring the financial and operational complexities that the UCSB framework aims to untangle.

“We can simplify nearly 200 plants into clear groups and pair each with evidence-based strategies,” Wu said. “That’s a powerful approach to a geographically diverse and politically fragmented challenge.”

Their analysis found that about 28% of coal plants without retirement plans are already highly vulnerable to closure — potential “quick wins” for policymakers and advocates. But it also revealed that the least vulnerable plants are spread across several groups, underscoring the need for a diverse set of strategies to address the most persistent facilities.

The implications extend beyond coal. Because the model captures the multi-dimensional forces that shape real-world decisions — economics, politics, health and grid reliability — it could be adapted to other complex decarbonization challenges.

Wu, whose research focuses on sustainable energy transition planning, said the framework bridges mathematical and applied environmental science in a way that could transform how analysts and decision-makers approach energy policy.

“This work takes state-of-the-art mathematical tools and puts them into the practitioner’s toolbox,” she said. “It’s flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.”

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, electric vehicle purchases could qualify for a tax credit off the purchase price up to $7,500.
That said, Electrek reported that Lucid Motors aims to bring the price of its EVs down to approximately $50,000, with a mid-size range expected in 2026.
The automaker considers the Gravity a luxury EV, similar to models from BMW, Audi, and Mercedes, per Electrek.
And, even though many companies plan to pull back on EV production, Lucid Motors believes that ""electrification is the future.""","Lucid Motors announced that it plans to continue offering $7,500 off the Gravity SUV through the end of the year to replace shuttered federal electric vehicle incentives.

Many automakers and tech companies are developing ways to slash the cost of EVs, including developing fast chargers, working to avoid tariffs, and improving battery recycling possibilities. As a result, more people will access the myriad of benefits of EVs.

According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, electric cars can help you save money on routine maintenance and fuel, allowing you to maximize your savings even more.

Plus, you can charge electric cars using solar energy, which reduces charging costs. At-home chargers are also cheaper than public options.

For homeowners interested in Level 2 EV chargers, Qmerit is providing free installation estimates. Additionally, EnergySage makes it easy to find home solar panel quotes from reputable installers.

Aside from saving money, the Union of Concerned Scientists has explained that EVs release no tailpipe pollution. That's a positive, because pollution contributes to rising temperatures and poorer air quality. Not to mention, EV manufacturing has a smaller environmental impact compared to traditional vehicles, as it requires fewer resources.

Several people had interesting things to say about the company's decision.

Some people expressed confusion about the credit in the Electrek article's comments.

One asked, ""How do you extend an EV tax credit for a vehicle that doesn't qualify in the first place … You just discount the price by $7500 and say you did.""

However, another person seemed excited about the offer, commenting, ""Lucid makes the best vehicles!""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lucid-motors.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 14:58:33.977287

The 30% clean energy tax credit will end on December 31, 2025. Are you going to make your upgrades? By acting now, you could reduce your taxes, lower energy bills, and position your home for a cleaner, smarter future.

Decoding the 30% clean energy tax credit and what it means for homeowners

The clean energy credit is a federal tax credit through the Inflation Reduction Act to promote energy efficiency and sustainability in U.S. homes. Homeowners can claim 30% of the total cost (both materials and labor) of qualifying energy-saving home improvements, up to certain annual limits.

To qualify, the improvements must be made to a primary residence in the United States. Improvements made in service from January 1, 2023, through to December 31, 2025, will be eligible

According to the IRS official statement on Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, homeowners are eligible to be reimbursed up to $1,200 each year for the types of improvements listed above; additionally, homeowners can be reimbursed $2,000 per year for larger types of improvements, including heat pumps, biomass stoves, and water heaters.

Understanding what home upgrades can maximize your 30% clean energy tax credit

The IRS lists many home improvements that qualify for the clean energy credit, instead of decreasing your overall energy use, and enjoy better comfort:

Insulating and air sealing: Keeps homes warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer by stopping the loss of energy.

Energy-efficient doors, windows, and skylights: These features minimize drafts and keep the indoor temperature stable, reducing the workload on heating and cooling equipment.

Heating and cooling systems: High-efficiency heat pumps, furnaces, and air conditioning systems use less energy while lowering your monthly expenses.

Efficient water heaters: High-efficiency models heat water faster while using less energy, so that you can shower, do laundry, and wash dishes without interruption.

Home energy audits: Discover where you are wasting energy while receiving recommendations specific to you to optimize energy use, while benefiting from the clean energy tax credit.

If you are thinking of making the switch to renewable energy with solar panels, wind systems, like this vertical turbine redefining home energy, or battery storage, you may also be eligible for related tax credits, such as the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which would stack on top of your 30% tax credits.

What Homeowners need to know to secure the clean energy tax credit

To receive your clean energy credit, you need to have all the records in order and be aware of the timing. Always hold onto your receipts, documentation of manufacturer certifications, and Energy Star labels for the eligible items you purchased.

When filing IRS Form 5695 to compute your total credit, this is when you will have the final figures available. All items must be upgraded and “placed in service” by December 31, 2025, as projects must be completed by this date to be considered.

Common mistakes homeowners make when claiming the clean energy credit and how to avoid them

To qualify for the complete 30% clean energy tax credit, you’ll need to make sure all improvements meet IRS efficiency standards, retain all receipts and product certifications, and have the project completed by December 31, 2025. Staying organized and planning ahead will help you avoid these common pitfalls and efficiently navigate the process, resulting in a successful claim and maximized savings.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1001401420.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:23:25.976721

Finding innovative ways to recycle renewable energy equipment could help significantly cut costs and reduce waste, further supporting the sector’s green ambitions. There is great potential for a range of components to be reused and recycled, from solar panels to wind turbines and electric vehicle (EV) batteries. However, greater research and investment must be contributed to the sector to improve practices and make recycling options more accessible.

As interest and investment in renewable energy increase, we are seeing more technological advancements across the sector. Wind turbines have become bigger and more powerful, while solar panels have been getting cheaper and more efficient. This means that old technologies are becoming outdated more quickly, leading to their replacement. Once a renewable energy component reaches the end of its lifecycle, it is normally removed and replaced by something bigger, stronger, and better. What is done with these old components varies massively from country to country.

Often, old turbine blades or photovoltaic (PV) panels are stockpiled for long periods of time as companies decide what to do with them. Waste from the renewable energy sector is significant, with Europe expected to dismantle around 14,000 wind turbines by the end of the decade. This would result in between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes of blade waste, according to WindEurope. Meanwhile, in the United States, wind turbine blade waste could reach anywhere between 200,000 to 370,000 tonnes a year by 2050.

Greater innovation in recycling could help reduce waste and cut costs by putting old components to good use. However, recycling old renewable energy parts is not always so simple. Steel and other materials that can be easily recycled account for around 85 to 90 percent of the makeup of a wind turbine, but the glass fibre or carbon fibre blades are much more complicated to recycle. The difficulties in recycling have not put operators off, with more innovative solutions being seen year on year. In a bid to become more sustainable, after years of discarding old blades and other components, several wind firms have pledged to invest in recycling operations to prevent old components from going to landfill.

In Scotland, old blades from the Hagshaw Hill windfarm are being recycled to provide a hybrid polymer to be used to produce precast concrete alternatives or replace virgin plastics. Meanwhile, Spanish energy firm Iberdrola aims to transform 10,000 tonnes of blade waste annually at its blade recycling facility on the Iberian Peninsula. It will use glass fibres and resins from the turbines to produce new blades to be used across a range of sectors, from aerospace to construction.

Related: Spain’s Clean Energy Dilemma

In the solar energy sector, various innovations are being seen. For example, in Brisbane, Australia, solar panels are being transformed into silver and copper. Operators are removing aluminium and wires from PVs that can no longer produce energy to grind them up into plastic, glass, silicon, silver, and copper. Pan Pacific Recycling is now processing around 30,000 panels a year and hopes to eventually increase its annual capacity to 240,000 panels.

Global solar panel waste is currently far higher than the recycling capacity for this waste, meaning that greater investment is needed in the sector to expand capacity and improve sustainability by preventing old solar panels from going to landfill. In addition, experts suggest that many of the solar panels being replaced with more efficient models are still capable of producing energy and could be reused in a different context rather than discarded. Several startups, such as Australian Second Life Solar, are working to encourage the reuse of old solar panels in alternative settings to provide clean energy and prevent unnecessary waste.

Some of the greatest advancements have been seen in EV battery recycling, as companies worldwide strive to improve their critical mineral supply chains. The lithium supply used for EV battery production is finite, meaning that once supplies are depleted, we will no longer be able to produce this type of battery. However, extracting the lithium from old EV batteries could allow EV makers to reuse the critical mineral, rather than relying wholly on mining projects for their lithium supply. Other minerals that can be extracted from these batteries include nickel, cobalt, and graphite.

Various companies from different regions of the world are now investing in expanding and improving recycling practices, although the industry’s recycling capacity still falls far behind the production of new wind turbine blades and solar panels, suggesting that greater funding is needed to accelerate the global component recycling capacity. In addition, governments could encourage companies to invest in recycling activities by introducing stricter rules and regulations on renewable energy waste, thereby helping the industry to become more sustainable.

What is energy security, and how does it relate to AI?

""It is making sure there is enough energy in the world to help enable and support our allies,"" said Pullin. ""But then an even broader, bigger context is making sure there's secure energy for humanity.""

She said energy security also applies to making sure companies like Google and Meta have the power they need to take advantage of artificial intelligence.

""Some of it's life and death, literal. And the other side of it is prosper, growth, and innovate, and keep the United States leading in this area,"" she said.

Is the HAMM Institute working on solutions to help fix the disparity of energy poverty globally?

Pullin said that ending energy poverty is at the heart of what they do.

""When you still have people that don't have access to electricity ... then that's a real problem, and so you have to solve that first, ""she said. ""We're not going to get there and be able to solve that unless we keep putting affordable and reliable energy at the front. of the argument in regard to energy policy. That has to happen, because when we can do that here locally and federally within our own country, that allows us to do more.""

How much are are local regulations affecting energy reform?

She said permitting reform is a key part of the solution.

""It is such a significant issue when you have an inconsistent policy, which is what we have seen over the past three decades in the United States, honestly. You see oil and gas come in favor, then out of favor. You see nuclear in favor, then out of favor. You see renewables in favor and then out of favor. And when you have that kind of inconsistency, the capital investment gets scared, and they're not willing to take that risk,"" said Pullin. ""Unless there is permitting reform, ? It means that there are laws in place that can help industry be able to do this in a way that's efficient and affordable and reliable to the consumer. What we will see, the risk of not getting the permitting correct, will be an increase in energy costs for the consumer.

“Nuclear energy is actually the backbone of Ontario's energy generation sector,” said Albis.
“It shows just how multigenerational nuclear power plants are,” he said.
Earlier this year, the Ford government greenlit Ontario Power Generation to start construction on the first SMR.
The Darlington New Nuclear Project was on Prime Minister Carney’s list of projects deemed to be in the national interest and therefore worthy of fast-tracking.","For as long as he can remember, Carter Albis has been fascinated by nuclear energy.

""I grew up right next to Pickering Nuclear. I used to play on the beach, like right next to the plant a lot,” he said. “When you're that age, it's this cool, mysterious building. That's where it started for me.”

That fascination led him to apply to Ontario Tech University’s nuclear engineering program, not far from which sits the Darlington Nuclear Station in Bowmanville.

Now it’s there, where the first-year student sees a radiant future for his career.

“Nuclear energy is actually the backbone of Ontario's energy generation sector,” said Albis. “There's no shortage of opportunity.""

On Thursday, Ontario and the federal governments announced a combined spending commitment of $3 billion to build Canada’s first small modular reactors (SMRs), a new nuclear energy technology to be built next door to the Darlington power plant.

The project is projected to bring 18,000 construction jobs to the region and sustain 3,700 energy jobs annually over 65 years.

“It shows just how multigenerational nuclear power plants are,” he said. “Many of the nuclear plants that are in projects that are being built right now, they'll continue to produce energy past 2100. That's a long time.”

Trickle-down effect expected to boost other sectors

The SMRs will inject $500 million annually into the Canadian supply chain, according to the prime minister, while construction, operation and maintenance of the four units will add more than $38 billion to Canada’s GDP over the next 65 years.

Earlier this year, the Ford government greenlit Ontario Power Generation to start construction on the first SMR. The total project cost was announced at the time as costing $20.9 billion, with the estimated construction cost of the initial reactor being $7.7 billion.

While construction is still in its infancy, local businesses are already reaping the rewards, according to Bonnie Wrightman, Clarington's board of trade executive director.

“We have connected quite a few businesses to vendors who are serving the project and working with our local businesses already,” Wrightman said. “ The economic impact is actually being felt right now.”

Wrightman described the scale of the project as one of the largest Clarington has ever seen. She said the trickle-down effect will boost numerous sectors throughout the region.

In a briefing earlier this year, officials with Ontario's Ministry of Energy and Mines told reporters roughly 80 per cent of the SMR project spending will go to Ontario companies.

“It puts us in a great position to keep supporting the nuclear file,” Wrightman added.

Clarington on a global stage

The technology is expected to be the first of its kind built within the G7.

The Darlington New Nuclear Project was on Prime Minister Carney’s list of projects deemed to be in the national interest and therefore worthy of fast-tracking.

Clarington Mayor Adrian Foster touted the project as a way to put the municipality on the map.

“The world is at our doorstep. They are coming through, they're paying attention,” said Foster. “There's a huge amount of international interest in this.”

Foster said the project holds the potential to provide relief among U.S. tariffs and economic uncertainty.

He pointed to struggling sectors, like Canada’s automotive industry, suggesting that workers could retrain to help steer the SMR project to completion.

“Those skill sets are more closely aligned than you would expect,” he added. “I think we can build a really, really interesting workforce, maybe more quickly than we thought.”

Foster said post-secondary institutions will have a vital role to play in filling out the positions created by the Darlington project.

Steven Murphy, the president of Ontario Tech University, knows that all too well.

Right now, he said post-secondaries across the country are working together to create pathways for future generations to enter into the nuclear field.

“That involves a lot of skilled trades like millwrights, welders, many others that are in short supply,” Murphy told CBC News. “If we are going to have this great build out as a nation, we're going to need all of us (post-secondaries) to be very coordinated.”

The first of four SMRs is expected to come online in 2030, according to the province.

When completed, the four SMRs is expected to produce 1,200 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power 1.2 million homes, according to officials.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/1.7234294,1718308387000/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C5280%2C2970%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-10-25 13:19:03.367234

“I said, ‘Oh, honey, if I’m cooking chili, I’m going all in.’ ” The community embraced her.
But none of those events have the vibrance, camaraderie and history of the Texas Ladies’ State Chili Championship Cook-Off.
“Competition chili is a little bit stronger, a little saltier, a little spicier,” says Maricle, a member of GVEC.
She dabbled in chili cooking on a lark, and now—with the help of her “chili family”—she’s a state champion.","Texans know: Chili is so much more than just a bowl of red.

That wasn’t always the case for Teena Friedel—not many years ago, when she worked for the city of Irving and was tasked with spicing up a city festival.

“I started trying to think of ways to make a festival more fun,” she says, “and one of the things I found was something called a chili cook-off, not knowing what that entails.”

Friedel joined her local pod of the Chili Appreciation Society International to learn the rules and process of a sanctioned competition. After her 2006 event, she remained part of the chapter but was reluctant to get more involved. “They asked me if I wanted to cook, and I did not want to do it,” she says.

After much cajoling and a crash course in cooking chili, she was finally persuaded to compete.

“I made the final table that first day and placed second in showmanship,” Friedel says. She was hooked. “I said, ‘Oh, honey, if I’m cooking chili, I’m going all in.’ ”

The community embraced her.

“If I needed anything, somebody gave it to me, and seeing how much fun everybody had, and part of your entry fee went to charity, and that feels really good.”

In the birthplace of chili, the official state dish comes with a storied history that represents Texas’ bold, rich culture. CASI, one of three standard-bearers for chili cook-offs in the state, hosts hundreds of competitions annually across the continent, raising $729,000 for charity during the last full fiscal year. But none of those events have the vibrance, camaraderie and history of the Texas Ladies’ State Chili Championship Cook-Off.

It’s as much about Texas hospitality as it is secret spice mixtures, and it’s a testament to the power of women in a traditionally male-dominated domain and the close-knit bonds that good food fosters.

The TLSCCO holds a unique place in chili history. The event was created in direct response to the 1970 formation of the Chilympiad, a famous San Marcos cook-off that barred women. In response, legendary rancher and humorist Hondo Crouch offered up Luckenbach, the town he owned near Fredericksburg, for a separate cook-off in 1971 called Hell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Scorned. It was for women only. And it was an instant hit.

The event evolved over the years to support more entrants and found its footing in Seguin, about 35 miles east of San Antonio, in 1991 as the second-largest chili cook-off in Texas, just behind the distinguished Terlingua International Chili Championship. While it’s no longer the second-largest, the women’s competition is still a qualifier for Terlingua, meaning winners gain immediate entry to the most prestigious cook-off of the year.

Heating Up

On a warm April day at Max Starcke Park in Seguin, there’s a huge spread of cars, campers and tents, all in residence for the TLSCCO weekend. A flag with the CASI logo flies above the proceedings, centered around a covered pavilion in a grove of pecan and sycamore trees along the Guadalupe River.

With 135 cooks, the competition is fierce but also clearly fun. Tents, tablecloths, T-shirts and décor are in bright pinks, purples and yellows. Previous champions stroll around wearing tiaras and bright sashes. Men, working behind the scenes, wear pink polos. Everywhere is the sound of women laughing.

Under the pavilion, the junior competition is already underway, with four girls ages 7–15 tending their pots in front of the main stage. Last year’s junior champion, Reese Satsky of Friendswood, is back, wearing her crown.

At the appointed hour, they parade their chili through a glitter-speckled purple arch to the turn-in table, reminiscent of a beauty pageant victory lap.

Outside the pavilion, the adult competition is just getting started. Cooks can begin their chili anytime but most plan a three-hour cook for the 1 p.m. turn-in time, when all competitors must present their chili to judges in 32-ounce plastic foam cups, marked only with ID numbers for anonymity. The visiting and socializing quiet down as the burners are lit.

“A lot of people think if you go to a cook-off, it’s just, you know, a free-for-all,” says Beverly Maricle, the cook-off’s board president. “We do party. We do have a good time but take what we do very seriously. After chili is turned in, or during the resting period, then you walk around and you visit with everybody, but when you’re cooking, you’re cooking. It is a competition.”

René Chapa of Grand Prairie, the 2023 chili world champion and 2014 ladies state champion, is among this year’s top competitors, browning her meat on a custom-painted camping stove under a purple awning with six other cooks, including her mom, Beth Baxter. All are dressed in pink shirts that read, “Spread Kindness.”

“Everybody does their own things a little bit differently,” Chapa says. “And so, you know, I’ll tweak it here and there. She tweaks hers here and there.”

While traditional Texas chili consists of beef (usually cuts of stew meat) cooked low and slow with a blend of peppers, garlic and onions, competition chili is more concentrated.

“This chili is not like a Wolf Brand Chili. You’re not going to sit there and eat a whole bowl; it’s very spicy,” Chapa says. “We’ve got five, six chili powders in here.”

Stew meat is left behind in favor of chili ground beef, and any vegetables are blended to create a gravy. Judges taste a single spoonful of each chili before recording a score, so each bite needs to pack a consistent punch.

“Competition chili is a little bit stronger, a little saltier, a little spicier,” says Maricle, a member of GVEC. “You want a little back bite, but if the tears are running down your face, your pot’s too hot.”

Each entry is judged based on five factors: aroma, color, consistency, taste and aftertaste. At the end of each round of judging, half the entries advance and the tasting begins anew.

Pat Krenek, 2001 and 2003 ladies state champion, has been coming to the competition since the Luckenbach days.

“You have to start out with a decent recipe,” she says. “You crank it up, put it in that cup, turn it in and wish for the best. Once you cook your pot, it’s out of your hands.”

Krenek loves the atmosphere of the event. “This is just a relaxing time. It’s not a beauty contest, so you don’t have to dress up or do your hair and makeup,” she says. “And the men are the ones working.”

Cooking Down

Stoves get turned off during the chili’s resting period as the spices work their magic. And then there’s a last-minute crush of activity before the mad rush to the turn-in table.

At Chapa’s tent, a band of visiting competitors brings out a tray of Jell-O shots, and everyone toasts to each other’s good luck. Some go back for seconds.

About 10 minutes before turn-in time, Chapa primes her entry cup by pouring in a spoonful of chili and swishing it around the edges, coating the cup in a familiar red color. Precoating the cup takes some of the plastic foam smell away, giving the aroma the best chance of scoring high.

At its core, this is a competition, but it’s also about the experience. For the participants, it’s a chance to show off their skills and gain recognition but also to nurture the bonds of a supportive statewide community.

Jeff Bauer, a CASI board member from Pinehurst, is sitting in the shade as his daughter Madalynn Bauer, 18, is cooking in the adult division for the first time. “At barbecue cook-offs, nobody will help you. It’s all about me, me, me, me, me,” Jeff says. “But chili cooks, they’ll help you.”

He competed for years on the barbecue trail before finding the chili circuit.

“It got to the point to where I was spending almost $800, $900, $1,000 a weekend at barbecue competitions,” he says, “and without sponsorship, there’s no way an average Joe can do that.”

Crowning Moment

For judging, hundreds of people—including members of the public—are divided among tasting tables.

“We like to have a minimum of 200,” Maricle says. On this day, some parks employees and litter cleanup crews have been recruited. The mayor of Seguin, Donna Dodgen; city employees; and longtime chili judges line the final table to determine the winners.

The main stage features custom purple camp chairs, part of the award booty for the top 20 cooks.

After the final tastings, the pavilion overflows with competitors, their supporters and curious onlookers. The winners are announced from 20th place to first by the entry numbers on their cups. Sharp cries and shouts of excitement rise up as winners emerge from the crowd, accept hugs from friends and then are escorted on stage.

Beth Baxter’s number is called as 20th place, and she takes a seat in her camp chair. As she’s handed a chilled glass of champagne, the number of her daughter, René Chapa, is called as 19th place, and the two women reunite on stage with laughter and hugs.

The camp chairs are almost full as the reserve champion’s number is called. A proud Jeff Bauer lets out a whoop of joy and spins his daughter Madalynn around. As the runner-up, she will head to Terlingua after her first year of competition.

When the championship announcement comes, Friedel looks radiant as she rises from the crowd. It takes her a few minutes to make her way to the stage, slowed down by all the hugs she receives along the way.

She’s crowned by last year’s winner and handed a bouquet of yellow roses and a large trophy, which she will carry around to competitions until next year’s winner is declared. She dabbled in chili cooking on a lark, and now—with the help of her “chili family”—she’s a state champion.

“I already knew it was going to be me,” she says later. “It was really weird, I just knew I was going to go get that crown.”",https://texascooppower.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chili-cookoff-11783-og.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 14:19:35.679793

Charlie Garcia responds to readers about AI doubters, nuclear reactors - and why Blackstone fixes what City Hall won't

China is building power infrastructure because they're smart enough to know that electricity is what separates civilization from camping.

Dear Charlie,

I read with interest your discussion of the grid as the bottleneck for AI development in the United States. But aren't you assuming that AI will not be the bust that many people now think it may be? What if AI turns out to be an overhyped loser? Then won't China have won a race that was never run?

Steve

Dear Steve,

Appreciate you reading the piece. And fair question. You're asking if I'm betting the farm on AI turning out to be the next internet instead of the next Pets.com.

Short answer: I don't care if AI is overhyped. Here's why: electricity infrastructure isn't an AI bet. It's a civilization bet.

Whether AI cures cancer or just gets really good at writing bad poetry, we still need to power data centers, charge electric vehicles, run manufacturing plants, and keep the lights on while everyone streams Netflix. The grid is failing now. Texas nearly froze to death because their power grid has the reliability of a 1987 Yugo. California had to schedule blackouts like they're yoga classes.

AI might be the excuse we're using to finally fix infrastructure we should've upgraded 30 years ago. If that makes me a sucker, fine. At least I'm a sucker who can turn on the air conditioning in August.

As for China ""winning a race that was never run,"" that's the wrong metaphor. China is building power infrastructure because they're smart enough to know that electricity is what separates civilization from camping. If AI turns out to be garbage, they'll still have functional power plants and we'll still be arguing about whether windmills cause cancer.

The Romans built aqueducts because they thought the gods demanded clean water. Turns out the gods didn't exist, but the aqueducts still worked. Sometimes the right infrastructure for the wrong reasons beats no infrastructure at all.

Besides, even if AI is 90% hype, that remaining 10% still needs a ton of electricity.

Betting on voltage over vaporware,

Charlie

P.S. - If you're right and AI is a complete bust, at least I'll be able to say I invested in companies that make actual things instead of tokens that represent someone's dream of making money by selling tokens to other people.

Dear Charlie,

Here's two interesting points that one may consider: First, one should look at how much coal China is actually using versus how many mines/plants it may have. Second, the U.S. has many more nuclear reactors than does China.

W.L.

Dear W.L.,

You're right on both counts. China's 3,100 coal plants run at 50% utilization, so they're only burning coal at seven times our rate. And we have 94 nuclear reactors versus their 58.

Here's what those numbers actually mean:

Our 94 reactors are an average of 42 years old. The oldest went online in 1969 - the year the U.S. landed on the moon. It's still running. America built its first new reactors in 30 years at Vogtle, in Georgia. Two of them. Took a more than decade; cost more than double.

China's reactors are mostly under 20 years old. They're building Generation III, Generation IV - China opened the world's first commercial Gen IV reactor in 2023. They have 28 under construction and last April approved 10 more.

The U.S.? America approved reopening Three Mile Island - the one that melted down in 1979.

The U.S. has more nuclear reactors than China. It's like having the world's largest collection of rotary phones while the other guy's building cell towers.

So yes, the U.S. has more nuclear reactors than China. It's like having the world's largest collection of rotary phones while the other guy's building cell towers.

On coal - China built so much infrastructure they can run it at half-speed and still burn seven times more than America does. That's not inefficiency. That's having options. The U.S. is running its 240 plants into the ground because that's all there is.

You're right. America is ahead on 50-year-old technology. China is ahead on everything built in this century.

May the best infrastructure win.

Charlie

P.S. - Nothing says ""global superpower"" quite like bragging that your energy infrastructure predates the invention of the VCR. The U.S. is not falling behind China; it's been behind since China figured out that concrete doesn't need congressional approval.

Dear Charlie,

Radicalization within the political arena is not really good for infrastructures. The energy shortage and infrastructures' extreme decay were both obvious for some time. And now the U.S. government is shut down.

Reality will hit the earth soon. Most will call this a crash.

Pierre

Dear Pierre,

Political radicalization is terrible for infrastructure. So is government dysfunction, regulatory paralysis, and the fact that Congress couldn't organize a two-car parade.

The energy shortage and grid decay in the U.S. have been obvious for 15 years. Nobody fixed it because cutting ribbons on transformer stations doesn't win elections.

Here's what happens next: Reality doesn't care about your political dysfunction. Data centers still need power. AI doesn't run on bipartisan cooperation.

Which means someone builds the infrastructure anyway.

That someone is private capital. Blackstone (BX) deployed $25 billion in 90 days. Microsoft (MSFT) is building power plants. Utilities being upgraded before the grid collapses during an earnings call.

You're right - most people will call this a crash when reality hits. I'm calling it the biggest infrastructure spending cycle in American history, happening whether Washington functions or not. The 10 companies that deliver transformers, cables, and grid systems get paid regardless of which party controls Congress.

Chaos is expensive. Someone profits from fixing it.

Yours in profitable dysfunction,

Charlie

P.S. - The beautiful thing about infrastructure investment is that it doesn't require optimism about government - only pessimism about its alternatives. When the choice is between Congress fixing the grid and Blackstone doing it for 12% returns, bet on greed every time. At least greed shows up for work.

Dear Charlie,

I'm a mother of three and a CPA. I manage our family's investments conservatively - index funds, some bonds; nothing crazy.

You're telling me to bet on American infrastructure when I can't even get the pothole on my street fixed after two years of complaints? When the school needs a new HVAC system but the city says there's no budget?

I get your thesis about China building while America argues. But you're asking me to invest in the same incompetence that can't maintain what we already have. Why would companies suddenly build transmission lines when municipalities can't even patch roads?

My husband says I'm too pessimistic. But I'm the one who balances our checkbook.

Jennifer

Dear Jennifer,

You balance the family checkbook. That makes you more qualified than 90% of Congress.

You're asking why companies would suddenly build transmission lines when your city can't fix a pothole. Great question. Here's the answer: because Microsoft needs power and your city council doesn't.

The pothole stays because fixing it requires a municipal bond issue, three committee hearings and a contractor whose brother-in-law knows a guy. Nobody profits enough to care.

The transmission line gets built because Blackstone deployed $25 billion and they'd like $28 billion back. When private capital wants something, it generally gets it. When public works want something, they schedule another hearing.

You're not betting on American competence. You're betting on American desperation. Your skepticism is healthy. Index funds are smart. But sometimes the boring infrastructure stocks ARE the index, just concentrated enough to actually benefit when the thing finally happens.

May your portfolio outperform your municipality,

Charlie

P.S. - Your city can't fix the pothole because there's no profit in asphalt and nobody gets fired for ignoring it. Blackstone will build the transmission line because there's 30% IRR in electrons and someone absolutely gets fired if they don't.

Dear Charlie:

The squirrel fires remark had me rolling on the floor. Made my day!!

Violet

Dear Violet,

Glad the squirrel barbecue gave you a laugh. Though honestly, with the way our grid's running, we might want to start collecting recipes now while we still have internet access to look them up.

Thanks for reading.

Charlie

P.S. - If you're near a squirrel when reading this, maintain eye contact. Show no fear. They can smell weakness.

“A truly just transition must put people and safety first — not profits or politics.” Author: Bryan Groenendaal","Calls grow for government to abandon oil, gas and nuclear projects seen as threats to a just energy transition.

With just weeks to go before the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, South African faith and community leaders are calling on government to abandon what they describe as “high-risk and outdated” energy projects that could derail the country’s Just Energy Transition (JET).

The Southern African Faith Communities’ Environment Institute (SAFCEI) has warned that expanding oil, gas, and nuclear investments risks locking the country into decades of inequality and fossil fuel dependence. The appeal comes amid mounting controversy over offshore exploration projects, Eskom’s proposal to extend the operating life of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station’s Unit 2, and indications that the government’s draft Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) could include additional nuclear capacity.

“South Africa stands at a crossroads,” said SAFCEI energy justice coordinator Ntombizodidi Mapapu. “Offshore oil and gas expansion and new nuclear investments are costly distractions from real solutions. Communities across the country are saying clearly: we cannot keep betting on energy options that harm our people, pollute our environment and delay a just transition.”

Communities Mobilise Through “No Faith in False Solutions” Campaign

Through its No Faith in False Solutions campaign, SAFCEI is training 45 faith and community leaders nationwide to strengthen grassroots advocacy, engage in public consultations, and push for cleaner, community-centred energy alternatives.

Among them is Hilary Swartz, a business and faith representative from Atlantis, who attended a recent National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) hearing on the proposed extension of Koeberg’s licence.

“As someone representing both business and faith-based groups in Atlantis, I’m deeply concerned about the safety and evacuation risks,” said Swartz. “Our community lives next to the plant — we’d be the first affected if anything went wrong. There’s no clear evacuation plan, and many people lack the resources to relocate in an emergency. That’s unacceptable.”

Swartz added that extending Koeberg’s lifespan could undermine local economic stability. “If an accident occurred, the consequences for our economy, environment and families would be catastrophic. Government should be investing in renewable energy that creates jobs and protects communities, not clinging to outdated technologies. Nuclear is a false solution — it doesn’t belong in South Africa’s just transition.”

Safety and Transparency Concerns Around Koeberg and Vaalputs

Nearby, faith leader Wiedaad Davids, chairperson of West Coast Faith Solutions in Saldanha Bay, echoed safety concerns.

“At almost 40 years old, is Koeberg really in a safe enough condition? The public deserves evidence that this plant meets all safety requirements before any extension is approved,” Davids said. “Decisions that could have far-reaching impacts for our communities are being made without considering the real dangers to ordinary South Africans.”

In the Northern Cape, Justin Montzinger from Port Nolloth raised alarm over the long-term management of nuclear waste at the Vaalputs storage site.

“Our communities have lived near Vaalputs for years, yet most of us have never been properly informed about the safety measures or long-term plans,” Montzinger said. “People deserve clear information about what makes radioactive waste dangerous and how it’s handled — especially if Koeberg’s operation is to be extended for another two decades.”

Offshore Oil and Gas Projects Also Under Fire

Along South Africa’s coastline, fisher and faith communities are raising similar concerns about offshore oil and gas exploration, which they say threatens marine life, fisheries, and livelihoods.

Deborah De Wee, a small-scale fisher and faith leader from Doringbaai, said the government’s push for fossil fuel expansion ignores the lived realities of coastal people.

“Offshore drilling and nuclear expansion harm our environment and our health. For coastal communities, climate change and pollution are already real,” she said. “Government must support clean energy that protects our oceans and sustains our way of life.”

Davids added that many coastal communities have been sidelined in consultation processes.

“No oil company can guarantee there won’t be spills or accidents, yet we’re expected to risk the ocean that feeds and sustains us,” she said. “Future generations have the right to inherit clean seas and safe livelihoods — not more pollution and inequality.”

Montzinger said the wave of proposed offshore projects along the coastline has left many feeling unheard — but that’s starting to change.

“It feels as though risky projects are being imposed on our communities with little consultation. But through SAFCEI’s campaign, people are learning their rights and refusing to be spectators in decisions that affect their lives,” he said. “A truly just transition must put people and safety first — not profits or politics.”

Santee Cooper’s governing board voted unanimously Friday to allow the power company’s management team to officially begin negotiating with Brookfield Asset Management on an agreement to restart construction of the failed expansion project at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.

Brookfield, which boasts a $1 trillion global investment portfolio, was among more than 70 companies to express interest after Santee Cooper put a call out nine months ago. It was a partner on one of 15 proposals Santee Cooper ultimately reviewed.

Negotiations will continue over the next six weeks, CEO Jimmy Staton said. Santee Cooper will name the other partners on the project at a later date.

Santee Cooper did not make public the potential terms of the deal, expected to be valued in the billions.

But Staton said Santee Cooper would use any cash proceeds it may earn from the agreement to pay down debts still owed on the abandoned nuclear facility. Customers could also benefit from the power the reactors would produce if finished.

“I feel pretty confident that our customers will realize some fairly significant value, both rates wise and otherwise, in this process,” Staton said.

Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.

Final executive punished for VC Summer failure to spend at least 10 months in prison

The utilities abandoned the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a single megawatt.

Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion, which customer continue to pay for on their monthly bills. Those payments could continue, in part or in full, through 2032, depending how much money Santee Cooper can secure for a buy down in any final deal with Brookfield.

If the two companies manage to ink a contract, Staton pledged that Santee Cooper customers will face no new costs associated with the project. All of that will be borne by Brookfield, as well as big tech companies, such as Google or Meta, that could buy the nuclear power a finished plant would generate.

“We’ve protected the rate payers of South Carolina, and quite frankly, I think we’ve shifted the paradigm of how nuclear energy gets built here in the United States,” Staton said.

After the firms mothballed the reactors eight years ago, SCE&G’s parent company, SCANA, collapsed. The reactors’ designer, Westinghouse, spiraled into bankruptcy.

Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy bought up SCANA.

Dominion is not part of the deal, so it won’t at all pay down debt saddled to its 800,000 South Carolina customers. They’ll continue to pay over the next 14 years for $2.3 billion worth of debt from the abandoned expansion.

Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

And it was Santee Cooper’s potential new partner, Brookfield, that took over Westinghouse in 2018.

To restart construction, Santee Cooper and Brookfield will need to find a construction firm. Westinghouse, which remains a part of Brookfield’s investment portfolio, won’t be the builder this time, Staton said.

It will take a year or more of due diligence, licensing and permitting before any construction on the inactive plants can restart, Staton added.

Among the funds Brookfield manages is a portfolio focused on clean energy and decarbonization. Earlier this month, the firm announced it had raised $20 billion for the effort.

The move to restart V.C. Summer follows calls by Gov. Henry McMaster earlier this year for a “nuclear power renaissance” in the state.

Sen. Graham on SC’s proposed nuclear reboot: ‘We’re going to finish these reactors’

And U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has vowed his support for the effort, which will ultimately have to make its way through the federal regulatory process.

Staton also pointed to a May executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which calls on the Department of Energy to prioritize approvals for 10 large-scale nuclear reactors under construction by 2030.

“South Carolina is going to have number one and number two in that process,” Staton said. “You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear in the United States.”

Still, nuclear power projects are expensive and take years to complete.

Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, operated by Southern Co. in Georgia, started construction around the same time as V.C. Summer. Work on the expansion wrapped up last year. Today the site is the nation’s largest nuclear plant, with four reactors.

But adding the two newest reactors cost more than $30 billion, more than twice the initial estimates.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2264-2048x1411.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 15:18:42.962521

A new climate report from Ember brings good news

State governments have broad discretion over their energy policy, while some are prioritizing emissions reduction, others remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels.

Currently, Kentucky does not stand out as a leader in the transition to clean energy.

Also: 2 Dividend Legends to Hold Forever

A new report from the climate think-tank Ember reveals that in the first half of 2025 the world’s wind and solar farms generated more electricity than coal plants for the first time. Solar output surged nearly 30% year-on-year and met 83% of global electricity demand growth. China and India led the transition, helping drive a drop in fossil-fuel use. Unfortunately, slower renewables growth and rising demand still pushed up coal and gas generation in the U.S. and Europe.

The United States is one of the heaviest polluters in the world, and electric power generation is one of America’s heaviest polluting sectors. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. emitted over 6.3 billion metric tons of harmful greenhouse gasses in 2022, more than every other country except China — and 25% of those emissions were created by electricity production.

With climate change emerging as a leading global threat, many countries are taking action to reduce emissions. In the United States, Biden had previously set a goal of achieving a 100% emissions-free power grid by 2035 — largely by cutting U.S. dependence on dirty power sources, like coal, and increasing our reliance on clean, renewable sources. (Here is a look at 11 American companies on the cutting edge of renewable technology.)

In the continuation of a longer-term trend, the amount of electricity produced in coal-fired power plants has fallen by over 57% in the United States over the last 10 years, from 1.6 billion megawatt-hours in 2014 to 675.1 million megawatt-hours in 2023. Over the same period, electricity production from wind and solar farms nearly tripled, from 199.3 million megawatt-hours to 586.7 megawatt-hours. The shift has had a meaningful impact, as emissions from electric power generation have fallen by nearly 24% in the U.S. since 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The federal government has a long way to go to achieve its ambitious energy goals, and doing so will require the cooperation of states. Every state has its own climate, geography, and natural resources — as well as broad authority over energy policy. Given these variables, some states are doing far more to reduce the climate impact of their power grid than others. (Here is a look at the states where carbon emissions are skyrocketing.)

Among the 50 states, Kentucky stands out for its continued dependence on coal. Nationwide, coal accounts for only about 16% of electricity production and over half of all harmful gas emissions from the electric power sector.

Kentucky is the fifth largest coal-producing state in the country, and partially as a result, the state is one of only a handful nationwide where coal-fired plants account for over half of all electricity production. About 69% of the 63.2 million megawatt-hours of energy produced in Kentucky in 2023 came from coal-fired plants. Additionally, nearly 86% of the state’s 47.2 million metric tons in harmful power grid emissions in 2022 were created by coal.

This is how Kentucky generates electricity — and how much pollution its power grid produces. Electricity output is measured in megawatt-hours and harmful gas emissions are measured in metric tons. For context, a single megawatt-hour is enough to power an average American home for just over a month, and a metric ton is equal to about 2,205 pounds. All data is from the EIA.

This post was updated on October 25, 2025 to include news of Embers’ recent climate report.

Why It Matters

Electricity production is one of the heaviest polluting sectors in the United States. As demand for electricity continues to rise, much of the country is transitioning away from fossil fuels and toward clean and renewable energy sources to meet the Biden Administration’s climate change mitigation goals. Like many other resource rich states, Kentucky continues to rely heavily on fossil-fuels — particularly coal.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright sent the proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that he hopes will accelerate the connection of data centers to the grid, according to a department press release.

Data centers use a large amount of power and in some cases, are expected to raise electricity prices.

Wright’s rule particularly seems to favor centers that come with their own “dispatchable” power sources — allowing such facilities to have their studies “expedited.”

It’s not entirely clear how dispatchable is defined, but it often refers to fossil fuel and nuclear plants that can be turned on and off at will. It may also refer to renewables if they come with batteries that can store the power they produce.

Under law, the secretary is able to send proposals to the independent commission, but it will ultimately be up to FERC whether to go through with it. Currently, the five-member panel has two Democrats and two Republicans. A third Republican was recently confirmed by the Senate but has not yet been sworn in.

“To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity,” Wright said in a letter to the commission. “To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner.

Original story

Marion County Circuit Court Judge Matthew S. Delligatti issued a temporary restraining order Friday against the sale of the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont to Marx Development Group. The order names Gov. Patrick Morrisey and Secretary Michael Caruso of the WV Department of Health Facilities, in their official capacities.

In August, Morrisey announced plans to sell Hopemont Hospital in Terra Alta, Jackie Withrow Hospital in Raleigh County, John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont and Lakin Hospital in Mason County by the end of September.

At the time of the announcement, Morrisey said the hospitals are licensed for 511 beds, although not all of them are currently in use.

“Marx Development Group, or MDG, has agreed to purchase these assets from the state of West Virginia for $60 billion,” Morrisey said. “And in addition, as part of the deal, MDG has also agreed that it would be investing in West Virginia to construct new facilities.”

Morrisey said the sale will help the state avoid an estimated $100 million in costs to renovate the buildings and that the four facilities have been operating at a $6 million annual loss.

As a private attorney, Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, filed a motion to stop the sale on behalf of his client Mary Devito, a resident of the facility. Garcia indicated he planned to file a suit at the end of August. Plaintiffs must give 30 days notice before suing the state.

Garcia indicated he would not be making statements because of the pending litigation but in August he told West Virginia Public Broadcasting “My client and other residents have many concerns but very little information other than a potential sales deadline of Sept. 30, 2025. The only way to protect the residents of John Manchin Sr. now is to fight this in court.”

A hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025, at 3:30 p.m. in the Circuit Court of Marion County.

Government incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act are still available to help cover the cost of a replacement, as outlined by the U.S. Department of Energy. However, many of these programs close at the end of 2025, so you need to act fast if you don't want to miss your chance.

If you are considering a stove upgrade, there's no better option than an induction cooktop.

Induction uses electricity to generate a magnetic field that heats up only the correct type of metal pans — not the stovetop itself or anything else you set on it that isn't made of magnetic metal. This helps minimize burns, in addition to avoiding the fumes from a gas stove. On top of all that, induction stoves heat up faster and boil water faster!

If you're interested in induction, you can get up to $840 off the cost of installing a new range. If it's still outside your price range or you want to try cooking with induction before you commit, you can get an affordable countertop burner, which start as low as $50.

If you do decide to install a full-sized induction stove, the Department of Energy has explained how to claim your rebate for the purchase.

First, check that the appliance you have selected qualifies for the program. If you make any upgrades to support the installation that are eligible for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, make sure the installation is completed before the applicable period ends. Then, when filing your taxes for this year, use IRS Form 5695 to claim your tax credit.

Assuming you followed the guidelines, that amount will be subtracted from your taxes, so you will either owe a smaller amount or receive a larger refund — and in the meantime, you can enjoy the lower bills every time you cook.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kitchen-5.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:08:21.476600

(AP) — Michigan is demanding millions of dollars in incentives back from a Chinese company after plans to build an electric vehicle battery plant collapsed following years of pushback against the project from neighbors and members of Congress.

Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer supported the $2.36 billion factory in 2022, and state lawmakers approved nearly $175 million in incentives for the project. The state is now holding Gotion Inc. in default of $23.6 million, accusing the company of abandoning the project.

“While this is not the outcome we hoped for, we recognize the tremendous responsibility we have to the people we serve to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely and appropriately,” Danielle Emerson, a spokesperson with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said in a statement.

Representatives for Gotion, which is headquartered in California, did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment.

In a letter dated Sept. 17, Michigan informed Gotion that it was in default of economic development grant obligations because no “eligible activities” had occurred on the site’s property in over 120 days.

According to the MEDC, the state is seeking to claw back $23.6 million that was disbursed toward the purchase of the site’s land near Big Rapids, about 200 miles northwest of Detroit. $26.4 million remaining from the grant that was not spent will be returned to the state, Emerson said. Citing a lack of progress on the project, a different $125 million grant was not distributed to Gotion.

The news was first reported by Crain’s Detroit Business.

The state also said two project-related lawsuits are imposing a “material adverse effect” on its progress, which counts as grounds for default. The letter said that if the defaults are not resolved in 30 days, the state expects repayment of $23.6 million. That deadline passed Oct. 17.

Residents of nearby Green Township so firmly opposed the project, some over environmental concerns, that voters in 2023 recalled five local elected officials who supported bringing the factory to the area.

Auto manufacturing is the lifeblood of Michigan’s economy, which has been hard hit by tariffs imposed this year on the industry and Canada. When the project was proposed, officials said the factory would produce cathodes and anodes, two components key to electric vehicle batteries, as well as over 2,000 jobs. The original economic development incentives came as officials sought to bolster manufacturing in the state.

Whitmer’s office did immediately respond to a request for comment.

Republican U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, who represents a swath of rural Michigan, had been the loudest and most prominent critic of the project, accusing Gotion of ties with forced labor and the Chinese Communist Party. Moolenaar chairs the House Select Committee on China and introduced a bill that stopped companies like Gotion from receiving electric vehicle tax credits from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Moolenaar’s bill was signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

“Now that its contract with the State of Michigan and MEDC is set to be terminated, the people of Green Charter Township can finally move on from Gotion’s lies and broken promises,” Moolenaar said in a press release.

Carter,,,,,https://currently.att.yahoo.com/att/michigan-embraces-gas-power-charging-122500377.html,"One way that states have decided to recoup the revenue lost by EV owners not paying gas taxes is by adding additional fees when EV owners register their cars.
That annual EV surcharge will soon skyrocket by another $100 each year, and make EV owners pay significantly more in taxes than gas car owners pay in gas taxes over the course of a year.
This will make Michigan tie with New Jersey as the states with the highest EV taxes in the United States.
Given that there were 30,206 F-150s sold in Michigan in 2024, that equates to a loss in annual gas tax revenue of over $1.35 million.
What do you think, is it fair to charge EV owners significantly more money than owners of gas-powered cars?","The automotive industry has relied on fossil fuels for over a century, and the roads those cars travel on have relied heavily on taxes that drivers pay on each gallon of gas purchased at the pump. As the effects of human-caused climate change continue to worsen and more drivers choose to drive less environmentally damaging electric vehicles, governments have had to reconsider how to go about collecting those infrastructure-funding taxes. One way that states have decided to recoup the revenue lost by EV owners not paying gas taxes is by adding additional fees when EV owners register their cars.

EV-owning Michiganders already pay an annual EV surcharge of $160 on top of their annual registration fees, and owners of EVs and hybrids that weigh over 8,000 pounds pay an additional $100 on top of that before even accounting for the standard registration cost. That annual EV surcharge will soon skyrocket by another $100 each year, and make EV owners pay significantly more in taxes than gas car owners pay in gas taxes over the course of a year. This will make Michigan tie with New Jersey as the states with the highest EV taxes in the United States.

EV owners could soon pay an additional $1.88 for every cent the gas tax increases

The proposed bill that would further increase the fees that EV owners pay is Senate Bill 593, and according to M Live News, ""a plug-in hybrid vehicle's annual fee would increase 94 cents for every cent the fuel tax increased above 19 cents per gallon. For EV, the increase would be $1.88 per 1 cent of fuel tax."" That's right, even plug-in hybrid owners are paying more in taxes than folks who drive gas-powered cars.

Critics say that raising fees for PHEV and EV registrations discourages EV adoption, and signals to the automakers that are based in the state that Michigan is not serious about electrification efforts. As a reminder, Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis are primarily based in Michigan.

According to ecocenter.org, EV drivers pay an average of $47 more in road funding taxes every year when compared to their most similar gas-powered counterparts. For example, the driver of a Chevrolet Equinox EV pays $40 more per year than the driver of a gas Chevrolet Equinox, and the driver of a Chevrolet Blazer EV pays $47 more per year than the driver of a gas Chevrolet Blazer. The gap widens with vehicles over the 8,000 pound mark; the driver of a Chevrolet Silverado EV pays $218 more toward road maintenance each year than the driver of a gas Silverado.

EVs are usually heavier than gas models

Since gas powered cars have become more efficient and use less fuel, the revenue from gasoline taxes has dropped significantly. For example, the owner of a 2024 Ford F-150 pays $45.15 less in gas taxes than the owner of a 2010 F-150. Given that there were 30,206 F-150s sold in Michigan in 2024, that equates to a loss in annual gas tax revenue of over $1.35 million. One of the biggest arguments against the increases in EV registration costs is that EV owners are paying significantly more in annual road taxes than gas car owners pay in gasoline tax over that same time span.

EVs tend to be heavier than their gas counterparts, which naturally puts more strain on the infrastructure that they use, but the gas tax doesn't reward owners of lighter ICE vehicles with lower rates than owners of full-sized SUVs. Yes, the Chevrolet Equinox EV weighs about 1,500 pounds more than a gas-powered Equinox, but a Miata weighs over 3,000-pounds less than a Chevrolet Suburban and yet they pay the same proportion in gas tax. What do you think, is it fair to charge EV owners significantly more money than owners of gas-powered cars?

Tens of thousands of good jobs in clean power are already here in Scotland and thousands more are coming.
And the same is true when it comes to nuclear energy.
Hunterston, just down the coast from us, produced power from nuclear generation for decades, but with the ban on nuclear there’s no chance of future investment there.","This was largely driven by China building more solar and wind power than the rest of the world combined.

Our future lies in renewable energy, backed up by new nuclear. It’s important for our energy security and for lowering energy bills, but it’s also important for the next generation of jobs in our country, and Scotland has the chance to lead the way.

That’s why, this week, the UK Labour Government announced its plans to create 40,000 new jobs in the clean energy sector in Scotland by 2030, and 400,000 across the UK.

We’re proud of the history of industry in our area but in recent years, young people have had to look further afield than home to find new and good jobs. I hope that these jobs can help to change that.

This is why I felt it was so important to bring employers from the renewables sector together with our education providers last month at my ‘Developing our Future Workforce’ event.

A generation of young people in Scotland – and here in Inverclyde and Renfrewshire West – will benefit from these jobs under this government, and we need to know what lies in the future of employment in our area in order to predict the educational and training needs.

One of the big complaints I hear from parents is that “there’s no such thing as a job for life”, but when it comes to Scotland’s renewable energy boom that couldn’t be further from the truth.

Jobs like cable engineers, welders and construction workers are needed to build the electricity grid that is going to power our country for years to come. But at the moment we aren’t training enough people in Scotland to do these jobs, meaning that companies have to recruit from overseas.

It doesn’t have to be like this. Tens of thousands of good jobs in clean power are already here in Scotland and thousands more are coming.

I want to see a future where young people can choose to stay here – to choose to study, to live and to work here in Inverclyde, and not be left without a choice but to move. And that’s what this Government wants too.

Sadly, I don’t know if the same can be said of the SNP Scottish Government. They have hollowed out our vital college sector, taking away routes for people to access work and retrain if needed. And just when we need the support to make sure people can take advantage of these new jobs in the renewables sector, our colleges aren’t there to provide the opportunities.

And the same is true when it comes to nuclear energy. With their ban on nuclear power stations in Scotland, the Scottish Government aren’t just turning their back on a safe, clean and reliable source of energy, they’re also rejecting highly skilled jobs and investment in our communities.

Hunterston, just down the coast from us, produced power from nuclear generation for decades, but with the ban on nuclear there’s no chance of future investment there.

A Labour Government would change that and this week, Ed Miliband committed to support nuclear power development in Scotland if Labour wins the Scottish Parliament election next year.

Today, I’m holding my regular monthly coffee morning in Wemyss Bay Community Centre from 10.30am-1.30pm, and I look forward to catching up with constituents over a cup of tea and a biscuit.

This has been a turbulent year for North Carolina’s solar industry:

The Trump administration nixed the 25d Residential Clean Energy Credit, which would have expired in 2032. Now, it expires at the end of the year.

New FEOC requirements, or Foreign Entity of Concern, are leaving solar installers struggling to determine which solar panels still qualify for the Clean Energy Investment and Production tax credits.

The EPA also cut funding for EnergizeNC, which would have lowered energy bills for thousands of low-income residents, according to North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson.

Clean energy tax credits have saved people money on home solar installations for more than 20 years. However, it might already be too late for homeowners to save on new solar. Bryce Bruncati, with 8MSolar in Raleigh, said it’s been a busy few months, meeting a surge of demand that followed the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

“When the Big Beautiful Bill passed, and they ended 25d, we signed up like 200 people in a couple weeks,” Bruncati said. “So, all solar installers in North Carolina right now are booked through the year.”

It was the same story with other solar installers I spoke with in the Carolinas. One reported that it has some spots available for upgrades and small projects, but the queue is otherwise full.

The story of solar so far

Home solar systems have steadily grown in popularity in North Carolina since the mid-2000s. In recent years, they’ve added significant capacity to the grid, approaching the size of a small power plant. That role has only expanded as new battery storage systems and power management agreements allow utilities such as Duke Energy to draw power from homes, reducing energy demand on the system during peak hours.

However, the solar ship had already encountered some headwinds before President Trump returned to office. In 2023, new solar installations declined for the first time in six years, falling by over 15% from the year prior. They dropped again in 2024 — this time by nearly 44%.

Creating energy islands after the flood

Even if 2024 was a low-performing year overall for solar, Asheville-based Rhino Renewables got an unexpected boost after Hurricane Helene.

“Since the storm, we’ve been very busy. A lot of people realize the need for solar,” said Glynnis Hollifield, office manager at Rhino Renewables. “Even people with existing systems wanted to add a battery, just because they were like, ‘I should have had one for the storm.’”

Rooftop or standalone solar panels that are connected to the grid won’t work during a blackout without battery storage. The utility requires panels to switch off when the grid goes down to prevent energy from backfeeding while lineworkers restore power. An at-home battery enables homes to function like an energy island, powering them without risking the electrocution of lineworkers. In this way, they can replace their noisier, more polluting counterpart — the diesel generator.

“People were realizing that to have power when nobody else does, or when the grid goes down, is just so important,” Hollifield said.

Immediately after Helene, organizations such as The Footprint Project deployed battery and solar systems in western North Carolina to power Starlinks, phone chargers and more. Buncombe County installed its first two battery storage systems earlier this year at the county’s Public Safety Training Center and the Health and Human Services building.

“We didn't initially design these battery systems to be like resilience projects in the traditional sense,” said Jeremiah Leroy, deputy recovery officer for Buncombe County, in an interview this past spring. “They were really more designed to be like cost savings projects, to shed peak load and reduce demand charges.”

Leroy said that changed with Helene, and the county shifted to asking questions about emergency preparedness. Suddenly, these battery systems meant more than the sum of their cost savings.

“Resilience is our big focus, and probably will be for the foreseeable future,” He said.

Rhino Renewables had also been part of EnergizeNC, a federally funded program that would have expanded community and residential solar installations in low-income and disadvantaged communities to lower electricity bills. The $156 million program was scheduled to launch later this year, but the Trump Administration canceled funding for the project. North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson has since joined several other states in a lawsuit against the EPA over the Solar for All funds.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” said Attorney General Jeff Jackson in a written statement. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

Looking ahead

For companies that have diversified their services, such as South Carolina’s Southern Energy Management, other home electrification programs, such as Duke and Dominion’s HERO rebate program or Energy Saver NC, have been a boon. Graham Alexander, co-owner of Southern Energy Management, said his industry will weather the new changes, tax credit or no.

“We’d rather see the energy industry in North America on a level playing field,” Alexander said. “Take the subsidies away from the natural gas and the coal and everything else, and let’s see where the field balances out to.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill expanded federal subsidies for oil extraction and reduced the royalties that fossil fuel companies pay for federal leases.

8MSolar’s Bruncati was similarly optimistic about the future of his industry.

“Even without the tax credit, I'm selling systems that have about a 10-year breakeven,” Bruncati said, referring to the amount of time it takes for new panels to pay for themselves.

Bruncati said that math gets more favorable as electrical rates increase. Duke Energy’s proposed 2025 resource plan forecasted that rates will rise an average 2.1% annually over the next decade. Similarly, at-home battery storage has begun to compete more with gas generators as unit prices decrease.

The federal policy shift may favor other business models. In California, where electricity rates are higher, solar leasing has overtaken outright ownership in the past.

When a homeowner signs a solar lease, they don’t own the panels or battery system, but they do benefit from the savings. The leasing company claims the commercial tax credit and charges the homeowner monthly for the panels. These agreements typically last 10-20 years.

“It's a little more tricky. You have to have a really good site. You have to be okay with having someone else owning the equipment we roof,” Bruncati said.

A 2017 law legalized solar leasing in North Carolina and put a cap on leased solar relative to the utility’s total peak demand. Solar leases tend to decline in popularity when panel prices decrease or financial incentives lower the barriers to ownership. It’s possible that solar installers might pivot to so-called third-party ownership models after 25D expires.

In the Carolinas, there are still other incentive programs to offset the upfront cost of solar and battery systems. South Carolina offers a state tax credit for 25% the cost of a new solar system, including installation. In Mecklenburg County, the Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg campaign is a group-purchase program that has lowered the price of a solar system to below $2.00 per watt.

Duke Energy’s PowerPair program offers up to $9,000 back to homeowners who install both solar and battery systems on their homes.

“We have 100 projects booked for [quarter one] of next year where those homeowners are not getting the 30% tax credit, but they're still getting that PowerPair incentive,” Bruncati said.

But the program's future is uncertain. This three-year pilot is already nearing capacity after just over a year. Duke Energy Progress has started a waitlist.

Duke Energy will need to request permission from state regulators to extend the pilot program. The company provided the following written statement:

“Currently, there is no plan for expansion of upfront solar + battery incentives programming. However, Duke Energy continues to offer demand side programs that provide eligible customers with opportunities to earn incentives.”

In fact, the park’s onsite solar array produces nearly as much electricity as the entire park utilizes on an annual basis, including electricity for their buildings and electric vehicle charging stations found in the park’s marina.

To help raise awareness about this impressive achievement, PennEnvironment’s Clean Energy Associate Carolena Bellini hosted a solar tour at Prince Gallitzin State Park’s solar array alongside DCNR Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn, and DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. Local elected officials from Cambria County gathered with local residents and partner non-profit groups to celebrate one of DCNR’s many solar projects in Pennsylvania’s state parks!

“This solar array isn’t just a model for how public lands across PA and the nation can go solar,” said PennEnvironment’s Clean Energy Associate Carolena Bellini. “It is also a reminder that with creativity and drive, we can jumpstart local homegrown renewable solar projects on schools, churches, warehouses, homes, or other ingenious sites.”

Numerous local news outlets covered the solar tour, including articles in the Altoona Mirror, the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat, and the Mainline Newspaper, as well as TV news coverage on local WJAC and WTAJ. By garnering media attention to the Prince Gallitzin solar array, we’re able to increase our reach to every-day Pennsylvanians and educate them about the benefits and opportunities for going solar.

Not only is the solar array at Prince Gallitzin the largest solar array in Pennsylvania’s state park system, it provides a variety of benefits for the state park and taxpayers’ pocketbooks.

Prince Gallitzin Park Manager Jessica Lavelua explained how the solar array provides over $90,000 in energy bill savings to the park each year, and how park officials are able to use those newly-saved monies and invest it back into park improvements like new grills and campsites, a new roof at the ranger station, and much more. The array also helps Pennsylvania’s park system lower its global warming pollution by an estimated 700 tons each year.

At the event, DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley emphasized PA’s progress towards increasing renewable energy. “In May, the Commonwealth reached the momentous milestone of 2 gigawatts of installed solar energy…. enough capacity to power around 377,000 homes,” she noted.

DCNR Secretary Dunn highlighted how “projects like the Prince Gallitzin solar array demonstrate how we can save taxpayer dollars, support local clean energy jobs, and protect our natural resources for future generations. By incorporating solar and other energy innovations across state parks and forests, we’re building a cleaner, stronger, and more resilient Pennsylvania.”

Alongside the Secretaries and PennEnvironment, attendees heard from Park Manager Jessica Lavelua and Steven Spotts with Gridsmart who installed the solar array. Attendees also heard from both Democratic and Republican local elected officials–Cambria County Commissioners Tom Chernisky and Keith Rager–showing the bipartisan support that exists for this project.

A bus full of students from Cambria Heights High School were also in the audience at this event. Having young folks present to learn about sustainability practices showcased one of the goals of the event: to bring together a group of people varying in age, political background, careers, amongst other things, all here to celebrate clean energy.

“The sky is our future,” said Cambria County Commissioner Keith Rager. “If it means reducing taxpayer money, and it means less taxes on me and these young folk [coming from Cambria Heights High School], that’s what I want to do.”

Cambria County Commissioner Tom Chernisky emphasizes how “this project will continue to help Prince Gallitzin State Park make Cambria County a great place to live, work, invest, volunteer, and play.”

Superintendent Ken Kerchenske of the Cambria Heights School District stated that “Cambria Heights School District is venturing into the solar business in the coming months, both through a Power Purchase Agreement on our secondary campus and the direct purchase of a rooftop solar array at Cambria Heights Elementary School, made possible, in part, by a Solar for Schools grant the district received earlier this year. Monday’s event showed that solar is an excellent, fiscally-responsible option for public entities in Cambria County.”

This event was a great opportunity for people to come together and learn more about the environmental and economic benefits of the Prince Gallitzin State Park solar array. It also was a way to highlight DCNR’s leadership and discuss how Pennsylvania can continue to move forward towards a renewable energy future.

The 2025 Oregon Legislative Session ran from January 21 to June 27 and was marked by fiscal uncertainty and systematic challenges as the Capitol community grappled with how to process a record 3,466 bills introduced. Within this context, the session did not feature any of the signature climate or environmental packages that have been a hallmark of Oregon policymaking in recent biennia. Instead, legislators grappled extensively with how to address imminent major challenges in a constrained budget environment, namely issues relating to wildfire and water. The legislature also authorized significant fee increases across many environmental and natural resource agency programs.

As the Legislative Liaison to the Oregon State Bar Environment and Natural Resources Section Executive Committee, I had the honor this summer of providing a legislative update in the Section’s E-Outlook newsletter, published this August, and will be expanding on that report during the ENR Section’s upcoming annual Year-in-Review CLE on October 16, 2025. A few of the most salient session highlights relevant to environment and natural resources policy are outlined below.

General Environmental Protection & Climate

While 2025 lacked signature climate legislation, conceptual groundwork was laid with SJR 28, a proposed constitutional amendment asserting a “fundamental right to a clean, safe and healthy environment.” SJR 28 failed, but a similar measure—Initiative Petition 45—was submitted by petitioners to be included on the 2026 ballot. Chief petitioner recently withdrew the petition for IP 45, but this conversation is likely to continue in future sessions.

Other notable failed bills that may resurface in future sessions included:

SB 680: Greenwashing liability

SB 681: Moratorium on fossil fuel investments by State Treasury

SB 682 and SB 1187: Separate formulations of Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program

Separately, efforts to repeal and replace Oregon’s Climate Protection Program (CPP) with a Cap & Invest model gained traction, as evidenced by HCR 42, a resolution introduced during the last week of session declaring the legislature’s intent to reduce proposed transportation taxes if the Legislative Assembly enacts a cap-and-invest program.

Other environmental protection discussions focused on PFAS, a topic that continues to garner attention nationally and in Oregon. Enrolled SB 91, which becomes effective January 1, 2026, prohibits use of “PFAS firefighting foam” with exceptions, and enrolled HB 2947 requires a study on PFAS in biosolids applied to land, with the final report due September 1, 2028. A bill proposing to prohibit the distribution or sale of certain products that contain intentionally added PFAS, HB 3512, received a public hearing but otherwise did not move forward.

Water

Legislators considered a broad slate of water bills this session, with 26 bills ultimately receiving hearings that addressed water quantity policy, and another 12 addressing water quality. Discussions on water policy during 2025 were a significant, bipartisan priority, with several successful water-related bills of note passing. The most important of those include:

HB 3372: Expands exempt well use on small farms

HB 3544: Establishes uniform processes for water-related contested case proceedings

HB 3342: Modifies laws related to regulation and administration of water rights

SB 1154: Groundwater Quality Protection Act update

HB 3525: Drinking water well testing by landlords for rented dwelling units

Wildfire

Wildfire was a topic of considerable discussion this legislative session. Regarding wildfire funding, legislators considered various proposals but ultimately adopted HB 3940, establishing a new “Zyn tax” on nicotine pouches and directing those funds toward wildfire prevention; redirecting a portion of interest earned on the rainy-day fund to purposes related to wildfire; restructuring how landowners pay for fire protection; and creating a grant program for retrofitting dwellings for wildfire resilience. The legislature also appropriated funds to ODF for ongoing wildfire costs through the end-of-session budget package, HB 5006. This funding, while helpful, totaled well short of legislator’s goals and is largely considered just a first step in addressing mounting wildfire costs. It is all but guaranteed that wildfire funding will continue to be a significant conversation in future sessions.

The DOE issued on Oct. 10 a circular that provides the guidelines for the generation, management and monitoring of carbon credits, which would allow an organization or even a country to produce a certain amount of carbon emissions.

According to the Peoples Rising for Climate Justice-Philippines (PRCJ-PH), the new order from the DOE was “illegitimate and anti-people,” as this also opens doors to foreign and even local corporations to purchase “cheap offsets” instead of reducing their own emissions.

“It allows polluters to greenwash business-as-usual operations while other Filipino people bear the brunt of environmental destruction and climate disasters,” the group said in a statement.

The new policy also threatens the country’s sovereignty over natural resources, as well as undermines grassroots, non-market solutions led by indigenous peoples, farmers and fisherfolk, being the “real stewards of our environment”.”

By issuing the order, the PRCJ also criticized the DOE for going “beyond its mandate” in coming up with such a policy.

The DOE has said that the new circular was in line with the international treaty Paris Agreement. The agency also stressed that it was eyeing to collaborate with Japan, Singapore and some European countries for bilateral or multilateral trade agreements for carbon credits.

However, the group said the DOE cannot use the Paris agreement as a “blanket justification for such overreach, as they are not self-executory without enabling legislation.”

“Worse, this regulation was railroaded at the department level with little-to-no participation from frontline communities, civil society groups or independent environmental experts,” the PRCJ said. “It sidelines the Climate Change Commission, the body legally mandated to coordinate national climate policy and centralizes authority in energy bureaucrats who have long been beholden to corporate interests.”

The “deeper danger” of the DOE circular also includes the “eligible mitigation activities” for the carbon emissions, such as in mega-dams, large-scale solar and wind farms, waste-to-energy incinerators and nuclear energy.

“Now, under the guise of ‘carbon credits,’ these destructive undertakings will profit twice: from environmental exploitation and from selling off supposed ‘emission savings’ to wealthy polluters abroad,” the group said.

This has been a turbulent year for North Carolina’s solar industry:

The Trump administration nixed the 25d Residential Clean Energy Credit, which would have expired in 2032. Now, it expires at the end of the year.

New FEOC requirements, or Foreign Entity of Concern, are leaving solar installers struggling to determine which solar panels still qualify for the Clean Energy Investment and Production tax credits.

The EPA also cut funding for EnergizeNC, which would have lowered energy bills for thousands of low-income residents, according to North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson.

Clean energy tax credits have saved people money on home solar installations for more than 20 years. However, it might already be too late for homeowners to save on new solar. Bryce Bruncati, with 8MSolar in Raleigh, said it’s been a busy few months, meeting a surge of demand that followed the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

“When the Big Beautiful Bill passed, and they ended 25d, we signed up like 200 people in a couple weeks,” Bruncati said. “So, all solar installers in North Carolina right now are booked through the year.”

It was the same story with other solar installers I spoke with in the Carolinas. One reported that it has some spots available for upgrades and small projects, but the queue is otherwise full.

The story of solar so far

Home solar systems have steadily grown in popularity in North Carolina since the mid-2000s. In recent years, they’ve added significant capacity to the grid, approaching the size of a small power plant. That role has only expanded as new battery storage systems and power management agreements allow utilities such as Duke Energy to draw power from homes, reducing energy demand on the system during peak hours.

However, the solar ship had already encountered some headwinds before President Trump returned to office. In 2023, new solar installations declined for the first time in six years, falling by over 15% from the year prior. They dropped again in 2024 — this time by nearly 44%.

Creating energy islands after the flood

Even if 2024 was a low-performing year overall for solar, Asheville-based Rhino Renewables got an unexpected boost after Hurricane Helene.

“Since the storm, we’ve been very busy. A lot of people realize the need for solar,” said Glynnis Hollifield, office manager at Rhino Renewables. “Even people with existing systems wanted to add a battery, just because they were like, ‘I should have had one for the storm.’”

Rooftop or standalone solar panels that are connected to the grid won’t work during a blackout without battery storage. The utility requires panels to switch off when the grid goes down to prevent energy from backfeeding while lineworkers restore power. An at-home battery enables homes to function like an energy island, powering them without risking the electrocution of lineworkers. In this way, they can replace their noisier, more polluting counterpart — the diesel generator.

“People were realizing that to have power when nobody else does, or when the grid goes down, is just so important,” Hollifield said.

Immediately after Helene, organizations such as The Footprint Project deployed battery and solar systems in western North Carolina to power Starlinks, phone chargers and more. Buncombe County installed its first two battery storage systems earlier this year at the county’s Public Safety Training Center and the Health and Human Services building.

“We didn't initially design these battery systems to be like resilience projects in the traditional sense,” said Jeremiah Leroy, deputy recovery officer for Buncombe County, in an interview this past spring. “They were really more designed to be like cost savings projects, to shed peak load and reduce demand charges.”

Leroy said that changed with Helene, and the county shifted to asking questions about emergency preparedness. Suddenly, these battery systems meant more than the sum of their cost savings.

“Resilience is our big focus, and probably will be for the foreseeable future,” He said.

Rhino Renewables had also been part of EnergizeNC, a federally funded program that would have expanded community and residential solar installations in low-income and disadvantaged communities to lower electricity bills. The $156 million program was scheduled to launch later this year, but the Trump Administration canceled funding for the project. North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson has since joined several other states in a lawsuit against the EPA over the Solar for All funds.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” said Attorney General Jeff Jackson in a written statement. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

Looking ahead

For companies that have diversified their services, such as South Carolina’s Southern Energy Management, other home electrification programs, such as Duke and Dominion’s HERO rebate program or Energy Saver NC, have been a boon. Graham Alexander, co-owner of Southern Energy Management, said his industry will weather the new changes, tax credit or no.

“We’d rather see the energy industry in North America on a level playing field,” Alexander said. “Take the subsidies away from the natural gas and the coal and everything else, and let’s see where the field balances out to.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill expanded federal subsidies for oil extraction and reduced the royalties that fossil fuel companies pay for federal leases.

8MSolar’s Bruncati was similarly optimistic about the future of his industry.

“Even without the tax credit, I'm selling systems that have about a 10-year breakeven,” Bruncati said, referring to the amount of time it takes for new panels to pay for themselves.

Bruncati said that math gets more favorable as electrical rates increase. Duke Energy’s proposed 2025 resource plan forecasted that rates will rise an average 2.1% annually over the next decade. Similarly, at-home battery storage has begun to compete more with gas generators as unit prices decrease.

The federal policy shift may favor other business models. In California, where electricity rates are higher, solar leasing has overtaken outright ownership in the past.

When a homeowner signs a solar lease, they don’t own the panels or battery system, but they do benefit from the savings. The leasing company claims the commercial tax credit and charges the homeowner monthly for the panels. These agreements typically last 10-20 years.

“It's a little more tricky. You have to have a really good site. You have to be okay with having someone else owning the equipment we roof,” Bruncati said.

A 2017 law legalized solar leasing in North Carolina and put a cap on leased solar relative to the utility’s total peak demand. Solar leases tend to decline in popularity when panel prices decrease or financial incentives lower the barriers to ownership. It’s possible that solar installers might pivot to so-called third-party ownership models after 25D expires.

In the Carolinas, there are still other incentive programs to offset the upfront cost of solar and battery systems. South Carolina offers a state tax credit for 25% the cost of a new solar system, including installation. In Mecklenburg County, the Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg campaign is a group-purchase program that has lowered the price of a solar system to below $2.00 per watt.

Duke Energy’s PowerPair program offers up to $9,000 back to homeowners who install both solar and battery systems on their homes.

“We have 100 projects booked for [quarter one] of next year where those homeowners are not getting the 30% tax credit, but they're still getting that PowerPair incentive,” Bruncati said.

But the program's future is uncertain. This three-year pilot is already nearing capacity after just over a year. Duke Energy Progress has started a waitlist.

Duke Energy will need to request permission from state regulators to extend the pilot program. The company provided the following written statement:

“Currently, there is no plan for expansion of upfront solar + battery incentives programming. However, Duke Energy continues to offer demand side programs that provide eligible customers with opportunities to earn incentives.”

A judge blocked Trump’s cuts in March, according to the lawsuit, and Hill thought her organization’s funding was safe.
“The grant was released in February, (and we added) on three additional communities,” Hill said.
“The loss of this funding will immediately curtail 4CORE’s planned programs for mobility planning in four communities, and commercial and residential energy efficiency outreach,” the release said.
To Hill, the move to cut the funding is strictly based on ideology, she said.","Half-million dollar cut resulted in job loss

The U.S. Department of Energy announced on Oct. 2 that it would be slashing more than $7.5 billion in funding approved through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Acts.

According to a release from the department, the funds, which were allocated for 223 energy projects nationwide, were found to be wasteful.

“DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the release read.

Some of the Congressionally-approved funds were to be sent to Durango-based nonprofit Four Corners Office for Resource Efficiency, according to a release from the organization.

4CORE Executive Director Jenny Hill said the cuts came after a coalition of state attorneys general, including Colorado AG Phil Weiser, sued the Trump administration, which tried to cut the funds through an executive order early on in 2025. A judge blocked Trump’s cuts in March, according to the lawsuit, and Hill thought her organization’s funding was safe.

“This one was completely out of the blue,” she said. “So we had been working under the assumption since February that these were obligated funds that we were already spending, and that they wouldn't ever be under threat of being cut again. So when this did happen, it was a big shock to us.”

The guiding ethic of 4CORE was to help communities across Southwest Colorado where 65% of households are at or below the federal poverty level – including Ignacio, Cortez, Pagosa Springs and Saguache. The nonprofit lost $531,240 due to the cuts, and as a result had to lay off two employees, reduce hours for two others and roll back operations, the release said. Hill said she had to cut her own time back to 20 hours a week.

“The grant was released in February, (and we added) on three additional communities,” Hill said. “We’re right in the middle of the work. For Pagosa Springs, we’re about 75% done with the transportation planning work. For Saguache we are roughly 50% done. So it really did impact and hurt those two communities when we received the stop work order.”

According to the nonprofit’s website, 4CORE helped provide funding, guidance and community organization for clean energy initiatives, such as solar installation projects and an e-bike lending program for low-income and car-less residents. On Friday, for example, Hill was in Towaoc working to get kids from the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe on e-bikes to help address their transportation needs.

Additionally, the organization sought to help communities become more climate resilient through groundwater conservation projects and sustainable economic practices.

What’s more, Hill said, is that community surveys about 4CORE’s work in both Saguache and Pagosa Springs was positive, regardless of political affiliation.

“The loss of this funding will immediately curtail 4CORE’s planned programs for mobility planning in four communities, and commercial and residential energy efficiency outreach,” the release said.

The reduction in the nonprofit’s staffing has already halted the organizations efforts to gather information and to help communities identify transportation needs, plan for affordable transportation, enable homeowners to make their houses more energy efficient and provide education about sustainable business practices to boost economic resiliency.

To Hill, the move to cut the funding is strictly based on ideology, she said. 4CORE’s work was non-partisan and helped communities save money, increase efficiency and become more environmentally friendly.

“It feels strictly political,” Hill said. “That’s why in 2020 through 2024, we were receiving more grant funds and getting more awards, and kind of wrapping up the services we offered. And then this whole year has been a roller coaster of determining the strategy moving forward.”
